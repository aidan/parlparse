<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 72, line 10, after "546(4))", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in cases where a holder acquired a personal portfolio bond with the sole or main object of avoiding tax".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My observations on the clause will not stray outside the terms of the amendment because they are on the theme of legitimate and illegitimate measures to counter tax avoidance. The Treasury and, I regret to say, the Inland Revenue have been shown in a most unfavourable light. They have gone a long way beyond the legitimate and understandable actions provided by successive Finance Bills to counter tax avoidance where the wishes of Parliament are clearly being circumvented and the loss of revenue is on an unacceptable scale.
<P>
The measures before us to counter tax avoidance are disproportionate to the problem identified or described to the Committee, unless the Paymaster General can give us better particulars. What has especially annoyed ordinary taxpayers who hold personal portfolio bonds is the terms of the Inland Revenue tax notice which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This type of bond is designed primarily for tax avoidance purposes".</UL></FONT>
<P>
The bonds in question are a particular type of product. They are marketed to those people living and working overseas who wish to build a significant fund for their retirement in lieu of the normal pension arrangements that might have been open to them had they been UK residents throughout their working lives. Under the present tax statutes, they cannot avail themselves of the normal tax-exempt pension plans and savings products available to those who work in this country. They find that particularly galling.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It seems to those people that the Government have a deep suspicion of anyone who is, or who has been, an expatriate. That became apparent during our debate on the foreign earnings deduction clause earlier this week, when the Government made clear their view that most expatriates work abroad primarily to avoid paying tax. However, in the experience of Opposition Members, such people work overseas not only in the legitimate pursuit of a career objective but often to advance this country's interests.
<P>
On publication the clause achieved a certain notoriety in the press. Since then I have received a number of letters from people who took out personal portfolio bonds not to avoid tax, but in good faith as a normal savings plan that they assumed to be in line with the Government's wishes. The Government frequently speak of the need to build up personal savings as a long-term insurance against state dependency. Such people are therefore acting responsibly and, moreover, entirely legally.
<P>
However, the Inland Revenue fought a long campaign against personal portfolio bonds, which it finally lost in the House of Lords. The route to the House of Lords was peppered with a number of unpleasant observations by officers of the Revenue, which suggested that anyone who persisted in buying and holding such bonds would be taken to endless appeals. It is not surprising that many taxpayers of modest means capitulate when they are thus confronted by the Revenue.
<P>
The special investigation section of the Revenue said that anyone who successfully appealed to the special commissioners would in turn be appealed to the High Court and eventually to the House of Lords. That did in fact happen, but the Revenue comprehensively lost. That outcome owes much to the courage and perseverance of Professor Willoughby, a man of unimpeachable integrity who was not to be browbeaten. On receiving his OBE from Christopher Patten in Hong Kong, the citation made reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the immense contribution you have made in the fields of taxation and the law."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Here is a man who, in addition to working legally overseas, contributed to the field of public policy and taxation. That may be why he was able to take on the Revenue and win comprehensively. In delivering the Law Lords' judgment, Lord Nolan described the fallacy that was at the heart of the commissioners' case. This was not a mere technicality. The judgment, which is extremely long and which I have no intention of quoting from at length, outlines the Inland Revenue case and subsequently demolishes it comprehensively. Lord Nolan describes what he calls the attack that the Revenue launched on Professor and Mrs. Willoughby and other Royal Life bond holders. Lord Nolan observed:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am unable to follow the reasoning of the commissioners."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He concludes that Parliament's intentions were not circumvented by Professor Willoughby or the other bond holders. But the Inland Revenue now asserts that it lost only on a narrow point, which is a grotesque description of what Lord Nolan and other Law Lords said.
<P>
Despite losing a case in the highest court in the land, this clause is being introduced to overturn that judgment and to continue what can only be called the persecution of many hundreds I do not know the exact number of people who took out such bonds in good faith.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Will my hon. Friend concede that the most serious aspect of the clause is that although the Bill sets the framework, the[Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown]
mechanics are governed by secondary legislation? If the Revenue subsequently loses a court case in the House of Lords, it need only return with a different piece of secondary legislation to overturn that judgment, which poses an extreme danger to the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. It is outrageous that, having lost in the House of Lords, the Revenue should get Parliament to change the law to give effect to what it would have liked to have been the case. That will not be achieved by primary legislation but by regulation, which may never be debated or scrutinised by the House. The Paymaster General must explain that.
<P>
I am afraid that we are becoming used to the growing abuse whereby important taxation matters are not debated, do not appear in the Bill and are related to regulation. But in this case it is an extreme abuse.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is going rather wide, as he indicated that he might, of the amendment. It will be my intention to allow a fairly wide debate on the amendments, with a view to dispensing with a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Butterfill. That would be a suitable arrangement. But I believe that my remarks apply fairly specifically to amendment No. 171, which would confine the clause to those arrangements and bonds that have the sole or main object of avoiding tax. Opposition Members recognise that such bonds can be used as part of tax avoidance schemes, which are beyond Parliament's original intentions. If the Government had introduced a targeted measure to address identified abuses, they would have had our support. But they are continuing a campaign against people whom the House of Lords have ruled not to be avoiding tax but to have taken out bonds in good faith, as part of a legitimate savings plan. We regard that as oppressive.
<P>
You have just indicated, Mr. Butterfill, that there will be debates on other amendments, and I have no wish to stray any further at present. I want, however, to make one final point. The Government are compounding what I can only describe as a fiscal crime by not simply subjecting future bond holders to a more stringent tax regime, but subjecting existing bond holders to a penal levy by taxing a notional gain at 15 per cent.
<P>
Unit trusts or a portfolio of shares can go up or down year by year. You, Mr. Butterfill, would be outraged, as would any hon. Member, if the Inland Revenue were to tax you at a compound 15 per cent., year upon year, simply because it had lost a case in the House of Lords that had proved that you were not avoiding tax. It is an outrage. I hope that the Paymaster General will see the force of our argument and will agree at least to reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I strongly support the amendment. It may be unusual for me to be so fulsome in my praise for the right hon. Member for Wells, but he put his case extremely well. We are debating a matter of principle. The Government are going against the rule of law in what they seek. Having read the House of Lords judgment, the right hon. Gentleman could have put it even more starkly, because the Lords ruled that offshore bonds do not involve the avoidance of tax. The Inland Revenue should be put in its place, but it felt the need to use a draconian approach to get rid of its pet hatreds.
<P>
The key issue is how people have used personal portfolio bonds. Are they a tax avoidance scam for offshore investors, or are they a legitimate saving device? I realise that some people may have used them as a tax avoidance device, but many have not. They have put their lifetime savings into that mechanism, and it is completely wrong and unjust indeed, it is immoral to change the rules of the game.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Would the hon. Gentleman concede that income tax is paid on income and on gains made on onshore bonds if there is a chargeable event at the higher rate for higher rate payers? That is one example of individuals with such onshore bonds being hit by the provision. It is not merely a question of offshore bonds being hit; the whole shooting match, including onshore bonds, where tax is paid if there is a chargeable event, is hit by this preposterous clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am not qualified to say whether he is right; perhaps the Paymaster General will tell us. However, the hon. Gentleman is certainly right that the proposal is outrageous. Some people of modest means have chosen to use PPBs as the principal means of saving for their retirement. The levy is not a sort of fat-cat tax. It is an attack on ordinary pensioners.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Wales said, the people who will have chosen that saving vehicle will typically have spent many years working abroad. In the past it was often difficult for such people it sometimes still is difficult to set up a pension and to enjoy the tax incentives that people who live and work here can enjoy. PPBs are a savings vehicle with a tax benefit to encourage people to save for their old age. It seems sensible that such a vehicle should exist. Why should people who work abroad, who may be working for the benefit of this country, not be able to enjoy the same tax incentives as people who live here? It would be an eminently sensible provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): The hon. Gentleman is speaking strongly against Clause 87. I hope for an insight into Liberal Democrat thinking on the matter. I asked the Library what was the revenue effect on the Exchequer of deleting clause 87, and was told that it would be £25 million. Can the hon. Gentleman say where in Liberal Democrat plans that money will be found? Will be a further 1p on income tax?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> There are many other tax loopholes that the Government could have chosen to close. Why did they choose this one? We are not against closing tax loopholes, but how it is done. What the Government have done is discriminatory. Closing that loophole more fairly would still have generated revenue for the Exchequer, albeit slightly less.
<P>
Losing some tax advantages will represent a huge cut in income for some holders of PPBs. It is no exaggeration to say that the measure will destroy some people's life savings and require them to change their lives significantly during their old age. I cannot believe that the Government really intended that at least, I hope that they did not but they have no case for doing it.
<P>
Perhaps the Government were not aware of that group of savers, but they should have been. If they were not aware of them before they put that measure into the Bill, they are certainly aware of that group now, because many who will be affected by it have written to their Member of Parliament and copies if those letters have been sent to Ministers. The Government must now be aware of the injustice, so there is no rhyme or reason for not putting right that wrong.
<P>
It is no good Ministers saying that the wording of the amendment would be difficult to interpret. That is the Government's fault for not understanding how PPBs operate as a savings mechanism. Even if there are problems with the amendment's wording, I support its spirit. The Committee must not allow the clause to remain unamended. It is arguably the most discriminatory and ill-judged measure of the Bill. I hope that Ministers will think again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to my amendment. I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). A number of superlatives have been heard during our deliberations, but clause 87 must be one of the most inept, most penal, most unfocused and most ill-defined clauses in the Finance Bill.
<P>
The clause might be dubbed the "It's anyone's guess clause". My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said that yet again huge powers are being hived off to secondary regulation, including the definition of what constitutes a personal portfolio bond, so we do not actually know what we are talking about. I know that Labour Members are used to talking about things which they know nothing, but the Committee is debating a product the definition of which has not yet been provided, but which has been delegated to secondary legislated. This is bizarre. The clause is a grotesque example of taking a vast sledgehammer to crack a tiny nut of abuse they may exist in certain PPBs.
<P>
I and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) tabled the audit because, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, there is no widespread abuse. Certainly the amendment will make sure that genuine holders of PPBs are not affected by the clause.
<P>
I want to speak about onshore bonds, which are potentially the greatest victims of the clause. Typical policy holders of onshore personal portfolio bonds are not particularly wealthy. The majority of them are retired, and a great many of them are widows. They have been resident in the United Kingdom for a long time. There is no evidence I challenge the Paymaster General to refute this that those bond holders go overseas on the maturity of the bonds to escape tax. I would ask the Paymaster General to tell the Committee how many bond holders are suspected of doing that, but I doubt whether he can give us a figure, and it would in any case be a slim number.
<P>
Yet again, along with overseas aid workers, British Council overseas teachers and pensioners who rely on advance corporation tax credits, anyone who holds a personal portfolio bond is seen as some sort of tax-avoiding fat-cat cowboy. The clause is yet another broad-brush measure to penalise genuine investors.
<P>
The anomaly is that onshore holders of PPBs suffer internal tax within the bond, despite the fact that the bond contains even normal unit-linked products under a fund manager who is a fully regulated member of the Securities and Futures Authority, the Personal Investment Authority or the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation. In those respects, PPBs do not differ from broker bonds.
<P>
There is a case for saying that certain offshore-based insurance bonds enjoy tax-efficient advantages from roll-up of income and gains being incorporated. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, the problem with those offshore bonds is that many were taken up for a time by investors working overseas and who now rely on the income, but who did not have access to the tax-efficient savings or pensions products that investors resident in the UK would have had.
<P>
I appreciate that certain people use offshore bonds as an insurance policy to wrap up a whole range of personal assets, including village cars and prime wines. I have every sympathy with a measure that would target that sort of abuse. It is a tiny minority, but everyone will suffer.
<P>
The attraction of onshore bonds is that they allow investors to invest their lump sum in a taxed investment, a fund managed by an independent fund manager of their choice on which they will pay higher rate tax on the profits on encashment. There is no way of avoiding tax, which is what the amendment seeks to define. It gives choice to the investor. The Paymaster General is one of the biggest advocates of choice for savers and investors, as we have seen in the various financial products that he has launched.
<P>
The other attraction of onshore bonds is that the investor may be paying a lower rate of tax on retirement, which is when he or she will want to take advantage of that long-term savings scheme. That is a perfectly legitimate form of investment. A 15 per cent. deemed gain is absolutely penal. More than that, it is a 15 per cent. deemed gain based on the total premiums paid up to the end of each policy year. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, it is cumulative, so that £100,000 would have a deemed gain after the first year of £15,000 and after three years of £19,837, regardless of how the bond has performed.
<P>
That deemed gain is taxed, despite any surrenders that may have been made to the investor during any of those years, and despite any losses that may have been made on investments within the personal portfolio bond, and in addition to any normal tax charge arising on a chargeable event; false surrender, death or maturity are the three main options. Those deemed gains are[Mr. Tim Loughton]
subject to tax at the higher rate, yet no money has been taken out by the taxpayer; the taxpayer will pay out of his or her own pocket for deemed gains that he or she may not even have on paper and which he or she probably has not enjoyed in practice.
<P>
It is absurd that no relief is given if those deemed gains exceed the gross termination gain. The strong possibility is that in poorly performing markets, the investor will end up paying excessive tax, based on a loss-making investment vehicle. Neither you, Mr. Butterfill, nor I would ever dream of investing in such a vehicle if it were shown to us in that light, yet it remains a perfectly legitimate way for people to save for their approaching retirement.
<P>
The terms are absurd, and 15 per cent. is a particularly harsh rate. It is also hypocritical of the Government, because any insurance company providing an illustration of how its investment products perform is statutorily limited to being able to show a growth rate of 10 per cent. per annum for onshore products after paying basic rate tax. Even ISAs are not that ambitious; they do not predicate a 50 per cent. gain, as the Paymaster General will confirm. In clause 87, we see one law for the Revenue and another for the legitimate investment community. It is bizarre. It smacks of expropriation more than of tax.
<P>
What options do existing bond holders have at present? First, they can surrender them immediately, which the Inland Revenue would like because it would get its hands on a large slug of tax. That would trigger a chargeable event, but as many of those PPBs are long-standing, many of them may have made considerable gains. Many people will therefore face a large tax bill at the marginal rate long before they expected. That is not a particularly attractive option.
<P>
The second option is to switch to the linked pooled funds of the insurance company. However, that does not give the investor a lot of choice, so the flexibility option that is so often touted by the Paymaster General is not available. Moreover, the Inland Revenue has not even confirmed that such a switch would not qualify for that deemed gain at penal rates.
<P>
Thirdly, bond holders can stay put and pay the absurd penal deemed rate of 15 per cent. on a cumulative basis. That is not an attractive option. It is a catch-22 situation. It is yet another abusive, retrospective form of taxation.
<P>
I thought that we were getting away from retrospective taxation certainly, that is what the Paymaster General would claim when he redeemed PEPs and those who had legitimately invested in that form of investment vehicle. However, the clause undermines the reasonable expectation of investors who legitimately invested in PPBs. As we heard, it will all be done by draconian secondary legislation.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, it rather smacks of revenge over the Professor Willoughby case. In that case, the House of Lords ruled firmly against the Revenue, clearly stating that personalised bonds were a legal and proper form of long-term investment and that they are not designed to be tax avoidance measures. The Inland Revenue effectively accepted the House of Lords' decision when it returned all the tax raised on the grounds of tax avoidance. It is sour grapes.
<P>
Under that draconian secondary legislation, the Treasury not Parliament or the Committee, but the Treasury can now determine the method by which the tax is charged, any relief that might be given, who is to be liable, the amounts on which the tax is to be charged, the rates of tax, when the tax is to be charged and how it is to be administered. We might as well all pack up and go home. We are having no effect whatever on the legislation; it is all being wafted off, at the whim of the Treasury, and all because the Treasury lost an important case in the House of Lords. That, too, smacks of sour grapes and nonsense.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The problem is the ability of policy holders or connected persons to choose or nominate their linked assets. The Government should be able to differentiate between United Kingdom insurance policies and offshore policies. The Revenue will claim that it is unable to do so within the European Union, but that is a red herring. I ask the Paymaster General to revisit that excuse.
<P>
The Revenue says that it will look at excluding bonds, which prevent the use of highly personalised investments, but where is that mentioned in the Bill? It has not been backed up by any words on paper; it is certainly not provided for in the Bill. I hope that the Paymaster General will say how many offending bonds exist, or have the Government plucked the issue out of the air regardless of the numbers? The Association of British Insurers, which is expert in the field, will claim, with authority, that the number of offshore PPBs is small and that the number of onshore PPBs is probably 10,000 or more with an average value of about £200,000 each. That is not an excessive amount for investors who are using PPBs for their retirement, living off the income and who might take a capital sum in part at a later date. Does the Paymaster General think that people with a PPB that is worth £200,000 as their major asset in retirement are fat cats and deserve penal rates of taxation?
<P>
The Government should ensure I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of the Treasury, however much humble pie that it will have to eat after the Willoughby case that there is a proper definition of personal portfolio bonds, a holdover charge to allow bonds to be rolled over into "non-offending" bonds and a definition of the PPBs that they do not like.
<P>
A PPB should not be affected by the Bill if it suffers internal tax, as onshore bonds do, and if the fund manager is appointed subject to the regulation body not acting on behalf of the holder of the policy. Regulations on the definition of funds suffering tax could be based on the draft regulations of November 1996 that reformed policy holder taxation.
<P>
The clause is one of the most unjust, draconian provisions in the Bill. Above all, it will affect people who, by no stretch of the imagination and by no stretch of the prejudicial views of some Labour Members, can be regarded as tax avoiders they are legitimate savers for their retirement. I recommend that members of the Committee accept the amendment. I hope that they are hanging their heads in shame that the Paymaster General and his colleagues will not withdraw the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): Conservative Members have spoken with considerable force. I hope that the Paymaster General will recognise that that shows our strength of feeling. The clause is described in the notes on clauses in the innocuous terms with which we are becoming all too familiar. The notes on clauses will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"close a number of loopholes in the existing regime and therefore contribute to the Government's aim of fairness in the tax system."</UL></FONT>
<P>
My right hon. and hon. Friends have demonstrated that it will do precisely the reverse. It will not simply close a tax loophole, but will impose a punitive and vindictive tax regime on a large number of investors who have taken advantage of an intended tax exemption to provide for their retirement. The nature of the tax regime being imposed is anything but fair. It is the culmination of a long-running vendetta by the Inland Revenue against those forms of savings vehicles.
<P>
I am still unclear about why the Inland Revenue should pick out this form of saving and claim that it is tax avoidance. As my hon. Friends have said, there is little difference between this personal portfolio bond and other offshore insurance bonds. The only real difference is that it gives the holder some control over where to place the investment, rather than allowing it to be managed by the insurance company. I am not clear why that should constitute tax avoidance, whereas allowing the insurance company to manage the fund is not. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would explain that point because it raises the question of whether the Government and the Inland Revenue regard all offshore insurance bonds as a form of tax avoidance.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have made clear, the definition of such bonds is left open in the Bill. The matter will be left to regulations that we have not yet seen. The government may change the definition by regulation in the future, but they are using the measure as a vehicle to attack all those types of offshore insurance bonds. The bonds are not generally used by people as a means of tax avoidance. They are used by expatriates who are not permitted under existing legislation to put retirement savings into an onshore tax exempt fund. Of course, some people may use the bonds to avoid tax, but I hope that the Paymaster General will respond to the questions raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) and tell us how many examples there are. One estimate suggests that 95 per cent. of holders of those bonds are genuine investors seeking to provide for their retirement. They do not intend to use them as tax avoidance devices.
<P>
Professor Willoughby has rightly been championed by the Committee for battling to establish that point. Despite the Inland Revenue's refusal to give up, he won his appeal to the special commissioner. It was upheld in the Court of Appeal and finally in the House of Lords. Several references have been made to that judgement. I shall read a sentence from the judgment in the House of Lords. Lord Nolan said:
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"It would be absurd ... to describe as tax avoidance the acceptance of an offer of freedom from tax which Parliament had deliberately made."</UL></FONT>
<P>
The use of the word "absurd" to describe the Inland Revenue's position shows how their Lordships regarded the strength of the Revenue's case.
<P>
Despite that ruling, the Inland Revenue proposes this clause and describes it in its press release as follows:
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
"This type of bond is designed primarily for tax avoidance purposes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, I accept that it is open to Parliament to change its mind. Parliament may decide that when an intended tax exemption is given, it is up to Parliament to reverse it. Parliament can overrule the House of Lords, but if it (does it) should say so. It should be recognised that it was an intended tax exemption and that it is not a tax avoidance measure. The Government are proposing not a change of mind by Parliament to remove an intended tax exemption, but are pursuing an argument that they have repeatedly lost every time they have attempted to use it. Consequently, many genuine investors will be subject to a punitive taxation regime. They will be faced with a choice of paying a large amount of tax today far sooner than they had ever expected to do, or paying even higher tax tomorrow.
<P>
I have more examples from my constituents and those of my hon. Friends, who have written angrily about the clause. I do not propose to quote them, but I hope that the Paymaster General will accept that Professor Willoughby is not unique. Many people will suffer from this vindictive measure.
<P>
The amendment targets those who use this tax-avoidance device the people whom the Inland Revenue press release states that the Government's regime is intended to hit. I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I take on board what has been said by Conservative Members, most of which was in good faith. I doubt that they believe that the Government should agree with the use of bonds whose purpose is tax avoidance. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham specified that they could be so constituted as to include racehorses, wine cellars, works of art and so on, but I am sure that no hon. Member supports the continuance of tax avoidance schemes, which often are offensive.
<P>
I do not want to be too technical or legal about the House of Lords' decision in the Willoughby case, which may have been misunderstood. The special commissioners and an appeal tribunal for tax matters found that Professor Willoughby did not intend to avoid UK tax when he bought his bonds. That finding could not be challenged in the House of Lords.
<P>
In introducing the clause, the Government do not intend to brand Professor Willoughby as a tax avoider. Nor do we introduce it in a spirit of retrospection, with a view to penalising any person or group of individuals. The aim is solely to deal with established cases that the Committee knows exist and need to be dealt with. In fact, Professor Willoughby is a distinguished lawyer in his own right, with a record of opposition to tax avoidance. His credentials speak for themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. No one is looking for revenge or to equal scores. As[Mr. Robinson]
Conservative Members know, some cases have to be dealt with. I shall speak about the merits of our approach next.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It seems absurd that the Paymaster General should admit, straightforwardly and correctly, that Professor Willoughby is an upstanding citizen whose reputation is that he is not a tax avoider. Why then did the Inland Revenue spend pots of money fighting the case all the way up to the House of Lords?
<P>
How many cases of abuse of personal portfolio bonds are there? The Paymaster General has acknowledged the question but not answered it. The Treasury must have had an estimate when the Bill was fashioned, but the Committee needs the figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I willingly give the hon. Gentleman the figures that I have. We estimate that the loss to the taxpayer from these avoidance schemes is £30 million, which is a lot of money. We have picked up on the previous Conservative Government's intention to deal with the problem and have adopted the approach that they would have taken had they been re-elected.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not participated in the debate, but I shall give way in a moment, when I have made a little progress. I always give way to the hon. Member for Guildford, and I shall do so shortly. Our figure is £30 million, which is a lot of money. Any Government confronted with such circumstances must deal with them.
<P>
Much has been made of the use of regulations, and the Opposition have made much of it again. I ensured that the circumstances were checked out with the Inland Revenue as fully as I reasonably could. There is no change in the approach to what is dealt with by primary and secondary legislation. There is no difference with regard to the negative and positive resolutions. I know that a later amendment comes down to that question, but practices remain the same.
<P>
While the measure is very wide, the point of regulations is to narrow it down. Ample time has been left for consultation, so that we can narrow down. That is what the consultation will be about, and it is the purpose of the regulations.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We do not need to decide on the regulations until April next year. They have the disadvantage of being secondary legislation, and have aspects that are not so good. They have one great advantage, which is that they can be consulted on and got right.
<P>
I believe that the matter is clear. Because of the difficulties of the definition, and because of the genuine nature of some schemes and intentions involved, the Government will do ourselves justice by taking the trouble to consult industry and representatives of the individuals concerned to get the provision as right as possible. Given good will and honesty on all sides honesty of motivation as much as of anything else the provision can become a genuine anti-avoidance measure that is not penal in any respects such as those mentioned by Opposition Members.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Sevenoaks does not believe that tax matters can be dealt with in that spirit, I am sorry to tell him that I believe that they can. The Inland Revenue will deal with them in that spirit, and will seek not to penalise people who are motivated for the right reasons that they believe to be justified.
<P>
We did the same with regard to ISAs, to which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham frequently refers, when we understood the nature of the investments. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that the action was in no sense retrospective. The Conservative Government never gave a guarantee about the continuation of tax relief on any form of saving. Changes could have been made from one year to the next.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Wriggling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No, absolutely not. No undertaking was ever given, and changes could have been made from one year to the next. In the small print of every ISA PEP a clear reference was made to the fact that tax relief changes could be made. Investments had to made in that full knowledge. It is no good wriggling with regard to the matter. The hon. Gentleman knows it to be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The point that I wish to make has been passed over. I shall return to it, and let my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks make his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The difference between the consultation about ISAs and that about the Bill is very clear. The Paymaster General published the draft regulations regarding ISAs before he used the statutory power in the Bill to put the provision on to the statute book. The Committee is being asked to agree to the clause before we have even seen the draft regulations, let alone the regulations themselves. Does not the Paymaster General regret that the draft regulations are not available to the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The ISAs are not a question of tax avoidance or evasion, but of incentives. I was pleased that the Government published the consultation document on ISAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. Consultation on the regulations will now occur. We are providing for the general power. The regulations will only narrow that power and make it specific and clear. That is their purpose, and they will be reached after a process of consultation.
<P>
I urge Opposition Members not to deny the value provided by the regulations in respect of intense consultation on technical detail. In my opinion, there is a great deal to be argued for proceeding in that way. It has considerable advantages over the very often specious and slightly pompous representations made by parliamentarians. I have made the point to hon. Members of both sides of the House who are in favour of the primacy of primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> How many worse options are there?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I agree that there are much worse things to do [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must allow the Paymaster General to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I was merely graciously accepting a compliment that came my way. Labour Members are not normally shy about accepting compliments and taking credit when it is offered perhaps the Opposition have some tricks to learn in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman has remembered what he wanted to intervene on before, I shall willingly give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I want to make it clear that we want to give the Paymaster General authority on these matters rather than on taxation in general because of his unique understanding of tax avoidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am inclined to note that, as so often, there was no point in giving way to the hon. Gentleman. Very few things change in this Committee, and that certainly has not.
<P>
I am trying to suggest that there is a problem, which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham acknowledged extremely well. He asked me to quantify it by the number of cases. I gave an equivalent figure, which is probably based on a better concept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Yes it is there could be 100,000 cases of £1 each, with which it would clearly be a waste of time for any tax-collecting authority to be concerned. On the other hand, one might have 10 cases amounting to 
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. As I was saying, a few cases could represent a much larger amount of money; what is at stake is the loss of tax revenue to the Government.
<P>
The previous Government deemed the matter worthy of investigation. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the consultative document and the recommendations that emerged from it. We know that Conservative Members want to dismiss 18 wasted years as being irrelevant. They want to pretend that nothing happened and that they can start afresh from last May. In reality, these matters were going to be dealt with by the previous Government, but through the just decision of the electorate it fell to us to deal with them, and we shall do so through regulations and consultation. I urge the hon. Gentleman to accept that we are approaching it in the appropriate spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The £30 million that the Paymaster General quoted and I should be very interested to know how he reached that figure is not the important factor. If, as he said, one person was responsible for that £30 million, the Government should be going after that one person rather than the 10,000 legitimate bond holders who use them as a legitimate means of saving. It is important to know how many individuals are supposedly abusing personal portfolio bonds. If the Paymaster General is saying that he does not have those figures, the Bill falls short yet again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman attempts to state that the Bill falls because we are considering a tax avoidance system, on the definition of which we are prepared to consult and draw up regulations so that we can see the full extent of the problem. The measure that we have, which the Revenue must take into account its whole function in life is to take it into account: we lose its zeal in fulfilling its duties at our peril is the figure of £30 million, which is a considerable sum.
<P>
I am trying to meet the legitimate concerns of Conservative Members. We are looking for alternative arrangements 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment; I know that the hon. Gentleman has a genuine interest in this. As I said, we are looking for alternative arrangements, transitional arrangements and definitions that will be fair and devoted to the sole purpose of eliminating an avoidance measure where it is obvious that the bond has been set up for tax avoidance purposes. Many are, and they amount to £30 million a year, at our best estimate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I find it extraordinary that the Paymaster General has no idea how many people hold bonds as a means of avoiding tax, yet can tell the Committee that the Inland Revenue loses £30 million as a result. Where does the figure come from? If the Paymaster General cannot supply the answer to the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, the figure would appear simply to have been made up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The figure comes as all such figures do from the Inland Revenue. Opposition Members say that they cannot imagine where it came from, but it is calculated on the same best-established principles as every figure that the Conservative Government provided for 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment. On the whole, figures from the Inland Revenue are there can be exceptions, as with any organisation, particularly where estimates of tax loss are concerned based on certain assumptions. We can get into the details in due course if hon. Members have a serious interest in the matter.
<P>
Opposition Members are zeroing in on a narrow point. They have received our figure of £30 million lost in tax revenue, which is substantial. The Conservative Government also considered it to be substantial and intended to deal with it. The figure is £30 million, and we have proceeded on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am very confused by the figure of £30 million. In answer to a question on an earlier[Mr. St. Aubyn]
clause, the Paymaster General spoke about the estimates and the press release of 17 March. He said that there would be negligible savings in taxation this coming year from the composite group of tax changes. The implication was, however, that there would be a speculative loss to the Revenue of £30 million from all the clauses next year and of £150 million in a full year. Will the Minister clarify that when he talks about £30 million, he is talking not about a £30 million saving from the clause this year or next year, but about a speculative Revenue estimate of what might happen if people use a perfectly legitimate savings vehicle for tax-avoidance purposes in the future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have some figures that might help Opposition Members. I ask them to tell me precisely what significance they attach to the figures and how they will further their arguments. We estimate that there are 3,500 UK-resident individuals with PPBs from non-UK life insurance. That is one established figure. I repeat it for the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham who has an interest in these matters and for the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, whom I should congratulate on his appointment to the Front Bench, as I have not yet done so. He seems to have no interest in it, although he can speak about it in due course if he wishes. The Association of British Insurers has estimated that there are between 5,000 and 10,000 bond holders in the UK. Those are two precise figures. I can also confirm the estimate that the provision will yield £30 million in 1999-2000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for repeating and confirming my figures, but he still has not given us the figure that we want. How many abusers are there? What is the number that is of such consequence that everybody should be tarred with the same brush and lose out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that I started the debate by clarifying. We are not trying to tar anybody with a brush. As he made clear when he started his speech, there are abuses and tax-driven schemes no one questions that. Our estimate is that there will be £30 million of savings to the Exchequer, which it is entirely correct for the Inland Revenue and the Treasury to pursue. There is no further justification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment. I have given way an awful lot and we are not getting very far. The Revenue and the Treasury believe and the previous Government took the same view that sufficient savings can be made to the Exchequer by tackling avoidance and abuse to justify us doing so. We shall draw up regulations in consultation with industry and with individuals and their representatives so that we do not penalise genuine cases in which avoidance is not an issue.
<P>
I should have thought that the terms in which I have responded and the assurances that I have given on our approach and on drawing up regulations are more than adequate to reassure Opposition Members that there is no need for them to pursue their amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I was nearing the end of my remarks, Mr. Butterfill. I reiterate that we were considering the impact of definitional statements and transitional arrangements on those who have been a legitimate cause for concern to Committee members.
<P>
It may assist the debate if I say something about the transitional arrangements. However, I do not want in any way to pre-empt the consultative process through which the regulations will be drawn up. It is not for me to take such decisions in Committee, much as Opposition Members might wish to settle the matter here and now. When changes such as these are anticipated, we should first consult widely. In that respect I again commend to the Committee the value of regulations over primary legislation. The parliamentary process of amendment, acceptance of amendment and eventual legislation inevitably imposes limitations on such matters.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells, and others with similarly distinguished careers in accountancy and tax, will know that such matters are not necessarily best settled on the hoof and in one go. Some matters must be settled quickly, and the Government have done so where necessary. Professor Willoughby in particular has drawn our attention to cases of deliberate and clearly admitted tax avoidance, and wants action to be taken against such abuses. We must therefore act as quickly as is practicable.
<P>
It is reasonable that Opposition Members should want the opportunity to unscramble the arrangements for personal portfolio bonds before the new charge on those bonds comes into effect. We have therefore proposed to defer the introduction of the charge until at least next April. Again, I must stress the importance of consultation between now and next April in order to get things right.
<P>
However, I cannot agree that it is reasonable to allow those with highly personalised bonds both to rearrange their affairs in order to escape the annual charge, and to defer the tax charge that would arise under the existing law until such times as they eventually dispose of the bonds. One cannot have it both ways. Such an arrangement could easily lead to no tax being paid on large gains made through those bonds. For example, the holder could arrange to realise the gain at a time when he or she is resident outside the UK.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale), who has recently been elevated to the Opposition Front Bench in Committee, shakes his head. However, we cannot allow those who have knowingly purchased such bonds, and who fall within the definition that we shall reach through consultation, to give up those bonds and to surrender the associated benefits without paying any tax. They can of course call a halt to the bonds in order to realise the gains payable to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Will you clarify whether we are discussing amendment No. 171, or have we moved on to amendment No. 192?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are still discussing amendment No. 171, but I am allowing some discretion, as I said I would.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I thought it would be helpful to have the matter on the record.
<P>
The draft regulations will include a transitional measure to give relief which will benefit some of those who held personal portfolio bonds before Budget day. Many who purchased those bonds have not used the option given under the terms of their contracts to invest in assets of their own choosing. Instead, throughout the life of the bond, the only investments held have been those in internal funds that the insurer has made generally available to investors. It is not generally the intention to bring bonds which permit investment only in such funds within the yearly charge. Those who have invested only in such funds will have the opportunity to alter the terms of their contract with the insurer so that they are able to invest only in linked assets of that type. If they do that before 6 April next year, they will not be liable to the yearly charge.
<P>
I urge Opposition Members to consider my comments when they have a chance to read the Official Report. The terms of the contract will not give rise to a chargeable event for tax purposes. We look forward to genuine and helpful consultation on the transitional arrangements and other details of the regulations.
<P>
I repeat that those who have used the bonds to invest in personal assets will have the choice of giving up the policy and paying tax on any gain under the normal rules, or facing the yearly charge from April 1999. There is no way out of that, which is as it should be.
<P>
I sense that the Opposition have further questions and I readily yield to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There is one important point that must be cleared up immediately. Before we adjourned, the Paymaster General suggested that the yield from the changes would be £30 million in the year 1999-2000. Is that correct? The Inland Revenue's press release No. 38 at the time of the Budget suggested that the full yield from the four changes would be £30 million in 1999-2000. Those four changes are to trusts, fiscal representatives and overseas life insurance businesses, as well as personal portfolio bonds. The Paymaster General, perhaps inadvertently, has misled the Committee if he is suggesting that the whole of the £30 million will come from the changes to personal portfolio bonds. That cannot be the position, or the yield from the other three changes would be minimal. Perhaps the Paymaster General will correct his previous comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall explain. The other changes will come in a year later. The figure of £30 million covers the change that will come in 1999-2000. The other changes will not come in until 2000-2001.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Is the Paymaster General saying that the Government thought of a figure £30 million and when they knew that there would be four changes, they quadrupled that figure, which is approximately £150 million?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We have given best estimates from the Inland Revenue. We believe them to be soundly based and that the savings will be made. The central issue is that if the Opposition agree that serious abuses and avoidances are taking place I believe that they do and I am addressing my words particularly to the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham and for Maldon and East Chelmsford they must be dealt with. In particular, if they agree with Professor Willoughby, who drew our attention to so many of those abuses, why will they not engage in the process of defining and limiting them in the regulations? It is incumbent on the Inland Revenue and the Treasury to do deal with the abuses. That is what the legislation allows us to do. It could be said that the clause goes too wide, but the regulations will restrict and define. Nothing becomes operative until they are agreed. Opposition Members should accept that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The Paymaster General said that if abuses are taking place, they must be tackled. Our point is that no evidence has been produced that abuses are taking place on a large scale. We attempted to extract an estimate of the number of people who are practising the abuse, but he was unable to provide that figure. The only figure he produced was that of 3,500 UK residents who hold the bonds. But a large number of those people will be the very expatriates whom we are trying to defend those people who have retired and returned to this country, one of whom, I suspect, is Professor Willoughby.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am prepared to respond in that rather aggravated tone if the hon. Gentleman wants. I invited him to take down the figures as I repeated them for his benefit, but he studiously refused to do so. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham wrote them down and checked them. I went out of my way to tell the hon. Gentleman that under no circumstances were we saying that there was an explicit or implicit understanding that those who held such bonds were engaged in tax avoidance. I made that absolutely clear.
<P>
I gave the hon. Gentleman figures on two occasions, but he refused to write them down. He even asked for them a third time, but he still cannot remember them. That is not my fault. It is unfortunate that we have to cope with the numerical illiteracy of the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. I shall give the figures again: in 1999-2000 [Interruption.] I shall repeat the numbers. I suggest that Opposition Members write them down. I do not expect them to understand them, but at least they will be able to read them. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] We have had some tetchy remarks today. I did my utter best to provide the figures. That was done under some duress because I knew that the Opposition would infer from them that we regarded all those people as being engaged in explicit evasion of tax. That is not the case; nor was it the case with Professor Willoughby.
<P>
The breakdown of estimated yields is: in 1999-2000, £30 million from PPBs the same figure as I gave earlier; from 2001 onwards, £100 million per financial[Mr. Robinson]
year from offshore policies; from 2000 to 2001, £5 million rising to £35 million from policies in trust. Those figures add up. What I said about PPBs was correct.
<P>
The Government, in the spirit of getting to the heart of a difficult, messy and unpleasant problem, are prepared to work to get the regulations right, something that we do with so much tax policy. Our whole approach is to be utterly fair. We cannot indulge and pay people for having engaged in such practices. There must be a fair balance between them and every other taxpayer in the country, but we do not want to penalise them. There is no revanchist spirit in any of our tax legislation. The only retrospective element in our policy was the windfall tax, which was welcomed throughout the country. The impact of the welfare-to-work measures shows that that tax was not only necessary but justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have heard the Paymaster General make the important statement that, with the exception of the windfall tax, the Government are doing nothing that has retrospective effect. If any aspect of tax legislation is inadvertently retrospective, will he give an undertaking to amend the relevant clauses, at least on Report?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am too old a hand to rise to the bait of these would-be clever interventions. There are some other retrospective aspects, even in clauses that we may discuss, which are wholly relieving. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to obstruct anything that would have that effect. I cannot therefore even pretend to make the commitment that he was trying to elicit from me.
<P>
PPBs are being marketed as tax avoidance devices even Professor Willoughby made that clear in his correspondence with the Inland Revenue and we have clear ideas about what needs to be tackled. All we are saying is that it must be tackled in a spirit of getting it right, rather than getting it wrong or not listening, which was a charactertistic of the Conservative Government. For those reasons, I believe that the clause is exactly in line with the good policies of consultation, involvement, fairness and justice in the taxation system, to which we are committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not think that the Paymaster General's response measures up to the seriousness of the issue. We have extracted a number of figures from him, and have discovered that 3,500 people in the United Kingdom have taken out these bonds. We are still waiting for a breakdown of those people who might be described as being in the Professor Willoughby camp whom the highest court in the country decided were not using the bonds with the intention of improperly avoiding tax and those who, in the Paymaster General's words, are engaged in serious abuses. If he were to introduce a clause that attempted a distinction between those two groups, he would gain a certain amount of sympathy from Opposition Members.
<P>
On the face of it, and in substance, a group of perfectly respectable savers won a convincing court case, which proved beyond doubt that they were holding the bonds for legitimate purposes and were not involved in any ordinary understanding of the phrase in a tax avoidance scheme. The Inland Revenue and the Treasury are determined to penalise everyone, and catch in the net the good and the bad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): I feel provoked into speaking. Earlier in the debate, I listened carefully to the remarks made by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen. I was worried by many of the issues that they raised. In particular, I recall the remarks made by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, which acknowledged quite explicitly that there was no question but that the Government had the right to change the legislation as they saw fit. The right hon. Member for Wells is riding roughshod over those remarks with what he is currently saying.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are supposed to be brief. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to catch my eye during the debate, he is at liberty to do so, but he is not at liberty to speak at length in an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I can assure the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) that there is no difference between my attitude and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford on this matter. We both recognise that, in successive Finance Bills, Governments introduce anti-avoidance measures where there is significant abuse such that Parliament's intentions are being circumvented and large amounts of public money are at risk.
<P>
The Paymaster General has not demonstrated that that is the case here. He mentioned the figure of £30 million the cost of the bonds but surely he understands that any savings vehicle that shelters investors from tax costs the Government revenue. It is exactly the same with the new individual savings accounts. Any savings product, almost by definition, shelters investors from tax. Indeed, the Government are trying to persuade people to take out ISAs so that they will save tax and not pay capital gains tax or income tax on dividends. According to the Government's logic, that is tax avoidance and illegitimate, so presumably those savings products will be shut down in a few years' time. Just after millions of them have been sold in good faith, suddenly, the Government will announce that it is all far too expensive and all part of a giant national tax avoidance scheme. Let us be more precise, therefore, about what is illegitimate and unjustified tax avoidance, and distinguish between that and people who, as the House of Lords found, take out bonds in good faith for normal and legitimate investment purposes.
<P>
The Paymaster General tried to defend his use of regulations to give substance to the Revenue's intentions, on the grounds that they would be subject to consultation, but draft clauses can be subject to consultation. Nothing would prevent the Government from announcing their intentions to legislate in a Finance Bill, and then exposing their intentions to criticism and suggestion. Many practitioners and commentators have written to us acknowledging that there is a case for a targeted anti-avoidance measure against personal portfolio bonds. What they resent, as do we, is that the entire category of bondholders will not just be told that the products are to be withdrawn, but will be subjected to an annual penal levy, which will force many of them to sell with disastrous tax consequences because they will all be subject to full income tax, and will then have to live on the residue, which will also become taxable in due course. That is a funny way of trying to persuade people to save for their old age and become more self-reliant.
<P>
That is our charge, and the Paymaster General showed no understanding of what we are suggesting. Instead, he simply said, "Trust us, the regulations will be fine because we are consulting on them." Why should we trust the Inland Revenue and the Treasury when they have wasted tens of millions of pounds pursuing an entirely fruitless persecution of Professor Willoughby and others, taking the case all the way to the House of Lords and losing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I will give way.
<P>
If that had happened in a public company in which I was investing, I would make sure that the directors, or someone, paid some sort of price for that, rather than allowing, in this case, the Revenue and the Treasury to say, "We shall introduce a wholly oppressive and penal tax regime to be applied to these people, but we shall not tell the Standing Committee considering the Finance Bill what it is because we have not really decided; it will all be subject to future regulations and, we are sorry, but you will have no opportunity to debate it." Does the hon. Gentleman want to intervene to say that he supports that approach to legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I intervened earlier to discuss the way that the Inland Revenue pursued Professor Willoughby, which was a most disgraceful episode. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that that pursuit occurred when the Conservative party was in government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> At the risk of wearying the Committee, I shall make my point again. The previous Government, of which I was a member for a few years, had a policy of tracking down what I regard as illegitimate tax avoidance schemes. If the Paymaster General wants to bring forward a clause to that effect we will support him, but the Government have made no such proposal. If I were a member of the Front-Bench team, I should tell the Inland Revenue to come back with a properly targeted measure to deal with that perceived tax abuse, which would mean that the Committee need not be troubled by the clause in the way that we have been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The clause is, as I hope to demonstrate in my speech, arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory and confiscatory.
<P>
The clause provides that there will be a periodic charge; that much we know. It also covers new ground, and new principles are being conceded. Regulations will be able to change the periodic charge: the amounts, periods, rate of tax and the allowances and deductions can all be changed.
<P>
As if that were not enough, subsection (9) states that the regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may make a different provision for different cases, different circumstances or different periods".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are conceding a long-held tax principle that every taxpayer should be treated fairly and equally. The clause contains the beginnings of a new development: a taxpayer will receive different treatment for each PPB that he owns, which is quite unacceptable. Subsection (9) goes on to say that the regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may make incidental, consequential, supplemental or transitional provision."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an unprecedented 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said that I would allow the debate on amendment No. 171 to range widely, and we have indeed had a wide-ranging debate. I must point out to the hon. Gentleman that we will discuss the regulations in relation to amendment No. 58, and I hope that he will not pursue that matter too far in his speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Butterfill. The matter has been put nicely in context.
<P>
We have heard much this evening about the Willoughby case. Previous cases made it clear that Inland Revenue officials can be subject to judicial review. They will have to be very careful when they frame the regulations, especially if our amendment is rejected. In the Fleet street case, Lord Scarman interestingly said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am persuaded that modern case law recognises a legal duty owed by the Revenue to the general body of taxpayers to treat taxpayers fairly: to use their discriminatory powers so that, subject to the requirements of good management, discrimination between one group of taxpayers and another does not arise".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Inland Revenue officials will have to be very careful because they might well fall foul of Lord Scarman's dictums. The Government's proposal will treat taxpayers in completely arbitrary and discriminatory ways. For example, if a taxpayer had a PPB an index-linked bond which was invested in the full FTSE 500 index, that would not fall under the clause's scope. If an insurance-linked index bond was invested in the more restricted 250 index, that person would fall foul of all of the provisions in the clause. Yet again, we are witnessing a restriction of taxpayers' freedom to choose the investments they make. Worse, the Paymaster General said that that does not matter because taxpayers are being given one year to readjust their affairs and that all will therefore be sweetness and light.
<P>
The Government are imposing a penal regime that means that some small savers, who may hold personal portfolio bonds or similar packages which is probable as they were introduced in 1968 will be forced to sell them. Some such small investors will have to pay capital gains tax prematurely on their savings, which they may have expected to carry on well for another few years and into their retirement.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The retrospective element of the clause is also disturbing. Previous such provisions, such as the life insurance premium relief tax, applied only to policies[Mr. Clifton-Brown]
that were subsequent rather than previous to their introduction. The clause is a typical example of a measure that adversely affects people who have been acting legitimately and who have been encouraged by successive Governments and Finance Bills. The people in question have held legitimate personal portfolio bonds for their savings and for their old age. They should be allowed to keep such savings unhindered.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells made a good point. Previous Conservative and Labour Governments have encouraged the savings vehicle in question. The Government are proud of the ISA regime, which is supposed to last for the very long period of 10 years. How can the Committee be sure that the Paymaster General or his successor will not decide that it costs too much and that it is being abused and therefore abolish it? They may decide to enforce a penal tax regime to ensure that such investments are no longer worth holding if, indeed, they were worth holding in the first place. The Committee must consider the provision very carefully.
<P>
I leave the Committee with a quotation from a very senior tax practitioner who wrote to my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). He wrote in confidence so I cannot name him. The quotation shows that it is not merely Opposition Members who are raising scare stories. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is no exaggeration to suggest if this petty, discriminatory and wholly indefensible piece of legislation is enacted by Parliament then most certainly citizens of the UK will never again be able to rely on the legitimacy and effectiveness of Acts passed by Parliament and judgments handed down by the courts."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee is in very dangerous territory. The clause is arbitrary and it abrogates the sovereignty of Parliament. All Governments and taxpayers will rue the day on which the Committee agrees the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Belatedly, I should declare an interest that I did not mention, but which is listed. I work for a bank that runs such policies, and I have run them in the past. Such work gives a little experience, although I know that Labour Members do not see its relevance.
<P>
The Paymaster General always kindly refers to my constituency. I should like to point out that it is East Worthing and Shoreham. I do not have the privilege of representing the western half of the area. I wanted to say that before my constituents also complain.
<P>
The Committee has had an interesting debate. I called the clause the anyone's guess clause. We are still in the dark, and it still is anybody's guess as to who the abusers are, how many of them exist, and the amount of regulations that will be introduced to deal with them.
<P>
The Paymaster General's response has been something of an eye-opener. The Economic Secretary used the term "fankle". We have certainly had some mega fankle from Labour Members this evening. Interesting contributions have been made, and have as usual come especially from the Opposition. The sole Liberal Democrat present rightly referred to the clause as probably the worst clause in the Bill. It will affect the income of many people in their old age.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East, rightly referred to the Willoughby case as the culmination of a long-running vendetta by the Inland Revenue under various Governments.
<P>
We agree wholeheartedly with the Paymaster General when he says that abuses of personal portfolio bonds occur. However, that is not the issue at stake. Some people use insurance policies to wrap personalised assets for racehorses, wine and suchlike. That must be clamped down on: the previous Government put in train measures to do so. This measure should be the culmination of that process, but it should not take everybody else out of the boat at the same time.
<P>
We are still none the wiser about the extent of the problem. The figure of £30 million that the Paymaster general was handed on a slip of paper, and then had to qualify and requalify, may represent 10 people who hold personal portfolio bonds to the value of £3 million each. Those 10 people could all be millionaire contributors to the Labour party. If they were, we should give the Government our full support in pursuing them. We would not necessarily know the names and addresses of those 10 people, but we know the names and addresses of the 10,000 honest taxpaying PPB holders onshore, who will be taken overboard by this broad-brush clause. They are the ones who will have to pay.
<P>
It is extraordinary for the Paymaster General to say that the number of such abusers is not the relevant point. Of course it is relevant. We want to know who the villains are, how they know that the loophole exists and how we target them. If this loophole is closed, they will find other ways of abusing the system. The 10,000 honest PPB holders will not have that luxury. It is like saying, "There is a problm in Coventry with road rage, and we are therefore going to confiscate the wheels and furry dice of everyone in Coventry who drives a Rover". It is absurd that the real abusers of the system cannot be pinned down.
<P>
I have laid out three possible options that are open to existing PPB holders. However, we do not yet know how the regulations are going to bite, how the method by which tax is charged is to be determined, or what reliefs may be given and who may be liable for them. How on earth did the Inland Revenue pluck the figure of £30 million out of the air? We have no confidence in that figure. The regulations are still some way away, but the cut-off date is to be 5 April 1999. That gives people very little time to decide what options are open to them, given that PPBs are to be clamped down on in such a penal way. The Paymaster General has been wriggling. That is obvious from the fact that he has had to defend the figures by referring to the example of ISAs. His figures for PEP holders who would be affected by ISAs ranged wildly, in the space of a day, from 650,000 to 350,000 and then to 700,000. He must have been in dire straits to have to clutch at those straws.
<P>
Conservative Members would be delighted to meet Professor Willoughby. He may, for all we know, be in the Public Gallery listening to our endeavours. He has been feted as a hero; a model taxpayer; an intellectual giant in the field of finance and tax law. No doubt he is all of those things. However, the Inland Revenue, which the Paymaster General believes to be infallible, has pursued him to the highest court in the land at vast public expense. Pensioner personal portfolio bond holders are now to join the ranks of foreign aid workers, teachers and nurses working overseas and pensioners who have relied on their ACT tax credit refunds to help with their small share portfolios. By the definition of the Bill and of the Government, they have joined the ranks of that fat-cat, tax-dodging shower.
<P>
I have given the Paymaster General some suggestions as to the formulation of a definition that would clamp down on the real abusers. That definition could easily be absorbed into the Bill at this stage, rather than deferring it to the regulations. It is a shame that the Minister has decided not to take up those suggestions. It is plain that the clause is highly retrospective and undermines the reasonable expectations of honest investors who bought the bonds. It is penal, pernicious, untargeted and inept.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the next and subsequent amendments to th clause, I want to make it clear to the Committee that I was lenient in allowing the debate on amendment No. 171 to go so wide that, in effect, it amounted to a clause stand part debate. However, I shall not be so lenient about diversions from the subject of other amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Does that mean that we will not have a debate on clause stand part?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I ruled when we began to discuss this clause that there would not be a clause stand part debate. I said that I would allow a very wide-ranging debate on amendment No. 171, which I did. I said also that we would deal with the question of regulations under clause 58.
<P>
I will allow debates on the matters that are the subject of the following amendments, but there will not be a debate on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 192, in page 72, line 29, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3B) The regulations shall make provision to allow existing bond holders to dispose of any personalised assets within their bond and amend their contracts before 6th April 1999 without this being treated as a termination or chargeable event.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mindful of your injunction, Mr. Butterfill, about brevity and non-repetition, I shall be very brief in speaking to the amendment. The intention is obvious, and it fits into the context of what we consider to be a wholly oppressive way to deal with a problem that the Government have magnified through their gross overreaction to a tax-avoidance issue.
<P>
As an absolute minimum, existing holders of the bonds should be allowed to dispose of them or transfer them into other assets without incurring a penalty. Under the Bill, the thousands of bond holders who bought them in good faith will be subject to a penal tax charge on an annual basis. Many may conclude that their best course is to dispose of them, and that is the Government's intention: they want to suppress this form of savings.
<P>
However, disposing of the bonds will trigger an immediate income tax charge. That will reduce the value straight away, and those transferring the bonds into other assets will have a much smaller pool of savings or shares on which to live for the rest of their lives. Many such holders are already elderly, and we regard the provision as unfair.
<P>
The amendment would enable bond holders to transfer the bonds into other assets without that being treated as a termination or chargeable event. That would be simple equity, as the products were bought in good faith. People had planned to be able to use them to the end of their days in the way that was foreseen when they purchased them originally.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will follow up the distinction that we were trying to draw earlier between those who manipulate the bonds as part of a tax-avoidance scheme we have no sympathy for them and the majority of holders who did not. Indeed, the House of Lords found that that majority did not intend to avoid tax in a way that was not foreseen or allowed for at the time.
<P>
The Paymaster General may not agree with the drafting of the amendment, but I hope that he will accept the thinking behind it so that, if necessary, he can table a similar amendment on Report. If he was genuine when he stressed the need to consult, he should consult on a way to draw the distinction that I described, and act for the law-abiding majority. However, the only consultation in hand at present concerns how to implement the subsequent penal regime that Conservative Members have outlined.
<P>
I urge the amendment on the Government in a genuinely constructive spirit. I hope that they will accept it in the same spirit.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> This has been an interesting debate, and the Paymaster General's good-natured response to some questions has been appreciated.
<P>
Conservative Members contend that the amendment strikes a blow for fairness a quality absent from the clause. I urge the Paymaster General to reflect quietly when he goes home tonight on the kind of language that the quiet denizens of Chancery lane and the Law[Mr. Ruffley]
Society have used. Those men and women are not known for their exaggerated language, but they have called the proposals draconian and said that they amount to an expropriation. They have used those words because the clause makes no serious distinction between bond holders who abuse the regime and we have conceded that a tiny minority does and the vast majority whose holding is legitimate and legal and who do not abuse the tax regime.
<P>
I shall not try your patience, Mr. Butterfill, but I shall refer briefly to points made several times by the Opposition. We have suggested that the Paymaster General has not made the case for his view that there is widespread abuse. He has not done so because he cannot provide a fixed number of abusers. It was quite ridiculous for him to come up with the figures to which he referred. We have written down the figures applying to all the fiscal years that he described.
<P>
The Opposition feel a sense of disbelief about those figures. I wrote down the Paymaster General's words. He told the Committee that he believed the estimates to be "soundly based". How can that be so without set numbers from the Revenue? It should be incumbent on the Paymaster General, as a Minister, to have such numbers at his fingertips. He said that the regulations will address the matter, and that distinctions will be drawn between holders who are genuinely abusing the system and those who are not. Why wait for the regulations? What will be elicited that could not be elicited now, in time to include a relevant clause in the Bill?
<P>
The key point about the amendment is that ordinary people will be hit. The Committee has not had the benefit of hearing about real-life examples of constituents who are not in any way fat cats. I received a letter, dated 19 May, from a constituent who lives in Barking road in Needham Market, and who is an onshore bond holder. With a sense of regret more than of anger, he wrote that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not being able to save and plan with any degree of confidence...affects me critically and deeply. Similarly, at the very stage in my life where after decades of careful saving and planning I expect to retire I find the massive uncertainty in this arbitrary whimsy in the treatment of Bonds has completely removed the anticipated pleasure with which I had been looking forward to retirement."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that many Opposition and Labour Members have received such correspondence.
<P>
A similar cross-section of correspondence must have come from offshore bond holders. A telling point was made in The Daily Telegraph on 25 April. The article in question pointed out that ordinary people would be hit by the crackdown on offshore funds, and stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the changes will hit people who are far from being `fat cats' and who simply saved for retirement while working overseas."</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee knows that many people who work overseas do not have the option of investing in pensions or other savings products in Britain. That is why such people have had to rely on the vehicle to which the clause applies.
<P>
The amendment would achieve fairness by avoiding the savagely penal regime that the clause will impose indiscriminately on bond holders. The Committee knows that the 15 per cent. rate for deemed tax is way in excess of any rate in the assumptions for investment growth allowed under financial service regulations. The level is extortionate, and applies whether or not investment growth has occurred and whether or not the investor has incurred profit or losses. It applies regardless of withdrawal by holders.
<P>
In addition, the application of the level has no regard for annual exemptions for CGT, indexation or tapering relief, which would be available to investors who had invested more directly and in more traditional products. They will reap the benefit of the CGT allowances. Holders under highly personalised funds, as they will be described, will not receive such exemptions. That is deeply unfair to people who have invested in good faith.
<P>
The question of retrospection was mentioned. I shall not repeat the lucid arguments of my right hon. and hon. Friends. People facing the change, albeit in April 1999, will have to decide on one of two options. They will face cashing in their policy, which will be a huge chargeable event for them; or they will have to find the money up front and 100 per cent. of all the tax stored up since the policy was taken out will become due and payable immediately. That will be a terrifying prospect for the many elderly individuals who are holders of those policies. There is much anecdotal and factual evidence to suggest that that will probably be unsustainable in many cases.
<P>
It is in that spirit and given those facts that the amendment deserves the Paymaster General's serious consideration. He has been jovial and sympathetic to some of our arguments, although he does not always agree with us. However, he should consider that the amendment would treat current policyholders fairly; it would allow them to transfer into a different sort of policy. That would deal with any problem of avoidance in the future.
<P>
We have in mind transfers into new contracts and policies that will not offend in the terms set up by Ministers. Those policies might be pooled or non-personalised funds. Therefore, the problem of perceived abuse would not arise. The amendment would be fair to those who invest in good faith, and it would avoid any problem of future abuse. In that spirit, I ask the Paymaster General to give the amendment due consideration. I am sure that he will have some affable, but well-considered, thoughts on what we have said.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I fear that I shall not be able to rise to the occasion. I am not sure that I can do what the Opposition have requested. The problem is that we have to decide on the one hand what is a deliberate attempt to avoid tax and, on the other, what is an innocent position of being in a fund. That is not especially easy to do.
<P>
The problems of definition and transition will be dealt with during the intensive consultations that will soon take place. We want to deal with those who have obviously deliberately avoided tax in a way that could not be tolerated, either by the Conservative Government or ourselves. I think that the matter goes back to 1989 and the case involving Professor Willoughby. No Government can simply ignore such blatant, deliberate attempts at avoidance. Some £30 million our best estimate is a considerable amount of revenue to the Exchequer.
<P>
In essence, this seemingly innocent amendment would allow bond holders to amend their contracts. It would also allow those bond holders who have linked their benefits to assets of their choice to switch to other non-personal assets without suffering a tax charge. The amendment is technically defective, as the right hon. Member for Wells realised in moving it. Without dealing with those technical deficiencies, the amendment does not commend itself if I am correct about its intent. It does not contain an essential element of fairness.
<P>
I do not know how long such bonds might have been held by the individuals who will be caught by the regulations, nor can I estimate the extent of their liability, because the definitions and transitional arrangements have yet to be determined. However, I believe it is right to announce the intentions and then work out the practicalities.
<P>
Clearly, we cannot simply make an arrangement that will prevent any tax charge from arising on the termination of current arrangements that will be caught by the new provisions which will be worked out in regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The amendment does not suggest that no tax will be payable. We are arguing that there should be holdover or roll-over int a new product. In other words, there will be a tax deferral. That cannot be interpreted as absolving policyholders from the payment of tax.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I take that point, but no tax would crystallise at the stage. It wouild go over into a perfectly legitimate pension scheme or into the bond holder's choice of scheme. What had accrued as a legitimate tax charge would not crystallise, but would be moved into a legitimate scheme. If the hon. Gentleman reflects on that, he may agree that that does not quite meet the test of fairness.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment. It is defective and does not achieve the limited objectives that the hon. Gentleman has clearly set out. Creating such a clear amnesty for gains that had arisen out of blatant tax-avoidance schemes would not be fair. I cannot accept the amendment's aims.
<P>
I repeat that there will be a period of consultation to work out the key elements. If hon. Members are honest in their intention to eliminate abuse and not to penalise those who have not been party to such abuse, they will accept that we must get the transitional arrangements right. That is the Government's clear intent and we shall adhere to it. However, the amendment would not achieve that intent; it is technically deficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I do not want to prolong the debates, but I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would deal with one further point. The suggestion that holders of personal portfolio bonds should be allowed, within the period set down by the Government, to transfer them into a different type of bond is not designed to allow to them to avoid future tax. They will clearly face a future tax charge when they cash in bonds. Professor Willoughby made that suggestion as a way of meeting the Government's concerns while removing unfairness.
<P>
The Paymaster General has still not dealt with the point I originally raised. In the view of the Inland Revenue, personal portfolio bonds are an abuse and a tax-avoidance measure. However, the Government do not consider managed portfolio bonds, which are no different other than the fact that an insurance company rather than the individual manages the investment, to be a tax-avoidance measure. Why have personal portfolio bonds been picked out? The House of Lords took the view that there was no justification for that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is right. The distinction he is trying to make is not precise. The Lords' ruling and Professor Willoughby made it clear that some of that category of bonds are avoidance geared. They are motivated by avoidance and are sold on that basis. There is no doubt about that. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will be aware of that because he has dealt with the honest side of the market.
<P>
I cannot give a definition or tell the Committee what the precise transitional arrangements will be. We have until April next year to get the definition right so that we do not trap innocent bond holders and so that we can make proper transitional arrangements to a new system. That new system should not contain the latent incentive to avoidance that currently exists, which Professor Willoughby admitted existed in his exchanges with the Inland Revenue and which the previous Government knew existed when they initiated the litigation with Professor Willoughby about seven or eight years ago. We must get it right and have the clarity and determination of purpose to do so. We should not rush into the law courts or into primary legislation; we must propose regulations that provide a definition and appropriate transitional arrangements. I urge the Committee to make progress.
<P>
Amendment negatived.

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have listened with great interest to the debate so far this evening, and I do not think that the Paymaster General has been on his best form. I hope that as we proceed further into clause 87, we shall elucidate what the Government are driving at.
<P>
One part of the clause offends against common sensibilities lines 31 to 35 on page 73. I draw attention[Mr. St. Aubyn]
to them to demonstrate their full import. Those lines state that the regulations that the clause promulgates
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) may make different provision for different cases, different circumstances or different periods; and
<P>
(b) may make incidental, consequential, supplemental or transitional provision.</ul></font>
<P>
Words as wide ranging as those have probably never before been used in a clause.
<P>
Instead of allowing such absurdly wide discretion, which has already been commented on so ably by my hon. Friends, amendment No. 124 would replace those lines with some words of restraint that would ensure that, in their anxiety to prevent unfair tax avoidance, the Inland Revenue and the Treasury are not given a general power to do as they please.
<P>
We have heard some interesting statements from the Paymaster General this evening. He said that no one on the Committee favours tax avoidance. In our previous sittings, we spent much time debating the enterprise investment scheme, which has been marketed by the Government as a scheme that will allow those who enter it to avoid tax. When is tax avoidance not tax avoidance? When people invest in pension funds in the UK, they invest in a savings scheme that allows their fund to avoid tax at least they did until this Government came into power, although the scheme can still avoid a significant amount of tax. Indeed, the Government argue that the benefit of ISAs is that they will save the indivdual some tax. When the Paymaster General says that no one on the Committee favours tax avoidance, what exactly does he mean? It is not clear. We think that we know what he means. Would my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge perhaps like to help me?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I doubt that I can, but I have listened carefully to the debate and to what the Paymaster General said. Did my hon. Friend notice that on different occasions the Paymaster General used the three terms "avoidance", "abuse" and "evasion", apparently interchangeably? Is my hon. Friend sure that the Paymaster General has the distinction clear in his mind between avoidance, abuse and evasion?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I think that there is real confusion in the Paymaster General's mind. Would the Paymaster General think it wrong for an indvidual in this country so to arrange his affairs to avoid paying more tax in a foreign jurisdiction, to the benefit of individuals resident in this jurisdiction? Is he against any form of tax avoidance against any legitimate tax authority? It would be helpful if he would answer that question.
<P>
There are legitimate reasons for Governments to promote savings schemes, and for individuals to be allowed to organise their affairs to minimise their tax bills, especially if that has the effect of encouraging savings in this country. In particular this goes to the heart of our amendment where people are not able to take advantage of what we may term mainstream savings schemes such as pension funds or ISAs, other savings vehicles should be available to them so that when they live in this country in retirement, they can enjoy the same income that they may have had if they had pursued a pension scheme while resident here in the normal way.
<P>
What is so pernicious about what the Government propose in the clause is that it will enable them to single out individuals or groups whom they take against and punish them for not following the conventions, forms and investment correctness that they feel to be required. Given the track record of Government Members, it is hard to know what such investment correctness might be at one time or another. To judge by their own activities, one could not divine any consistency whatsover.
<P>
Our amendment is intended to apply what I hope would become a cast-iron rule; I am sure that in the able hands of the parliamentry draftsmen, it could become a golden rule. If we are to have regulation, we do not want regulation as sweeping as that provided by the clause; it should be constrained by certain cast-iron and golden rules. In our somewhat amateur way, we have tried to go down that path by setting out some basic principles of equity. We have tried to set out the idea that people who pursue what may be regarded as a less conventional route should not be automatically condemned as tax avoiders, tax evaders, tax abusers or whatever phrase comes from the top of the head of Ministers but should be allowed to proceed in an honest and fair way to order their savings in the knowledge that whatever the wide-ranging powers of the clause, it is governed by a principle that they should be treated in a reasonably similar way to any other UK citizen. That is their fundamental right, and it is that right that the Government are attacking in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Amendment No. 58 would ensure that the eventual regulations are debated and approved by Parliament.
<P>
We have already noted that the Bill makes greater use of regulations than has ever been the case before, and it uses them in new areas. We all accept that matters of detail, particularly administrative detail, should be delegated to regulations that is only good legislation, especially if those regulations need to change from time to time in the light of experience. It means that the Government do not have to return to the House to amend primary legislation every time changes are necessary.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, how much tax people pay, when they pay it, who pays it, and the circumstances in which they pay it should be the subject of primary legislation. At the very least, it should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Clause 87 gives the Government very wide powers to draw up regulations. There is almost no targeting and the clause is widely drawn. Almost any regulations brought forward on this subject would be within the clause's scope.
<P>
For instance, the annual charge on personal portfolio bonds will be made at a penal rate with no subsequent parliamentary approval or certainly no debate. We feel that that annual charge, which is due to be 15 per cent. on a cumulative basis, regardless of the underlying performance of the bond, is not taxation but a penalty. It is therefore even more important that it is authorised by Parliament.
<P>
Moreover, the regulations will be drawn up by a Department that we know thinks that all holders of these bonds are engaged in artificial avoidance schemes. The House of Lords contradicted that view when it exonerated holders, but we know that the Inland Revenue and the Treasury view them as taking part in an illegitimate avoidance scheme. It is therefore doubly important to subject the final regulations to parliamentary approval.
<P>
Under the clause as drafted, what will be the parliamentary procedure? Will the regulations be made by positive or negative resolution? If, as we suspect, there is no certainty or even likelihood that the regulations will be adequately debated, will the Paymaster General change that and ensure that there is full parliamentary debate before these people are subjected to a tax penalty regime and all that goes with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): It seems to me that the amendment is a way for Opposition Members to ask why the regulations are so unusually widely drawn. In the course of the debate, the reason has become obvious.
<P>
Personal portfolio bonds are not the sort of products that the average grandmother or grandfather buys at the local post office; they are highly specialised, variable products that often have pool funds. They are heterogeneous products with an asset base that is normally unique, and they are therefore very sophisticated. Opposition Members lead us to believe that they are owned by poor old ladies living down the road. It would be interesting to know the profile and nature of those holding the bonds; indeed, the question has already been asked. From a knowledge of the way in which many such products are marketed, it would be reasonable to guess that they are targeted at sophisticated consumers with reasonable amounts of money.
<P>
The Opposition have noted the definitional problem of separating those who blatantly purchase and use bonds to avoid tax from those who legitimately use tax incentives to save for later life and enjoy their retirement. Given that intricate difficulty, my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has made it clear that the Government will allow enough time and consultation and enough of a transition to get their approach right. To do that, he has to cast his regulations widely in the way that is defined in the Bill.
<P>
The Opposition harry my hon. Friend although he obviously laughs about the definition of who is avoiding tax. They understand the difficulty of definitions, but they do not accept that, to get them right, we must have a reasonably wide opportunity to set regulations in the light of consultation. Instead, we have had to face the latest of three bizarre amendments, which says that we must treat everybody the same. The amendments would ensure that the Government could not administer the law

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I will [Hon. Members: "Give way."] The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge knows that I will give way in a moment.
<P>
There is an in-built inconsistency in the Opposition's approach; they are attempting to draw up legislation in such a way that it will inevitably fail. As we all know, this is a complex issue. That explains why the previous Government failed in their litigation and legislation and in the case law about which we have heard. That is why we have drawn up the legislation in its current form in the present exceptional circumstance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be perfectly compatible with his comments to provide a requirement in the Bill that the clause target those who seek to avoid tax in an unacceptable way and then to allow regulations precisely to define how avoidance will be specified?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The strategy that has been adopted is the correct one [Laughter.] I am sorry, but both sides of the Committee recognise that there is a problem. That is why the previous Government considered the matter. They failed abysmally to deal with it, and now we have to take advice from their remnants. The new Government have confronted the problem in a more realistic way that will involve consultation with the consumer community.
<P>
We all know that bonds are highly varied and sophisticated and, in many instances, geared to tax avoidance. The regulations are, therefore, set to embrace a wider strategy, and I wish my hon. Friend great success in pursuing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We have had several late-night contributions from the curio corner of the Committee. The one thing about which we can be sure regarding the previous contribution is that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central was not coached by the Paymaster General.
<P>
I want to speak in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford on the consistency of the regulations that need to be made under the clause. Consistency is demanded at one important point. In the light of the previous speech, I can understand why the Paymaster General is staring at the ceiling, but I should like his attention for a moment. The agency relationships under subsection (7)(b) need to be clarified and made more definite. Given the way in which the subsection is worded, the choice of agents could lead us into considerable difficulty. It might be better if subsection (7)(b) required that the policy holder make the nomination rather than a person acting on his behalf as an agent. I am sure that the Paymaster General would want to avoid the creation of a chain of agencies.
<P>
That is one example of how the regulations could be made more consistent in the treatment of bond holders and of people with other, similar investments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Member for Sevenoaks makes a valid point about subsection (7)(b), and I shall look at the matter carefully.
<P>
The leitmotif of Conservative Members' critique of the Budget from day one has been the question of how much is to be delegated to secondary legislation and[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
how much is to be subject to negative rather than affirmative resolution procedure. I assure the Committee that there has been no shift in the Revenue's general approach to such matters. The Government have not suggested a wish to take a different view on the relative balances and advantages of primary and secondary legislation; nor has the Revenue sought to achieve greater powers in respect of secondary legislation.
<P>
I have said, earlier this afternoon and at previous sittings, that legislation has become increasingly complex, with a huge volume of technical regulations to be worked out. The consultative process that regulatory arrnagements make possible is not wholly bad.
<P>
Conservative Members should reflect for a second and set aside their collective amnesia. When PEPs were introduced it took two or three goes to get them right. If this Government had done the same with ISAs, it would have needed two or three sets of legislation to get them right, rather than a period of genuine consultation.
<P>
Equally, it is clear that the previous Conservative Government delegated much wider powers to secondary legislation and to the negative resolution procedure. That exposes the hollowness of the Conservative criticisms, although I know that an element among professional tax experts has suggested that the Revenue has made a deliberate, concerted decision to concentrate more provisions in secondary regulation than in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall just get this matter on the record and then give way.
<P>
In 1990, the previous Conservative Government introduced two short provisions. The first gave the Treasury power to amend the entire chapter of the Taxes Act dealing with insurance companies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where they think it expedient to do so in consequence of the exercise of any power"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under the Insurance Companies Act 1982. The power is so wide that it appears draconian. It gives the impression that the former Government had absolute power and absolute discretion, although they were working with the same Department and officials as are we.
<P>
The second provision allows the Treasury to amend any of the provisions of a schedule about overseas life assurance business whenever it feels like it. It is not obliged to give a reason for doing so. Those two powers are much wider than anything in the Bill. In both cases, the primary legislation provides that the regulations be laid using the negative resolution procedures.
<P>
The Bill represents no seismic change in the approach to legislation.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I know that disquiet exists, and I am trying to be serious about it. Although Conservative members may not be so serious, the matters are so complex that we have to deal with them reasonably and pragmatically.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment. I should like to put this on the record for the future reference of Opposition Members. The chapter and verse on both of those points derives from section 431A in schedule 1(9)AA of the Taxes Act 1988.
<P>
I give way to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Paymaster General is trying to make the point that regulations have been used to affect tax changes under previous Administrations. However, the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants do not agree. The Institute of Chartered Accountants states, in reference to clause 87:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a new and unwelcome development for substantive issues to be dealt with in this way."</ul></font>
<P>
The key words are "new" and "unwelcome", especially "new". That is the practitioners' assessment and they are professionals who have experienced, over the course of many years, different Administrations using regulations for various types of changes. What does the Paymaster General say to that?
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman exactly what I say to that. We must wait to see the outcome of the consultative process with the professional bodies they may change their minds. An ex cathedra statement from them has no greater value than an ex cathedra statement from those on the Opposition Benches or from the Government Front Bench. It is the opinion of one person, who expressed it so as to attract the publicity that he has managed to achieve for himself in this distinguished Committee.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
Why did the distinguished practitioner have nothing to say in 1993 about the new regulations governing the deduction of PAYE from employees' wages and salaries under the negative resolution procedure? Those regulations were passed by the previous Conservative Government. They affected tens of millions of people, and involved tens of billions of pounds of tax. In comparison with that, the subject matter of clause 87 is very small beer.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Guildford in a moment.
<P>
Why was the practitioner not so voluble and vocal in his opposition to the previous Government? Nothing new is occurring: There is no sea change. We should deal with the matter realistically, and I urge Conservative Members to drop this rather silly, inflated theme that they have tried to develop regarding the Inland Revenue and the Government. [Interruption.] They are a chorus when one turns, they all turn, like lemmings. [Hon. Members: "They are all wrong."] Yes, usually they are wrong. I give way to the hon. Member for Guildford.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose [Interruption.]</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I understand and sympathise with the reaction of my hon. Friends to the almost unbelievable display of arrogance that we have just witnessed from Labour Members. We have heard the usual litany about regulations that were passed by the previous Government. Can the Paymaster General identify any occasion prior to this Budget on which a senior partner in a major firm of accountants has described the proposed use of regulations as being unconstitutional?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not particularly want to listen to some highly paid tax expert's view on constitutional matters. Nothing that the Government propose would be unconstitutional I am certain of that. I am also certain that the practices and procedures that are implicit in the Bill are more restrictive in their nature than was the case in some of the measures passed by previous Governments, who took to themselves powers that they should not have done. We shall not fall into that trap, which stemmed from the arrogance of power. I would never be party to that. I have continued to impress on the Committee that this is nothing new, but Opposition Members repeat the same old thesis. We cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give an example of past statutory instruments that have set a rate of tax? I refer him to new subsection 553B(3)(f), which provides that the Treasury will have the power to make regulations setting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the rate or rates at which the tax is to be charged".</UL></FONT>
<P>
What rate of tax do the Government intend to impose on personal portfolio bonds? It would be helpful to know.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Those are questions to be dealt with in the consultative period on the regulations and I do not propose to get into them at this late hour. We have made it absolutely clear that we are open to serious discussions about definitions and transitions and all matters that could affect people who did not realise that they had entered into unacceptable arrangements we do not find them acceptable, and the previous Government did not find them acceptable. We are committed to dealing with the problem. If the Opposition press the amendment to the vote, we shall resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcote-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General did not answer my specific question about what parliamentary procedures are to be followed under the clause. It is a simple question. We all know what should be done they should be debated fully in due course. The hon. Gentleman did not even give us his own proposals.
<P>
There has been a step change in the use of regulations, which has been widely commented on by responsible outside practitioners. They all noticed that the Government are increasingly using regulations, not for administrative changes in how taxes are to be collected, but, for example, to set tax rates. If the Paymaster General believes that the rate of tax that our constituents are to pay should not be subjected to some parliamentary procedure, he is not doing his duty as an elected representative.
<P>
I make a modest plea: when the Government use compulsory powers of taxation to relieve our constituents of their money, Parliament should debate and approve it. That is the essence of the reason that Parliament came into existence. In very controversial circumstances many years ago, the House of Commons obtained that power from the Executive. We do not want to give it up but we will do, unless we object to clauses whereby, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor regis and Littlehampton said, the rate or rates of tax to be charged are to be smuggled through in Treasury regulations which might not even be subject to any parliamentary procedures at all the Paymaster General will not tell us. Perhaps some official in the Treasury will write them down, and they will then assume the force of law. Even if the hon. Gentleman will not accept our amendment, will he say what parliamentary procedure he envisages?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that they will be subject to negative resolution in the House in the normal way. If I did not make that clear, I apologise to him; on reflection, however, he may realise that I made it absolutely clear.
<P>
I refrained from making comparisons with the previous Government. The right hon. Gentleman had many distinguished reasons for resigning, one of which may well have been that Government's record on negative and affirmative resolutions. If he has forgotten, I remind him that in 1994-95 there were 42 negative resolutions and 15 affirmative resolutions. In the following year, although the ratio was already unbalanced, there were 69 negative and three affirmative resolutions. We need no lectures from the Opposition, nor their continuing silly arguments about these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> In a moment. We want good consultation on the matters that everyone in the Committee including the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham admits need to be dealt with. The way to do that is not to enshrine everything in primary legislation, but to get down to some pains-taking, nitty-gritty discussions with practitioners.
<P>
Perhaps the Opposition do not want that. One of the reasons behind their views may be that it would be so difficult to do such a thing in primary legislation that it is easier to do nothing at all. I do not know what their motivations are. Clearly, detailed tax policy matters are best worked out by consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General has quoted some figures giving the relative numbers of positive and negative resolutions in different years. Does he happen to have the figures handy for the first year of his Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that I am correct in saying that the ratio is better already, which is a trend in the right direction. The hon. Gentleman can check the figures and will see that in ratio terms of positive and negative resolutions, we are already doing better if that is to be taken as a measure of how appropriately legislation is drafted. I do not accept that there is an absolute[Mr. Robinson]
measure I use the figures merely to show Opposition Members, who wish to make something of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I cannot give way any more. I have given way so much and it is unfair on the Committee to give way again. If the Opposition are serious about the issue, why did they do nothing about it when they were in government? If they are not serious about it, why do we continue to have these tiresome arguments? I advise the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am sorry that the Paymaster General finds explaining his own clauses tiresome. It is one of the duties of Treasury Ministers to come to the House to defend the legislation that they have introduced. It is a measure of the arrogance displayed by the Paymaster General throughout the debate that he is now confessing that he finds that duty tiresome. Let me make it very clear to him that he will be a little more tired by the time he is finished with this Bill.
<P>
The Paymaster General has dodged two important points. First, he has quoted numbers and ratios on regulations laid under previous Finance Bills, which you may have participated in, Mr. Butterfill, in another, humbler capacity; but he has not addressed the central point levelled at him by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that these regulations set the rate of tax. Perhaps the Paymaster General will now give the Committee the real figures for the number of regulations laid by the previous Government, allowing them to set a rate of tax by regulation, rather than primary statute. That is the proposal, under clause 87, to which we take the greatest exception.
<P>
Secondly, the Paymaster General suggested that we were somehow standing in the way of good consultation. We look forward to consultation. A point that we have been emphasising since 10.30 on Tuesday morning is that the Paymaster General has not even done the Committee the courtesy of producing the draft regulations. The consultation that he is talking about has not begun because he has not even published the draft regulations for us and outside bodies to consider. It is not good enough for him to say that these regulations are entirely similar to regulations made under previous Finance Bills.
<P>
These regulations set the rate of tax. They will not have been produced in draft before the substantive clause is passed into legislation. Those are two very good reasons why the Committee should press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I rose slowly in the hope that the Paymaster General might answer those questions and I am rather surprised that he has not done so. Perhaps he simply cannot be bothered. [Hon. Members: "Too tiresome.] He said earlier that he would not reveal the Government's thinking on what the rate of tax should be. Yet, their press release No. 38 on 17 March, referring to personal portfolio bonds states that under the Budget proposals there will be an additional tax charge on a deemed gain equal to 15 per cent. of the sum of the total premiums paid up to the end of each policy year. That statement is not the Bill, in a draft regulation, or something that we in the Committee are deemed worthy to hear; it is in a press release, which is a different matter. We know that we have a Government who love spin and feed on it. The Treasury has earned the soubriquet "the Grosvenor House gang", and, with its spin doctors, acolytes and cronies, has taken it upon itself to run this country's affairs from a different part of town altogether. That is how far we are from the democratic procedure that we want to instal and protect with our amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I believe that there was a scheme to turn some of the Treasury buildings into luxury residential accommodation, but it appears that the Paymaster General has reversed that policy by turning the running of the Treasury into a luxury accommodation of his own. That is the extent to which he has a contempt for the procedure, the Committee and the values that we are proposing in our amendments.
<P>
There is a wider principle that goes beyond even the traditions and beliefs of Parliament, which is the fundamental principle of justice that people are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Yet, someone who has chosen to invest and save through a personal portfolio bond will be presumed guilty with no appeal consultation, perhaps, but no appeal. There is no sense of justice whatsoever.
<P>
One of the Paymaster General's colleagues in the Department of Social Security is a firm advocate of self-help. He wants people to put more money aside for their retirement. Yet, when people have done so in good faith, with good reason and with every expectation that they will be treated fairly, they are treated as pariahs what a message that sends to people trying to plan their long-term future.
<P>
I regret that our attempts to get a reasonable response from the Paymaster General have fallen on deaf ears. Had he been just a little more constuctive, our language would not have been so strong, but it is not only the Opposition who will be condemning the Paymaster General after tonight's performance.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause is intended to undo some of the damaging measures implemented by the Labour Budget last July. It provides that an element of section 30 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997 would cease to have effect. That measure did an enormous amount of damage to the pension fund industry and to people who have pension funds.

At a dinner attended by the pensions Minister, the chairman of the Association of Consulting Actuaries, Paul Thornton, delivered a damning speech on that measure, which will be repealed by the clause. He said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Whilst the Chancellor may have felt he had the opportunity to withdraw the tax credit, these quite troublesome ramifications were clearly not thought through at the time of the Mini-Budget. Frankly they should have ... the message which I have for the Government is they must stop loosening the foundations on which the hitherto robust system of Occupational Schemes is built."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are now seeking to mitigate the damage done by that measure by providing that for five years until 2004 it will not apply to friendly societies. Why have the Government singled out that group for special treatment? Why does clause 88 not apply to occupational pension funds generally? What is so special about that group that does not apply to others? Indeed, why does the clause not apply to pensioners? I hope that on Report the Paymaster General will introduce measures to deal with non-taxpaying individuals. Why has the Paymaster General singled out that group, and what will be the cost of doing so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been vocal since our first Budget last year dealt with the anomalies of tax credits, the ACT system and all the other imbalances in the tax system that lead to the payment of dividends rather than to investment. Therefore, I should have thought that he would welcome the clause; it will put friendly societies on the same footing as ISAs. The principle of parity between the two will allow friendly societies five years to adjust to the new provisions. The role that they perform in the financial services business entitles them to that period of adjustment.

Instead of challenging us, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton should welcome the clause. However, he may want to reopen debate on the two stages of the historic corporate tax reform that the Government have pushed through. It will create long-term advantages. The Opposition's regular scaremongering suggests that the reform will plunge the corporate tax system, the financial system and the stock market into crisis. However, it has been generally welcomed. In particular, the CBI welcomed the second stage on ACT. The general reaction of corporations throughout the country recognised that reforms were long overdue and should have been carried out in the so-called final phase of the previous Government their final four or five years when they did nothing.
<P>
We are introducing reforms, and the allowances that we have made for ISAs and for friendly societies have been widely welcomed. The attitude of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is curmudgeonly. He is trying to reopen a debate that he has already lost. I strongly commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The £5 billion smash-and-grab raid on Britain's pension funds is not popular and has not been widely welcomed. It has been condemned because[Mr. Gibb]
many people will have to put higher contributions into their pension funds to make up the difference. If they do not, they will suffer when they retire. They will have lower-value pensions because of the Government's theft of retirement funds. If the Paymaster General believes that the measure is bad for friendly societies, why cannot he accept that it is bad for pension funds in general?

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am curious about this clause. As I understand it, it will have retrospective effect. Payments of tax that would normally fall to expire in 1998 the Inland Revenue would not be able to claw them back after that are now to be subjected to a further year of vulnerability, during which time the Inland Revenue might clause them back.
<P>
The clause extends the Inland Revenue's ability to claw back tax in respect of accounting periods ending before 1 July 1992 for one more year until 1 July 1999. It is extraordinary to put such a narrow and limited provision into the Bill that I wonder whether there is a special reason for it. Is the Inland Revenue targeting a particular victim or company from whom it wants to claw tax back? Does it want the provision extended for another year because it cannot claw that tax back by July 1998? If there is a special reason for the measure, will the Paymaster General tell us what it is?
<P>
I understand that as a result of the clause, after 1 July 1999, a general provision will allow the Inland Revenue to do what it is now trying to do during the year July 1998 to July 1999. The clause is therefore special and targeted, and I should like to understand why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> It may help the Committee if I briefly outline what the clause will do and then reply to the hon. Gentleman, who clearly has an interest in it.
<P>
The clause extends the time limit for recovering income tax and tax credits that have been over-repaid to insurance companies carrying on pension business. It will apply only when the amount over-repaid cannot be ascertained until more than six years after the end of the relevant accounting period. I shall explain its more narrow purpose in a moment. What is being said may not please the hon. Gentleman, but it is clear why it is being said. The clause may also affect friendly societies carrying on pension business or tax-exempt life business.
<P>
The repayments in question are those that the company or society can claim during an accounting period in respect of pension and exempt business income. The claims are, necessarily, estimated, and it can take many year to ascertain the correct amount to which the company is entitled. At present, an assessment to recover excessive repayments can be made only within six years after the end of the accounting period. At the same time, it cannot be made before the correct tax liability for the period has been established. A delay in settling the liability could therefore have the absurd result that the excessive repayment could never be recovered. The new rule extends the time limit to the end of the accounting period following that in which the amount of over-repayment is finally determined. A similar rule already exists in relation to periods that will be affected by self-assessment for companies. The clause therefore provides a welcome measure of compatibility between the two systems.
<P>
The inability to recover an over-repayment in such circumstances would represent an entirely unjust enrichment of the companies affected. I am not suggesting that companies have deliberately dragged their feet over settling their tax liabilities, but leaving the law as it is would give them a strong incentive to do so. Removing that incentive and making it clear that we need the extra time that the clause specifies will encourage companies to behave well. The clause should be welcomed by the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 89 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
