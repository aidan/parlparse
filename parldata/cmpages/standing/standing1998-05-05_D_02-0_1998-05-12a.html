<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>

<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/158/1998158.htm">Data Protection Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: Before we start, I remind the </B><P>
Committee that there are financial resolutions in 
connection with the Bill, copies of which are available 
in the Room. Furthermore, I remind hon. Members that 
adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a 
general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call 
starred amendments, including any that we reach during 
the Committee's afternoon sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> On a point of order, 
Mr. Stevenson. First, may I welcome you to the Chair? I 
imagine that you will chair large parts of our proceedings 
in tandem with Mr. Welsh. I am not seeking to be 
difficult, but simply to be as constructive as possible. Two 
of the amendments in the fourth group that we shall be 
asked to consider under clause 1 relate to clause 1. The 
remainder, however, which are extremely technical as is 
the whole Bill relate to clauses 63, 64 and 65 and to 
schedules 8 to 14. They make significant changes to the 
Bill's format.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will give us a detailed 
explanation of the amendments, and we look forward to 
it. I am not saying that we should debate the issues again 
when we reach the relevant part of the Bill, but could we 
at least return to some of them then? That would help the 
Committee's progress and enable members on both sides 
to get their minds round the Government's decision to 
introduce the changes. Rather than delay ourselves 
unnecessarily this morning, could we return to aspects 
about which we are concerned when we reach the relevant 
part of the Bill? That would enable us and people outside 
the House to consider the implications of the changes with 
the benefit of a little more time.
<P>
When we reach the amendments, we will not have had 
the opportunity of studying notes on clauses. We will 
simply have the Minister's words this morning, and it will 
be two or three days before we see them in print. It would 
be helpful if you could give us some guidance on the 
opportunities that we might have to consider some of the 
issues in the amendments later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is up to Committee members what 
contributions they put on the record, provided that they 
are in line with the amendment paper. I am in the hands 
of Committee members. I take the hon. Gentleman's 
point, but, subject to the course of the debate, Committee 
members may have a stand part debate on any clause, 
new clause or schedule that we reach. That gives them an 
opportunity to make further points, provided that debates 
are not repeated to a degree that would irk the Chairman.



<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to you for that 
explanation, Mr. Stevenson. I am sure that members of 
the Committee found it extremely helpful.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Basic interpretative provisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No.1, in 
page 1, line 8, after `information', insert`, including 
visual images,'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the 
following amendments:
<P>
No. 10, in page 2, line 19, after `information', insert 
`or any visual image'.
<P>
No. 12, in page 2, line 23, after `information', insert 
`or any visual image'.
<P>
No. 13, in page 2, line 26, after `information', insert 
`or any visual image'.
<P>
No. 14, in page 2, line 27, after `information', insert 
`or any visual image'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The first group of amendments, like 
most of those that we shall consider under clause 1, seeks 
to probe definition and meaning a little more. I do not 
intend to make a habit of going over matters that were 
discussed in another place. The Committee will mostly 
discuss other matters. The amendments, and the next 
group of amendments on the selection paper, were 
debated. On reading Hansard, I felt that some questions 
were not entirely answered and that the Committee should 
consider some of them.
<P>
The amendments relate to the definition of 
"information", which it may he helpful to expand. 
Amendment No. 1 would add the words, "including visual 
images". All such terms mean different things to different 
people. In the House of Lords, it was asked whether 
pictures and information caught on closed circuit 
television cameras were included in the Bill's definition 
of "information". Much debate focused on whether the 
definition of processing, holding or storing data includes 
such pictures. The question of whether such visual images 
are caught within the definition of "information" was not 
entirely dealt with. That is an important matter, on which 
the Committee should ponder.
<P>
The question of encrypted data is also relevant. Much 
of the Bill involves development in technology. 
Increasingly, data may be stored in a form that looks like 
sheer gobbledegook. Is all such data caught by the general 
definition of "information"? The Minister may well say 
that all the best legal advice states that it is. The 
Committee should ask whether anybody else reading the 
Bill will understand the definition. During consideration 
of the sittings motion, I said that the Opposition were 
seeking to involve the minds of users of the legislation,
 especially in the commercial sector, in relation to whether 
the visual image is caught by the definition of 
"information".
<P>
It is worth bearing in mind that the Government 
amended the Bill by including the word, "information" in 
the definition of "processing". The clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`processing', in relation to information or data, means obtaining, 
recording or holding the information or data".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word "information" was added in another place. Lord 
Craig of Radley, who is a member of the House of Lords 
Science and Technology Committee, and Lord Flowers, 
who is an eminent academic in the fields of science and 
technology, expressed concerns about the matter. It would 
be helpful if visual images were caught within the 
definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North-East):</B> Will 
the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was about to finish. The Minister 
should speak first, and the Committee may return to the 
matter.
<P>
<B></B><P>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the 
Home Department (Mr. George Howarth): As the hon. 
Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) rightly said, the 
amendments explore the nature of information covered by 
the Bill. He said that they are essentially probing 
amendments. When I have spoken, perhaps he will tell the 
Committee whether he intends them to remain as probing 
amendments, or whether they will become matters of 
principle.



<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale wanted to know whether 
the Bill applied to pictures as well as to verbal 
information. I assure him absolutely that it does. The word 
"data" is defined to cover information that is processed or 
recorded in certain ways. That information can be verbal, 
visual or in some other form.
<P>
Three criteria limit the information involved: first, that 
it is processed automatically; secondly, that it is recorded 
with the intention that it should be processed 
automatically; and thirdly, that it is, in effect, part of a 
relevant filing system. Such a system would include the 
type of manual record described in the Bill.
<P>
For data to be covered by the Bill they must relate to 
a living, identifiable individual. That is the effect of the 
definition of personal data. The hon. Member for Ryedale 
asked whether encrypted data were covered. the answer is 
yes, provided that they meet the criteria in the relevant 
definitions. The fact that a piece of information is 
encrypted does not mean that it ceases to be information. 
If the controller as defined in the Bill has the 
encryption key, or if that key is likely to come into his 
possession, then encrypted information may come under 
the Bill's definition of personal data.
<P>
I hope that that explanation reassures the hon. 
Gentleman and that he does not feel it necessary to press 
the amendments. I know that the House of Lords debate 
dealt with some matters very thoroughly, and that my 
noble Friend Lord Williams, for instance, spoke in detail 
about closed circuit television.
<P>
I agree with the hon. member for Ryedale that there is 
no need to repeat the Hansard coverage of the Lords 
debates, but it would be clear to anyone reading that 
report that the debates dealt with the matters that he has 
raised in depth. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept 
that visual images are covered by the Bill and that no 
problem such as he described will arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. As I 
made clear, the amendments have no great substance and 
I have no intention of pressing them to a vote. I thought 
that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. 
White) was about to intervene when I sat down, but he is 
obviously happy with the Minister's reply.
<P>
It is important during our proceedings that we 
remember that people outside the House, who will have 
to use the provisions of the Bill every day, must 
understand what it covers. The purpose of many of the 
amendments that we have tabled is to secure a proper 
explanation of what the Bill means. I am happy to accept 
what the Minister has said, and am ready to move on.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment no. 2, in 
page 1, line 10, leave out "automatically".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following 
amendments: No. 9, in page 2, line 16, leave out 
"automatically".
<P>
No. 30, in clause 7, page 5, line 14, leave out "by 
automatic means".
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This amendment is similar to those in 
the previous group. It questions whether the word 
"automatically" is required in the definition of the 
information being processed. In a later part of the Bill, 
the word "automatically" has a significant meaning in 
relation to data that is, in cases where decisions may be 
taken about an individual purely on the basis of the 
automatic processing of certain information.
<P>
I have looked at the issue in some detail and discussed 
it with senior members of the Data Protection Registrar's 
staff. They agree that the word "automatically" is not 
necessarily appropriate, because it may imply that no 
human intervention is involved. During the debate in the 
other place, Lord Williams said that the use of the word 
"automatically" enables people to differentiate between 
what is manual and what is not manual. However, in 
reality, much data processing involves both of those.
<P>
<H5></H5>
</P>
10.15 am

<P>
The Bill puts the concept of the manual records within 
the ambit of data protection supervision. Given that it will 
be at least another 15 years before we return to this matter, 
is the differentiation between manual and non-manual 
required? We do not know how technology will develop 
in the future. I have heard that it is already possible to 
talk into equipment in which everything is stored and 
processed. One might describe that as automatic. 
However, I am not sure that the word "automatically" is 
necessary in such a context. The record of the debate in 
the House of Lords suggests that the participants were not 
entirely convinced of that.



<P>
We need a clear explanation of the significance of the 
word "automatic". Is there likely to be an unexpected or 
unanticipated change not in respect of the automatic 
processing of personal data, which we shall come to later, 
but purely in terms of the Bill's definition of what is being 
processed? If information is being processed by means of 
equipment, that must be in response to given instructions. 
Might the use of the word "automatically" lead people to 
conclude that future technological changes may fall 
outside the Bill's definition? This a probing amendment 
by which we seek to ensure that the Bill's definitions are 
correct. That is also the underlying objective of many of 
the Minister's amendments.

<P>

<P>
<b>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's 
Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b> The hon. Member 
for Ryedale has explained that the amendments relate to 
the inclusion in the Bill of the words "automatic" or 
"automatically", which are important in legislation about 
data protection. People often use the shorthand term 
"computerised data" but, as the hon. Member for Ryedale 
would accept, that is just one type of automatically 
processed data. The introduction of digital technology 
means that many more types of information processing 
come under the scope of the term. Nowadays, for 
example, CCTV could well be included in a definition of 
processed information. The use of the word, "automatic" 
and its various derivatives is not new to this area of the 
law. It is widely used term which is well understood, both 
in our law and in various international instruments. The 
Council of Europe convention on data protection, on 
which our 1984 legislation was based, talks about "data 
undergoing automatic processing" and defines that term 
by reference to operations carried out "by automated 
means". The data protection directive, to which the Bill 
gives effect, also refers to processing by "automatic 
means".
<P>
Thus, the concept of processing being carried out "by 
automatic means" or "automatically" is an essential 
feature of the definition of the activity on which data 
protection law has been focused. There is nothing new in 
the precise form of words that the Bill uses. It reproduces, 
virtually word for word, a similar definition in the Data 
Protection Act 1984, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`Data' means information recorded in a form in which it can be 
processed by equipment operating automatically in response to 
instructions given for that purpose".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far as I am aware, that definition has given rise to no 
difficulty in the 14 or so years since the 1984 Act came 
into effect. It is a tried and tested formula, which captures 
precisely what the Bill is intended to cover, and the 
Government see no good reason for changing it.
<P>
In the light of that historical survey of the use of the 
word "automatic" and its derivatives, I hope that the hon. 
Member for Ryedale will feel able to withdraw his 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 is a little more complex. It deals 
with the underlying logic of processes where the decision 
is in effect taken by a machine in credit referencing, for 
example. It is important that such decisions are reviewed 
carefully by human agency, if I may use that term.
<P>
The problem with the amendment is that it would break 
the link between clause 7(1)(d) and clause 13 it would 
extend the right to information about logic underlying 
decision making to human-made as well as machine-made 
decisions. The clause is designed to provide a safeguard 
in respect of decisions that have been taken automatically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> With which clause is clause 13 linked?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government are concerned that 
accepting amendment No. 30 would mean breaking the 
link between clause 7(1)(d) and clause 13. I am sorry if I 
was less than clear.
<P>
It is very important as I hope Opposition Members 
will accept that where a machine takes a decision by 
an automatic process, there is the possibility of human 
intervention to supervise the underlying logic of the 
process by which the machine takes that decision. 
Unfortunately, amendment No. 30 would change the basis 
on which individuals could have access to that logic. It is 
important to make a distinction between decisions that 
are taken automatically by machines and those taken by 
human beings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister is right. Initially, I also 
looked at clause 13 and the phrase "by automatic means". 
I entirely understand the Minister's point that clause 
7(1)(d) and clause 13(1) are linked. That is a different 
point, however, although I am glad that the Minister 
raised it. To delete the words "by automatic means" in 
clause 13 would wreck the meaning of the clause. That is 
not our intention. The point is whether the word 
"automatically" is required in the general definition.



<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I 
anticipate that his reasoning and logic in this case will 
lead him to beg leave of the Committee to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We have had the benefit of exploring 
the issue again in Committee and having on record the 
Minister's view that the definition is adequate. Therefore, 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in 
page 1, line 11, after "intention", insert "or likelihood".
<P>
We come now to a slightly different issue, although 
there is a similarity in that we wish to ensure that we get 
the meaning right. The hon. Member for Ashfield
(Mr. Hoon), will be well aware of my point: as a former 
police officer, whenever I see in statute the word 
"intention" and the requirement to prove intention, there 
is a little sigh in one's heart. That is a burden of proof 
on which the courts deliberate at great length indeed, at 
greater length than I suspect we shall do this morning. 
The guilt or otherwise of many individuals stand or falls 
on the question of intention.
<P>
Throughout the Bill, not just in this provision, the 
question arises whether intention alone is strong enough 
or whether it would be better to add the caveat, "or 
likelihood" that information should be processed. I seek 
to cover every eventuality and to improve the definition.
<P>
Having made a solo effort in trying to understand the 
Bill, I am not clear exactly what the Government intend 
by their inclusion of the word, "intention". Do they wish 
to cover all eventualities in which people store 
information that will effectively be processed by various 
types of equipment, whatever those will be in the future, 
or is there a requirement that there will be a clear intention 
that it will be processed before any data are caught? The 
fact that the Bill brings together manual and automatic 
data is another reason to pause for thought.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With Committee members' 
forgiveness, I suppose that having a former police officer 
and lawyers on the same Committee does lead to some 
confusion. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale very fairly 
began his explanation by referring to the burden of proof. 
The purpose of establishing the burden of proof is to 
provide certainty. The Government's purpose in resisting 
the amendment is to ensure that we preserve the certainty 
that is set out in the Bill as it stands. The hon. Gentleman 
said that the amendment is designed to deal with every 
eventuality. The trouble with trying to do that is that it 
leads to considerable uncertainty. I hope that he will 
accept from me that the Government's purpose in 
resisting his amendment and keeping the words in the Bill 
is to avoid the uncertainty that would inevitably lead to 
expense for those who have to deal with its complex 
technical terms. I shall try to explain the reasoning in 
greater detail.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 raises the question of the Bill's 
application to non-automated information in other 
words, to manual records. I am sure that we shall discuss 
the central definition of what we mean by "relevant filing 
system". The specific question now is whether 
information that may or may not be destined for a relevant 
filing system is data for the Bill's purposes. I deliberately 
say "may or may not be destined" because that relates to 
the question raised by the amendment.
<P>
Information must be destined for a relevant filing 
system to be caught by the Bill. That is why the relevant 
part of the definition of data refers to the intention that 
the information should form part of a relevant filing 
system. The intention in question is that of the data 
controller.



<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> Does the Minister recognise that many of 
us who had to implement the 1984 Act when it was 
introduced went far wider than we needed to because of 
the word "intention". If we introduce the word 
"likelihood", we shall cause confusion. The present 
wording gives those who have to implement the measures 
full scope to include all data.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</b> That is a helpful intervention. As I tried to explain at the outset, the Government's purpose in 
resisting the amendment is to ensure that there is a degree 
of certainty for those who have to operate the legislation.
<P>
Clearly, there are certain obligations on data 
controllers. If they fail to meet them, they are liable to 
civil and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. Data subjects 
will be able to seek compensation from them, which is 
quite right. It is, however, also right that the demands that 
the Bill makes of data controllers should be reasonable 
because of the obligations on them. Among other things, 
that means that they should be in a position to make 
informed decisions and to control what happens. We can 
help them achieve that by making it clear in the definition 
that information is intended for a relevant filing system. 
That will ensure that the controller knows what will 
happen he will have an intention and will be able to take 
all appropriate data protection action.
<P>
Adding the words in the amendment would weaken that 
approach. Under the amendment, it would be sufficient 
for it to be likely that information would be included in a 
relevant filing system for the data protection regime, with 
all its obligations and sanctions, to be triggered. That is 
too uncertain a test and would put additional burdens on 
controllers without introducing real additional benefits for 
data subjects. That is the point that my hon. Friend the 
Member for Milton Keynes, North -East has just made. I 
do not believe that that is the effect that the hon. Member 
for Ryedale wants to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It might be better if I deal with this 
matter in a short intervention before the Minister sits 
down. Earlier in his remarks, he used the phrase, "must 
be destined for a relevant filing system". It would be 
helpful for those who have to implement the measures if 
we were absolutely clear about what he meant, and I am 
grateful to the hon. Member for Milton-Keynes, 
North-East for his comments.
<P>
Is the Minister saying that the Bill would not catch the 
collection of information unless the data that was being 
processed, kept and built up was destined to be part of 
some relevant filing system? Would it be caught the 
moment that there was an intention for it to be processed?
<P>
We can all think of circumstances in which information 
that was to be available to an organisation might not be 
structured in a way that would come within the definition 
of a relevant filing system. That information would, 
however, be caught the moment that there was an 
intention for it to become part of a relevant filing 
system that is the key point about the phrase, "must be 
destined". It might not have been intended at the time that 
the information would go into a filing system, but it might 
subsequently do so. Is the Minister saying that it would 
be caught at that point?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am always conscious that 
interventions can expedite our proceedings, but I am sure 
that hon. Members will agree that they need to be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I am grateful to 
the hon. Member for Ryedale for his exposition. I do not 
want to oversimplify matters, but perhaps he would do 
better to concentrate on the question of the intention of 
the data controller when the information is collected. That 
is what is relevant, because the data protection regime will 
apply if the data controller intends that information to be 
included in a relevant filing system. It will not apply if 
the controller does not so intend.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Ryedale is worried 
about how people in business deal with such matters. The 
Government recognise the need for certainty, and the 
benefits and burdens placed on those who control data. 
That is why it is important that we proceed in the manner 
set out in the Bill. A weaker definition of intention would 
bring in all the dangers described earlier by my hon. 
Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East that 
those who control data will not be clear about which data 
they should be responsible for collecting, nor about which 
data incur the various obligations to the data's subjects.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer (Broxtowe):</B> Data may have been 
collected in the past with no intention that they should be 
placed on computer. However, it is not uncommon for an 
organisation with the appropriate advanced technology to 
decide to scan those data into a computer, with a view to 
processing the information in the future. Is my hon. Friend 
saying that that would be a complete defence against a 
requirement to be covered by data protection legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I think 
that the logical time to deal with such questions will be 
when we reach the provisions covering manual data. The 
proposals represent a significant change, and it would be 
sensible to deal with all the questions related to manual 
data when we reach them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not entirely sure that I am 100 
per cent. convinced. The hon. Member for Broxtowe
(Dr. Palmer) put his finger on the question uppermost in 
the minds of Conservative Members. I accept that my 
intervention was too long, but it was worth it for what we 
learned from the Minister's reply.
<P>
I could not agree more that businesses should not be 
caught unnecessarily within the scope of the data 
protection regime. It may seem a rather twisted approach, 
but that is why we are tabling some of the amendments. 
We do not want the Bill to be worse for businesses; we 
want to clarify what the Bill means and covers. I raised 
the question of the burden of proof because, as the 
Minister said, we shall discover as we progress through 
the Bill that offences can be committed and that 
individuals need to be protected.
<P>
I remain slightly sceptical about the fact that, although 
data can be used to the detriment of individuals, the 
person who collected that information can claim that he 
never intended it to be structured or placed in a relevant 
filing system. A person who does not seek approval from, 
or give notice to, the data protection commissioner about 
the processing of data can say, by way of excuse, "But I 
never intended that the data would be processed as part 
of a relevant filing system."
<P>
I suspect that we shall return to that question later, but 
I shall not press the amendment. I am grateful to the 
Minister for his explanation, and for his assurance that 
certainty is important to the Government. The Opposition 
agree. I am anxious about people escaping the net to the 
detriment of ordinary citizens. I am the last hon. Member 
to want to impose unnecessary burdens on business.

<H4><center>Meaning of "accessible public record".</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall say a brief word of introduction. 
The amendments are intended to give effect to Gaskin in 
respect of the records to which the Access to Personal 
Files Act 1987, the Access to Health Records Act 1990 
and corresponding Northern Ireland legislation apply. 
They will bring those records within the regime that the 
Bill will set up. The amendments deal with rights of 
access to information held in unstructured, manual records 
to which the provisions of the Bill would not otherwise 
apply. Those records relate to local authority housing, 
social services and health.



<P>
The amendments are numerous and lengthy. I apologise 
for that, but they seek to make technically complex and 
intricate provisions. I am sorry if the Committee finds 
them difficult to follow. I shall try to simplify them, and 
their underlying purpose is relatively straightforward. The 
amendments will consolidate the access rights given in 
other legislation that I have mentioned, and thereby give 
effect in respect of records relevant to the ECHR 
judgment in the case of Gaskin. The Bill already gives 
effect to that judgment in relation to some records, both 
automated and manual. The same should be done for other 
records to which there is a right of access and which do 
not currently come within the scope of the Bill.
<P>
The Gaskin judgment relates to refusal of subject 
access. It says that when access is refused because of the 
risk of identifying third parties that have not consented, a 
mechanism must exist for independent review of the 
refusal.
<P>
The Bill deals with that matter in two ways. When 
access has been refused, data subjects may seek a court 
order requiring access to be given or they may request an 
assessment to be made by the Data Protection 
Commissioner, who has power to take necessary 
enforcement action. To the extent that public bodies such 
as local authorities and NHS trusts hold records likely to 
be caught by the Gaskin judgment, the Bill does the job 
for automated or manual records that come within its 
scope. Those bodies also hold personal records, however, 
accessible under the Acts that I have mentioned, to which 
the effect of the Gaskin judgment applies, but which are 
not covered by the Bill. To deal with that problem, and 
because we wish to meet the UK's ECHR obligation in 
full in this case, we have decided to bring those additional 
records into the scope of the Bill. That is the purpose of 
the amendments.
<P>
It may be helpful for me to explain broadly how the 
package of amendments works. I hope that the Committee 
will agree that I should concentrate on the principal 
amendments rather than explaining each point in detail. 
All the points are interrelated.
<P>
For simplicity, I will describe the arrangements by 
references to legislation that applies in Great Britain. 
However, comparable provision is already made for 
Northern Ireland. The additional records to which we wish 
the Bill's regime to apply are brought within its scope by 
amendment No. 149, that seeks to add to the definition 
of "data" in clause 1 a new limb comprising "accessible 
records". Those are defined in new clause 1; they include 
certain health records and "accessible public records" as 
defined in new schedule 1.
<P>
The wording of the definition of "health records" is 
substantively the same as that used in the Access to Health 
Records Act 1990. "Accessible public records" are 
essentially those to which the Access to Personal Files 
Act 1987 applies, particularly local authority housing and 
social services records.
<P>
Amendment No. 2, new clause 1 and new schedule 1 
are thus the key provisions to bring the relevant records 
within the scope of the Bill in so far as they are not 
already included within the existing broadening of the 
definition of "data".
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall briefly describe the other effects of the package. 
However, I should give notice at this point that the 
Government are considering not pressing amendment No. 
170 to schedule 13, but will probably deal with matters 
addressed in the amendment under two separate 
provisions.
<P>
New clause 2 replicates in the Bill the definition of 
"health professional" from the 1990 Act. It is needed, as 
the 1990 Act has been largely repealed. Amendments 
Nos. 156 to 159 make necessary amendments to schedule 
8, which provides transitional relief. We wish to be able 
to apply the subject access and data rectification 
provisions to the manual data now covered by the 1987 
and 1990 Acts earlier than the general scheme provided 
for in the Bill that is, 24 October 2001. The amendments 
allow us to do that. Subject to the preparation of, and 
consultation on, the necessary guidance to public bodies 
such as local authority housing, social service departments 
and health bodies, we propose to bring the provisions into 
force during the first half of 1999.
<P>
Amendment No. 166 makes transitional provision in 
respect of access requests under the existing Acts made, 
but not dealt with, when the change to the new 
arrangements take place. As with the other, non-exempt, 
manual data covered by the Bill, the Bill's regime will 
apply in full to the data covered by the amendments from 
24 October 2007.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 174 to 182 make consequential 
repeals, which cover all of the 1987 Act, most of the 1990 
Act and other relevant enactments. The rest of the 
amendments make essentially minor and consequential 
changes. I realise that the arrangements are complicated 
and that there is a great deal for members of the 
Committee to digest. However, I hope that at least the 
broad thrust of the amendments is clear.



<P>
Finally, a number of amendments are missing from the 
numerical sequence covered by the group. They relate to 
separate issues and I trust that they will be selected for 
discussion later. I am sure that the Committee will agree 
that it is important that we give effect to the ECHR 
Gaskin judgment. In that context, I commend the 
amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I warned you, Mr. Stevenson, at the 
start of the Committee's deliberations that the matter 
would be both technical and far reaching. We are grateful 
for the Minister's explanation. We had anticipated that it 
was designed to deal with the Gaskin judgment. The 
Home Secretary said on Second Reading that the 
Committee would be asked to consider these amendments. 
We will be able to consider the matter fully when we have 
either some notes on these clauses, which the Minister 
might be prepared to circulate, or the opportunity to read 
in Hansard precisely what he said. However, a few 
questions have already sprung to mind.
<P>
As the Minister said and as is clear from one of the 
amendments the intention is to implement the manual 
provisions regarding health and public records two years 
or more earlier than was initially anticipated. The Minister 
mentioned the second half of 1999, whereas the Bill 
provides for 24 October 2001. He said that there would 
be guidance, but does he acknowledge the need for 
consultation with all the public bodies which will be 
affected?
<P>
The new set of amendments deals with another question 
that has been in the back of my mind since I began to 
study the Bill the extent to which the Bill is likely to 
apply to Government Departments in respect of its key 
provisions on access to personal records. To a large 
extend the Minister has answered that, but we are anxious 
that there should be consultation. I seek his assurance on 
that.
<P>
As the Minister said, the list in new schedule 1 
replicates the 1990 Act with which, I must confess, I am 
not entirely familiar although I am sure that it is as 
embracing a definition of medical practitioners as we 
could expect. More seriously, I hope that the Minister will 
see the need to consult with them. I dare say that those in 
the primary health care field I do not mean those in 
primary care, but the people whom one thinks of as being 
most involved in health provision, such as doctors and 
dentists will have seen this coming, or at least their 
professional bodies will have anticipated the 
Government's intention to implement Gaskin.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I am certainly not a doctor and, 
therefore, cannot comment on the specifics, but will my 
hon. Friend clarify the point that he made earlier about 
bringing forward the date from which manual records 
might be caught by the Bill? I recall that when the 
directive was going through council meetings, we fought 
hard to get derogation to avoid manual records being 
caught earlier. I am slightly worried that Ministers' 
intentions when the provision was being debated in the 
European Council are being distorted by this group of 
amendments and new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for 
the opportunity to pause for breath. He raises an important 
point. The amendment in question is probably amendment 
No. 158, which applies to schedule 8. I am, however, sure 
that the Minister will confirm that bringing forward the 
date affects only data related to health and public records, 
which are caught by the change, and not all manual data. 
The Government will have to tell those who will be 
affected why they think it necessary to bring things 
forward by two years and what it will mean for the 
organisations concerned.
<P>
Furthermore, not only is there the question of whether 
those organisations will be able to cope with the provision 
by autumn of next year for which I cannot answer, 
although I am sure that they will be grateful that we have 
raised it in Committee there is also the issue of cost. 
Some of that cost will fall on local authorities, because 
housing departments and housing records will be covered. 
The resource implications will have been thrashed out in 
Cabinet Committee and, given the general drive to reduce 
administration, those spending Departments that will be 
affected will presumably have had the opportunity to 
assimilate the implications. Conservative Members 
accept, reluctantly, that the Gaskin judgment must be 
addressed by this legislation.
<P>
We shall need to study some aspects of the matter 
further, because it is important and far-reaching, and will 
affect many people. It may well be debated further on the 
Floor of the House.
<P>
Those are my immediate thoughts. We understand the 
Government's reasoning, but I should be grateful if the 
Minister would say more about the decision to bring 
forward the implementation date by two years. What 
effect will that have on consultation, costs and the 
resources that will be required?
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I have a small query about new clause 2 
on page 409 of the amendment paper, which may result 
from a printing error, a drafting error or, as is most likely, 
a misunderstanding on my part. The words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"employed by a health service body"






<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
appear to relate only to "(j) a music therapist". The way 
in which the clause is structured, specifically the fact that 
proposed paragraph (k) refers to such a body, leads me to 
suspect that there should be a carriage return before the 
word "employed". Do the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"employed by a health service body"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
apply to all the previous proposed paragraphs (a) to (j)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am reliably informed that all the 
health professionals mentioned in proposed paragraphs (a) 
to (j) should be covered by the original statement my 
hon. Friend has not misread the new clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale raised some matters on 
which he seeks clarification. With regard to the bodies 
that will be affected by the changes, particularly by the 
introduction of some of the provisions in the first half of 
1999, I assure him that we shall undertake a consultation 
exercise and take seriously the views that are presented 
to us.
<P>
In terms of the resources that are available, full 
advantage will be taken of the transitional period to allow 
people to make the necessary judgments. I anticipate no 
problems in that area, but if problems occur we shall listen 
to the views of those affected.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to suggest that some of 
these explanations are technical and difficult to 
understand. With that in mind, I shall arrange for a clearer 
and more detailed explanation to be placed in the Library 
of the House so that any hon. Member can make use of 
it. I hope that that explanation will satisfy some of the 
on-going concerns of the hon. Member for Ryedale, and 
help him to decide whether he wishes to return to the 
matter later. I intend to make that information available 
reasonably soon.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Amendment made: No. 149, in page 1, line 14, at end

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (d) does not fall within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) but forms part 
of an accessible record as defined by section (Meaning of 
"accessible record");'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in 
page 1, line 18, at end insert `within the United Kingdom'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government 
amendment No. 244, and amendment No. 20, in clause 5, 
page 3, line 33, leave out `context of that establishment' 
and insert `European Economic Area'.
<P>
<h5>11.30 am</h5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway: This short debate will be one of the </B><P>
several necessary on the question of jurisdiction. 
Amendment No. 4 would provide that the data controller 
definition applies only to processing performed in the 
United Kingdom. I hope that the Minister will confirm 
that that is what is intended in the Bill, given that United 
Kingdom legislation can apply only in the United 
Kingdom.
<P>
More importantly, amendment No. 20, like later 
amendments, applies to clause 5, which appears to extend 
the application of the Bill. We have phrased the 
amendment as we have because there seems to be a gap 
in the provisions. Clause 5(1)(b) deals with circumstances 
in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the data controller is established neither in the United Kingdom nor 
in any other EEA State but uses equipment in the United Kingdom 
for processing the data otherwise than for the purposes of transit 
through the United Kingdom."</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure about enforcement, nor about what 
happens with data processed in another European country 
on behalf of a controller established in the United 
Kingdom. A common directive lies behind the relevant 
legislation, but one presumes that there are 15 different 
laws.
<P>
What are the practical implications, and what 
opportunity will there be for redress? A data controller 
may be established here but the processing may be done 
in France or Italy. How will that be covered? Under
clause 5, it seems that the same situation will apply. A 
country that is not in the European economic area will be 
used, such as the United States, India or South America. 
This is an important issue, which, together with the 
subject of the next amendment, concerns what I tried to 
suggest earlier in our debate on the word, "intention". We 
wish to ensure that the disreputable do not find 
opportunities to escape the general net that the Bill will 
put around the data processing world.



<P>
I think that I have covered what I should like the 
Minister to answer; it is clear from his reaction that he 
agrees that we were right to raise that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> I wish to reinforce a couple of points 
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale. 
Although the amendments are specific, there is a problem 
which I am sure the Minister understands, given his 
interests before 1 May last year. The effect of the internet 
and the rapid communication of data means that it is very 
difficult to know the jurisdiction of the Data Protection 
Commissioner, the date controller and all the other people 
who are supposedly caught within the Bill's jurisdiction. 
I seek the Minister's elucidation of some of the issues; I 
am sure that he has spent many evenings cogitating about 
them. How is being precise about the scope, or the 
geographic scope, of the power of the commissioner and 
the responsibility of the data controllers compatible with 
electronic commerce? Credit references and electronic 
direct mail can be carried out within the European 
economic area and more crucially for the Bill outside 
it, which has implications for future debates in 
Committee.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for the concern shown by the 
hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) about 
how I spend my evenings.
<P>
<B>The chairman:</B> We shall not get into that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I appreciate that that might be too exciting 
a subject for most Committee members, Mr. Stevenson. I 
welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee. I had the 
privilege of shadowing him for many years. In a sense, 
he is now reciprocating the various kindnesses that I 
showed him during that period. Both he and the hon. 
Member for Ryedale
<P>
have described the essential problem that the amendments raise: where member states are required to 
implement in their national laws the principle of the 
directive, what happens if those 15 national laws in 
practice produce slightly different results? Where 
processing can take place across member states' 
boundaries and jurisdictions, which law should apply? 
The Government's purpose in trying to clarify this issue 
with its amendment and resisting those in the name of the 
hon. Member for Ryedale is to ensure consistency. I shall 
try to explain why.
<P>
It is right that I should concede immediately that the 
amendments raise an important and complex issue: the 
geographical scope of the Bill. If I have understood both 
amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Ryedale 
correctly, they point in different directions. One would 
restrict the scope of the Bill, the other would extend it. 
[Laughter.]
 <P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We shall want to know which it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I shall explain that in a moment. They are 
also subject to a more fundamental objection as they 
would frustrate the data protection regime established by 
the directive within the European Union. The definition 
of "data controller" in clause 1 and clause 5 taken together 
help determine the Bill's geographical scope. It might be 
helpful if I explain the underlying general purpose.
<P>
The starting point is that the data protection directive 
establishes a common level of data protection to which all 
member states are required to give effect through their 
national laws. Data protection considerations must no 
longer be a barrier to the free flow of personal data within 
the European economic area. Indeed, the directive's 
primary purpose was to prevent national legislation from 
restricting the free flow of data.
<P>
The key provision in the directive is article 4. The basic 
rule is that the controller's place of establishment 
determines which member state's law applies. It does not 
matter, therefore, where the processing is carried out, it 
is the place of establishment that matters. A controller 
established in the United Kingdom will be subject to 
United Kingdom law, even if some of the processing was 
carried out in another member state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Let us see whether I can anticipate the hon. 
Gentleman's question. Clearly, a controller of data may 
be established in more than one member state. For 
example, a company may be established in the United 
Kingdom and in France. In that case the basic rule still 
applies, but with a modest refinement. Processing done in 
the context of the United Kingdom establishment will be 
subject to United Kingdom law, and processing done in 
the context of the French establishment will be subject to 
French law. "In the context of" is an expression that will 
require further interpretation, but it is contained in the 
directive. It is important that we establish a consistency 
of approach across different member states.



<P>
It may be sensible in due course for companies with 
more than one place of establishment to specify which 
one is relevant for their particular purposes. It is important 
that all those affected by the decision are aware of which 
legal regime applies. It does not matter where the 
processing is carried out what is important is a 
consistency of approach across the EEA. I hope that 
Committee members will accept that it is important that 
different member states approach these matters in a 
consistent way. Otherwise, the law of more than one 
member state might apply to a particular piece of 
processing. That would be an unfortunate conclusion for 
us to reach. Equally, no law might apply.
<P>
The interpretation of article 4 that I have set out is 
shared by the European Commission, which is 
encouraging all member states to follow it. If that 
consistent interpretation is pursued, we shall achieve a 
consistent standard across the European Union.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Ian Taylor: The Minister is touching on a crucial 
point. He was right to remind the Committee that the idea 
behind the legislation, when it was in directive form, was 
to facilitate the movement of information across borders, 
not to restrict it. That was one of the reasons why, as 
Minister for Science and Technology, I was in favour of 
the Bill and why to repeat what I said at our first 
sitting the Home Office was more concerned about it.
<P>
Nothing that I would wish to do would create 
difficulties for the free movement of information 
However, the Minister raised a secondary point regarding 
the interpretation of the directive in the various member 
countries. Can he assure the Committee that he has had 
talks in Council, or with his opposite numbers in other 
countries, to ensure that the implementation of the council 
of Ministers' wishes provides the outcome which he has 
stated is his objective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's 
historical explanation of the difficulties that different 
Department's under the previous Government had in 
reconciling their view. I assure him that this Government 
speak with a single voice. [Laughter.] There are, 
therefore, no difficulties of the kind to which the hon. 
Member for Esher and Walton referred.
<P>
On the point that the hon. Gentleman raised, I have 
explained that we will not accept amendments Nos. 4 and 
5 in the name of the hon. Member for Ryedale because 
they would not be consistent with the European 
Commission's interpretation. The Government hope that 
every other member state will adopt the same reasoning. 
The hon. Member for Esher and Walton is long 
experienced in the Council of Ministers and knows that 
nothing I say today will guarantee that other member 
states' implementation of the rules in their jurisdictions is 
consistent with the European Commission. Clearly, our 
officials are in discussion with officials, from other 
member states to ensure that there is consistency. It would 
be unfortunate if the first thing that the Government did, 
in arguing for consistency, was to depart from the 
European Commission's interpretation. I hope that that is 
sufficient explanation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Esher and Walton raised a small 
matter in relation to the internet. Recital 47 of the 
directive states that the person who puts personal data 
onto the internet is the controller of the data.
<P>
Government amendment No. 244 is a technical 
amendment designed to clarify the relationship between 
clauses 1(6) and 5. Clause 1(6) deals with the 
circumstances in which personal data are processed 
outside the European economic area. It states that, in such 
circumstances, personal data are not to be taken as having 
been transferred outside the EEA for the purposes of the 
Bill if the Bill continues to apply to the processing. Hon. 
Members will be aware that special rules apply to 
transfers of personal data outside the EEA, and I am sure 
that they will want to discuss those rules in greater detail. 
The rules need not apply where the Bill applies in full to 
the processing after the data have been transferred.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>


<P>
As I have already explained, clause 5 establishes the 
criteria for determining when the Bill applies to particular 
processing. The basic rule is that the Bill applies where 
the processing is done by a controller established in the 
United Kingdom. It has been suggested that there is some 
ambiguity in clause 1(6) and that it is not clear whether it 
applies only to processing within the terms of clause 5(1). 
The purpose of Government amendment No. 244 is to 
clarify the position. It is a purely technical amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's 
explanation. On amendment No. 244, I still have the 
virgin copy of the Bill as amended in the other place, 
which I took with me on holiday to France at Easter. It 
has my hieroglyphics in it. When I read clause 1(6), I 
wrote, "What does this mean?" and I am grateful for the 
Minister's explanation. Conservative Members considered 
tabling a probing amendment to delete clause 1(6), but 
realised that such an wrecking amendment would not have 
been acceptable to the Clerks. The Government's 
amendment makes the position clearer, and we welcome 
it.
<P>
I assure the Minister that we have no intention of asking 
him to accept amendments Nos. 4 and 5. He will, 
however, understand that we are seeking to find a peg on 
which we can hang a debate.



<P>
He and my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and 
Walton clearly appreciate that this is an important issue. 
During the Minister's explanation, however, other 
concerns began to ferment in my mind. One of the matters 
to which we will want to return in Committee or on the 
Floor of the House is the state of preparedness of other 
member states for the implementation of the directive in 
legislation. Some have done better than others. All we can 
do is implement the measures in our own country by the 
date to which our Ministers have agreed.
<P>
The next question that arises is that of data processed 
elsewhere. I am not concerned about bona fide business 
in any of this, but no doubt we shall shortly deal with the 
issue of sensitive personal data and journalistic, artistic or 
literary purposes, where there is scope for abuse.
<P>
I am more than a little concerned that the measure will 
result in people trying to find safe havens where they can 
process material that we would prefer them not to have at 
all, in places where they are unlikely to come within the 
scope of any serious enforcement of the directive, as well 
as the Bill. I entirely understand the Minister's reply in 
respect of processing in relation to several member states, 
because that is clearly possible.
<P>
With those caveats, I recognise that the Minister could 
not answer all our concerns because many involved 
implementation elsewhere. We may well want to return 
to the issue again, but we have satisfied our purpose for 
now. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in 
page 1, line 20,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>after `employee', insert, `agent or contractor'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We tabled the amendment to clarify a definition. It is not 
a major point.
<P>
The Bill differentiates between data controllers and data 
processors [Interruption.] It is important. If one is 
employed by a data controller, one comes within the 
definition of a controller. A processor is, as far as I can 
tell, someone who carries out the processing but who is 
not the data controller or employed by him. Whom do the 
Government intend to be caught by this general 
provision? Is an employee purely someone who is 
formally employed by the data controller, or would the 
term include someone who may have the status of agent, 
sub-agent or contractor? There are many instances in the 
commercial world of people appearing to the outside 
world to work within an organisation's empire and thus to 
be part of that organisation when, in reality, they are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I have experienced such a situation. At 
the end of the day, someone in the company had to take 
responsibility for the information that had been provided 
to senior management. A contractor, consultant or agent 
could provide advice, but responsibility for decisions 
rested with the company itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that that is right, but it does 
not really answer the point. I do not want to labour it, but 
we want to know, for the benefit of those outside the 
House who will have to implement the provision, what 
the Government mean by "employee". Do they mean 
people who are employed, with all the implications in 
terms of the normal relationship between employer and 
employee, or are we potentially including people who, 
although they may appear to be part of an organisation, 
are self-employed, have a consultancy agreement or act 
as an agent? That is rather different from the 
circumstances that the measure is clearly intended to 
cover, in which a company uses a wholly different 
organisation to do the processing. That is commonplace. 
I have made my point, and I shall not labour it. I look 
forward to the Minister's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I should apologise to the hon. Gentleman 
if my wry smile distracted him: I was simply reflecting 
on the effect that he appears to be having on the hon. 
Members behind him.
<P>

<P>
<P>
The Government will resist the amendment because it 
seeks to alter the definition of "data processor". That 
definition currently includes any person other than an 
employee of the data controller, who processes personal 
data on the controller's behalf. Given the wide definition 
of processing, that would mean, for example, that 
somebody other than an employee, who collected personal 
data on the controller's behalf, would be a processor.
<P>
I refer Committee members to what is described as the 
seventh data protection principle, which is dealt with by 
schedule 1, on page 43 of the bill. Paragraphs 12 and 13 
impose specific obligations on data controllers in their use 
of the services of processors in other words, they relate 
to the delegation of processing to people other than 
employees. The provisions are intended to ensure that 
when a data controller places processing functions at a 
remove from his or her immediate control, the relationship 
between controller and processor is such that the risk of 
any breach of data protection law is minimised. They 
ensure an effective route of enforcement through the 
controller to deal with such a breach.
<P>
The Government emphasise that we do not want to risk 
breaking that link to the controller. Otherwise, the 
projections set out in the Bill would be damaged. The 
provisions faithfully give effect to the directive's 
requirements. The amendment would exclude from the 
definition of "processor", and thus from the Bill's regime, 
persons who should not be excluded. It is the 
Government's firm view that the protections set out in the 
Bill are necessary and that there would be a danger of 
those protections being weakened if the amendment 
were accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I assume that the Minister is saying 
that an agent or contractor is by definition a data 
processor, and does not come within the ambit of the data 
controller. That was the purpose of tabling the 
amendment. I am grateful to have that response on the 
record, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to amendment No. 
6, it may help the Committee and I have no doubt the 
Chairman for me to remind hon. Members that only the 
first amendment in a group is technically before the 
Committee. Grouped amendments or new clauses in the 
name of a Minister will be called formally when the 
Committee reaches the relevant point in the Bill.



<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in
page 2, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by reference to the data subject'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to 
consider amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 10, at end 
insert "publication,".
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was slightly surprised to see the 
amendments grouped together, as they address separate 
points.
<P>
The amendment seeks to clarify the definition. If I 
remember correctly from Hansard, the addition of the 
words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by reference to the data subject'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<P>

<P>
was suggested in the House of Lords. That would make 
clear that the processing in question relates to information 
about a living and identifiable person a phrase used by 
the Under-Secretary. In the spirit of constructive 
co-operation, I simply wonder whether that addition 
would not clarify the matter, given that the Bill is intended 
to catch processing about living individuals. Other, more 
abstract, processing is not caught.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 asks why the word "publication" 
was not included in clause 1(1)(c). If "otherwise making 
available" does not include publication, I am a Dutchman. 
I hope that the Minister will offer some explanation.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>


<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I assume that amendment No. 6 was tabled because the Data Protection Act 1984 applies only to 
automated processing done by reference to the individual. 
However, the directive would not allow us to maintain 
that restriction. The directive's definitions of "personal 
data" and "processing" are significantly wider than their 
counterparts in the 1984 Act. Neither of those wider 
definitions allows for the possibility of limitation along 
the lines suggested by the amendment.
<P>
Although that may not satisfy the hon. Member for 
Ryedale, it is the reason for the Bill's broader scope. I 
shall try to answer any further questions that the hon. 
Gentleman has, but the clause ensures that United 
Kingdom law conforms with the directive. A return to the 
1984 wording would put us in breach of the directive.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale clarified the problem 
identified in amendment No. 7, and I think that he 
answered his own question. I confirm that the existing 
wording includes publication. The extra word that he 
proposes is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I feared that the Minister would say 
that, but it seems strange that the most obvious word in 
the English language "publication" means that material 
is made available is excluded from the definition. 
However, it is his Bill, not mine: if he is satisfied, that is 
up to him.
<P>
I shall have to think about the Minister's response to 
amendment No. 6. I understand that the Bill must properly 
implement the directive, but I hope that the Minister has 
not left open the possibility that the provisions will go 
further. However, I shall not press that question. I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`page 2, line 14, leave out from `means' to end of line 20 and insert 
any structured set of personal data which are accessible according 
to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed 
on a functional or geographical basis.'.</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the choice elements of our debate is that at 
certain points the Minister says that the Government are 
implementing the directive, and at other points I stand up 
and ask why the wording of the directive has been 
replaced by some gobbledegook that nobody can 
understand. Perhaps I stray a little too far towards 
colourful language in seeking to clarify my view of the 
Bill's definition of "relevant filing system".
<P>
The directive offers an alternative definition. That was 
touched on during the discussions in the other place, when 
my noble Friend Viscount Astor proposed that the word 
"specific" should be added to clause 1 in line 19 on page 
2 of the Bill. On Third Reading the Government carried 
that amendment forward.
<P>
I cannot see why the Government deemed the wording 
of the directive's definition, which we have used in 
amendment No. 8, to be insufficient. That has far-reaching 
implications. The definition brings in manual records, 
which are outside the scope of the 1984 Act. Conservative 
Members believe that the directive's wording is clearer 
than that of the Bill. Will the Minister address that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale 
conceded that his amendment is a direct copy out from the 
directive. He appears to be trying to compare the potential 
effects of the Bill's wording. That is a reasonable debating 
stance on his part.
<P>
During the debate in another place, my noble Friend 
Lord Williams said:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Our intentions are clear. We do not wish the definition to apply 
to miscellaneous collections of paper about individuals, even if the 
collections are assembled in a file with the individual's name or 
other unique identifier on the front, if specific data about the 
individual cannot be readily extracted from that collection." 
[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 March 1998; Vol. 587, c. 467.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a nice summary of the Bill's intention. The hon. 
Gentleman's amendment relates to the definition of 
"relevant filing system" that is, manual records. The 
amendment would change the definition of a "relevant 
filing system", which establishes the manual records to 
which the Bill applies, substituting the definition that is 
specified in the directive.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's purpose may be to ensure that 
the Bill does not catch any more or any fewer manual 
records than those to which the directive's definition 
would apply. That is an admirable objective, which we 
share. I am afraid, however, that the amendment would 
not achieve that objective. The words of the amendment 
follow precisely those in the definition of "personal data 
filing system" in article 2(c) of the directive. However, 
those words should be read in the light of the relevant 
recitals, which serve to clarify the scope of the definition. 
For example, recital 27 states expressly that the directive 
does not apply to unstructured files. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the content of a filing system must be structured according to 
specific criteria relating to individuals allowing easy access to the 
personal data."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It concludes by saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"files or sets of files as well as their cover pages, which are not 
structured according to specific criteria, shall under no 
circumstances fall within the scope of this Directive".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that those words place 
important restrictions on the interpretation of the 
definition in article 2(c). I am afraid that the hon. 
Gentleman's amendment takes no account of that. It 
would broaden the scope of the definition considerably, 
which would mean bringing within the Bill's ambit many 
more manual records than the directive is intended to 
cover.
<P>
In drawing up the definition of a relevant filing system, 
the Government had particular regard to all the relevant 
provisions of the directive, including the recitals. We have 
taken great care to express the definition as far as 
possible, in order to catch the manual records and only 
those manual records that the directive requires to be 
covered. In that sense, we have taken a fairly minimalist 
approach.
<P>
The Committee will find in the definition of the criteria 
to which the recitals make reference the need for a 
structure that is developed with reference to individuals, 
and a requirement for specific information about a 
particular individual to be readily accessible. Although we 
believe that our approach is preferable to the hon. 
Gentleman's and certainly much closer to the spirit and 
letter of the directive, we would not claim that it is 
perfect.
<P>
One of the problems of applying data protection law to 
manual records is that it is very difficult to define 
precisely those records that should be caught.

<B></B><P>
Mr. Greenway: Will the Minister confirm that a 
photographic library which is accessible by reference 
specifically to individuals would be caught by the 
definition?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall come back to the hon. 
Gentleman on that. It would depend on the structure of 
the file and what information it contained. In that sense, I 
do not think that a photographic library would be any 
different from a collection of information in some other 
building with entirely different purposes. It would depend 
on exactly what information was contained and how 
readily identifiable it was to an individual. I suspect that 
there is no clear-cut answer to the hon. Gentleman's 
question. It would depend on individual circumstances.
<P>
The experience of most countries that have already 
applied data protection law to such records shows that it 
is a difficult area. We are not pretending that it is 
straightforward. However, two approaches guarantee 
precision. One is to apply the law to all paper records 
containing personal information, whether or not they are 
structured, and whether or not it is easy to get access to 
the information. Incidentally, that is probably as near as I 
will be able to get to an answer to the question of the 
hon. Member for Ryedale, although it was not specifically 
designed to answer his query.
<P>
Such an approach would mean catching almost every 
single piece of paper with a person's name on it. That 
does not seem to be a particularly desirable way of 
proceeding and goes way beyond what the directive 
requires.
<P>
The other approach is to limit the law's application to 
certain expressly designated types of data holding, such 
as records held in card index systems. The difficulty with 
that is it would mean that we were not complying with 
the directive. Thus, one approach implies too much, while 
the other implies too little. We are trying to strike a 
balance.
<P>
We have attempted to find a way of limiting the Bill to 
those records that are held in such a way as to meet the 
directive's requirements. Since the directive itself is 
imprecise, that necessarily means that if we are not to 
exceed or go below its requirements, our own law risks 
lacking complete certainty. Part of the difficulty is that 
manual records are held in such a wide range of ways. If 
it would be convenient for the Committee, I can give a 
brief explanation of how we see the definition applying.



<P>
Highly structured systems, such as card index systems, 
come clearly within the definition. Equally clearly outside 
it are wholly unstructured collections of paper, such as 
unsorted bundles of papers that are stored in loose-leaf 
folders, and policy or topic files, which only incidentally 
contain references to individuals. As Members of 
Parliament, we could all imagine case work files that 
related to a problem in our constituency. They might, by 
definition, involve individuals, but would not be 
specifically about them.
<P>
In the middle is a rather greyer area. An example would 
be a file say a personnel file about a named individual. 
Let us say that it was a general file about the person 
concerned, which contained all of his or her employment 
records from day one to the present in date order. Such a 
file would not be caught if there were no index to the 
individual documents or no other way of gaining ready 
access to them. It would, however, be caught if the papers 
were indexed. It might also be caught in part if specific 
papers were flagged in some way. A personnel file that 
was limited to specific information about an individual 
might also be caught for example, a file in date order 
that was confined to a person's health record or 
attendance record.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>


<P>
I realise that the situation is less certain than many 
people would wish. If hon. Members have suggestions for 
improving the precision without damaging our underlying 
objective of complying precisely with the directive, we 
would be willing to consider them.
<P>
I have spoken at more length than I would have wished, 
but this is an important issue and it is as well to explore 
it properly. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the 
hon. Member for Ryedale will recognise that the present 
definition does its job pretty well, and certainly better than 
the simple copy-out of the directive. With those 
reassurances, I invite him to consider withdrawing the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his 
detailed explanation. As he realises, the purpose of the 
amendment is to ensure that we have the best definition 
possible. I take his point about ensuring that we do not 
catch more than is necessary.
<P>
I have lingering concerns I have expressed this 
sentiment in regard to other amendments about the 
means whereby some of the Bill's provisions might be 
avoided. Collections of bundles could contain information 
that people could retrieve, although it might take them 
longer than pressing a button. In part, that is why I asked 
the Minister about photographic libraries. Photographs are 
easily identifiable and one needs only a few hours to look 
through them, while it is more difficult to look through 
shelves of papers.
<P>
I will, however, not labour the point. I am grateful for 
the Minister's comments. Conservative Members cannot 
come up with a better suggestion than his. Doubtless, 
people will have the chance to study his comments and 
reconsider the issue before we consider the Bill on Report. 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in

I shall be brief. On first reading, the phrase
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"unless the context otherwise requires"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
left me thinking, "What does that mean?" Will the 
Minister confirm that it is a direct reference to clause 54 
and that it has no other connotations?



<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps the Minister would 
like to intervene just to confirm matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall sit down I have asked the 
question.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Howarth: To answer the hon. Gentleman, it 
relates directly to clause 54 and bears no relation to 
anything else.
<P>
It might be helpful if I start by explaining the need for 
clause 1(2). The Bill draws a distinction between personal 
data and the information that they contain. Perhaps I can 
give an example. If a business prints out a customer's 
credit record from my computer, the print-out does not 
necessarily contain personal data within the meaning of 
the Bill, as it may no longer meet the criteria in the 
definition of "the data". That is the situation that we seek 
to cover. The hon. Gentleman has had an explanation of 
the origin of the wording, and I hope that he is satisfied 
with it. I therefore hope that he will not seek to amend 
those words further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The 
point about clause 54, which we shall debate later in our 
proceedings, is that the same words are used about 
obtaining disclosure in recording and so on, but in an 
entirely different context. We are grateful for the 
Minister's explanation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We have had a good debate on the 
definitions in the clause. I do not intend to delay the 
Committee further by unnecessary debate. We wish to 
support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for 
Ryedale. I think that he accepts that clause 1 remains an 
essential part of the Bill. It contains definitions of the key 
terms used, and those definitions are crucial to giving each 
of the terms the meaning that it needs to make sense of 
the Bill. In that way, they have an important part to play 
in determining the scope of the Bill. Having said that, I 
hope that we can agree that clause 1 should stand part of 
the Bill.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> All the amendments in this group have in 
common the fact that they would each change the 
categories or sensitive data in clause 2 in some way. With 
your leave, Mr. Stevenson, I will deal first with 
Government amendment No. 110, together with 
amendment No. 16, which has been tabled by Opposition 
Members. It is fair to say that there is not a great deal 
between the Government and the Opposition on this 
matter, but I shall try to explain, why I tend to prefer the 
Government's approach.
<P>
I made a concession to the hon. Member for Ryedale 
in saying that he has got pretty near to a definition which 
the Government could accept. But inevitably, with all the 
resources available to the Government, the definition that 
we suggest is preferable.
<P>
The list of sensitive personal data in clause 2 is based 
on article 8(1) of the directive, which refers to religious 
or philosophical beliefs. The Government deliberately did 
not include a reference to philosophical beliefs in the Bill 
because of the ambiguity of the expression. Its meaning 
is clear enough in the directive, but its use in a United 
Kingdom Act of Parliament might well not be.



<P>
The Government seek to avoid writing into law a 
definition of beliefs that applies only in a rather academic 
sense. We do not, for example, believe it to be appropriate 
for the legislation to cover the ideas of Jean Paul Sartre 
or Bertrand Russell. It would not be right for such ideas 
to be considered as sensitive data; that would be 
inconsistent with the purpose of the directive. The 
reference to philosophical beliefs is intended to catch 
beliefs that are similar to religious beliefs, but which 
cannot be described as religious. Humanism is an 
example, which is why the Government initially preferred 
the expression, "religious or other beliefs". Having given 
the matter further thought, however, we accept that that 
definition might be a little to wide. It is argued that such 
a definition could let in beliefs whose nature is very 
different from that of religious beliefs. For example, it 
could include a belief in the value of overseas aid, or in 
the need for a strong pound. I recognise that Labour 
Members probably have greater commitment to such 
beliefs than Opposition Members. We are anxious to 
make allowance for such concerns.
<P>
The Government amendment will deal with the matter 
by making it clear that the other beliefs must be similar 
in nature to religious beliefs. The amendment covers all 
that the directive requires, but without the ambiguity and 
uncertainty that reference to philosophical beliefs might 
entail.
<P>
I am in your hands now, Mr. Stevenson. I could go on 
and deal with the remaining amendments, but it might be 
curious to do that before they have been explained by the 
hon. Member for Ryedale, who moved them.

Mr. Hoon: In that case, I shall allow the hon. Member

he will allow the Chairman to ask the hon. Member for 
Ryedale to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Of course I mean that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Already a pattern is emerging in the 
Committee. The Opposition have tabled amendments 
dealing with issues and wording about which the 
Government have a touch or uncertainty.
<P>
The reference in clause 2 to religious or other beliefs 
was extremely widely drawn. I accept the Minister's 
comments, and that the Government are proposing a 
significant improvement. If the amendment is agreed to, 
the drafting will undoubtedly be better. I do not wish to 
fall back on the wording of the directive too much. As the 
Minister acknowledges, it includes the phrase, "religious 
or philosophical beliefs". Both the Minister and my hon. 
Friend the Member for Esher and Walton have far greater 
experience of dealing with European matters than I, but it 
is clear that the French, German, Dutch or Italian 
equivalent may not mean quite what we think the word 
means; I understand that that is open to interpretation. We 
see no reason, however, why the definition in this regard 
should extend beyond that required by the directive. I 
should have thought that the term "philosophical" was 
clear. The Minister used the phrase "religious or other 
beliefs of a similar nature", but I am not entirely sure 
whether that covers a requirement to include philosophical 
beliefs. I presume that philosophical beliefs go beyond 
religious beliefs or those with some similarity to 
religious beliefs.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>

<P>
We need not only to concentrate on the wording of 
clause 2, but to direct our minds to the fact that it deals 
with an important aspect of the Bill the definition of 
what is included in the term "sensitive personal data". 
Such data receive different treatment in the Bill from 
other data. Those are some of the most important issues 
that the Committee needs to address. The special status 
given to sensitive personal data makes it important that 
the entire definition is correct.
<P>
The other changes that we have proposed relate, for 
example, to the definition of trade union membership, 
which is specifically required in the directive. The 
preamble to article 8 states:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Member States shall prohibit the processing of personal data 
revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or 
philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership".</UL></FONT>
<P>
A sense of fairness would lead us to recognise that 
people belong to many organisations that are not trade 
unions because of their occupations. They might, 
however, rightly feel that such membership is equally 
sensitive to trade union membership. That is what we have 
tried to deal with in amendment No. 17, where we suggest 
that we add to the clause the words,
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"or membership of a professional or business association".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Someone might belong to a trade body that is not a trade 
union. To all intents and purposes, the representation that 
he receives from it is as sensitive to him as trade union 
membership.
<P>
We would not want to put more than was strictly 
necessary into legislation, and nor would the Government. 
There is, however, the significant point to which Ministers 
have referred again this morning that we must include 
what we think is important. I want to promote the fairness 
of that approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Perhaps I could assist the thinking of the 
hon. Member for Ryedale. Does he regard membership of 
the Ryedale rotary club as a sensitive matter that ought to 
come within the provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No. On the other hand, I have been 
parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Insurance Brokers 
for 10 years and I am an insurance broker. A time could 
come when people in that profession were regarded in a 
bad light. Why is membership of the General, Municipal, 
Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union is so sensitive as 
to be given that special status. We are making the general 
point that if people belong to a professional body or trade 
association which represents them in their industry, 
business or occupation, why is it not caught, simply 
because it does not come within the definition of a trade 
union?
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there 
has been an unfortunate history of employment 
discrimination based on trade union membership? I am 
sure that he regrets that as much as I do. That history 
has not been reflected in, for example, membership of a 
professional association or a rotary society. It is worth 
including such a provision in the Bill only if there are 
specific instances of injustice based on the maintenance 
of personal records of that type.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good 
point, but I do not think that it answers my point. The 
definition of membership of an organisation which relates 
to one's occupation or way of life should be wider than 
the definition of a trade union. I agree with what the hon. 
Gentleman said. We have witnessed, even in the past 24 
hours, the extent to which the issue remains a political hot 
potato, not just across parties but within them. I recognise 
that is a sensitive issue.
<P>
However, we seen no justification for making the 
definition of sensitive personal data in respect of one's 
membership of a body representing a particular 
occupation depend entirely on the definition of a trade 
union, as specified in clause 2(d).
<P>
Amendment No. 18 relates to subsection (e),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"his physical or mental health or condition"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and (f), "his sexual life". The directive preamble refers to 
his "health or sex life". I am not clear why the 
Government have chosen to expand on the directive's 
definition of health. I can see that "physical or mental 
health" is a more specific definition of health, but I am 
confused by the intention behind the phrase "or 
condition". What is meant by that? I do not suppose that 
all of us slightly overweight and overfed Members of 
Parliament would regard ourselves as in the peak of 
condition for doing what some hon. Members did 
yesterday. They kicked a football around the field at West 
Ham United, and they all survived the experience.
<P>
Given the importance that the Bill attributes to sensitive 
personal data, does not the inclusion of the words "or 
condition" make life unnecessarily difficult? Our 
suggestion is simply to replace it with the phrase "health 
and sex life", which is used in article 8.



<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock (Wyre Forest):</B> I rise with some 
difficulty, Mr. Stevenson, as I was one of those tramping 
around West Ham United football ground yesterday. Does 
the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) agree that 
many asymptomatic conditions may leave a person's 
health unaffected until a later stage? Is it not just as 
sensitive a matter to hold information about people with 
such conditions as it is to hold information about those 
with conditions whose symptoms are apparent at the time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not entirely sure what the hon. 
Gentlemans is suggesting. Is he talking about people with 
a certain thought train in a political party, who are thought 
rather odd because they are not generally on message and 
in the mainstream? Does he mean that their sanity will be 
queried, and that some record should be kept in little black 
books buries in the bowels of this building?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Or in the Whips' Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I thought that that is what I said. That 
proposition would be an unnecessary addition. The 
directive gives health the widest possible definition. The 
hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock) suggests that 
people may suffer from a degenerative condition not 
presently regarded as an illness. That may be so: how 
many hon. Members over the past five or 10 years have 
signed early-day motions about myalgic 
encephalomyelitis and repetitive strain injury? People did 
not think that there was anything to either condition, but 
they are now more recognised.
<P>
The information involved when a doctor cannot 
diagnose what is wrong with a patient is sensitive, 
however, as it covers that person's health. I am certain 
that other hon. Members, who are not members of the 
Committee, will want to return to this important matter 
when the Bill returns on Report.
<P>
Amendment No. 19 would delete from clause 2 
paragraphs (g) and (h), which deal with the commission 
of any offence and the proceedings related to criminal 
prosecutions and convictions. Those requirements appear 
not in the preamble to article 8, but in paragraph 5. We 
can understand why the Government want to include them 
in the definition of "sensitive personal data", but they 
provoke some of the most serious questions arising from 
the Bill.
<P>
Organisations other than Government Departments or 
public departments such as the police keep records on 
people. For example, banks and credit companies set up 
units to deal with the problem of credit card fraud. When 
we discussed the sittings motion, I referred briefly to my 
interest in the insurance industry. I said then that the 
Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters was deeply worried 
about the records that it keeps on people whom it suspects 
of fiddling the system and making fraudulent claims. 
Because there is no clear evidence of proof, it keeps the 
data because it believes that only time will provide such 
evidence. The problem is that, because of the definition 
and the requirements of the way in which sensitive 
personal data are dealt with, it is questioning its ability to 
continue. We think that there is a way round this which 
we shall discuss later.
<P>
We have singled out this issue in the amendment to 
draw attention to the fact that many of the problems do 
not arise under the provisions of the 1984 Act which allow 
such data to be kept. I believe that it is in the public 
interest that they should be, although the institute is not a 
public organisation. However, the new regime raises 
issues that were not covered in the 1984 Act and will 
create the difficulties that people perceive will arise in 
that regard.
<P>
I ask the Minister to think particularly about the 
definitions in paragraphs (g) and (h). To draw attention to 
what we see as the problem, we propose that they be 
removed. I quite see the article 8 provisions; we may wish 
to consider the matter again on Report and propose an 
alternative.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>


<P>
Clause 2 is one of the most central tenets of the Bill, 
and the Committee will want to reflect on it. We believe 
that the Government's proposed change regarding 
religious or other beliefs is better than what is currently 
in the Bill. Our preference would be to take into account 
religious or philosophical beliefs. Whatever decisions we 
come to about that now, there will be the opportunity to 
consider it again.



<P>
Membership of any trade association or professional 
body which does not necessarily come within the meaning 
of the Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 should 
be included in clause 2(d). We see no reason to expand 
the directive's requirements in regard to health matters. 
An easier way would be to use the words of the directive 
which refers to a person's health or sex life. Finally, we 
draw attention to the difficulties that various organisations 
will face as a result of the extension into sensitive 
personal data. The criminal records aspect does not cause 
difficulty under the 1984 Act but will certainly cause 
difficulty as a result of this proposal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms ((Poole)):</B> As my hon. Friends have 
done, I should like to declare an interest. I am director 
of a family building and plant hire business that may be 
impacted at some stage by the Bill, particularly if we 
continue to progress as we have done this morning.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 would add those with membership 
of a masonic lodge, guild, professional or business 
association to the list in clause 2. I felt that it would be 
more inclusive to have a balance by adding business 
organisations to the list of bodies, organisations and trade 
unions listed in clause 2.
<P>
There was an earlier reference to persecution. Many 
people in masonic lodges feel somewhat persecuted, if my 
post bag is anything to go by. One should remember that 
masons were persecuted by the Nazis. Indeed, clause 2 
would be something of a Nazi hit list, so I suggest that 
masons should be included proudly. I proposed the 
amendment principally so that the list should be 
somewhat more inclusive and for clause 2 to have a 
proper balance. Membership of a masonic lodge, a guild 
or a profession can constitute sensitive personal data to 
the person in question.
<P>
Government amendment No. 110 substantially 
improves paragraph (c). The clause was not very well 
drafted in its reference to other beliefs. The reference to 
beliefs of a similar nature puts such beliefs into the 
context of religion. That will make the Bill much clearer, 
although as my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale 
mentioned, the reference to philosophical beliefs was 
originally in the directive.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 is a little more narrowly drawn 
than my amendment. It excludes guilds and masonic 
lodges. Balance is important, and trade unions and 
business organisations should be included. It was pointed 
out that amendment No. 18's reference to health and sex 
life was also in the directive.
<P>
I return to clause 2(e)'s reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"physical or mental health or condition".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>I am not sure that the term "condition" is clear. The substitution of "health and sex life" would make the 
provision clearer. The Committee's job is to be precise. 
The term "condition" is not precise; it will cause argument 
and debate, and it will mean different things to different 
people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> Will the 
Minister clarify a couple of points? First, in relation to 
health or condition, genetic data has become increasingly 
important. It would be of great value to insurance 
companies to know whether somebody has a 
predisposition towards a health problem due to his or her 
genetic make up. Is the term "condition" intended to cover 
such data? How will genetic predispositions be caught 
within the context of sensitive data?
<P>
Secondly, will the Minister give an example in relation 
to the issue raised by the hon. Member for Poole
(Mr. Syms) about freemasons and membership of a 
masonic lodge? I am not expressing support for the 
amendment. It is, however, relevant to recent proposals 
by the Home Secretary about requiring people within the 
criminal justice system to declare such membership. What 
impact would the proposed provisions have in relation to 
requiring freemasons to give up information, and to the 
probation service, the Lord Chancellor and others having 
to hold data on freemason membership within their 
employment files?
<P>
The matter will be relevant in the context of other 
sensitive provisions that have already been accepted. For 
example, it would be relevant to an employer holding 
information on political opinion, and to a requirement for 
that information to be included in an employment 
contract.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Ian Taylor: For a moment, I thought that the hon. 
Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) was about to 
redefine constructive opposition as constructive support 
of the Opposition. He did not quite get to that stage.
<P>
The clause is very difficult, largely because, as I said 
earlier, the Bill's purpose is to facilitate movement of 
information in the new electronic age, and to ensure that 
such movement is free and unfettered throughout the 
European Economic Area. Therefore, a broad definition 
of sensitive personal data could well be a problem.






<P>
I do not oppose the principle that some data can be 
described as sensitive personal data. I am putting down a 
marker. The terms involved are wide in any event and are 
quite difficult to define. It is difficult to define his or her 
political opinions, and why they become sensitive 
personal data.
<P>
With regard to "religious or other beliefs", I agree with 
my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale about the term 
"philosophical". It was in the original directive. It is 
probable that the philosoph went into oblivion trying to 
find the third way. Nevertheless, I do not know why it 
should be included in the concept of sensitive personal 
data. We should be careful about defining such headings. 
I know that it was included because of the way in which 
the European Union works in terms of social partners. 
The trade unions are often mentioned as one side of that 
partnership, but in this case business affiliations were 
not mentioned.
<P>
A whole series of inconsistencies is evident. I share the 
concerns of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam. 
Having been the Minister responsible for science and 
technology, I am well aware of the problems of genetics, 
particularly in relation to insurance and employment. I 
should not wish to deny access to genetic information to 
employers and insurers, but it is important how that is 
handled. A dichotomy exists in my mind regarding 
striking a balance in such cases, and that dichotomy finds 
a parallel in the Bill.
<P>
The Bill must not be so descriptive that it is impossible 
subsequently to decide that certain genetic information 
should be made available to the insurance industry so that 
it can conduct its business of spreading risks. The proper 
commercial instinct of businesses particularly targeted 
direct selling operations to gather information about 
individuals' backgrounds and personal preferences may 
start to clash with the stipulations of the Bill. Because 
they cannot assemble data that is regarded as sensitive, 
companies may not be able to produce an accurate profile 
of the credit or sales target.
<P>
I shall now sit down to listen with great interest to the 
Minister's response to that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman will not have to 
sit for long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> We have had an interesting debate about 
an important part of the Bill. Sensitive data should, by 
definition, be treated in a different way frm the generality 
of data. That naturally imposes extra burdens on those 
who are responsible for dealing with it.
<P>
Listening to Opposition Members during the 
Committee's philosophical discussions, I was intrigued to 
discover that the Government's position is enlightened, 
tolerant, sophisticated and even liberal. It appears that 
Conservative Members are adopting a far more restrictive, 
big brother approach that would require larger quantities 
of sensitive data to be processed. That implies the 
imposition of extra burdens and responsibilities on those 
who control sensitive data. In each of their amendments, 
Conservative Members are seeking to broaden the 
definition of what is sensitive. If that would not result in 
extra burdens on business, then I, like the hon. Member 
for Ryedale, may well be a Dutchman. The philosophical 
debate has revealed, curiously, that it is now the 
Conservative party that seeks to interfere more 
extensively in the lives of individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is a gross distortion of the 
position. I made it clear that we are seeking to broaden 
the definition of clause 2(d) out of fairness. However, my 
amendments, which would reduce the current list of eight 
conditions to five, could hardly be described as creating 
additional burdens.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I hear the hon. Gentleman's words, but I 
am not persuaded by his determined efforts to stick his 
finger in a philosophical dyke. If his amendments were 
accepted, we would have to record detailed and sensitive 
data about those of us who might describe ourselves as 
existentialists. I am not aware of any evidence of 
widespread discrimination against existentialists. Perhaps 
a more practical illustration for the hon. Member for 
Ryedale, who may not have had the benefit, as I have, of 
studying the work of Jean-Paul Sartre, is that he would 
also extend the concept of sensitive data to membership 
of the Ryedale rotary club. I find that remarkable.
