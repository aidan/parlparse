</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 17, line 30, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(aa) Grant Maintained Schools.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 177, in page 18, line 13, after "area", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"subject to a ballot of the parents of children currently attending the school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 171, in schedule 2, page 93, line 38, leave out from "shall" to end of line 39 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"only be transferred to a new category following the approval of a majority of parents of children attending the school at that time.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> We come now to the heart of the Bill. The Government have frequently said on platforms during and after the general election campaign and in the White Paper that standards in education are more important than structure. Every time they say that, they receive a cheer from those involved in the daily delivery of the schools service and interested observers, who virtually all agree that they do not want another major upheaval in the structure of schools.
<P>
Yet, despite the principle set out in the White Paper that standards are more important than structure, the Bill devotes 75 clauses the whole of part II of the Bill to what is described as a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"new framework for maintained schools".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that the Government have avoided using the word "structure" in the Bill. What was previously referred to as "structure" is now referred to as "framework". The Bill devotes 75 clauses to establishing a new structure or framework for schools and the purpose of amendment No. 146 is to provide a peg for the Committee on which to hang a debate about the wisdom of introducing a major upheaval and its effect on grant-maintained schools.
<P>
Before it is pointed out to me by a well-briefed Labour Back Bencher, I must say that amendment No. 146 would write grant-maintained schools into the Bill as schools that are maintained by a local education authority. I want to test opinion in the Committee on the wisdom of leaving the grant-maintained structure intact. If the Committee is persuaded of the wisdom of such action, the Opposition stands ready to introduce other amendments that would give effect to it. I am sure that the Minister would not dream of advancing such an argument, but I thought that I should deal with the matter before a Labour Back Bencher leapt to his feet to do so.
<P>
The central purpose of re-writing the framework or structure of schools is to abolish the grant-maintained approach that was introduced by the previous Government and has been picked up by many successful schools during the past 10 years. It is contradictory for the Government to have sought, under the Bill, to abolish grant-maintained schools and the freedom that they enjoy, given that at our previous sitting we were discussing the establishment of education action zones. Although the substantive effect of such a provision became increasingly unclear, the Government, in their rhetoric, envisaged for schools within education action zones the type of freedom that grant-maintained schools have enjoyed as a result of their status. It is paradoxical that both approaches should be contained in the Bill and that the Committee should be invited to consider those contradictory approaches in consecutive sittings.
The overwhelming majority of schools that chose to adopt GM status with the support of parents have demonstrated its success. That is why we support greater freedom for those schools within education action zones. We cannot understand why the Government should extend those freedoms to more schools through education action zones, while removing those freedoms from schools that already use them to deliver high-quality education. Those schools want to see those freedoms maintained.
<P>
The policy is not merely paradoxical; it is self-contradictory. Amendment No. 146 and other amendments consequent upon it, which the Opposition are ready to introduce, would at least make the Bill internally consistent. We want to ensure that those schools that wish to enjoy greater freedoms of the sort that GM schools presently enjoy continue to have that freedom. We would introduce another version of the same idea. That would be not merely desirable, it would be more internally consistent.
<P>
I remind the Committee that GM status was chosen by the schools; it was a choice that was supported by parents. The Minister made great play during the previous sitting of the Government's willingness to introduce trial areas and to examine new ideas. That is exactly what was done with GM schools, which have demonstrated in practice that the ideas were successful. Evidence shows that the majority of schools wish to continue to develop new ideas; as the Minister said at the previous sitting, the Government find that idea attractive. I do not understand why the Government are prepared to allow pilots of new ideas in EAZs while closing down the schools that have picked up new ideas ideas that have been shown to be successful in pilot schemes.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Would not the right hon. Gentleman accept at least the logical position, if not the political position? We may agree about objectives, and perhaps identify problems, but if the proposed solution in this case, the GM school does more harm than good, it would be right to sweep it away and introduce a properly thought-through alternative to meet many of the objectives that the GM schools were supposed to have addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's finding that GM schools have been damaging. [Interruption.]
<P>
I must ask the Committee to excuse my coughing. The national health service has taken a terrible dive in recent months and has not been able to sustain me in my full state of health.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should consider the evidence of attainment by children in GM schools. The league tables of GCSE scores they were fiercely controversial when they were first published, but are now accepted by the Labour party show that scores of A to C were achieved by 53 per cent. of pupils in GM schools, against a national average of 43 per cent. and an average in local-authority schools of 40 per cent.
<P>
Before the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) leaps up, and before others think to themselves that that is the result of selection, that defence is not open to them. Comparing non-selective schools GM with non-GM the A to C results achieved by 45.6 per cent. of pupils in non-selective GM schools should be compared with the national average of 40 per cent. and the 38.5 per cent. achieved by LEA schools. By that measure, GM schools have been successful.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Surely the right hon. Gentleman would accept that you cannot cherry-pick which measures of success you look at; you must look across the board and take account of inputs as well as outputs? What about the extra funding and the bribes that encouraged schools to change their status? What about the fact that those schools are self-selecting, so their inputs are often atypical?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Both the shadow Minister and the hon. Gentleman are using the word "you". I have done none of the things that they have mentioned.
<P>
It is quite warm today, so hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets. Hon. Ladies, of course, are free to dress as they like.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for relaxing the rules. I feel much better now.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk says that I should not be selective when I consider indicators of success. I happen to agree with him, so let us look at one or two other indicators of the success of GM schools. In the league tables published last year, 50 per cent. of the top 100 schools for A-levels were GM schools. The measures of improvement, which take account of the point made by the hon. Gentleman figures published by the Department of Education and Employment, not by Tory central office [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a lot of murmuring, semi-heckling or whatever this morning, perhaps because of the late night and lack of sleep. Please listen to hon. Members when they are speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I was focusing the attention of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk on measures of school improvement, which take account of the point that he was making. The tables published by the Department reveal that 240 schools out of more than 5,000 improved every year for the past four years, and one in three of those were granted maintained.
<P>
The case that we make his two fold. First, there is objective evidence that GM schools perform well, measured by absolute attainment and relative to other schools they are over-represented in the tables of schools that have improved. Secondly, GM status reflects the choice of the professionals working in those schools and of the parents who choose to send their children to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Before the right hon. Gentleman moves on from that point, will he answer the question of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk? The hon. Gentleman was trying to get the right hon. Gentleman to accept that one of the reasons for the improvements that he has described if they really happened and there is disagreement about that might have been the significant additional funding that GM schools have received. Will he at least acknowledge that the Public Accounts Committee said that double funding was "unacceptable" and that the cash protection element meant that GM schools received œ26.4 million extra even excluding the additional money that they received for other duties? Will he acknowledge that that could be a factor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No, I do not acknowledge that. It is true that the availability of cash to a school is a major influence on the opportunities that are open to it and its children. That is one of the reasons why I am not persuaded by the Government's boasting about their school spending record, especially given this spring's local authority budgeting decisions on the money available to individual schools.
<P>
Cash is a factor. However, the principle behind GM schools was that the resources that were available to support a particular child's education should be available in their entirety to the management of the school, not partly to the school and partly to the LEA. A GM school's management could then determine whether the interests of the children were best served by spending money on services provided within the school or by buying in services from outside, whether from the LEA or someone else. That is the principle behind the financing of GM schools a principle that the Government accept, at least in the abstract. I have heard the Minister saying that the financing regime for GM schools is the gold standard to which the regime for other schools should be raised. I agree: we shall no doubt debate that later.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No, I am responding to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster).
<P>
The experience of GM schools has demonstrated that giving schools responsibility for decisions about allocation of resources results in better value educational output, in terms of the attainment standards to which I have referred, and efficient provision for overheads such as building maintenance. Numerous anecdotes demonstrate that schools have delivered better value by taking responsibility for managing expenditure themselves. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Bath will no doubt develop his point: I also look forward to hearing from him what The Bath Chronicle has to say on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way because he is deliberately failing to address the point that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk and I have raised. The question is not whether there is sufficient delegation from LEAs or how that money is used. The right hon. Gentleman should accept the point highlighted in the 9th report of the Public Accounts Commission, which was published on 19 January 1994 that cash protection meant that GM schools received significant additional sums, in addition to the money that might more appropriately have been delegated by the LEA to individual schools. Does the right hon. Gentleman acknowledge that they received that money; does he think that that was, as the PAC said, unacceptable; and does he agree that that money may have had something to do with raising the standards in the way that he alleges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Interestingly, over the past six month I have had many discussions about GM prinicples with heads and governors of GM schools and with surrounding local authority schools in many parts of the country. I do not deny that schools that are not GM are concerned about the effect of GM status, but they do not focus on the kind of argument that the hon. Member for Bath puts forward. If the only issue between us on the desirability of GM status is some fine tuning of the funding formula, I would be happy to discuss that with him outside the Committee, and outside the context of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman takes one issue as the basis of his argument, forgetting that he has consistently sought to oppose the freedoms that allow GM heads and governors to develop the service they offer to improve children's education.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for participating in debate on this key issue. We are, as I said, united about certain objectives. However, could he give examples of the powers that he believes were essential to creating the key strengths of a GM school and that were not available to an LEA that adopted best practice? If he can explain that, I shall perhaps understand his argument better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall explain it extremely simply to the hon. Gentleman. Money should flow to heads and governors, and they should decide how best to meet the needs of the children in their school. I am not saying that LEAs have no role; but there is a debate to be had about that. I tabled an amendment earlier that focused on failing schools, special needs and so on. However, in the majority of cases where a parent and a child are content with a school, decisions should be taken within the school and money should flow in a way that reflects that decision-making system.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman be specific: what money is not being delegated by an LEA following good practice? Surely he would not argue that school transport, for example, can properly be delegated. Can you give us examples of the sort of delegation that occurs under the GM system that you believe is critical that does not already occur under an LEA that follows good practice when making distributions through the local management of schools?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will not, but I am sure that the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk misses the point. He starts with the proposition that money should be available to an LEA and suggests that we test how much it delegates. That is to look at the matter the wrong way round. Where a school chooses I do not argue that it should be compulsory to be responsible for the whole expenditure devoted to a child's education, on the grant-maintained model, that option should remain open.
<P>
It should not be a question of judging, as the hon. Gentleman seeks to do, how much money should go to the LEA and how much should go to the school; it should all go to the school, and it should be for the school to determine where money can best be used to meet the needs of individual children. The amendment gives the Committee the opportunity to write that essential principle into the Bill, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I rise briefly to support the amendment and the case made so eloquently by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. The key principle behind the amendment and grant-maintained schools is parental choice to which we have referred time and again, and which is somewhat stronger that the Government's preferred principle of parental preference.
<P>
I make no apology for citing examples from my constituency, where parents have voted for grant-maintained status because it is what they want. At my old school, Altrincham grammar school, 78 per cent. of parents voted; 75 per cent. voted for GM status. At Ashton-on-Mersey school, 73 per cent. of parents voted, of whom 76 per cent. voted for GM status. At Blessed Thomas Holford school, 64 per cent. of parents voted, of whom 84 per cent. voted for GM status. Parents wanted grant-maintained status and voted for it.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I accept the right hon. Gentleman's argument about parental choice in GM schools, but what about choice for parents in neighbouring schools, who found that their school's funding in particular, section 11 funding, which was focused on those who most needed it was cut to support GM schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am not aware of any of my local schools having had their budget reduced as a result of GM status being introduced. I am also in a happy position virtually all my local secondary schools went grant-maintained. That shows how the system works at its best; it is a pity that the Government are seeking to prevent its expansion to benefit all schools, parents and children. The principle is popular not only with parents but with the staff and heads of those schools. I am not aware that the headmaster of any of those schools regrets the decision to gain GM status and wants to move back.
[Mr. Brady]
<P>
Where something is working, is popular with parents and reflects the choice of parents and staff, it should be maintained. It is quite wrong for the Government to interfere to try to undermine that choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He said that he was not aware that additional money for grant-maintained schools had been provided to the detriment of other schools under his local education authority. Paragraph 22 of the Public Accounts Committee report of 19 January 1994 mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unnecessary payments to grant-maintained schools of some œ13.6 million to the detriment of some local authorities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is clear evidence that the additional money that went to grant-maintained schools was given to the detriment of LEAs, and therefore of the schools remaining within the LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On the contrary, I was answering the question from the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). Her question was whether other schools in the surrounding area were detrimentally affected. I said that I was not aware of any school in my area that had a reduced budget [Interruption.] I am speaking about an area that has a great many grant-maintained schools. In fact, it probably has a greater concentration of GM schools than any other area in the country. Whether there are isolated examples of other things happening, I cannot say. But, in principle, if any one area has a large number of grant-maintained schools, it is logical and appropriate that the LEA budget should be reduced to reflect that. I think that that is perfectly reasonable.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, under the previous Government's policy, money was taken from the LEA by the GM schools, and the larger that sum, which was recognised both locally and nationally as being disproportionate to their need, the smaller the sum that was left to divide among the rest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The result of that policy, which we have been happy to defend, was that money went to schools directly. It was given to governors and heads to spend as they thought best for their schools. It is entirely appropriate that decisions on school expenditure should be made at that level rather than at the rather inefficient level of the LEA. Tragically, in most instances, money had not been spent to obtain best value. Most of the GM schools found time and again that they obtained better value in the purchase of any one of a number of services than they ever did from the LEA. They still find that, when the LEA tenders to offer services to the GM schools.
<P>
I do not accept the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk because it is not valid. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood referred to the success of GM schools and their academic results. I shall not repeat the figures which speak for themselves.
<P>
<B>Helen Jones (Warrington, North):</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if a school can select its intake on academic ability, as many GM schools do, it should achieve better exam results than a school that cannot select its intake? It is no reflection on the teaching standards or organisation of the school. It would be wrong if such GM schools did not achieve those results.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall happily go much further. I believe that all the evidence suggests that all the schools in selective areas not only those that select achieve better results. My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood gave figures showing beyond question that GM schools, whether selective or non-selective, achieve better results than LEA schools. Thirty of the top 100 improving schools are GM schools a figure that the Government should take seriously, given what I am sure is a principled and intelligent desire to improve standards in education. If the system is working and GM schools are at the forefront of that achievement, the Government should be embracing rather than trying to abolish them.
<P>
Returning to the specific point about selection in grant-maintained schools, I am delighted to have the opportunity to refer once again to one of the very best local schools in my area the Ashton-on-Mersey school. It does indeed select its intake; it is selected from the local Manchester overspill estate and 23 per cent. of its pupils are on free school meals. None the less, it achieves tremendous results. Since becoming grant maintained, it has a much lower pupil:teacher ratio, more support staff, including a new librarian, a school nurse, an IT technician and two classroom assistants. In 1994 and 1997, it was awarded the charter mark. It has recently become a sports college and this year, for the second time, I am delighted to say that it has been given an outstanding salute. [Interruption.]
<P>
There is a Second Reading speech within me, as the Minister appears to have noted. However, a second award of outstanding status from Ofsted to that school shows beyond any question or doubt that it is not just selective schools that achieve great results in the GM sector. Here we have a fine school, serving the local community, which does not select by academic ability or, indeed, any other criteria.
<P>
We have shown that the benefits of GM status are not just about funding, although value for money is vital. The GM schools have achieved better value for money and the Government would be wise to reflect on the improved standards of services that the GM schools have obtained in return for the money they have spent.
<P>
The issue is about freedom, responsibility and giving pride to the schools that run themselves. The proof is not only in the results, but the improvement in those results in selective schools, non-selective schools and in areas where there is no selective education. I am happy to support the amendment.
 <P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): I return to the original challenge issued by the right hon. Member for Charnwood. He asked whether there was a contradiction between the Government wishing to set up education action zones to pursue innovation and perhaps go beyond the traditional LEA model and what he thinks is the Government's intention to restrict the freedom of grant-maintained schools to pursue a similar course.
<P>
The right. hon. Gentleman made two fundamental errors. First, he was considering schools in isolation. All his analysis was based on particular schools. He failed to take into account that it is the Government's duty to ensure that schools serve the needs of the community. An education service must meet the needs of a town in an organised and proper way. Secondly, he did not understand the difference between co-operation and competition in education.
<P>
The purpose behind education action zones is to enable a group of schools to work co-operatively to push up standards. The grant-maintained movement puts schools into sharp competition. I know that from experience because, before May, I taught in a grant-maintained school in a town where all the high schools, bar one, were grant-maintained. Competition was so fierce that schools spent much time and much of their budgets trying to compete for pupils, as a result of which there was poaching from feeder schools. There was no overall coherent admission system; it was chaotic. Parents were trying to exercise choice, but were often not able to do so because of appeals that did not go their way.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): Grant-maintained schools did not just work in isolation. It was because GM schools were in a certain area that other schools suddenly had to look at what they did and what they could offer parents. The hon. Gentleman described such practice as competition and that word should not be derided in the context of education. Such action made other schools look at what they did, which necessarily helped other pupils not only those in GM schools. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Some heckling is taking place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> If the model put forward by the hon. Lady was so successful, I wonder why there were not more grant-maintained schools in Devon.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman why. The constituency of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) is 60 miles away from mine. Every time a school in my constituency applied to the Liberal Democrat-controlled, Labour-assisted, county council, to become grant maintained, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport and his trade union chums intervened with parents, schools and the LEA and they put the mockers on the whole issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> I will not comment further on Devon. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am having difficulty hearing the hon. Gentleman. I do not know what is happening this morning. The Committee is badly behaved. Indeed, if I had recourse to giving out lines, I would consider giving them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I will return to the part of the country that I worked in and know, where schools competed so desperately that many desperate measures were taken simply to try to attract extra pupils to those schools. That resulted not only in a chaotic admissions policy, but bad feeling between schools, head teachers and staff, which often spilled over to pupils, stoking up feelings that went far beyond traditional school rivalries.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) suggested that competition will somehow drive up standards because best practice and knowledge will spread, but I know from experience that the opposite is true. When introducing a new system of school management, of which the school was very proud, we were told, "Don't tell the others. We must keep this for ourselves to get the edge on the others." How can we be involved in education while being told to restrict the spread of knowledge and good practice?
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood referred to league tables. We know the weakness of league tables they depend on school intakes, selection and so on. League tables do not prove that GM status was a miracle cure that drove up standards.
<P>
To serve the real education needs of towns and communities, we need a coherent system of education. When schools either in clusters, or one by one applied for GM status, there was no coherent system of education for a town. I accept that good things were done within individual GM schools. They were not bad schools; their staff worked hard and some good and interesting ideas came forth.
<P>
The new framework proposed in the Bill will provide the coherence for admissions and the running of schools that is needed in communities. If the right hon. Member for Charnwood reads the Bill, he will see that GM schools will still be allowed freedom to develop their policies and ideas, but they will be given freedom without favour. That is very important.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): Over the years since the concept of GM schools was first introduced, I have heard members of the Labour party use several arguments against it. We were told that it was wrong for schools to be allowed to leave LEA control. We were told that it was wrong as several hon. Members have said this morning for certain schools, other than those under LEA control, to be given any extra money. When it was proposed that GM schools should have the power to offer their teaching staff different terms and conditions, it was said that that was inappropriate. This morning, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said that he thought it inappropriate to applaud their results because GM schools were self-selecting.
<P>
It was thought that the Labour party genuinely believed in all those arguments, many of which have been reiterated this morning, but what does the Labour party now say in government? All the arguments that Labour Members used against the GM concept have been turned on their head. The Government are introducing all those things as part of the concept of the education action zone.
<P>
Schools in such zones will be taken out of the day-to-day running of LEAs. Such schools will receive more money, they will be able to offer their teaching staff different terms and conditions of employment and they will be self-selecting because the Secretary of State will accept an application only when the governing body of a school has agreed to it.
[Mrs. Theresa May]
<P>
The Government are now applauding those policies as reasons for accepting EAZs as a new, innovative way forward for this country's educational framework. Those who look in on the debate will make their own judgment about the way that the Government have turned on its head their original argument against grant-maintained status.
<P>
To give the Government their due, they appear to be going even further and I was particularly interested in the comments from the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. As the Minister for School Standards made clear in our debate on education action zones on Tuesday, the Government would be happy not only to take schools out of the day-to-day control of local education authorities and give them more money and allow them different terms and conditions for their teachers but to allow private sector businesses to come in and run them. That was not the idea in grant-maintained schools, although financing from private sector business was the concept behind the city technology colleges, many of which were successful.
<P>
Having argued against grant-maintained schools when in opposition, the Government now accept all the concepts behind them. It is, therefore, paradoxical that they have refused to accept that the concept of grant-maintained status should be retained in the Bill. It has been argued that grant-maintained schools should not worry about being under LEA control; that if an LEA is following good practice, schools should be perfectly happy; and that somehow LEA control is never inappropriate. I refer hon. Members who agree to the speech made by the Minister for School Standards in our debate on Tuesday morning. He gave examples of circumstances in which schools might choose to be part of an EAZ and his second example was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where a group of schools or parents feel that the local education authority has not been challenging enough and the school should be doing better." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 3 February 1988; c. 241.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The concept of grant-maintained status that a school could remove itself from LEA control because it thought that it could do better without it has been accepted in the proposals for EAZs. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, assuming that he will argue against the amendment and therefore against the policies that he advanced to the Committee on Tuesday.
<P>
We have been told that EAZs are about being innovative and meeting new challenges. What was the purpose of grant-maintained status but to give schools the freedom to be innovative, to meet new challenges and to make decisions for themselves? That is what EAZs are about. The Minister told us that the government will look for a new education system for the next century that will include flexibility and innovation. He said that education will not be like it has been in the past, and the implication was that the Government will seek diversity.
<P>
If the Government believe in the principles that lie behind their EAZs including the need to accept innovation and challenge, and to set a new framework for education for the next century that is based on flexibility and diversity, they should have no problem with the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Conservative Members speaking in support of the amendment have attempted to portray the grant-maintained experiment that started in 1988 as some form of nirvana that has benefited all schools. Indeed, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) seemed to be transported into seventh heaven on the subject. But if that blissful state has existed, why, despite nine years of a steady drip of psychological and financial inducement, did only 1,200 out of 24,000 schools opt for it? Why did only 3 per cent. of Church of England schools opt for grant-maintained status? One of the reasons was that the process started to unravel and people realised that they were being presented with a false prospectus.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The previous Government's initiatives on grant-maintained schools set parents against parents in schools and outside. I assure the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West that the number of votes on grant-maintained status in his area was nowhere near as convincing and conclusive as he suggested. Head teachers were set against teachers, and, even more embarrassingly for Opposition Members members of that education authority were set against the Government. The chairman of the Bromley education committee resigned in 1991 in protest against opting out. The Tory chairman of Hampshire county council described grant-maintained status as "morally flawed". He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a political decision which we, as Tories, will bitterly regret."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the reality of many aspects of grant-maintained status. I agree with my hon. Friends that, of course, good work was done in those areas, but the general response was that, where difficulties existed, the remedy was often far worse than the disease. I sometimes think that if Conservative Members had found themselves on the Titanic, they would react by privatising the lifeboats: that is very much their approach towards grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Good idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> Well, if that were the case, the number of first-class passengers who survived on the Titanic would have been even greater. The same cherry-picking approach characterised Opposition Members in the privatisation of train operating companies, and in the internal market of the national health service.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West made great play of what happened in his area. It is reasonable on these occasions to introduce ad hominem or even ad feminem arguments, but they are not, of course, conclusive. I give the example of my borough, Blackpool, where no schools became grant maintained. The reasons were interesting. In April this year, Blackpool will become a unitary authority but, prior to that, schools were under the control of Lancashire county council's education authority. Under Labour control from the late 1980s onwards, that authority steadily increased its spending on education and its input into schools, and went from being one of the worst authorities in the country to being one of the best performers. That was why parents from Warbreck school in Blackpool decisively defeated the proposal that they become grant maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> One reason Lancashire county council increased spending on education during that period was the competition from grant-maintained schools and the fear that it would lose its schools to grant-maintained status. Here is an example of GM schools even benefiting schools which did not change to that status.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I am sorry to disabuse the hon. Gentleman, but his chronology is suspect. Lancashire county council increased its spending long before the grant-maintained initiative got under way.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and the right hon. Member for Charnwood questioned our proposal, suggesting that it was similar to what happens in education action zones and asking why we were making it. They have both failed to realise the crucial distinction: EAZs are about co-operation, not competition. EAZs are about groups of schools coming together, not about one school striking out on its own.
<P>
A comment on the GM consultation process in and around Blackpool came from the headmaster of a voluntary-aided school in my constituency.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The same market forces pressure ... has promised unhealthy competition between schools; this has diminished networking, support and sharing of good practice between local schools."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If Lancashire had practised the sort of cherry picking that occurred in the constituency of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, and elsewhere, we in Blackpool would be nowhere near as well equipped to take up the responsibilities of a unitary authority in April.
<P>
Conservative Members, when they were in government, behaved like Maoists in their treatment of the education system; they behaved as if they believed in the concept of permanent revolution. The Bill attempts to recognise the existing situation and to put forward principles and a framework to promote co-operation between schools, rather than restarting the educational wars that were suffered under the previous Government.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) referred during a previous sitting to Queen Elizabeth I not wanting to make a window into a man's soul. One of the reasons for that was that she was content for people to live their own lives as long as they subscribed to the co-operation of the body politic in this case, to a common educational policy. [Interruption.] That is what we are trying to achieve in the Bill. That is why the GM experiment was so morally flawed and dubious. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am having difficulty in concentrating on the hon. Member's speech because so many conversations are going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The Opposition's arguments for the GM system are morally and practically flawed, which is why I invite the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis (Harrogate and Knaresborough):</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bath and I would have a great deal more sympathy with the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) if the Government were not proposing GM status by default. The Government have argued strongly against grant-maintained schools, yet they now propose a category of school that allows GM schools to continue in another guise [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Conversations are erupting all over the place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. It is good to see you bringing right hon. and hon. Members into line.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is quite right I was not being specific, because I could not be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> During his opening remarks, the right hon. Member for Charnwood croaked, and blamed the national health service for his lack of good health. As he was once responsible for the NHS, his comment was perfectly apt. He croaked when saying that GM schools had done no damage. I am not familiar with many GM schools there are not many in Leeds, where I used to work, or in north Yorkshire, which I now represent. However, I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that he croaked on those words because the Lord looked on him at that moment and sent down a bolt.
<P>
The damage was done not by the schools themselves, but by the process of moving to GM status. The previous Government saying, perhaps in a Maoist way, that all schools should be grant maintained, created an enormous amount of difficulty. In north Yorkshire, only one small village primary school opted out. That school was in Nun Monkton and it had only 13 children. The local education authority proposed closing the school because of the budgetary constraints imposed by the Conservative Government. The council was spending at the cap it was spending every penny. There was no division between the political groups on North Yorkshire county council. The council achieved much consensus on education, both before it became hung and since.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Balanced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bath is always correcting my terminology, because I am new. Whether a balanced council or a minority administration, the political groups are very much the same. The previous Secretary of State decided, for dogmatic and party political reasons, to give that school GM status, even though she recognised the difficulties that would be caused for North Yorkshire county council's budget.
<P>
In my constituency, there are five superb schools for 11 to 18-year-olds and an extremely good further education college. That group of schools and the college work together to provide a quality of education that rivals, if not exceeds, that to which the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West constantly refers. Two of those schools are constantly among the top 100 comprehensive schools, according to every measure, and all have had brilliant Ofsted reports. They work[Mr. Willis]
together in concert, they are not rivals. They offer different packages there is a Roman Catholic school, a Church of England school and three other comprehensives, each of which has its own identity. Then a Secretary of State came along and wanted, for party political reasons, one of the schools to opt out. The town of Harrogate was divided over the issue and a bitter battle split not only that school community, but the other school communities. The result was to be announced on the day that the Tory central council was to be in Harrogate for its meeting the Secretary of State was to come and congratulate the school on opting out. In fact, 80 per cent. of the parents voted against opting out and Harrogate schools were saved from a division that would have caused great problems.
<P>
Although the amendment will not be passed, if it were we would have to return to those days; and schools could again apply for GM status. That vital point has been missed in our debate. We must not return to that division within our school communities. We must try to rebuild a comprehensive system that gives all children access to resources and to a quality education.

<P>

<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I rise because I would like to make it clear that while there is much that divides our schools we can lay some blame for that on the GM school initiative the difficulty that the previous Government had, from an LEA perspective, is that while they often identified problems correctly, they believed that those who agreed about the problem but disagreed with the solution that they proposed were not intent on achieving the shared objectives. For many years, I belonged to an LEA that was part of the education problem. It was dead-hand, low-spending, overly bureaucratic, narrow-minded, inefficient and had all the problems that rightly led many in education to demand change. I shall not repeat the long list of reasons why the GM system was not the correct cure for those problems. Over the course of our proceedings, the Opposition have correctly identified the problems and found a different solution to them by recognising that class size matters thereby making a dramatic shift in policy. They could therefore also recognise that there is considerable merit in trying to bury the divide of the GM experiment over the past decade and to find a way forward that unites us.
<P>
Good LEAs will now delegate where it is sensible to do so. When I had greater influence as chairman of the education committee in a hung council, I believed that we should delegate unless schools believed we should not. If an LEA has a proper relationship with its schools, the schools feel that belonging to an LEA is like belonging to a club that helps them to achieve what they could not achieve on their own. An LEA's decisions can be constructively influenced, although the buck should stop with the LEA.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
During the past year or two in Norfolk, when we have consulted on delegation, it has been increasingly argued that we should delegate no further that we would risk introducing inefficiency into the system if we delegated further functions. The schools identified a range of functions such as in-service training and specialist provision for special educational needs as best done by the LEA and not delegated to schools.
<P>
The Government have recognised the truism that we should delegate authority to the school to decide how it spends money. I remember that some years ago a school of which I was a governor had to undertake a bureaucratic process even to place an advertisement in a newspaper to replace a member of staff. All too often, by the time the bureaucracy had been gone through, the school was too late to obtain the best member of staff. All that needed to be swept aside.
<P>
To be fair to those responsible for the system in the past, we must also recognise that new opportunities presented by information technology, for example, have allowed delegation and the making of management decisions at different levels than was previously possible. The opportunities that information technology will continue to present for delegated management must be taken fully into account because they are important to efficiency. We must keep asking whether some things that have historically been best done at the centre should be delegated, because information technology often allows that, sometimes at minimal cost.
<P>
I remember arguments about GM status in Norfolk other members of the Committee must remember such arguments when the case put to parents was that the Government were offering bribes, to put it bluntly. The argument put by the majority of schools for maintaining an LEA system was that a good LEA allowed the benefits of co-operative ventures, to which other members of the Committee have already referred.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) raised the question of whether we are in danger of maintaining a big divide and preventing progress by introducing foundation schools. That question was raised during discussions I held in Norfolk on the White Paper, mostly by schools which had remained in the LEA sector. In some cases, people had not carefully read the Government's proposals.
<P>
The Government have defused an argument that was raised by the GM sector that a new Government would punish GM schools for having opted out of the system. There has been concern nationally, as well as in Norfolk, that the changes proposed by the Government would be vindictive. However, the compromise proposed in the Bill should be acceptable to both sides. The Government have removed the real causes of problems in the LEA sector with GM schools, and have given reassurance to the best schools.
<P>
Where there was a bad LEA, it was schools that were the most thwarted by the LEA that opted out. They were self-selecting, which is why I suggested to the right hon. Member for Charnwood that we should not look simply at their results. Sometimes good schools, with good heads and good governors, wanted to break away from a poor LEA. They should be given a clear path forward and made to feel secure about what the Government are offering. If you are to bury the arguments and problems created by GM schools, you must proceed with care. The care with which the issue has been considered is not reflected by the number of words used in drafting the Bill. You do not reflect the importance of an objective in how long it takes you to phrase it.
<P>
If we deal properly now with the damage done by the GM experiment, we can spend the next decade raising standards, which is what the Bill is about.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman used the word "you" many times. I did not interrupt him because he is a new Member. However, I caution him not to use it because it might get him into trouble Downstairs.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> This has been a useful debate. Both sides of the Committee hold strong views on grant-maintained schools and the impact that they have had on the education service. The debate has given us the opportunity to illustrate the differing views held.
<P>
I hope to describe a way forward that will build on the best of what we can learn from the grant-maintained sector. I shall explain why we can learn from those things that the grant-maintained sector has done well, but we must consider the problems caused by its existence. We must take a balanced view that builds on the best of the grant-maintained sector, but does so in a way that will benefit all schools.
<P>
The Labour party had difficulty formulating policy towards the grant-maintained sector. When my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I were Opposition Whips, we talked to a group of Labour councillors in Brighton in 1995 just after we had published our policy document, which for the first time outlined the fact that we wanted to move to three categories of schools. Among them was the foundation category. Although we were Whips, we went to Brighton not to exert discipline we cannot discipline Labour councillors [hon. Members: "Oh!"] We could not in those days, anyway. We want to promote the Opposition's policy of that time.
<P>
We engaged in arguments that continued until the Labour party conference that was held in Brighton, where a full debate took place. Lord Hattersley opposed our policy vigorously, but the then Opposition spokesman, now the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, took that argument on. As a result, the Labour party overwhelmingly endorsed the policy that is reflected in the Bill. That policy is based on three categories of school: foundation, voluntary and community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister remind the Committee whether the reference to the new structure for schools that is covered by the clause appeared in the Labour party's manifesto at the last election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, it did. I will provide the hon. Gentleman with a copy of the manifesto that was put to electorate. I was at the meeting that agreed that that commitment would appear in the manifesto, so I am very conscious that it was there.
<P>
The Labour party's policy in opposition is now reflected in the Bill. It recognises that the grant-maintained sector has experience from which we should learn. We should seek to extend the power of self-management, which was given to grant-maintained schools, to all schools. Self-management has benefited individual schools. When taken with local management and the delegation of budgetary powers, it has given schools freedom to determine their own priorities and to decide how their own budgets should be spent.
<P>
When we reach the clauses on local management and the delegation of budgets, I will provide a paper to the Committee which will consider the procedures that currently apply to the grant-maintained sector. We must then debate whether that is the appropriate model for all schools, or whether other efficiencies might be achieved from of a slightly different approach. We can learn and build on the benefits.
<P>
However, there have been disadvantages to other schools with regard to admissions and funding as a result of the grant-maintained sector, and I want to address those two issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): The Minister has just confirmed that the only reason for striking down grant-maintained schools is political. He has no objection to their practical operations or the benefits that they bring. Will he explain the impact on the public sector borrowing requirement of bringing GM schools back into the LEA, given that some of the capital spending on GM schools is outside the PSBR? What will be the onward impact on the PSBR in future years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman will need to update himself because, with effect from the middle of December, capital expenditure by the GM sector is now counted as part of the PSBR. The Office for National Statistics, which is an independent body 
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> How very convenient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is independent. If it were not, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it would not have put more money into the PSBR. In the middle of December, it reclassified capital spending by the GM sector as being a call on the PSBR. Two things are happening as a result: first, we have agreement from the Treasury to underwrite the addition on PSBR, so there will be no loss to the GM sector; secondly, we are making the strongest representations to the ONS to reconsider the classification that it arrived at in December. We hope that it will agree to maintain the present classification, but time will tell. It is an independent body and it will make up its own mind.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was hoping to hear some figures from the Minister. If he is successful in his appeal for the capital spending of the GM sector to be reclassified, what will be the effect on the PSBR of those schools coming back to the LEA sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is no question of schools coming back within the LEA sector. The hon. Gentleman needs to read the Bill in detail to see what is being proposed. On the specifics of GM capital spending and the PSBR, the point that I made clearly was that there has been a reclassification. Whether we move to foundation status or retain the GM status, as reflected in the amendment, capital spending in the GM sector now counts as part of the PSBR. Therefore, it does not matter whether it is the GM sector or the foundation sector, it is now a call on the PSBR.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not want to detain the Minister, but will he clarify what he meant when he said that there[Mr. Dorrell]
was no question of schools coming back within the local authority sector? GM schools are funded directly by the Funding Agency for Schools, so are outside the ambit of local authority responsibility. Surely the purpose of the Bill is precisely what the Minister, probably through a slip of the tongue, said there was no question of: GM schools will be brought within the local authority sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We cannot just debate what we mean by the local authority sector. On the issue of finance, about which I shall say more shortly, the financial arrangements will be directed from central Government through local education authorities to individual schools. We shall be debating shortly the arrangements for delegating budgets and local management. With regard to admissions, foundation schools will be their own admissions authority, so they will have a certain freedom, but they will have to operate within the code of practice that we shall discuss when we come to clauses 76 and 77.
<P>
It is not a matter of local education authority control I am not sure that I would call it the local authority sector, but it becomes an exercise in semantics. The budgets will move from central Government, through the local education authority to individual schools. The key is the procedure for and the policy on the delegation of budgets and local management. How much of the money that is allocated from central Government to the local education authorities is passed on to individual schools? We shall be debating that key issue in the next week or two.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford talked about dogma. Our approach has not been based on that. Some of us have attended difficult meetings where we were shouted at because we were willing to adopt a constructive approach so that we would come up with a good policy. At times, it would have been much easier for us to have reverted to dogma and to have said, "Yes, we'll go for abolition. We will kill off any good things that have come from the grant-maintained school experience." We have not done that. We have said that we will build on that which was valuable, but that we will do so in a fairer context. The Bill achieves that balance.
<P>
Let us think back to the creation of the grant-maintained sector. When I was in Harrogate, I picked up from one of its good bookshops a remaindered copy of Nigel Lawson's "The View from No. 11: Memoirs of a Tory Radical." I do not recommend it to members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> There are many unsold copies of Norman Lamont's book, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, a remaindered Mr. Lamont.
<P>
In his book, Lord Lawson described a meeting that he had with Baroness Thatcher in 1986, when she was enraged because she had discovered that local education authorities were spending œ550 million more than central Government felt they should spend. She said that they must be kept under control and said to her then Chancellor, "Nigel, what are we going to do?" although she probably never called him Nigel.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): Oh, but she did! It was all very friendly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That changed later Lord Lawson was called Nigel only until Sir Alan Walters arrived on the scene.
<P>
In response to Baroness Thatcher, Lord Lawson said, "I'm not really sure. We could go for abolition. That would be the obvious thing." Baroness Thatcher said that there must be a more diplomatic way in which to approach the matter without it being regarded as the abolition of local education authorities. She approached the then Education Secretary, now Lord Baker, and said that they needed to think about how to keep LEAs under control.
<P>
Not much work was done until the Conservative party came up with the concept of grant-maintained schools in the 1987 election manifesto. Lord Baker now admits that no details had been worked out, but the Tories thought that it was important to allow schools to opt out of LEA control. That was why, at the famous press conference during the 1987 general election campaign when someone asked how many schools did the Conservative party believe would opt out, Lord Baker said that there would be about 50 only to be handbagged immediately by Baroness Thatcher and told to say, "No, at least a few thousand in the lifetime of the next Government." That was dogma working. No thought had been given to the policy; it was just put into the Conservative manifesto that schools should be able to opt out of LEA control.
<P>
In contrast, the policy in this Bill was the result of three years work, going through the arguments and coming up with a balanced framework it is a framework because there is flexibility within it that will ensure that all schools benefit.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I admire the Minister's spirit. Initially, the Bill was to be on the stocks early in this Parliament; it was then described as a Bill for the autumn but it did not reach the Floor of the House until the last day before the House rose for Christmas. If ever there were a classic example of election promises that then had to be worked out in detail once the Labour party came to power, it must be this Bill. We do not need any lessons from the hon. Gentleman about Conservative education Bills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The difference between this Bill and the raft of Bills that were introduced under the Conservative regime is that we consulted on the details of a White Paper that we produced within 10 weeks of taking office. Full consultation was undertaken and, at the end of that process, we drafted the Bill. Yes, we have made changes. We still have three categories, but we now have a voluntary category rather than a former-aided category because we listened to the Church authorities about a new partnership. I make no apology for listening and ensuring that, as result of the consultation, the Bill before the Committee is far better. We are putting forward the interests of the partners in the education service to ensure that the children in the school system benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Before the Minister moves on from the issue of dogma and the decision taken by Baroness Thatcher, is he aware that I happened to be present when Lord Baker was whisked off to take a telephone call from No. 10 Downing street? He returned fuming, using words somewhat similar to, "That stupid woman, she's now invented yet another new type of school." Later that day, he had to announce the introduction of city technology colleges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That was very informative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> In a moment we want to tell our tales of experiences with Conservative Secretaries of State. I was at a conference with the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor), the then Secretary of State, when he was summoned to take a phone call in the car park on a mobile phone, only to be told that he was being sacked as Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel:</B> Shame.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It was a shame. The right hon. Gentleman was moved, but, given his reaction, I think that he regarded it as a sacking. That was the way in which Baroness Thatcher conducted her Cabinet. Talking of Tory Cabinets, I shall give way to the right hon. Member for Charnwood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I hope that we can come to the end of this trip down memory lane in a moment. I caution the Minister against agreeing too much with what the hon. Member for Bath says about CTCs, because the Government are pursuing that clearly successful Conservative policy. I welcome that; I only wish that the Government had the same capacity to learn from the successful experience of GM schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That illustrates the Government's approach. Where we think an initiative is working well that might be said of CTCs we shall develop it. For example, we are expanding specialist schools, but we are doing so slightly differently, so that their benefits can be shared around more than under the previous Government. We have considered the GM experience and we have agreed that there are things from which we can learn self-management and delegation of budgets are good, and we want to build on them. However, there are disadvantages to the wider school system funding and admissions.
<P>
Hon. Members cannot get away from the report of the Public Accounts Committee. In 1994, the unanimous finding of that all-party Committee was that, in some LEAs, funding had been given to the GM sector to the detriment of other schools. Conservative Members signed up to that report. The PAC, which all of us view with great respect, achieves a cross-party view on such matters.
<P>
I congratulate the 30 GM schools that are in the list of the top 100 most improving schools. They have done well and deserve congratulations on doing so. Many other GM schools are doing well. They are raising their standards, not because they have had additional funding but because they are doing a good job, their teachers are dedicated and their head teachers are giving good leadership. They should be commended for that.
<P>
Some GM schools are failing. Four of the 18 schools that I listed in May as having been under special measures for far too long were GM schools, so not all GM schools are successful. As with other schools, some have difficulties, even with the benefits that they might have received because of their GM status. The point is this we can learn from what has worked well in the GM sector, but we must remedy what is wrong with it.
<P>
We must adopt a new regime in which we have fair funding for all schools. That means a new regime both for recurrent, day-to-day revenue spending we shall deal with that in debates on delegation and local management ensuring that there is a fair distribution of such spending, and for capital spending, where a disproportionate amount of funding has been made available through the Funding Agency for Schools.
<P>
Once again, there has been some good work by the funding agency to develop new ways of making capital available to schools, for example, by involving the private sector and providing seed money to grant-maintained schools which they have used themselves to get money from the private sector. That has been a success and we want to use it on a national scale. We want to learn from those successful initiatives. It is not restricted to one group of just over 1,000 schools; all 24,000 schools can benefit from those new approaches to capital spending.
<P>
Hon. Members may cite schools in their constituencies where there has been a great improvement, but we need to look at what Her Majesty's chief inspector says about the relative success or otherwise of grant-maintained schools. In his annual report of 1996-97 the chief inspector says clearly that when similar schools are compared, the quality of teaching and progress made by pupils in GM and LEA schools are similar. That is not simply anecdotal or from personal experience looking at a range of inspections across the whole country, the chief inspector says that there is no difference between the two. The argument that the GM sector is improving standards to the extent that it is leaving local-authority-maintained schools behind does not stand up when it is analysed by an independent body. There is no evidence that GM schools, because of GM status, provide a better quality of education.
<P>
What do we need to do? We need a new framework. It is a framework because there is flexibility within it; a structure can often be far too rigid [Laughter.] Words are important here. It is a framework that offers flexibility. It is not command and control. It offers three categories of school, building on what has worked well and giving schools a choice of the category to which they wish to go. It builds on what has worked well, but says that there is a better way forward. The divisions that have occurred in our school system have not been good. One of the reasons why we have not been able to develop a world-class education system is because our school system has separated one school from another. We need to find a new framework that will overcome those divisions.
<P>
This is a policy that we have thought through. We are confident that it will ensure that schools can move[Mr. Byers]
forward with freedom to put the interests of children first no longer to have the sterile debate about structures, but to address the improving of standards. That is what the framework in the Bill will achieve. That is why I commend it to the Committee and why the amendments should be resisted.

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I welcome the tone of what the Minister says such as the proposition that there are lessons to be learnt. He acknowledges that from the success of GM schools. It is a tone that is in sharp contrast to some of the things that Labour spokesmen said when these schools were introduced. The current Home Secretary, who previously held the shadow education brief, predicted that grant-maintained schools would lead to racially segregated schools. That was only the most extreme of a series of wild statements made by previous holders of the shadow education brief.
<P>
It is sad and damaging to the long-term interests of children, and a reflection on the limited nature of the Government's willingness to rethink their policy on these issues, that the Minister did not address the central fact about grant-maintained schools. The professionals working in them and their governing bodies wish to continue to have grant-maintained status, the parents voted for it, and the evidence is that they wish it to continue. It is true that Labour party policy has moved on somewhat, but not far enough.
 <P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>

The Committee should write the grant-maintained principle into the Bill to ensure that the success of the schools is safeguarded. Most importantly, we should respect the wishes of those most directly involved in the interests of the schools and the children.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 155, in page 17, line 36, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(f) voluntary special schools.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment: No. 160, in clause 21, page 19, line 42, after "voluntary", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", voluntary special school.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I shall be brief, as the amendments are very much probing amendments.
<P>
Under subsection (1), the Government will establish certain types of school-three categories of community, foundation and voluntary schools the latter covering voluntary-aided and voluntary-controlled schools. They have set out concepts: special schools may be either community special schools or foundation schools. They have not provided for special schools being voluntary special schools either voluntary aided or voluntary controlled. When I asked why the latter two had been omitted, I was told that it was because no such schools exist. In my view, that is no argument for not providing for such schools; after all, someone may wish in future to establish them.
<P>
The Under-Secretary spoke earlier about the need for choice, and we heard on Tuesday about the setting up of a new education system for the next century. Much of the speech of the Minister for School Standards was about diversity, flexibility and choice. No doubt, therefore, the Government accept that it is appropriate to allow for the provision of voluntary special schools, which may, for example, wish to be run by the Churches or other religious groups that are now permitted to run schools under the education system. I trust that the Government will consider the amendment sympathetically and allow that extra diversity.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> As the hon. Lady said, there are no voluntary special schools; there is no demand for them. We have set out a new structure for schools, allowing them the option to be foundation special schools or community schools. There is provision in the non-maintained special schools sector for trusts or voluntary organisations to set up a school if they obtain the Secretary of State's approval and think that they have a special contribution to make to the sector, and can meet some need by setting up a school. But during all our consultations, whether on the Bill or the special needs Green Paper on which consultation ended in the first week of January there has been no request whatever from the Churches to set up voluntary schools, and I do not see any point in incorporating in legislation a structure that no one wishes to use.
<P>
The debate about the future of special schools is interesting, but does not take into account the lack of demand of Churches or parents to have special schools in the Church sector. Having reassured her that children's needs can be met within the structure outlined in the Bill and that people who want to set up special schools can do so through the non-maintained special schools sector, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am disappointed, because although we have been told that the Bill is about creating a new structure for education for the next century, the Minister said that the Government intend to cast in stone the present structure. If there is no demand for it today, the Government are not prepared ot provide for something that might be demanded in future. However, in the light of the Minister's other comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 18, line 14, after "a" insert ", infant, junior,".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 156, in page 18, leave out line 16.
<P>
No. 157, in page 18, line 17, leave out "(b)".
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Again, the amendments are, in a sense, technical; they cover three separate areas. I should first explain that the intention of amendment No. 157 is not to delete the whole of line (b), but just the letter (b).
<P>
I wish to draw two issues to the Committee's attention and ask for the Government's response to them. The first involves the status that the Government accord to infant and junior schools, as distinct from the category of primary schools; I recognise that in some cases "primary" is a term that may be understood to embrace infant and junior schools. However, the clause refers only to primary schools. I have several infant and junior schools in my constituency which are keen to retain their separate identity and status and I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.
<P>
The second amendment proposes that we delete from the clause the exclusion from the definition of "school"
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a nursery school which is not a special school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment was tabled to discover the Government's intentions towards nursery schools. Some parts of the country provide nursery education through units attached to infant or primary schools, but others have separate nursery schools. Many would argue that a separate nursery school, rather than a unit attached to another school, helps to provide proper nursery education. There are arguments on both sides, but I hope that the Bill will not inadvertently exclude the category of a separate nursery school and that the Government will therefore accept the separate identification of nursery schools.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the term "primary school" because that is important. I assure the hon. Lady that legally the term does not mean only what might be called a through school infants to juniors but covers separate infant and junior schools. Accepting the amendment would therefore not effect any change. We do not want to end the existence of free-standing infant schools and free-standing junior schools. I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady.
<H4><center>[Ms Rachel Squire in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
All legislation tends to treat nursery schools differently, primarily because they are small institutions that do not have the same requirements in terms of a governing body and are not funded through the local management of schools. Many of the provisions relating to the structure of schools would not apply to nursery schools; for example, under the previous Government's plans, nursery schools were not entitled to apply for GM status. They have always existed outside that framework and there has been no demand for that to change; the legislation carries on a tradition that has worked well. Having assured her that we do not desire to remove freedoms that existed under previous legislaton, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> In the light of the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I seek to persuade the Committee to vote against the clause.
<P>
When we discussed amendments to clause 19, I made it clear that Liberal Democrats fundamentally oppose the Government's proposals to introduce foundation schools. The Government were opposed to grant-maintained schools when they were in opposition, but they are now appeasing them. That is why they propose to create foundation schools.
<P>
During the earlier debate, it was interesting to hear the Minister for School Standards refer to his noble Friend Lord Hattersley as a famous left-winger. The Minister attracted our attention to Lord Hattersley's article in The Guardian on 9 July 1997, so I made it my business to obtain a copy of it. It appeared under the interesting heading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The real way to convince teachers is to spend more on schools and the people who work within them".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I found that I agreed not only with the sentiments expressed in the heading, but with much of the rest of the article. In particular, I draw attention to the passage on foundation schools. Lord Hattersley refers to the Government White Paper "Excellence in Schools", which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"All categories of schools must be treated fairly" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and concludes that that is,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"presumably a promise that foundation schools will not receive the extra funding which they enjoyed in their grant-maintain incarnation. But the distinction will itself do damage."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have considerable sympathy with the view expressed in the final sentence.
<P>
Lord Hattersley argues that there are many distinctions between community schools and foundation schools. Were there to be no distinctions, there would be no need for separate categories. The major difference that we must bear in mind is that foundation schools will be outside the strategic planning framework and the light touch of local education authorities. They will remain opted out of LEAs.
<P>
Until recently, the Labour party opposed opted-out schools. I could go back further, but I point to the views of the current Home Secretary who, in 1992, was the Labour party's spokesman on education. In a press release, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Opting-out remains as what it began, a carelessly constructed wheeze based on little more than dogma."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to recognise that he was referring to schools opting out of LEAs.
<P>
In addition to the press release, the current Home Secretary published in June 1992 a document entitled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Developing local schools for all"<P>
</UL></FONT>
[Mr. Don Foster]
<P>
in which he stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In 1988 the Conservatives introduced the possibility of schools opting out of their local education authority. The policy was aimed at breaking up the cohesive pattern of local education."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly shows that the Labour party opposed schools opting out of LEAs. The document added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that nationally, the policy of opting out will lead to a reduction in parental choice, the selection of some children and the rejection of the many, a major disruption of the administration of education and no improvement in the standard of education for the nation's children."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
It is reasonable for political parties to change their minds over time. The Liberal Democrat party is prepared to develop policies, to think the issues through and perhaps to come to different conclusions. However, it is interesting to study how the Labour party's poisition has changed. In 1994, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), was the Opposition spokesman on education. In a secret letter to Labour Members, he stated: "We are opposed" [Hon. Members: "Secret?"] So much for the secrecy of Labour party documents; but more of that in a moment.
<P>
The letter said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are opposed to schools opting out and remain committed to the white paper pledge to bring such schools back."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was again talking about opting out of local education authority control.
<P>
That was in the past, however. We can now come right up to date and find out the Labour party's view on the issue. For example, the education committee in the city of Plymouth the area in which the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport, the silent whip

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would that he were; the hon. Member for Devonport is chattering, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The view of the hon. Gentleman's education authority on the issue is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There can be no case for three categories of school ... What is needed is simplicity not greater complexity ... it would thus be sufficient to re-structure on the basis of just two categories: community and re-defined aided category."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is not the only Member on the Government Benches. I thought that it would be interesting to find out the views of the education department of Warrington borough council. The hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) 
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> The hon. Gentleman has sought the views of all those LEAs, but I think that he failed to read the Bill before the Committee stage. There are three acknowledged problems with grant-maintained schools the first is favoured funding; the second is a weakness in democratic accountability; and the third is the setting of admissions policies that could lead to selection and a lack of coherence. Surely the hon. Gentleman can see that all three problems are addressed in the Bill, but that it still allows grant-maintained schools to make good use of devolved budgets, which many of them have done. They have the freedom without the favour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. If he is saying that there is no distinction between a foundation school and a community school, and if he can convince the Committee that that is the case, there may be much greater agreement between us. However, in that case he would accept my argument that there is no need for the special status of foundation schools. Some of the unfairnesses and injustices that have led to the awarding of special status to grant-maintained schools will continue to contribute to the special status of the foundation schools as their name implies. They will have a number of additional privileges that are not available to the community schools. However, if the hon. Member for Waveney can convince the Committee, by some tortuous argument, that there is no distinction between the two, we would be delighted to hear from him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> If the hon. Gentleman accepts that the problems of the grant-maintained schools are solved by the Bill, why does he want to be vindictive? He would wipe out organisations that have worked hard and done well. The problems relating to other schools are solved by the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman wants to go further, he is simply being vindictive; he is not considering what would be a fair and balanced education system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> There is no notion that I seek to be vindictive. I seek what I expected the hon. Gentleman would also want a system that is fair to all schools and, therefore, to all children. Does he acknowledge, for example, that a major distinction can be drawn between foundation schools and grant-maintained schools over the ownership of the premises of the school and other assets, and the conditional right of foundation schools to dispose of those assets? Does he also acknowledge that in such circumstances it would be possible for a foundation school to dispose of assets for its own benefit when those assets originally belonged to the wider community? If the hon. Member for Waveney does not agree, I hope that he will say so. If he does agree, he should accept the fundamental difference that exists even now between foundation schools and community schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that LEAs in the constituencies of Labour Members are against the proposals and head teachers, too, oppose them? Will he comment on the views of the head teachers of Harrow, East, all of whom signed a letter stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We worry about the creation of three types of school. We have been operating for some years on a very `uneven playing field' with some schools gaining higher status by opting out ... Any perpetuation of this system is to be regretted. Two categories of school are sufficient."?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing attention to that point. It is clear that the hon. Member for Waveney is out of tune with the head teachers in his constituency. They will doubtless be interested to hear of his remarks in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Blizzard:</B> My constituency is Waveney, not Harrow, East.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that many head teachers are concerned about the continuing distinction between foundation schools and community schools.
<P>
The hon. Member for Warrington, North will be concerned by the views of Warrington borough council's education department that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Warrington would much prefer two categories of schools, community and voluntary, rather than the three categories proposed in the White paper."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Under-Secretary has taken note [Interruption.] The Minister for School Standards will be aware that his local authority's response is rather bland unsurprisingly, because the Bill is bland in many respects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Come on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister presses me. I must be honest: I did not bother to bring a copy of the response, so bland was the comment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It is bland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for that.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will be aware that Birmingham City council's education department does not support the Government's proposals. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There was a suggestion that there should be only two groups of schools, community and aided."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Enfield, North (Ms Ryan) will no doubt be interested in the views of her local education authority, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We question whether there is a need for the `foundation' category of school and believe that two categories of aided and community would be sufficient."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall just finish these quotations. They are worth hearing.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, who has been eloquent in his interventions I have enjoyed many of them may enjoy hearing the views of Norfolk's education committee, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Norfolk Education Committee notes that Foundation schools were a manifesto commitment but considers them to be unnecessary."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, although I rise trembling with fear, not knowing what he might say about my constituency. I wonder whether he agrees with that great Liberal, Keynes, who is reported to have said, "When the facts change, I change my mind, Sir. What do you do?" Given the position that my hon. Friend the Minister described earlier, it is better to put together a concordat for the future which is exactly what foundation status represents than to fight old battles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says let us put together a concordat for the future; let us look to the future. I entirely agree with that, but we can have a concordat only if the majority support the proposition. My argument is simply that the majority of those involved in the world of education do not support the proposition before us. If they did, the hon. Gentleman's argument would be stronger.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt refer to responses to the White Paper. He will know that there has been strong opposition to the clause from those directly involved in the education service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. My question concerns majorities. Will he confirm that of those responding to the White Paper and the consultation document specifically on foundation status, the majority supported the establishment of the foundation category?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I accept that. However, the vast majority of respondents made no comment whatsoever about the proposals in the clause [Hon. Members: "So what?"] The point is that when people, especially people representing the local community on local education authorities, have become familiar with the issues and considered the matter in detail, they have opposed the proposed structure.
<P>
The same is true of teachers' representatives. The Secondary Heads Association says that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is not convinced that the proposed framework is right and urges the Government to allow time for further consideration."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers believes that the proposed framework is not the right way forward. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the proposal to establish foundation schools, together with the proposals for schools to choose the appropriate category, is a recipe for the divisive debates and campaigns in schools associated with the opting out procedure."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The National Union of Teachers says that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"urges the Government to accept the need for only two categories".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could go.
<P>
The point is that there is a clear difference between foundation schools and community schools. The Bill will perpetuate the divisive approach caused by the setting up of grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): I cannot understand why you are desparately looking backward instead of forward. In my local authority, Northamptonshire of which I was formerly an elected member the local education authority, the grant-maintained schools and the LEA schools in Corby are today sitting down and working together to decide how they can raise standards for all children in the area. All this ranting on about the past is simply looking backward. We have dealt with all the issues of concern. Why cannot the hon. Gentleman join us in looking forward and getting people to work together, as they are now, instead of giving us history?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The word "you" was used again. I am looking forward to lunch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Bearing that in mind, Mr. McWilliam, I will respond rapidly.
<P>
I am looking forward to an education system that is properly funded so that schools can deliver the high-quality education that we seek. I look forward to a time when people work together in the way that the hon. Gentleman describes to produce the high-quality education that the nation deserves. I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need to look forward. However, it is difficult to look forward if we retain within our education system divisions such as that perpetuated by the clause.
[Mr. Foster]
<P>
I briefly draw the Committee's attention to one more concern, which relates to foundation special schools. The Committee will be well aware that it was not initially part of the Government's thinking to allow special schools to move to foundation status. The recent Green Paper on special educational needs an excellent Green Paper, on which I congratulate the Under-Secretary states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Within the new schools framework ... all maintained special schools are likely to become community special schools. This is because of the importance we attach to the place of special schools in a unified service supporting greater inclusions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I entirely support that view. 



LEAs will continue to be responsible for meeting special educational needs.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It will be more difficult for LEAs to perform their functions and deliver the special education needs provision that is needed in a particular area if several special schools become foundation special schools and opt out of the local education authority. That will undermine the ability of LEAs to deploy resources to meet special educational needs. I urge the Government to reconsider foundation status for special schools. It is of great concern to many people, including members of the Local Government Association.
<P>
I am, to say the least, disappointed by the way in which the Local Government Association has responded to the Bill. Some weeks ago, its education committee considered several amendments that it wanted tabled. Subsequently, a deal was struck at a private meeting between the Minister and the chair of the LGA's education committee whereby no amendments would be put forward by the LGA. Mr. Graham Lane, the chair of the LGA's education committee, then wrote to the Minister thanking him for the meeting and saying that he had found it most useful. The letter said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We agreed to pursue most of our concerns through correspondence with you and only seek to find an MP to move an amendment where we felt there was a matter of principle which needed debating in Standing Committee. It will take a few days to turn our draft amendments into letters. Officials will already have had an understanding of our concerns and I hope that responses to our letters can be received" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want the Committee to listen to the next few words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at least a few days before the matter is debated in Standing Committee. We will circulate our correspondence to all our member authorities."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suppose that such a deal is fair enough, in that the association could draft amendments if it was not satisfied with the responses that it received. I would not necessarily recommend the LGA's education committee to take such action. The Committee may be interested to know what happened subsequently. The duty-bound Mr. Graham Lane wrote to the Minister expressing concerns about education action zones [Interruption.] The direct relevance of my remarks will become clear in a second, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The Committee will recall that we debated education action zones on Tuesday 3 February. The letter from Mr. Graham Lane, in which he expressed concern about the zones, and which was sent well in time for the Minister to respond to it and for the education committee to have time to draft amendments if it was not happy with the response, was dated 2 February the day before we debated the matter in Committee.
<P>
We are debating today the structure of schools, and foundation special schools in particular. It would have been helpful for us to know the views of the LGA about that and to have heard the Minister's response. Unfortunately, that was not possible because Mr. Graham Lane's letter to the Minister on that issue is dated 3 February. Many members of the Committee will share my concern that the Local Government Association, which should have been working effectively on this issue, have failed badly to support its members.
<P>
I hope that there will be no lack of understanding that Liberal Democrats are fundamentally opposed to clause 20 and shall be pressing for a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall be brief. First, I agree with what the hon. Member for Bath said about the Local Government Association. It is extraordinary that an organisation which exists to represent the views of local government across the political spectrum should feel that that responsibility is adequately discharged by private correspondence between the LGA and the Minister. I have already publicly criticised the behaviour of the LGA, whose officers have not properly discharged their responsibilities on major issues of public concern and matters raised with it by member authorities.
<P>
Having said that, it is one of the joys of politics that you cannot always choose your friends. I shall invite my hon. Friends to vote the same way on clause stand part as the hon. Member for Bath and his hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. However, we shall vote with them for diametrically opposed reasons, but I do not propose to go through all the arguments that were rehearsed on amendment No. 146.
<P>
Clause 20 will close down grant-maintained schools, which will be allocated to foundation status in the new framework. For all the reasons that I have already given the Committee, I regret the Government's proposal and I shall invite my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
I do not agree with what the hon. Member for Bath said about foundation schools. I hope that the Committee will reject the clause and endorse grant-maintained status. Although we believe that foundation status is very much second best, it is important to have that choice available. In voting with the hon. Member for Bath in opposing clause stand part, I reject almost all the logic he advanced in favour of that course of action.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that I choose my friends very carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am not sure that there was any logic advanced in the speech of the hon. Member for Bath. I think that he has spent far too long writing "Focus" leaflets. His argument was based on misrepresentation, prejudice and distortion, and it showed up the irresponsibility of opposition. No thought was given to the hundreds of thousands of children who attend the more than 1,000 grant-maintained schools. We had a speech representing the interests of local education authorities and teachers' unions I think that we should be putting the interests of children first. The children attending those grant-maintained schools will not be used as political footballs by this Government.
<P>
Clause 20 gives us a new way forward. It ensures that there will be a framework in which all schools will feel comfortable and none will feel intimidated or threatened. Foundation status will be attractive to current grant-maintained schools; it will be a different world for them. There will be a different funding regime and an admissions system that will have to operate within the code of practice, but there will still be the freedom that comes from self-management and the delegation of budgets. We believe that that is a far better way forward than the prejudice that we have heard from the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister said that there will be a new method of funding. Is he implying that because of the loss of the special status of capital expenditure for GM schools, which are outside the PSBR, there might be a form of funding that could reinstate that? To clarify that we are not playing political football, will he tell us what was the effect on the PSBR when the grant-maintained schools' funding was reclassified in December?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There has been no effect, for the simple reason that the Treasury underwrote the changes. I am sorry if I did not make that clear. Because of the PSBR changes and the Treasury agreeing that 
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn </b><i>rose </i><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, I shall explain; it might help the hon. Gentleman if he listens to what I say. The Treasury agreed that reclassification would mean an increase in public spending. The sums involved in the grant-maintained school sector are relatively small, so they will not have a dramatic impact on the total amount of the PSBR. The reclassification will have no direct impact on grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am rather sad that the Minister used the language that he did to put down my hon. Friend the Member for Bath [Laughter.] I have to look after my hon. Friend.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that the principal objective of the Committee is to put children first, which was not done in the past. I ask the Minister specifically to consider the issue of foundation special schools. I have worked in the sector for a long time, but I can see no specific advantage in creating foundation special schools. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> When the hon. Gentleman has read the Official Report of the comments of his hon. Friend the Member for Bath, he will understand that talking about a policy that appeases the grant-maintained sector is not the sort of language that one would expect from an hon. Member making a reasoned contribution to a serious debate.
<P>
I understand the concerns of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about foundation special schools. We have considered the issue carefully and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has gone into the policy in great detail.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> It might help the Committee if I remind hon. Members of why, after consultation, we decided to allow grant-maintained special schools the same options as other GM schools: it was not to separate them from the rest of the GM movement, but rather to give them the same choice as every other GM school. That was the spirit of our thinking, and it was right. Clause 89(5) arranges for regulations to be made so that admission to special schools, either community or foundation schools, will be guided. I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend that GM special schools and maintained special schools have already met to thrash out any problems and to ensure that the admissions arrangements will be better than was the case under GM special school and maintained special school status
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis</b> <i>rose </i><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, I must reply to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I am grateful to her for drawing the Committee's attention to clause 89(5), which provides flexibility and choice for foundation special schools.
<P>
I do not want to delay the Committee, as we must make progress. Clause 20 is a key part of the Bill. It provides a framework for the new categories, which will provide flexibility and fairness in our school system. We must look forward; we should not rehearse the old debates, but begin to create an environment and a climate in which a family of schools works together, putting the interests of children first.

Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Allocation of existing schools to new categories</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 147, in page 93, line 21, after "table", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unless the governing body of the school has, before the appointed day, given notice to the Secretary of State of its desire to move to adifferent category in which case the provisions of paragraphs 4 to 7 of this Schedule will apply to that school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The spirit of the amendment is contained in the White Paper. Chapter 7, which is entitled "A new partnership", states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We need a new framework which strikes a better balance between fairness, co-operation, diversity between schools, and the power of schools to decide their own affairs ... We are considering the role of new foundations that might be required for schools which become aided or foundation schools. We are also considering the implications for controlled schools, in cases where they move to foundation status, of becoming the employers of their staff; we are mindful of the need for flexibility."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the White Paper was published, the Government intended to extend to LEA schools a range of flexibility and choice. The wording in the Bill is rather different. Schedule 2 prescribes the choices for LEA schools. The amendment would allow the governing bodies of schools to challenge the category to which the LEA has allocated them, and thus extend the same choice to LEA schools as to schools that were formerly grant maintained. The amendment would extend the full range of choice to LEA schools. It is a reasonable request in the light of the wording and philosophy of the White Paper, which was published only last summer. Choice and diversity is in line with Government thinking. They should experience little difficulty in accepting the reasonable amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> To clarify matters, all schools will have choice, but that choice will be phased. We wanted to avoid 24,000 schools balloting about their status on the introduction of the measure. Therefore, at first, grant-maintained schools will be able to choose their category. Governing bodies of other schools will be able to choose the most appropriate category probably 12 months later. If the Bill is enacted, the decisions will go before the school organisation committees.
 <P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister mentioned 12 months. We also tabled amendment No. 132, which was not selected, but which provided for a time frame of six months rather than 12 months. Perhaps the Minister will consider reducing the 12-month period.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We have not cast the period in stone. Schools may wish to spend time in their new category before deciding whether they want to change to another category. We considered a school year about the right period in which to experience the new category and its advantages or disadvantages.
<P>
The Government's reasoning is that a phased approach would be preferable to a big bang approach, with 24,000 schools choosing from various categories. That decision reflects the comments in response to the technical consultation document, which suggested that people were concerned about the prospect of all schools being given a choice of category at the same time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In replying to an earlier debate this morning, the Minister said that he was in favour of the principle of self-management and wanted it to be extended to every school or certainly more broadly. What is his view on whether the phased approach that he mentions will lead to a significant movement from, in particular, community status to foundation status, with the increased flexibility that that would bring?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That may be among the reasons for a12-month period being preferable. Schools will have the opportunity to investigate how the new foundation category works and to assess their own status. They may then consider that there would be advantages in moving on. That would be for the schools to decide, and they will rely on experience. I should not have thought six months long enough to enable those decisions to be taken. However, we have not yet decided about the period of delay. I consider that 12 months or a full school year may be appropriate.
<P>
As to the amendment, there is no question that every school governing body will have a choice about category. That will not happen all at once on implementation of the Bill, but within 12 months of that time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 94, leave out lines 29 and 30.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 165, in page 94, leave out lines 32 and 33 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(g) the result of every such ballot shall be determined by a simple majority of those voting.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that many members of the Committee, like me, found schedule 2 fairly impenetrable, and my amendments are not intended to do more than cut a path through its undergrowth. We have heard that the Department is greatly overloaded with work at the moment. Last night a bombshell was dropped the long-heralded White Paper on lifelong learning will be scrapped, and some lesser document will be produced. It is therefore no surprise that the Government have made a dog's breakfast of many aspects of the schedule.
<P>
In particular, I should be delighted if the Minister would clarify the impression that I have formed from reading paragraph 4. While the arrangements are supposed to involve consultation, it is not clear that a clear majority of those voting in a ballot of parents would be enough to determine the outcome, so confusingly and misleadingly is the paragraph phrased. Amendments Nos. 164 and 165 are probing amendments to give the Minister an opportunity to spell out how it is expected that governing bodies will conduct the decision-making process.
<P>
Bearing in mind the debate that we have just had on grant-maintained schools, it will be very important that the process by which they are allocated to a new category is both fair in the context of the Bill and seen to be fair, particularly as the relevant parents will have fought long and hard to win that prize status of GM school. Those parents will have strict regard for their democratic rights and paragraph 4 opens the way for those rights to be ridden over roughshod not only by the abolishing of GM schools, which will undercut the parents' first choice, but also through the further undercutting of their choice, under the Bill, over the category into which their school will fall. It would be to the detriment of the Government not to clarify that. I hope that they will accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has had such difficulty in understanding the delights contained in schedule 2. I shall try to enlighten him about the highlights it will be a short contribution. The hon. Gentleman did raise an important point. There will be an indicative allocation for GM schools: many will have foundation status; some, because of their background before achieving GM status, will be classed under the voluntary category. However, the final allocation will be determined by the governing body.
<P>
Parental ballots will take place only when parents disagree with the decision taken by the school's governing body. If there is disagreement, it is only right and proper that a number of parents take part in the ballot. It is appropriate where the governing body has met and made a decision about the category for their school.
<P>
There is a danger that a small number of parents could come together and challenge that governing body decision, with all the difficulties and potential division that that would incur. We are therefore reluctant to give a small group of parents the right to do so. We are contemplating triggering a ballot if perhaps 20 per cent. of parents are unhappy with the governing body's decision. As the technical consultation paper of last summer said, we may require a turn-out of 50 per cent. of parents to demonstrate real parental concern with that decision.
<P>
There are adequate safeguards to ensure that parents' views are taken into account, but not as a result of only a small minority. Where there is real concern across the parental body about the governors' decision, schedule 2 will allow a parental ballot on adopting a category other than the one decided by the governing body. That is what schedule 2 seeks to achieve. Additionally, we need powers to declare a ballot void if fraudulent activities or irregular conduct have taken place. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to resist the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I appreciate the Minister's comments. I am not entirely satisfied with what he has told us, but in the interest of making progress on the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 95, line 32, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Local Education Authority".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 169, in page 95, line 32, leave out from "determine" to end.
<P>
No. 170, in page 95, line 37, leave out paragraph 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> These amendments speak for themselves. When there is a dispute over which category a school falls into, it is surely appropriate that the matter is determined and resolved at a local level, not by the Department in London. I hope that Liberal Democrat Members will support the amendments, which are based on principles that they hold dear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. We wish to support amendment No. 166. However, we do not wish to support amendments Nos. 169 and 170. Under a ruling from our excellent Chairman last week, we cannot take a separate vote, so we will be unable to support the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The only amendment before the Committee is amendment No. 166. To vote on amendments Nos. 169 and 170, they would have to be moved formally at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam. You are so much more generous, but I cast no aspersions on your co-Chairman. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Gentleman reads the record, he will find that my co-Chairman ruled accurately, but it was misunderstood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> You are so wise, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
We want to support this sensible amendment and we hope that the Minister will accept it. Clearly, the LEA is the right level at which to resolve such disputes.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The Government do not accept the amendments and I shall briefly explain why. It is clear from our debate that the governing body's decision could conflict with what is decided by a parental ballot. In those circumstances, someone must make a decision 
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
