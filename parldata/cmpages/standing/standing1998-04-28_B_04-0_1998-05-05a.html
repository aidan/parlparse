<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, everyone. There are two changes to the draft selection of amendments that was issued on Thursday evening. Amendment No. 91 now appears in the group that is headed by amendment No. 90, and there is a new group of amendments under clause 7 that is headed by amendment No. 337. These changes are shown on the list that is available in the Room.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Anti-social behaviour orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison  </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 3, line 22, at end insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but no such variation may be made within six months of the making of the order save in exceptional circumstances'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 23, after `parties', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments explore the issues that turn on the duration of anti-social behaviour orders and the circumstances in which orders can be varied.
<P>
Conservative Members remain dissatisfied following last week's debates. We are concerned about the workability of anti-social behaviour orders, and whether it will be possible for them to be left hanging around. If that were to be the case, people could find themselves in breach of orders years after they were made. Their circumstances would be entirely different, and the trouble that gave rise to the order would have come to an end long before. However, an anti-social behaviour order must be given time to work. In many of the cases in which an order is applied for, six months would be a reasonable time scale for bringing trouble to an end. Amendment No. 9 would prevent an order from being varied within six months, unless there were exceptional circumstances.
<P>
In some circumstances, an order could be brought safely to an end within two years--for example, where it has been made in respect of a child or young person. During last week's proceedings, the Government revealed anti-social behaviour orders' potential application in respect of children and teenagers. In such cases, it is important to bear in mind that children and teenagers can do a great deal of growing up in the course of two years. We did not know when we tabled the amendments that the Government saw the anti-social behaviour order as having only limited application in cases involving children and young people. The Minister has said that under-18s are not the main targets of anti-social behaviour orders and that their use against that age group, especially those at the younger end of the scale, would be exceptional. However, it is important in such cases that do arise that the order should not linger for an unnecessary length of time.
<P>
As the Bill stands, an order cannot be discharged within two years without the consent of the relevant authority. Amendment No. 14 suggests that that should be subject to the condition that consent is not withheld unreasonably. Does the Minister agree that the authority should have reasonable grounds for withholding consent, especially in cases that involve a young person? It would be reasonable to withhold consent if there was evidence to suggest that there was a risk of the original trouble reigniting. However, what if there was no such evidence, and the person concerned had shown every sign of having put the trouble behind him?
<P>
The issue should be viewed in the context of overall duration. The Government suggested in their consultation paper that the court will be empowered to grant an indefinite order, and that has been put into the Bill. The consultation paper stated that this may well be the appropriate duration in most cases. It has not been said whether that remains the Government's view. It is an important matter, and we therefore look to the Minister for a clear answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I shall briefly support the points made by my hon. Friend the member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison).
<P>
It is important to know the position of a defendant to an application when an order is made. As my hon. Friend noted, an order can currently be made that has an indefinite effect. That could prove unsatisfactory as a matter of principle.
<P>
Moreover, the nature of a person against whom an order is made might be such that, for one reason or another, the defendant neglects to make an application for discharge, even at the appropriate stage. That is a worrying fact. Without a check-up process through which to discover whether such an order is still appropriate, thousands of orders could remain in abeyance for an indefinite period.
<P>
It may be that local authorities, or the police, will have recourse to a check-up process. Will a mechanism exist through which those authorities will be able to consider whether it is appropriate for such an order to remain in force? For example, after two years each order could be considered on its anniversary.
<P>
My hon. Friend makes a good point about the unreasonable withholding of both parties' consent. Subsection (9) could give rise to an unhelpful degree of rigidity. It will make it very easy for the local authority or the police to take a rigid view and to refuse ever to give consent. Under such a circumstance the order would inevitably remain in force for two years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. Given that they improve the Bill, I hope that the Minister can accept them.
<P>
If amendment No. 9 is not accepted, the courts may be troubled by repeated applications to vary an order. Once a court has made an order, the matter should be regarded as certain. My fairly extensive experience of the legal profession has led me to realise that much court time can be wasted by repeated applications to vary an order after it has been made. That is particularly true of domestic violence injunctions, a field with which I dealt for a number of years at the Bar.
<P>
Anti-social behaviour orders should be prompted by behaviour that needs to be controlled--otherwise such orders would not need to be made. We must therefore ensure that the parties concerned know that such orders will last for a minimum of six months, unless something extraordinary happens.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> The amendment is problematic because it would limit the court's power to vary an order within six months, even if both parties are content for that to happen. We are wary of taking that step because, in general, variations will protect the public.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Hertsmere made some discoveries last week. I think that we had a useful debate in which we put forward a view that is consistent with what we have said about the aims of anti-social orders. I remind the hon. Gentleman of a point that came out in our debate: orders will not be punishments, but preventive measures. Provided they are not breached, nothing will happen. Orders will often deal with situations that have developed over a considerable period of time, so we must ensure that those situations have ended before orders are discharged.
<P>
We must also have the capacity to respond to variations in problematic behaviour. If we were to agree to amendment No. 9, a situation might develop during the first six months of an order that made it sensible for there to be a change in the order. The court might then be forced to issue a second order to get over the problem. That does not make sense, so I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere understands that we cannot agree to the amendment.
<P>
I am happy to address the point that the hon. Member for Woking made about undischarged orders. We do not want to create a bureaucracy in which unnecessary checks take place. I reiterate that there will be no problems, provided that orders are not breached. Orders will succeed when they make punishment unnecessary for the people on whom they are imposed. Those people will no longer be a nuisance to the public and their anti-social behaviour will have been curbed.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 puts forward the requirement that consent should not ``be unreasonably withheld''. I think that that is a recipe for a great deal of legal discussion. I am sure that police and local authorities would not wish to have orders made unreasonably. However, sufficient time must elapse to ensure that anti-social behaviour is not in abeyance for a short period. We want to be certain of an end to conflict and harassment that may have continued for a considerable period of time. That is why we think that the presumption should be to have that certainty in a reasonable period of time. That is what is in the Bill.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the matters raised by Conservative Members, but I think that those problems will be taken care of in practice. I undertake to examine the point made by the hon. Member for Woking. I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough):</B> I wish to press the Minister on this matter. An interesting point of principle can be raised in relation to the duration of the orders. The Minister is at pains to say that the orders are not punishments, but are designed to stop certain behaviour continuing or getting worse. However, the English legal system traditionally reassures the public about sentences passed on criminals. Part of that reassurance comes from a set period of time, usually spent in prison, that is imposed on defendents who are found guilty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is referring to sentences. I reiterate that anti-social orders are not sentences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I knew that the Minister would say that. However, he must allow me to develop my argument. The public have been used to sentencing that gives them reassurance. The orders are new creatures, and we had a considerable debate on them last week. I shall not rehearse that debate now, but will the Minister tell us how the orders will be administered?
<P>
Orders will be made for a period of not less than two years, but what time scale does the Minister envisage as necessary? How will police and local authorities administer the orders, because I presume that that will involve considerable resources. The orders may deal with quite complicated behaviour that is the subject of dispute and does not form a black-and-white situation. The Committee needs to know exactly what will happen in such cases.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
An order may deal with a person on a particular estate. How will the police assess whether that person is abiding by the order, whether it should be discharged and how long should be its duration? It is easy to say that a clear pattern of anti-social behaviour should stop, but the solution offered by the Bill is not clear. I may have misunderstood something, but the provisions on the length of time that the orders will be imposed and on how they will be administered and discharged do not leap out at me. The Minister's clarification would be helpful.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's questions briefly. As I said last week, anyone who has had experience of dealing with anti-social behaviour on estates and who has dealt with police and local authorities will recognise immediately how the orders will operate. Those without such experience will do what the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) has done; they will search the pages of the Bill for the answer. Experience of the problems will demonstrate why the relevant clauses are necessary and how they will work effectively in practice.
<P>
Police and local authorities already have to deal with such problems on a day-to-day basis, but they do so without the instrument that will be provided by the orders. The orders will deal with the prevention of serious problems that build up over time. I am confident that they will work well in practice and that they will prevent problems coming to the point of acute difficulty and conflagration. They will stop serious cases coming to court because they will deal with problems that develop over time.
<P>
The orders must operate for a reasonable time to ensure that anti-social behaviour has not just stopped for a short breathing space, such as in cases when it occurs in cycles from one summer to the next. The two-year period will make sense to those who will have to administer the orders. In general, they have welcomed them because they will provide them with an instrument that they desperately need.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response, but I am not entirely satisfied by it. Once again, we are in danger of leaving the courts with a difficult task.
<P>
The Minister said that six months would not be long enough for an order. In a way, I agree with him about that. However, amendment No. 9 contained a let-out. In exceptional circumstances, it would enable an order to be varied after six months. Events are still fresh in everyone's mind six months after an order has been made and a court will have heard all the details about the defendant's circumstances in the course of its hearing and it will tailor the order accordingly. It is unlikely that circumstances that necessitate a varying of the order will change in that time scale. However, in exceptional circumstances, the amendment would allow such a variation to be made. Much could change between six months and two years, and that is especially so of a child or a young person.
<P>
I was not entirely happy with the Minister's response to amendment No. 14, which would require that consent to a variation could be withheld on reasonable grounds only. Much could change in two years, and the courts need some flexibility. Neither the Bill nor anything that the Minister has said offers guidance about what would happen if a local authority or police force had a blanket policy of refusing all applications for variations within two years. According to the Bill, such a policy would not be wrong, and the Minister has given no hint that it would be unreasonable. Is the Minister prepared to contemplate a police authority or local authority operating a blanket policy of withholding consent?
<P>
Most unsatisfactory is what the Minister said about the overall duration of the orders, which is the time scale against which the amendments must be considered. In my opening speech, I asked specifically whether the Government retained the opinion that they felt emboldened to put forward in the consultation paper, which was that the court would be empowered to grant an indefinite order. The consultation paper also stated that an indefinite order may be the appropriate duration in most cases. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the matter should be left to the courts, but the Government were emboldened to offer that suggestion in the consultation paper. Last week, the Minister said that the Government had moved away from the consultation paper, but have they rejected this suggestion? The question remains up in the air. The courts do not know the Government's view about indefinite orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I would not assert that an indefinite order would be the appropriate duration in most cases: that was only a suggestion in the consultation paper. In many cases, the period of two years will allow an order to prove its value and be a success. However, many injuctions, including those covering domestic matters, are made until further order--that is, indefinately. So the provision is nothing new: indeed, the courts are used to dealing with such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That represents some movement from what the Minister has said previously and from what appeared in the consultation paper. I agree that two years will be a sensible period for such orders in many cases.
<P>
I am pleased to have extracted that much from the Minister. I hope that that sets the tone for the day.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 3, line 26, leave out from beginning to `liable' in line 27, and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(10) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything which he is prohibited from doing by an anti-social behaviour order shall be guilty of an offence of breach of an anti-social behaviour order and liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (10A) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything which he is prohibited from doing by an anti-social behaviour order and at the time acts in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as himself shall be guilty of an offence of aggrevated breach of an anti-social behaviour order and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 41, in page 3, line 27, leave out from `order' to end of line 32 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`his conduct shall be punishable as a contempt of court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 85 in page 3, line 30, leave out from `both' to end of line 32.
<P>
No. 42, in page 3, line 32, leave out `five' and insert `two'.
<P>
No. 26, in page 3, leave out lines 33 to 37.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As the Minister has been fond of saying, an anti-social order is a civil order. However, it is a criminal offence to breach it. Whether others regard such orders in the same way as the Government may be contested in future, but at present we must consider the penalty for breach. That is the question considered in the amendment.
<P>
The maximum sentence for breach of an anti-social behaviour order ranks alongside the maximum for some serious offences. At five years, it is more than the three years' maximum for affray, for example, and is the same maximum as is available for offences of violent disorder. I remind the Committee that, in the eyes of the law, offences of violent disorder occur when three or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence and whose conduct is such as to cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
<P>
Five years is also the maximum sentence for offences of assualt occasioning actual bodily harm, or even of grievous bodily harm. Those are serious offences, in which people are made badly afraid or suffer real injury. Yet a person subject to an anti-social behaviour order would, in theory, lay himself open to the same sentence through any action that puts him in breach of the order. That need not be the same behaviour that cause harassment, alarm and distress, and which occasioned the making of the order in the first place. We have already discussed and firmly established that it need not be criminal behaviour, although a person could, of course, also be charged for any criminal behaviour that he committed.
<P>
The behaviour might involve the breach of an order, such as an exclusion order. I am sure that members of the Committee can think of many circumstances in which the mere breach of an order might take place. Someone might, for example, merely set foot inside an exclusion zone and thus render himself liable to five years' imprisonment--the same penalty as for the serious criminal offences that I mentioned.
<P>
It is worth reconsidering the issue. Amendment No. 15 attempts to make the sentence for breaching an order a little more proportionate by introducing a distinction between breach and aggravated breach. According to the amendment, someone who breaches an order by doing something that it prohibits him from doing would be liable to six months' imprisonment. That is not an unreasonable maximum for just breaching an order. Someone who breaches an order by acting in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress would, however, be guilty of aggravated breach. In that case, we would follow the Government in imposing a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. In that way, we recognise the distinction between breaching an anti-social behaviour order and breaching an order by behaving in the way that was complained about in the first place and which gave rise to the order. That is an entirely reasonable distinction, and the penalty for a non-aggravated breach is in line with the penalties for breach of non-molestation injunctions or other injunctions under civil law.
<P>
Last week, the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Stinchcombe) spoke with some authority about the procedures for granting and enforcing civil injunctions. He might feel moved to tell us in the course of this debate whether he or any other member of the Committee knows of a civil injunction being enforced by anything approaching five years' imprisonment. In my limited experience of the civil courts, I have not come across such consequences flowing from the breach of an injunction. As I have already said, a person could be sentenced for any criminal behaviour that occurred when a breach took place.
<P>
I want to make one other point in favour of the amendment. Conservative Members want to help the Government avoid a successful challenge against anti-social behaviour orders under the European convention on human rights. We have outlined some of the problems that might arise in future and there could be a problem with the penalty. The fact that the breach of what is described as a civil order will give rise to such a heavy criminal penalty makes the order look far more like a criminal penalty than a civil order. The look of the order is important.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am not privy to the advice that Ministers were given in the previous Government and I wonder what advice they were given when they introduced the Protection from Harassment Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not privy to that advice either, so I cannot share it with the Committee, although I would have done had I been privy to it. We are, however, concerned with the present Bill, and learned legal opinion has suggested that a challenge might be made to it. Conservative Members want, of course, to help the Government deal with any such challenge.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 deals with similar issues. As the Bill stands, clause 2(11) prohibits a person who is in breach of an anti-social behaviour order from being dealt with by way of a conditional discharge. When Conservative Members first saw that, we were a little curious to know why the Government had not ruled out an absolute discharge as well. Absolute discharges are used in particular circumstances and the Minister might want to say something about that. That is, however, not the main point that troubles us; our principal reason for moving the amendment was to assist the Government with the problems that might lie ahead and which I have just described.
<P>
Removing subsection (11) might make anti-social behaviour orders less vulnerable to successful challenge in respect of breach of the European convention on human rights. It can be inferred from the Bill that a person subject to an order has already had one conditional discharge--the order itself. The Government argue, and the Minister argued this morning, that the order is civil, not criminal. If it can be inferred that a person subject to an order has had a conditional discharge in the shape of the order, that argument is undermined.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Opposition are concerned about the matter. Those who argue against the Government, and who say that the anti-social behaviour order is a criminal rather than a civil penalty, may seize on the clause as evidence of its criminal character. Such people could say that however the Government describe the order, its effect is that of a conditional discharge, because a conditional discharge would be ruled out in the event of a future breach.
<P>
It does not matter how the Government present the clause--its effect is what matters. The amendment would, among other things, make it impossible to draw the inference about which I have spoken, which is a disadvantage to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I shall speak to amendments Nos. 41 and 42, which are tabled in my name, and to amendment No. 26, to which my name was added when Liberal Democrats tabled a similar amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 deals with a crucial matter. If the order is genuinely a civil order, as the Government assert, breaches should be treated in the same way as breaches of any other civil order--as contempt of court. Such provision would go a long way towards removing the blurring of criminal and civil law that has been alluded to many times. An unhelpful precedent was set by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is notable that the breach was not made a criminal offence in that Act, which currently works along the lines that the amendment suggests, whereby breaches of non-harassment orders are punishable as contempt of court.
<P>
Contempt of court is not a soft option, and carries a possible sentence of two years' imprisonment. Liberal Democrat Members would be interested to know whether the Government have considered this option and to hear about their ministerial advice, never mind that of the previous Government. When the Government came up with the penalties, did their ministerial advice suggest that the option of contempt of court should be excluded or not followed up, and that there should be instead the possibility of a five-year criminal sentence?
<P>
I should like to mention the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, and perhaps to add it to the conspiracy that seeks to defend civil liberties. I hope that Conservative Members will accept its evidence. The association clearly suggested that anti-social behaviour orders should be imposed and enforced by civil courts--either by county courts or magistrates' courts acting on a civil basis. There is widespread support for the order remaining an entirely civil order.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 proposes the alternative of reducing the maximum sentence from five to two years. The reasons for that proposal are similar to suggestions outlined by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. Liberal Democrats cannot envisage circumstances in which behaviour relevant to the order could be so serious as to be punishable by five years in prison. To propose such a maximum simply as a deterrent would be a retrograde step in criminal law. The approach that involves hanging for stealing a handkerchief has long since gone. It has been recognised that deterrents work only if they are followed up.
<P>
	Will the Minister give examples of circumstances in which he expects courts to impose the five-year sentence? If the order is to be introduced but that sentence is never imposed, the deterrent will not work, and a retrograde step would have been taken by proposing such a serious legal penalty.
<P>
	How will simultaneous prosecutions be handled? An order could be imposed to prevent harassment of an individual. The subject of the order could then commit an offence such as actual or grievous bodily harm against that individual. Those presumably are the circumstances in which the higher penalty for breach of the order would be sought. However, we are not yet clear about how those simultaneous cases would proceed. Does the Minister envisage one case proceeding for grievous bodily harm and one for the breach of order, which would both produce sentences that would affect the individual, or is there an alternative? We seek clarification on that point, because if a serious criminal offence is to lead to the greater penalty, the breach of the order becomes redundant because the greater penalty will in any case be imposed for the offences of GBH, ABH, or similar behaviour.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that there is cross-party agreement on amendment No. 26, to which my name has been added. It deals with the crucial issue of the courts' discretion, which they need and have traditionally enjoyed in this country. The courts should be able to offer an appropriate disposal for any individual who comes before them. Removing the conditional discharge as an option, along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, would make the civil injunction--which is what the Minister has stressed that an anti-social behaviour order is--appear to be a criminal offence in terms of the assumption that the original offering of the order was the equivalent of a conditional discharge. Amendment No. 26 would give the courts the maximum possible freedom to dispose of individuals before them as they see fit, rather than having constraints under the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 85 and the others moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. First things first--when I looked at the Bill's definition of an anti-social behaviour order, it occurred to me that such behaviour could cover eccentric and unusual behaviour. Nowhere does it say in the Bill that such behaviour must amount to criminal behaviour. When I saw that, I thought that the Bill could cover much behaviour that did not amount to crime. The Bill still maintains the same position; its wording is clear. I then looked at the punishments that might be imposed. That a breach of an anti-social behaviour order could give rise to five years' imprisonment, on indictment, is a heavy-handed approach to what I then believed was conduct which fell well short of criminal behaviour.
<P>
	I am sure that my hon. Friends will agree that it has been most unsatisfactory to find that civil proceedings have been effectively intertwined with criminal proceedings throughout our arguments. That strand of dissatisfaction runs through the entire clause.
<P>
	Under the amendment, there would be no breach, triable on indictment, and subject to five years' imprisonment. I say that notwithstanding the Minister's comments the other day, on which I shall press him again. He said--and he will correct me if I am wrong--that the kind of conduct that can give rise to an anti-social behaviour order must be criminal or sub-criminal. I ask him most sincerely when he replies to the debate, or perhaps later this morning, to tell us exactly what he means by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a habit of asking whether statements are accurate and requesting the Minister to correct him if they are not. I am not going to go into critical exegesis of the hon. Gentleman's every sentence. I have said what I have said, and have made quite clear the nature of the order and how it will operate. I shall listen to what he says and, if appropriate, respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister must not get too ratty with me at this early stage. The debate has hitherto been good humoured, and I am sure that it will continue in that vein. However, Opposition Members would be most intrigued to learn what the Minister means by sub-criminal behaviour.
<P>
The sort of conduct that could give rise to a court considering a five-year sentence--which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere rightly pointed out, is the same as sentences for serious crimes--must surely, by definition, amount to a serious criminal offence. I cannot think of any circumstances in which a court would consider passing a sentence of up to five years for a breach of an anti-social behaviour order without a serious criminal offence having been committed. If there are such circumstances, I should like to know what they are.
<P>
If I am right, however, why on earth is the provision necessary? Criminal law contains all the right penalties. Where there is serious violence or serious public disorder, a person can be arrested and charged. Providing for a five-year sentence in relation to a breach of a civil order, where the full case has not really been tested in court to the criminal standard, is an unsatisfactory duplication of law, as well as a point of principle.
<P>
I am most surprised to find that a conditional discharge is not available. If there is a good reason for that, I hope that I will understand it when it is put to me. As the Minister will know, conditional discharges are a commonly used tool available to magistrates courts and to recorders and judges in the Crown court. It is a way of dealing with technical or de minimis breaches, and if there is a particular reason for getting rid of it, I should like to hear it. On the face of it, I am sorry to see its removal.
<P>
My next question has not been put before. If a person behaves in an anti-social way, contrary to clause 1, is it possible that at the same time as a local authority, in consultation with the police, decides to seek an anti-social behaviour order, the police, in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, can seek to charge and prosecute a criminal offence? Can the Minister assure me that that is not possible under current law? If it is possible, he does not need me to tell him that such a situation is wholly unsatisfactory from a variety of points of view with which I need not detain the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sorry that the Minister is not prepared to engage in critical exegesis of the every utterance of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Life is too short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> After all, the Court of Appeal is not too grand to do it when my hon. Friend sits as a judge. His statements have a fine record of standing up, and I believe that every statement that he has made in Standing Committee will stand the test of time and will not seem to be contrary to our law.
<P>
Those who practise in the criminal courts may be familiar with the appalling photographs of people who have been the subject of attacks necessitating a charge of actual or grievous bodily harm. They are not the fuzzy family photographs that one takes on a pleasant beach in the summer; they are in fine focus and relate in grisly detail--shocking even for hardened practitioners--the results of the behaviour that often leads to such charges, which can incur a five-year prison sentence. They depict serious injuries, including glassings and stabbings.
<P>
I fear the Government have gone over the top in drafting the provision. It is not clear to me why they decided on a period of five years; or perhaps it is clear--the Minister thought that he was making a frightfully clever debating point against my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere when he referred to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which has a five-year provision. However, that measure requires a higher burden of proof than an anti-social behaviour order would. Above all, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 gives rise to a criminal charge. The Minister has taken care to explain that an anti-social behaviour order would be nothing to do with a criminal charge, but would be a civil matter.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why, if an order would be a civil matter, was the Minister at such pains to refer to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which is a criminal provision? I should be happy to give way to the Minister if he wanted to intervene. I think that he may have given the game away, by being unable to contain his impulse to make a point against my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere about the advice that was given to Conservative Ministers at the time in question. Why is the period of five years necessary in the context of an entirely civil matter?
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) made some pertinent points when speaking to his amendments. Under one of those, breach of an order would be dealt with by the normal processes for dealing with contempt in the civil courts. If anti-social behaviour orders would be civil matters, why should not breaches of them be dealt with in that way? Why are prison terms of up to five years, which the courts impose only for serious matters such as actual or grievous bodily harm, being considered?
<P>
Opposition Members have made it clear that under the Bill a person could--but of course it will not happen, and in that case, why put it in the Bill?--be sent to prison for five years not for anti-social behaviour but for breaching the conditions imposed by an order. We all know that not in a million years, thank God, will the courts in this land impose a five-year sentence for such a breach. The Minister may be surprised, but I am not one of those who believes we should hang handkerchief stealers. In what circumstances does the Minister envisage that the court would impose a five-year sentence for breach of an order? He must answer; presumably the question figured in the advice he was given. If he is not prepared to, or cannot, answer, one must assume that the main purpose of subsection (10) is to provide a way of strutting around the stage, or letting the Minister bang his chest and say, ``I shall be stronger with such people than the Conservatives ever were; I will impose a sentence of five years.'' That is not good enough. It is not how Bills should be drafted. There should be a reason to impose a sentence of five years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest):</B> I briefly add my agreement to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. This morning's discussions have revealed the lack of clarity in the Bill about an important matter. Amendment No. 15 is intended to ameliorate that. The Minister has implied this morning that precision is not necessary because those who are likely to administer this law, or who will deal with the matters that we are discussing--that is, anti-social behaviour in general--understand what it is all about. They know what such behaviour is when it happens. That is rather a woolly and imprecise way to explain the reasons for the creation of a new criminal offence.
<P>
The creation of a criminal offence is a serious matter. It should not be approached so vaguely. Perhaps people in some parts of the country will understand the Bill in one way--as the Minister intends it to be understood--but in other parts of the country, it might be taken to mean something quite different. It is wrong to enact a law that applies throughout the country, but which can be interpreted in vastly different ways by different courts under different circumstances.
<P>
The criminal law should apply equally throughout the country and to those who come before the criminal courts at any time. Surely, it must be recognised that there is a huge difference between mildly anti-social behaviour, which should be restrained for the good of the community, and alarming or distressing behaviour, which might, for example, lead to serious injury. If that distinction is recognised, why is it not made clear in the Bill? Amendment No. 15 would do that. It would improve the Bill and there is no reason why the Government should not accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I share one thing with the hon. Member for Hertsmere, as I, too, do not have access to the advice given to the previous Government.
<P>
Under section 5 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, five years is also the maximum sentence for the breach of a restraining order. The purpose of that Act is the same as that of the Bill: to prohibit specific types of behaviour, and to have available a strong penalty if orders are breached and behaviour continues that is seriously damaging to the individual whom the order seeks to protect.
<P>
With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, I have said on several occassions that he must recognise that an order is intended to prevent crime. It is not a conviction, nor a penalty in itself. It is intended to protect the public.
<P>
There are people who have not experienced the practical problems of trying to deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis on estates, or in some of our town and city centres. Those who have had that experience will recognise the value and practicability of the orders.
<P>
The issue of proportionality in penalities is one for the courts. I am confident that they will exercise common sense in such matters, but the Government want to send the clear message that people should not mess with the courts when the courts have imposed anti-social behaviour orders. That message must be clear and simple, to prevent the repetition of the type of behaviour that has caused such absolute despair and distress for many families up and down the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to intervene at such an early stage. He referred to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Will he tell the Committee when the Government intend to enforce the provisions of that Act? Furthermore, are they reassessing the current punishment for the breach of such orders, which is to use penalties relating to contempt of court? Liberal Democrat Members have suggested that course of action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, the hon. Gentleman takes me on to another point. A civil injunction can be imposed, even though no offence has been committed. The breach of such an order can be punished by five years' imprisonment. A breach does not require mental intent.
<P>
The Government wish to implement the whole of the Protection of Harassment Act as soon as possible. The hon. Gentleman must contain himself until we can reply to his specific point.
<P>
We want to ensure that the breach of an anti-social behaviour order is seen as being a criminal offence, as well as a contempt of court, because it is a criminal act against the individuals who are protected as a result of the order being made. It is important to understand that point.
<P>
On the matter of the European convention on human rights, I have already mentioned the comparability with the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The breach of an order is punishable with a maximum of five years' imprisonment; if the breach proceedings were not subject to criminal procedure, it might well contravene the European convention. Of course, the breach proceedings will be dealt with in the criminal courts under the Bill, but the proceedings under which the order is made need only contain prohibitions for the protection of the public. It is therefore wrong, and a distortion of language, to treat the application of an order as a criminal charge against the defendant for the purposes of the convention.
<P>
As far as an absolute discharge or a conditional discharge are concerned, we have left the absolute discharge as a safety valve available to the court when the court has to take a decision, but in the light of the evidence, it is clear that the breach should be treated as negligible.
<P>
The conditional discharge can sometimes be used to put off the evil day of punishment. The conditional discharge essentially says, ``Go from here, and if you don't breach the discharge conditions, nothing more will happen.'' It is a criminal order and it goes on a person's list of convictions. The intention of the civil message, which is given by the anti-social behaviour order, which of course does not go on a person's list of convictions, is the same: it is to enjoin the individual not to offend further--not to continue the behaviour that led to his appearace in court. Leaving conditional discharge as an option in the Bill would be another obstacle to enforcing the order effectively.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister's argument is not convincing. He said that the problem with conditional discharge is that effectively it puts off the evil day, but it does no such thing. It is a sentence of the court; what might be thought to put off the evil day is a deferred sentence. Will a deferred sentence still apply in this case, or will it not be possible to impose a deferred sentence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is wrong. Conditional discharge, especially in relation to young offenders, has been used as a way of putting a tick on the list of disposals; it allows things to drift for far too long. That is one of the evils of its misuse--I accept that it is a misuse, but it is a persistent misuse in respect of young offenders. We will return to the matter later when we discuss the need to act much more quickly to nip things in the bud when young offenders are involved. The order will not only have been based on a pattern of behaviour of which evidence will have been given to the court, but the court will have warned the individual, ``We are making an order; don't carry on with this behaviour.'' In such circumstances, a conditional discharge is not appropriate for a breach of the order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister said why he thinks that conditional discharge would be inappropriate. Can the Minister go to the other end of the scale and answer the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough? Will he give an example of a case in which he thinks a sentence of five years in prison would be justified for a breach of an order on its own, without further bad behaviour, without a criminal offence being committed, just the breach of an exclusion order? When would that justify a sentence of five years on its own?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That is for the courts to decide. The point is to use legislation to make it clear how seriously we take a breach of these orders, and how seriously we take the sort of behaviour that ruins people's lives on estates and in streets up and down the country. If the hon. Gentleman has not come across those examples, perhaps he does not understand how people's lives are ruined. He rightly suggested the seriousness of an affray. However, affray involves one incident--maybe one moment of madness involving a group of people. Here we are discussing a pattern of behaviour that is damaging people's lives over a considerable period of time. If the hon. Gentleman is inviting me to ask whether it is that serious, I am glad of the opportunity to say, ``Yes, I do think it is as serious as all that.''
<P>
Mr. Clappison
<P>
: Is the Minister saying that there has to be a pattern of behaviour for there to be a breach? Surely, one act in breach of an order would be sufficient.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, one act in breach, but the order itself is made on the basis of a need for an order to be made, which will normally be on the basis of the pattern of behaviour. In coming to its decision, on the basis of the criminal burden of proof on the breach, the court will be able to judge the seriousness of that one act to which the hon. Gentleman refers. The court will have thought that the pattern of activity is serious enough to make an order to protect the public and prevent the continuation of that pattern of behaviour. That is why the mixture of civil and criminal law is entirely appropriate in relation to the orders and will be greately welcomed by members of the public who have been subject to the nuisance about which we have been talking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The Minister has not answered the question. Is it open to the Crown court or the magistrates court upon a conviction--a breach of the anti-social behaviour order--to defer sentence? If so, why is that better than a conditional discharge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There is nothing to stop a deferred sentence being imposed for a breach of an anti-social behaviour order, but it is rarely used. In some cases, it is putting off the situation until a later stage. We may need to give further thought to the point that the hon. Gentleman raises, but a deferred sentence involves a determinate threat hanging over somebody's head. That is not the effect of a conditional discharge.
<P>
In practice, the courts generally do not end up giving anything for the breach of a conditional discharge. Often, it is wiped out of all consideration. That seems entirely inappropriate for the serious behaviour that is likely to give rise to an anti-social behaviour order and the serious nature of somebody having continued with a pattern of behaviour, despite the fact that an order has been granted by the court.
<P>
It is possible that a serious offence might overtake breach of proceedings. I fear that that may happen in some cases, but the police and the Crown Prosecution Serice must study the evidence. Although it is likely that that may happen in some cases, one only has to study serious cases in court, when a pattern of behaviour over a long period of time is described: it will be the last incident only that has led to an appearance before the court, but the description of behaviour will help us to understand why we want to intervene earlier and prevent such serious cases arising. That is what the public wants and that is what we need to do. That is why we have brought forward these proposals. I hope that Opposition Members, having heard my explanations, will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We all share the desire to deal with the problem of disorder on estates, but that does not prevent us from asking if we are going about it in the right way in the Bill. On questions of details, it will not do for the Government to bluster and say, ``Well, we're dealing with these problems of disorder. We shall not answer any questions of detail and we don't care if we get the legislation right or wrong.''
<P>
Some of the Minister's answers today have been satisfactory, but I am less convinced by part of the answer he just gave on the previous point. Although I shall not press the issue, I remain disappointed by the Minister' s response. I do not think that he answered satisfactorily the points on conditional discharge made by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. If the Minister is concerned about things not being put off, why leave in the possibility of courts giving a deferred sentence and take out the possibility of them ordering a conditional discharge? The Minister has not entirely answered my original question which was why leave in an absolute discharge, which is lower than a conditional discharge in the scale of sentencing, and take out a conditional discharge?
<P>
Might not the effect of that be that courts will look at transgressions and breaches of orders and say that, although they are more than merely a technical breach, they are not serious and that as they cannot give a conditional discharge, they will give an absolute discharge instead? Might it not push the sentence down one rung of the ladder rather than, as is presumably the Government's intention, push it up? We warned the Government of the dangers of doing that and how it may appear that someone has already been made subject to the criminal sentence. We are not entirely satisfied with the answer to that, but the matter may have to wait until a later date when the Government seek to convince another tribunal that prohibiting a conditional discharge is not a sentence in itself.
<P>
I am still not convinced about breach and aggravated breach. I appreciate that the circumstances in which courts will give the maximum sentence is a matter for them, but we must think about proportionality with other sentences. We have to try to cater for the worst cases and give the courts some flexibility. I find it hard to envisage circumstances in which the mere breach, not aggravated by the commission of further acts causing harassment, alarm or distress, and not aggravated by criminal behaviour, might be worth five years' imprisonment. If we cannot think of any such circumstances, should we leave that as a provision in the Bill? Is there not a danger of making this sentence disproportionate to those which could be given for other offences?
<P>
I remind the Minister that affray carries a maximum sentence of three years and involves putting people in fear for their physical safety. A violent disorder, which has the same maximum sentence for breach, as I imagine the Minister knows well, encompasses really serious behaviour and problems of disorder and violence which terrify people out of their wits. We are putting a breach on a level with that sort of behaviour.
<P>
To answer the point made by the hon. Member for Hallam, if the behaviour is accompanied by the commission of a criminal offence, a person in breach could be charged with a criminal offence as well and sentenced accordingly. We are a little unclear about what happens when criminal proceedings are undertaken at the same time as civil proceedings and the police decide to prosecute for the behaviour for which the local authority is seeking an anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
We are once again left with the problem of the Bill's vagueness. We are failing in our duty to give the courts the definitions and guidance they require. We have already had this problem with the definition of criminal behaviour. The courts are aware only of criminal and non-criminal behaviour; the interesting expression ``sub-criminal behaviour'' has crept in, but they will have no idea what it is. They are being given only a limited amount of guidance on how they should deal with people who are in breach of anti-social behaviour orders because they are being given a wide range of possible sentences up to five years' imprisonment. That is not giving them sufficient guidance on sentences for breach.
<P>
The amendment would have improved the Bill. It would have been sensible to have had six months for a breach and five years for an aggravated breach, but the Minister has set his face against that. Although I am disappointed by the response, in view of the need to make progress, I shall be seeking leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the use of conditional and absolute discharges. There is a strong case for saying that this is a situation where conditional discharge would have been a useful tool for the courts. We referred earlier to the example of a person breaching an exclusion order in a way which causes no harassment, alarm or distress. The court needs a range of options to deal with minor breaches of those orders. An example was given of a person late for school taking a short cut and accidentally transgressing into an area prohibited by such an order. The conditional discharge was a useful tool, and the hon. Member for Hertsmere was right to say that the courts will ratchet down the penalties given because the only other option will be the absolute discharge.
<P>
The Minister's comments on conditional discharge were worrying and could apply to any use of such a discharge. Do the Government intend to remove the option of conditional discharge in a variety of offences? In terms of human rights, the only offence that needs to be proven to the criminal standard is breach of the order. It may be straightforward to prove to the criminal standard that a person went out at an hour or to a place not permitted by the order, but originally the order would have been imposed according to the civil standard. That may need to be borne in mind when considering possible breaches.
<P>
The Crown Prosecution Service will have to make some difficult decisions about possible disposals when a serious offence is committed. Should the CPS prosecute a breach of an order, or an offence of, for example, affray? The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 imposed a maximum of six months' imprisonment for intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress, yet this Committee has been discussing people being punished severely for breaches of an order which may not be intentional.
<P>
Finally, there is an analogy to be drawn with the people supposedly hanged for stealing handkerchiefs. The word got around quickly that people were not being hanged for that offence, but deported instead. Something similar may happen in this instance: the Bill may stipulate five years, but the people subject to the orders will soon become familiar with the actual sentences being handed down. The deterrent in the Bill will end up being unusable in the courts and it will not have the effect intended among the general public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The debate has been useful and latterly touched on some important matters. I want to focus on whether conditional discharge is available as a penalty. I can understand that the Minister would not want proceedings to be protracted but would prefer the courts to be able to deal with breaches quickly, seriously and with a degree of certainty. However, the courts have several relevant tools available: the absolute discharge, which seems to have been retained; the conditional discharge, which appears to be going; the deferred sentence, and the fine.
<P>
The deferred sentence is an important option, as it allows the court to adjourn for six months. If a defendant behaves himself for that period, the court is able to say that that is probably the end of the matter. The court can also impose a fine, which can be as low as &#163;5. I hope that the Minister will clarify on Report which of those available sentences are being kept, and why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I must make it clear that this morning I have said simply that the conditional discharge is not appropriate for the circumstances surrounding the breach of an order. That is because an order, although not a criminal finding, like a conditional discharge enjoins people not to offend again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> A conditional discharge is a penalty imposed by the cirminal law. A person in court for breach of an anti-social behaviour order may be given a conditional discharge for two years. This is a criminal matter, and the effect of that discharge will be that if the defendant stays out of trouble--[Interruption.] I think that the Minister said I was talking rubbish. I should be glad to hear why he thinks so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman is talking about what is criminal and what is not. We are talking about how to tell people not to behave in an anti-social way again, and how to succeed in preventing them behaving in such a way again. That is the purpose of the order that we are discussing. The hon. Gentleman's arguments have trapped him up a blind alley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am scratching my head, because I do not think that they have. However, it is good to see Labour Back Benchers nodding their agreement to everything that the Minister says.
<P>
If a person is convicted under subsection (10) and breaches an anti-social behaviour order, subsection (11) makes it clear that it will not be open to the court by or before which he is convicted to grant him a conditional discharge. That suggests that the power of conditional discharge, which is a penalty under criminal law and goes on the record, will be removed. Conservative Members are not happy about that. A conditional discharge normally lasts for two years and if someone does not get into further criminal trouble in that time, he is told that that is the end of the matter. However, if he commits a further criminal offence, he will be sentenced not just for the subsequent offence, but differently for the original one. Therefore, it is silly to argue that the penalty of criminal discharge must be removed from the court's hands when the power to impose a deferred sentence will remain.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister also failed to tell us what will happen after the first instance of a defendant's appalling behaviour. Will it be possible for a local authority, after consultation with the police, to apply for an anti-social behaviour order if, at the same time and in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, the police decide to implement criminal proceedings? That would be two sledgehammers to crack one nut. If a local authority is unable to apply for an order in such circumstances, that is fine. However, will the Minister tell us whether such action will be possible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 3, line 37, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(11A) It shall be the duty of the relevant authority to appoint an independent person to monitor applications for anti-social behaviour orders and to publish a report each year in the local government area giving such details of the applications as he thinks fit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take clause stand part and amendment No. 17, in page 3, line 44, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(13) The Secretary of State shall within two years of this section coming into effect make a report to Parliament on the working of anti-social behaviour orders'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The case for the amendments has been made stronger by what we have heard in the debates on anti-social behaviour orders. Although we appreciate that making an order is a matter for the courts, we thought it important to subject applications for them to proper scrutiny. The case for such scrutiny has been strengthened, and especially in the case of local authority applications.
<P>
The case for an independent monitor is already strong, given the width of conduct with which anti-social behaviour orders might deal. Nothing we have heard has allayed our concerns about that.
<P>
An independent monitor would be an additional safeguard against the orders being used to discriminate on the grounds of race, religion or disability. We asked why the Government did not fulfil their promise to put such a provision into the Bill, and I do not want to go over those arguments again. However, independent scrutiny would assist in preventing discrimination and would make people feel absolutely sure that the orders could not be used in a discriminatory fashion.
<P>
There are circumstances in which the orders could be used in a discriminatory way without that amounting to discrimination on the grounds of race, religion or so forth. The orders will cover a wide variety of behaviour, and we have heard the expression ``sub-criminal behaviour''. However, we do not know what that means and fear that the courts will not, either. We are worried that the orders might be used against unpopular or eccentric people or against those with unconventional lifestyles. We know what the Government mean by disorder on estates, but they will know what we mean when we refer to people on estates with different lifestyles. Their unconventional behaviour may mean that they are not the most popular people on the estate, but they have a right to their lifestyle, and we should guard against the anti-social behaviour order being used as an instrument against them. People with different lifestyles, who are sometimes eccentric or unpopular, tend to be the subjects of--often groundless--gossip and suspicion. There is a danger that local authorities will apply for anti-social behaviour orders to deal with such people. Amendment No. 29, which proposes the independent monitoring of applications, would help to deal with that problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 would require that a report to Parliament be made within two years about the operation of anti-social behaviour orders. We have heard many claims made regarding the orders, but we must ensure that they work and monitor closely what they deliver. During the Committee's proceedings the Government have changed their position on the anti-social behaviour order as it was originally presented. We have discovered for the first time that young people are largely outside the scope of anti-social behaviour orders, and that the orders are to be used principally for criminal or sub-criminal behaviour, although such behaviour has not been exactly defined.
<P>
Anti-social behaviour orders are apparently to be used instead of prosecutions for public order offences. In circumstances in which the police would normally have prosecuted a person for an offence under the Public Order Act 1986, an application may instead be made for an anti-social behaviour order. Instead of being brought before a magistrates court, prosecuted and--if found guilty--sentenced for a public order offence, people will be brought before the same court and be subject to an anti-social behaviour order. A person who is brought before a court and sentenced thereby receives a criminal conviction. The person has to serve that sentence, whatever it may be, and it remains on his record. Should he get into trouble again, his position will be made all the worse by virtue of the fact that he has a previous conviction. Under the Government's proposals, an anti-social behaviour order will have been made and the person will be dealt with for being in breach of it. There may be considerable presentational change involved in that, but how much has changed in substance? The Bill involves a certain amount of relabelling by the Government, and we suspect that this provision is an example of that. A report to Parliament would help in assessing the orders and in judging whether their achievements measure up to the Government's claims.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Liberal Democrat Members believe that these are sensible amendments. A reporting system would provide an important way of assessing the effective use, and the possible misuse, of anti-social behaviour orders. Because of the wide scope of the order's potential applications, and the severity of the penalties involved, the order should be subject to great public scrutiny, which should take place in this Committee.
<P>
The Minister has referred frequently to the kind of behaviour that needs to be dealt with. All hon. Members see people in their surgeries every week whose quality of life suffers dramatically because of the behaviour of those around them. However, the orders must hit the right target. If the Government oversell the product that is formulated in clause 2, there may be great public disappointment, or public expectation that orders will be wrongly applied. The Minister briefed members of my local authority on the orders, and I was pleased about that. Much more of that kind of activity will be required before the orders are introduced, because local authorities have only a hazy idea of their implications.
<P>
In earlier debates, Committee members referred back to the Government's original consultation document. It is now clear that many of the statements contained in that document are no longer consistent with the Government's current thinking. I am worried that many of the moves that we have welcomed are some distance away from the contents of the consultation document. I hope that the orders will be used to deal with the Minister's elephant on the doorstep rather than the mouse on the doorstep, or the person who is doing no harm but whose face does not fit. I am sure that the Minister does not wish to see the orders misapplied; however, in most cases he will not have direct control over their application.
<P>
During the debate we have sought to clarify the Bill. In practice the orders will be applied on the basis of non-statutory guidance. The relevant authorities should therefore have the power to report back. That would enable us to assess the number of elephants against whom orders were made, and the number of mice for whom orders were hopefully refused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> The clause has prompted a very good debate. The Minister smiles--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Only with pleasure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Some points are teased out and answered immediately, whereas others are answered later. Many Opposition Members were pleased to discover that legal aid will be available in such cases, and that an order will not constitute part of a criminal record.
<P>
There remain one or two outstanding points. The Minister said that he would examine the interesting question of the person who consistently causes harassment and havoc in a number of local authority areas. He said that he would consider whether in such a case an order could be made that would cover a number of local authority areas, and whether a ruling would be made about the magistrates court in which the complaint would initially be decided. The Minister recognised that such a circumstance can arise, and that the matter should therefore be looked into.
<P>
As we finish debating the clause we are to some extent wiser. However, I doubt whether any of us knows what kind of conduct would give rise to such an order. Having said that, I have enjoyed the debate, and I look forward to discussing the rest of the Bill over the coming months. I also look forward to as many contributions as possible from Labour Back Benchers, which would be helpful to Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I welcome the point made by the hon. Member for Hallam about the need for a wide discussion on the use of orders. As he said, he was present when I spoke to Sheffield city council. He will therefore have noticed the way in which the orders were welcomed by the chief constable, and indeed by members of the city council.
<P>
Many of us will recognise the evil with which the orders seek to deal. The hon. Member for Hallam said that the orders must be applied carefully to ensure that they hit the right target. As I tried to make clear during last Thursday's debate in particular, we will ensure that that happens.
<P>
I understand why the hon. Member for Hertsmere has tabled the amendments. However, amendment No. 29 is unnecessary and bureaucratic. There are a variety of ways in which to review and monitor the use of orders. For example, local crime and disorder strategies entail the publishing of reports as well as the setting of targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister's last comment takes me by surprise. Is he suggesting that a target will be set for the number of anti-social behaviour orders made in the course of a crime and disorder strategy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, the target will be to reduce the amount of crime and disorder, and to consult regularly with all parts of a given community. Such consultation periods would discover whether--as the hon. Member for Hallam suggested--one part of a community had been inappropriately subjected to the orders.
<P>
There are other ways in which to review and monitor orders. Conservative Members have raised doubts which were answered in the debates that we had last week. We understand that the Magistrates Association may issue sentencing guidelines for the courts. That will be helpful, as that is not a function for the Home Office alone. Police and local authorities will monitor the situation locally, and are working nationally in a partnership approach with the Government. We will examine how the orders are used and, if necessary, will amend and upgrade guidance. The picture is not static.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I return to the elephants on the doorstep that the hon. Member for Hallam brought back into the debate. It is clear that the police and local authorities recognise those animals, and I am confident that the courts will use common sense in dealing with applications and breaches.
<P>
We believe that there should be a regular review of the success or otherwise of legislation. We are currently examining the early working of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. I share the previous Government's view that a review should not be incorporated in the Bill, but I give an undertaking that we will review matters and that we will report our findings to Parliament. We aim to to do that within two years or even earlier, but that will depend on priorities and experience in several areas.
<P>
I have answered the points made by Conservative Members. I hope that they will join us in welcoming the orders, which will help the police, local authorities and the courts to protect individuals and communities from anti-social behaviour. I had hoped that Opposition Members would show greater enthusiasm and unequivocal support for tackling a real evil in society.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That was my closing sentence. Opposition Members have had all of their questions answered, so they should be able to demonstrate that support in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not sure that we have been given answers to all of our questions. We have been told that people to be targeted by anti-social orders are like elephants on the doorstep--we will know them when we see them. I am not entirely satisfied by that. I am tempted to say that I hope that people who read those comments in Hansard do not find a white elephant. On that possibly inappropriate note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Sex offender orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 4, line 4, after `public', insert `or any individual'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 18, in page 4, line 4, leave out `serious'.
<P>
No. 19, in page 4, line 4, at end insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 91, in page 4, line 15, after `public', insert `or any individual'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall speak briefly to amendment Nos. 90 and 91 because they are technical amendments. It is possible to envisage a situation in which a person is a sex offender and gives the authorities cause to believe that an order may be necessary to protect a particular individual from serious harm, rather than the public alone. It is just possible that someone might behave in such a way towards an individual--for example, as the result of a fixation about him or her--that it would be necessary to seek an order under the clause. At the same time, however, that person may not be a danger, threat or worry to any other member of the public. By widening the prescription slightly, one could bring in such possible, albeit unusual, cases. That is the spirit in which I table my amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am afraid that I shall have to speak at slightly greater length than my hon. Friend the Member for Woking to amendments Nos. 18 and 19--particularly amendment No. 18, which we regard as potentially very important.
<P>
We appreciate that this is an extremely serious matter. Sex offender orders have been proposed by the Government as one of the main ways of protecting the public from sex offenders, especially paedophiles. Conservative Members recognise the need to respond to legitimate public concern regarding sex offenders, but we join Liberal Democrat Members and hon. Members from other parties in setting our face against the more hysterical manifestations of that concern, including the behaviour of those who seek to take the law into their own hands, thereby doing more harm than good.
<P>
However, we need to reassure the public that we are doing all that we can to protect them. We are concerned that the Bill's drafting could place serious limitations on the effectiveness of sex offender orders. In particular, there could be circumstances in which although the public and perhaps even the Government might expect sex offender orders to provide protection from sex offenders, The Bill's drafting would prevent that. Our amendments are designed to explore those serious limitations.
<P>
The conditions that need to be fulfilled before a sex offender order can be made are, first, that the person is a sex offender, and secondly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the person has acted|in such a way as to give reasonable cause to believe that an order|is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill defines a sex offender as someone who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has been convicted of a sexual offence to which Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is by no means our main point, but we wonder whether there are some offences to which the Sex Offenders Act 1997 does not apply, although the public might expect a sex offender order to be available for them. Will the Minister confirm, for example, that a sex offender order would not be available where the previous conviction of the person in question is for indecent exposure? It looks as though such confirmation may be forthcoming in due course. Under the provision, if a man with a previous conviction for what we commonly describe as flashing was seen behaving strangely on the local common, the police would be powerless to obtain an order to prevent him going onto that common. If such an order were applied, of course, the man would breach it by going onto the common.
<P>
There is another, much more serious problem in the second condition that must be fulfilled before a sex offender order is granted, namely
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the person has acted, since the relevant date, in such a way as to give reasonable cause to believe that an order under this section is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When I first read the Bill, the expression ``serious harm'' sprang out at me. I thought that it could give rise to serious problems, and I wondered whether it would make more sense to stipulate that the public should be protected from harm, rather than raising the threshold to serious harm. Amendment No. 18 would remove the need for harm to be serious, and would ensure that an order could be used to prevent the public from harm, and, under amendment No. 19, from alarm or distress.
<P>
When I first saw the Bill, that was my reaction. I did not then appreciate, however, that the use of the term ``serious harm'' would lead into a legal minefield. I now wonder openly whether the use of that term will take the sex offender order into such a minefield, and whether the people faced with the decision of whether to grant an order will have to confront that minefield and make their way through it.
<P>
Nobody can be blamed for not realising at first the full implications of the term ``serious harm''--the drafting is not exactly explicit. Anyone reading clause 3 is in for a bit of a search to find out what it means. Clause 4 defines a sex offender, relevant dates and other terms, but is silent with regard to serious harm.
<P>
One could be forgiven for assuming that the lack of definition means that the term does not refer to other legislation, but has its ordinary, natural meaning. Such an assumption would be wrong. The Bill does contain a definition of serious harm, but one has to make one's way to clause 18(2) to find it. However, clause 18(2) is not explicit either. I shall read it in its entirety. I apologise for having to do so, but it is important for the Committee to hear just how badly drafted the Bill is with regard to this matter. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In this Chapter, unless the contrary intention appears, expressions which are also used in Part I of the Criminal Justice Act 1991|have the same meanings as in that Part.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Serious harm happens to be defined in the Criminal Justice Act 1991. There is no clue in the Bill, however, that that Act will provide a definition.
<P>
Why on earth did not the Government define serious harm in the Bill? Why did they leave it to be dealt with in clause 18(2), which does not mention serious harm, but which defines it for legal purposes? Clear it is not.
<P>
For a definition of serious harm, mentioned in clause 3, one has to go to section 31(3) of the Criminal Justice Act, which states, in relation to an offender, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any reference . . . to protecting the public from serious harm from him shall be construed as a reference to protecting members of the public from death or serious personal injury, whether physical or psychological, occasioned by further such offences committed by him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It might be thought that the threshold of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``death or serious personal injury, whether physical or psychological''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is high. Members of the public who look at that test might think that it is fairly strict.
<P>
It is worth remembering just why the test was set so high for the purposes of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The definition appears there because it relates to the passing of custodial sentences, and to those that are longer than usual, for sexual or violent offences. It might be thought that the degree of harm needed to justify locking somebody up for a potentially very long time is different from the degree of harm that should properly justify imposing a prohibition preventing somebody from hanging around the school gates--the example that the Government often give--the local library or the swimming pool. There is a salutary warning in all that for those who simply take definitions from one piece of legislation and apply them to another without thinking about their purpose. We are dealing with two quite different purposes. In one case, the purpose is to lock somebody up for a long time; in the other, it is simply to impose prohibitions on him.
<P>
Conservative Members suspect that the Government have made a serious mistake by lifting the definition from the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Do they realise just how serious that mistake is in the light of the decided authorities on the operation of the definition.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before making a sex offender order, a magistrates court will have to be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. It will presumably have details of the offender's previous conviction. The magistrates will have to decide whether the harm from which they want to protect the public is serious harm. They are bound by the definition in section 31 of the 1991 Act and by the decided authorities in regard to what amounts to serious harm. The Government's guidance makes it clear that the magistrates courts will be bound by the decided authorities in regard to the definition in section 31. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Regard will have to be paid to the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal when interpreting this phrase in the light of the definition in Section 31.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
High Court and Court of Appeal decisions on the meaning of serious harm might result in significant problems in that context. Were the Government aware of the decided authorities when they chose the definition and when it put the note in the guidance?
<P>
All the authorities are, of course, decided on their own facts, but I want to give one interesting example of an order on which there is a decided authority. An order could be made under a sex offender order to prevent a defendant from hanging around primary school gates. The Government and others often give that example, and the Government's guidance note does so. Members of the Committee might want to consider the case of Creasey, which was a Court of Appeal case. It is one of the cases to which a magistrates court would have to look when deciding whether harm amounted to serious harm.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me for taking the unusual step of reading from the case, but it is one of the authorities that appears in the current sentencing practice, which is edited by Professor David Thomas and which deals with the definition of serious harm under the Criminal Justice Act 1991. It is the sort of case to which the magistrates courts will have to pay heed.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The appellant, a man aged 54, pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 13. On three occasions the appellant followed the boy on his way home from school, placed a hand on the boy's genitalia through his trousers and attempted to masturbate him. The boy was upset. The appellant had one previous conviction in 1961 for two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 13, and one in 1975 for two counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 8, similar on their facts to the present offences, in respect of which a probation order was made. The Crown Court had a pre-sentence report, a report from a probation officer specialising in the treatment of sexual offenders, and a report from a clinical psychologist. The reports indicated that the appellant was of paedophiliac orientation, unlikely to respond to a treatment programme, and likely to offend in a manner similar to his previous offences. The appellant was unable to recognise or accept responsibility for his behaviour. Sentenced to give years' imprisonment, passed as a longer then normal sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 1991.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall briefly leave the head note, which concerns an appeal against the sentence to the Court of Appeal. This is what the Court of Appeal said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The question of whether or not [these offences] met the criteria laid down in section 1(2)(b) was, however, a different matter.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 1(2)(b) applies when the offence is a violent or sexual offence, which these clearly were, that only such a sentence would be adequate to protect the public from serious harm from the offender. The trial judge also made clear that he had in mind section 2(2)(b) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 which is in the following terms:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2) The custodial sentence shall be:--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) where the offence is a violent or sexual one, for such longer term (not exceeding that maximum) as in the opinion of the court is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender.'
<P></UL></FONT>

The trial judge therefore had to consider whether or not, if he was going to impose a sentence which was longer than that which would normally be justified for the offence on its intrinsic merits, such a sentence was necessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender. It was firstly necessary therefore to consider whether or not the term imposed by the trail judge of five years was longer than that which was justified on the intrinsic merits of the offence.<P>

<P>
We have no doubt that the sentence imposed fell above the level that was merited intrinsically by the offence on each occasion, even taking into acount as the trial judge clearly did, and was entitled to take into account, under section 3(3) of the Act;<P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `Any aggravating and mitigating factors in relation to the circumstances of the offence.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The aggravating factors in that context, of course, were the pattern of previous offending, the repeating nature of this offending in relation to this one boy. The appropriate level of sentence on a plea of guilty in our judgment on the intrinsic merits of the offence would be in the region of 18 months to two years, and clearly there is a matter of judgment within that level to be arrived at. <P>
<P>
Did it, however, fall within the criteria required under section 2(2)(b)? In our judgment it did not. What the report before the trial judge showed was that there was a real risk of the repetition of such conduct by this appellant, notwithstanding the fact that there had been substantial gaps between the appearances in court in 1961, 1975 and 1992. What the reports and pattern and the nature of these offences did not show, in our judgment, was that there was likely to be serious harm to the public from this offender. The nature of the offences actually committed whilst unpleasant and distressing, and not to be in any way lightly regarded did not, in our judgement, amount to such offences as would necessitate protecting the public from serious harm.<P>
<P>
The trial judge fell, understandably perhaps in the light of the reports, into the trap of assessing the seriousness of the risk rather than the seriousness of the harm, which is what the statute requires. In all the circumstances, therefore, this appeal must succeed because, in our view, the trial judge was wrong in imposing a longer sentence than was merited for the offences themselves.''<P>
<P>
The magistrates courts will have to perform exactly the same exercise in their interpretation of serious harm. Instead of an appeal against an extra-long sentence, under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the same scenario will apply to an appeal against a magistrates court order for one of these sexual offences or sex offender orders because of the ground of serious harm.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me for having quoted that case in full. However, it is important to hear such cases and to take on board the fact that an offender whose offending behaviour was the same as that of the gentleman in the Court of Appeal case could not be restrained by a sex offender order because the requirement of serious harm could not be made out. That was what happened in this case, when the Court of Appeal decided that an additionally long sentence was not justified.
<P>
There are other cases in which the courts have accepted that the requirement of the risk of serious harm has been made out for these purposes of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for justifying a longer than normal sentence. In particular, there is the case of Bowler, in which such a sentence was held to be justified on the grounds of serious harm. The case involved a man who carried out an assault at a Sunday school class; he carried out a serious indecent assault on a six-year-old girl. He had eight previous convictions since the age of 16 for indecent assaults on adult women, four of which had resulted in custodial sentences. The Court of Appeal made it clear that in forming an opinion as to whether there was a danger that serious harm might occur in the future, it was not limited to looking at the facts of previous convictions but could look at other material before it, such as reports. There was said to be a wealth of such evidence in the case of Bowler, in which the court decided that the ground of serious harm was made out and that a longer than normal sentence was therefore justified. That illustrates the approach that the courts have taken towards the definition of serious harm in the Criminal Justice Act 1991. However, in the case of applications in the sex offender order, there will be no provision for the courts to obtain reports or to have such material before it. The courts will have details only of previous convictions and recent behaviour on the part of the defendant that is giving rise to concern.
<P>
There are different outcomes over the interpretation of the meaning of ``serious harm'' for the purposes of the Bill. The expression ``serious harm'' has been given a strict meaning by the courts and its appearance in the sex offender order means that courts that wish to make such an order will find themselves venturing into a legal minefield. We are entitled to ask the Government why they have included the expression ``serious harm'' and why they are taking the courts into such a legal minefield, with the result that there will be a great deal of legal argument. Courts will find themselves in difficulties, with the likelihood of appeals in cases in which orders are granted. It will severely limit the effectiveness of the orders.
<P>
We wonder whether the Government foresaw the difficulty because, in the words of their own consultation document, they state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is possible, also, that in order to determine whether to make a Community Protection Order''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--which was the phrase then being used for a sex offender order--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a court will have to evaluate quite complex evidence from several expert sources which may lead to significant legal argument.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are concerned about those difficulties for the courts. They may even deter the police from seeking such an order. Or if an order is sought, it may not be granted. The overall result could be that the sex offender order provisions in the Bill will not afford the public the protection that they have been led to expect. Although the Bill has been presented as giving the public the necessary protection, it could be seriously flawed. We think that amendments Nos. 18 and 19--amendment No. 19 in particular--represents a way out. The Government will find it difficult to justify the unamended Bill. I for one will be listening carefully to the Minister's response to the debate.
<P>
Why did the Government choose to use the term ``serious harm''? Why did they take the term from an Act in which it served a different purpose? Do the Government accept that the authorities to which we have referred will be relevant to the meaning of ``serious harm'' for the purposes of the sex offender order? We think that the Government accept that because of what was said in the guidance order. Most importantly, will the Government think again and restudy the amendments?
<P>
There is nothing that the Minister can say today or set out in guidance that will have any effect on this issue because the Government's chosen definition--``serious harm''--is one that already appears in legislation and has already been the subject of legal analysis and authority. There is nothing that the Government can say today to make matters better, if the expresion ``serious harm'' is left in the Bill. We urge the Government to think about the matter and, on Report, to produce a better solution that will afford the public the protection that they have been led to expect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I want to take up the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere and for Woking. I hope that not only the Minister, but hon. Members--particularly honourable Ladies--will take our concerns over the Bill extremely seriously. As I mentioned in declaring my interest--as somebody who is a member of the Bar and has practised at the Bar in such cases over several years before coming to the House of Commons--I think there are great concerns.
<P>
I shall discuss first the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. I draw the Committee's attention to particular cases in which the behaviour of sex offenders has been limited after their release to persecuting one particular individual. I am thinking in particular of the kind of case which has been described generically as stalking. It is not restricted to stalking of women by men although that is the most common form. Male homosexual sex offenders can stalk young boys in the kind of case that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has so graphically illustrated.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider thinking further about the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) because it is particularly important to make it clear that the harm or threat of harm might be directed to one individual, not to the public at large. We have all seen the appalling problems in the case of Sidney Cooke in the past couple of weeks. None of us would condone the mob violence from those who simply wanted an excuse to attack the police. But there is no doubt that the peaceful demonstration by different people earlier in the day showed the extent of the public concern about sex offenders after their release.
<P>
I welcome the fact that the Government are bringing forward some proposals to deal with these problems. As I said on Second Reading, these proposals were originally put forward by the Conservative party before the election as part of its programme. I am delighted that the Labour Government have taken it forward but the genesis of these measures, including dealing with sex offenders, was set out in Conservative proposals well before the election.
<P>
I welcome the fact that we now have all-party consensus about the need to do something about sex offenders after their release. I urge the Ministers to consider accepting, if not now perhaps later, the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. I use as an example a case which received quite a lot of national publicity. I do not want to accentuate that as it was a matter of great distress to the family concerned. It involved a lady whom I knew very well who had been active in politics at various times as a Conservative, a Liberal Democrat and also an Independent. She had a daughter in her 20s who was extremely attractive and, sadly, the object of an obsessive stalking campaign by a much older man.
<P>
The campaign continued despite visits to court to get injunctions and despite the criminal penalties imposed on him and continued after his release. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking is right to say that such cases require the amendment to ensure that the necessary powers are available to the courts, even if the harm or the threat of harm is directed only at one individual, be it an adult or a child--it should not be a reference to the public at large.
<P>
I turn now to the official Opposition amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. I entirely agree with what he said about the legal minefield of ``serious harm''. I cannot do much more than reinforce the points that he made in considerable detail. The first thing that occurred to me as a lawyer when I saw the phrase ``serious harm'', which as my hon. Friend pointed out has received a great deal of judicial scrutiny in the higher courts, was that it would lead to problems.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consult further with their officials and will be able to accept at least the spirit of our amendments. If so, we will end up with a much better Bill, with wider powers which will not lead to the kind of problems that we anticipate with the current Bill. It will also ensure that more people are protected. I am sure that I speak for every member of the Committee in saying that our main wish is to ensure that people cannot be preyed upon repeatedly by sex offenders. We know that those offenders have obsessions. The courts find it almost impossible to deter them and they try repeatedly to prey on similar people--sometimes obsessively stalking the very same person. The Bill should be aimed at protecting those people. I want protection for as many people as possible. I hope that the Government will reflect seriously on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am interested in the Minister's way of defining the behaviour that would be covered by an order under the clause. Clause 3(1)(b) refers to a person having
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acted, since the relevant date''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in a way giving rise to an application. A debate took place in the House of Lords about the ``relevant date'', and it may be an appropriate moment for the Minister to comment on that, but I assume that what is meant is the implementation of the Bill.
<P>
The condition set out in clause 3(1)(b) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the person has acted, since the relevant date, in such a way as to give reasonable cause to believe that an order under this section is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to probe to discover what behaviour is meant. A Library research paper sets out the provisions relevant to this matter under section 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If a police officer in England or Wales has reasonable grounds to believe that a person will cause physical injury to himself or others, or if he has reasonable grounds to believe that arrest is necessary to protect a child or other vulnerable person, he may exercise his power of arrest under Section 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is not necessary for the prosecutor to prove that actual harm was suffered by a third party. Nor is it necessary for the prosecution to establish that an accused person actually intended such a result. These powers may often be relevant where sex offenders are involved.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does the Minister envisage that the working of an order under clause 3 would differ from the working of section 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984? Why is the proposed new order necessary, given the existence of that section? I am not arguing that it is not necessary; it may well be.
<P>
My next point follows on from the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere and for Woking. It is clear under existing law that the police must be concerned about behaviour that might be a threat to an individual. The Minister obviously believes that a wider power, relating to the general public, is now needed. If that is the case, it is incumbent on the Minister to state what behaviour he has in mind. I have been racking my brains and all that I can think of that might be relevant is what might be termed geographical behaviour; a convicted sex offender hanging about a certain location--probably a school.
<P>
Existing provisions may well not be sufficient. Possibly they could not deal with a clear pattern of behaviour such as I have mentioned, and the Government's proposal might therefore be necessary. However, it would be useful if the Minister would tell us. If he has in mind forms of behaviour other than those I have described--presumably the subject was discussed with officials when the Bill was being framed--he should let us know.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) said, if a Conservative Government had been returned at the general election, much the same sort of provision might well have been implemented under the community protection orders proposal.
<P>
It appears that a consultation paper stated of that proposal that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provisions of the Order will be primarily focused on protecting the community by putting measures in place which the defendant would be expected to follow.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That passage describes the apparent intentions of the Conservative Government, which were set out in the consultation paper issued in November 1997. I was not privy to the relevant detailed discussions between Ministers and officials in 1997 and nor was the Minister. It would not be fair to question him on that matter. At that time, however, the then Ministers were talking about proactive measures. I might be wrong about that. Obviously, the Minister has had discussions with his colleagues and he should be able to answer my questions. Does the behaviour that is envisaged relate to the geographical location of the particular sex offender? How does that relate to section 25 of the 1984 Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I share the view that we must understand and respond to the wide public concern about the danger posed by sex offenders, especially paedophiles. We have to do that reasonably and effectively, rather than by simply reacting to expressions of concern and anger. As has been rightly said, such expressions of anger are sometimes used by people for their own ends. We must respond to the genuine concerns.
<P>
The proposal for the orders has not been introduced out of the blue but is the result of careful consideration. I must chide the hon. Members for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and for Gainsborough for trying to claim the credit for the proposals that we are discussing. They might recall that for a long time the previous Government resisted the idea of legislation to establish a paedophiles register that would provide the kind of protections that were introduced under the Sex Offenders Act 1997. When we debated that legislation, I welcomed the belated support of Conservative Members for a measure for which Labour Members had argued for a number of years. If I have interpreted the remarks of Conservative Members correctly, I also welcome their support for the orders.
<P>
The introduction of the orders is part of the Government's determination to tackle logically and effectively the serious and intransigent problem of sex offenders. The orders must be seen against the background of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, which has resulted in a sea-change in attitudes towards dealing with sex offenders. That Act has changed the situation from one in which people were wringing their hands over the dangers and were expressing anger at events to one in which there are attempts to identify and manage the risk of danger and so to avoid it turning into reality.
<P>
One of my first ministerial tasks was to work on the guidance for the implementation of the Sex Offenders Act. The Government said that the provisions of the Act must ensure that information was passed to the police and that it should not just gather dust in a file or sit in a computer. It should be used for the protection of children and vulnerable adults. I want to pay tribute to the way in which the police--especially the Association of Chief Police Officers, led by the chief constable of Gloucestershire, Tony Butler, and, more recently, the chief constables of Sussex and of Avon and Somerset, who had to cope with practical issues--have managed problems relating to individuals who were previously allowed to disappear into the community on their release from prison.
<P>
Turning to amendments Nos. 90 and 91, I understand that there is concern for the protection of individuals. Normally such protection is extended generally to members of the public. However, in two recent cases, it was accepted that the reference to the public in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 might protect a small group of individuals, such as the defendant's ex-wife and any male friends who might be seen with her, or a single member of the public. That point was endorsed in the cases of Hashi in 1995 and Nicholas in 1994.
<P>
There are other ways of protecting individuals, of course: the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, to which we have referred on several occasions, provides some protection. However, it is clear that the Bill should be interpreted so as to protect an individual when that is appropriate. I am glad to be able to endorse the hon. Gentleman's argument. The amendment is not needed, but we support its intention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough mentioned the relevant date; clause 4(2) makes it clear that it is the date of conviction or, if later, the commencement of clause 3.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Several hon. Members mentioned precision on behaviour. Hon. Members should bear in mind, as we consider the point made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, that it is precisely because there must not be too narrow a definition of behaviour that we must be careful not to make the type of threat minimal. It would be nice if offenders would behave in a simple manner--the examples of hanging around school gates or carrying a bag of toys spring to mind because they illustrate the trigger for concern--but the hon. Gentleman and others would accept that we are dealing with devious and dangerous individuals whose behaviour is not simple and straightforward. It is therefore important not to limit behaviour in terms of the legislation, but to allow the courts to interpret a wide definition in accordance with the problems posed by an individual.
<P>
As to serious harm, a matter raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, we have spent considerable time discussing and examining the problem. I have instinctive sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's view, but we are treading a thin line in respect of human rights. The order, although preventive, may prevent an individual undertaking actions which in other circumstances might be perfectly reasonable. That is the critical difference between this and other injunction-type provisions. It is the critical difference in respect of the anti-social behaviour order which we discussed earlier. There may be simple, normal actions which an individual may be restrained from undertaking.
<P>
Issuing a sex offender order is a serious matter involving civil rights; it would not be appropriate in order to protect the public from witnessing someone flashing, for example. Flashing is a serious offence, which can be the subject of prosecution, but it is the seriousness of an individual's previous behaviour and his likely future behaviour that matters, not the seriousness of the actions given as evidence of the need for the order, nor the seriousness of the behaviour prevented. It is important to understand that distinction because it helps us to understand the way that the Bill, when enacted, will operate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Is the Minister telling us that the reason why the Government have fixed on the definition of serious harm is because there will be prohibitions against the defendant? If so, why can prohibitions, presumably of a similar nature, such as excluding someone from an area or imposing a curfew, be made under anti-social behaviour orders to protect people from harassment, alarm or distress, but not from serious harm?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Because it is the behaviour and effect on other members of the public that is the test in that respect. I explained the difference between the sex offender order and the other order and the importance of keeping that distinction in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Let me develop my point first. There must be some justification for the prohibitions that are required under a sex offenders order, which may be critically different from those available in respect of other orders, to balance the otherwise draconian nature of the order. That is why the view is taken that serious harm is the lowest level possible to achieve that balance. I repeat the point--I am sure that the hon. Member for Hertsmere appreciates it--that it is not a punishment; we are trying to prevent a danger becoming a reality. Protecting the public from serious harm is, by virtue of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, protecting them from death or serious personal injury which can be psychological, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, occasioned by further sexual offences committed by the same person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would allow me to develop my argument before I give way to him.
<P>
It is not enough to justify a sex offender order by the need to protect the public from alarm and distress. Such wider protection can be achieved in certain circumstances by means of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the anti-social behaviour order and the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986, but the wider protection under those provisions is balanced by the fact that the actions prohibited or punished are in themselves criminal, or at least anti-social. That need not be the case for the imposition of a sex offender order. That is the crucial difference.
<P>
To qualify for a sex offender order, an individual must be a sex offender, which is defined as having been convicted of or cautioned for an offence under schedule 1 of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. That is a wide-ranging starting point. The behaviour thus must give rise to concerns about reoffending; the behaviour in isolation might be reasonable--sitting in a park, watching children at play, for example--if it were not for the fact that the individual involved had already been convicted of a sexual offence. But it is important, for the reasons that I have already mentioned, that this type of behaviour can lead to an order being granted in the circumstances, and that the order can be used to prevent the commission of another type of offence. Since the police simply have to prove that a person has acted in such a way as to give a reasonable cause to believe that an order under this section is necessary to protect the public from serious harm, that should not be too difficult to achieve in cases of real concern. Moreover, as it is a civil matter, the standard of proof would be that appropriate to civil cases.
<P>
Many people argue that the test is too low; I disagree with them. Taken together with the points that I have just made, the position is tenable on human rights grounds, while protecting the public from the menace that reoffending by sex offenders presents. For that reason I must conclude that to amend the Bill as suggested, although attractive, would be untenable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister mentioned orders being granted when there was concern. Can he confirm that a magistrates court which was confronted with an offender with a previous conviction, such as Mr. Creasey, who had been behaving in a way that gave rise to concern, would not be able to make a prohibition against him because there would not be evidence of serious harm?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No, I do not believe that that is the case, but I will certainly look at the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. He made a considered presentation earlier, which is why I am taking his arguments so seriously. I will certainly look at the matter again.
<P>
There are two reasons for my view. First, as the hon. Gentleman said, Creasey stands in contrast to Bowler, whose case was decided in the same year, in which the defendant pleaded guilty to indecent assault. The court's decision was upheld on the basis that the court must have regard to the possibility of future victims who might be vulnerable to such conduct. It is for the courts to decide what is serious harm, but it is misleading to base that view solely on one decided case--that of Creasey.
<P>
The second crucial difference is that clause 3(1)(b) requires the court to assess risk, which is not the situation that arose in the Creasey case. Creasey is not on all fours with the Bill's provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Creasey was not about risk, but about the seriousness of the harm. That is the distinction that must be made. It is the same test which must be passed before an order is granted. Putting aside the matter of risk, the harm must be of a certain seriousness, which was not met in the case of Creasey.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> But that was a case about extended sentences, not behaviour, to which the sex offender order applies. It need not even cause distress, let alone constitute a criminal offence. The behaviour giving rise to the order and the assessment of risk are perhaps the elements that the hon. Gentleman has overlooked. I invite him to look at those points with great care, just as I undertake to look with great care at the arguments that he advanced earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am glad that the Minister has undertaken to reconsider, with his officials, the matters that we raised earlier. When he does so, will he bear one point specifically in mind? Four Opposition Members--my hon. Friends the Members for Hertsmere, for Woking and for Gainsborough and myself--are all experienced in the ways in which criminal defence advocates look at these matters when presented with a set of facts. If any of us were defending one of these cases, the first point we would look at is whether the prosecution could establish serious harm in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere set out in his initial contribution to the debate. That would be the best way of establishing the case for the defence.
<P>
Our experience leads us to believe that if the Minister does not address the point and does not amend the Bill in the way we have suggested, a big loophole will be left through which many of the people that the Minister wants to catch will be able to slip. I know that the Minister takes this seriously, and I am glad that he will look at that again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do indeed take it seriously and did so during the drafting of the Bill. While I do not have the hon. Gentleman's experience or legal expertise, I wanted to be sure that the order would work in the way that it is intended, both in the courts and, more important, in achieving the objective of protecting children and vulnerable adults. It is because I accept the importance of experience in dealing with these issues in the courts that I undertake to look at this again with my officials. But these points are not fresh; they have not arisen for the first time today.
<P>
We have been wrestling with the need, which I am sure all Opposition Members would accept, to set a threshold that is low enough to catch those who pose a danger to children and vulnerable adults without being so wide that it leads to human rights abuses and problems that might undermine the whole intention of these clauses. Our objective is to reconcile those two elements. I am sure that Opposition Members will accept that we are trying our best to do that. It is in that spirit that I will look at this again. As a result of the discussions we have undertaken so far, I believe that we probably have got it right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> When the Minister looked at this with his officials, were they aware of the case of Creasey which I cited?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I believe that that was so but I am not absolutely certain. I have undertaken to look at the points that the hon. Gentleman made. I shall cross-examine officials on their awareness of that case as part of the discussion. The case has been referred to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that the Minister wants to look at this in a considered way. Would he take this away to look at the amendments and come back with something on Report? He knows that the world would not come to an end if that happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been on Committee long enough and heard Conservative Ministers frequently enough to know that what I have said goes as far as can be expected at this stage. I shall examine his arguments. As I made clear, they are not fresh arguments. We have been over them, but we will look at them again. It is not an unconsidered conclusion that we have set out in the Bill. My belief at this stage is that we have got it right, but I undertake to consider again the comments that he has made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I thank the Minister for his helpful response to my concern about the use of the word ``individual''. He dealt with the point fully and I am utterly reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was originally considering seeking a separate vote on an amendment other than the lead amendment in the group. Given the serious nature of the issue, I will consider the Minister's words which I shall read with care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 4, line 10, after `proved', insert `to the criminal standard'.
<P>
Perhaps I could make a few preliminary points before getting on to the main thrust of my argument which will obviously follow, as otherwise I should do it in entirely the wrong order.
