<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/091/2000091.htm">Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that I speak on behalf of the Committee when I say how delighted we are, Mr. Maxton, to meet under your chairmanship. Those who know you will know that you will regard our proceedings with an eye honed in the classroom of a previous incarnation. Any members of the Committee on Front or Back Benches minded to take advantage of your natural kindness and generosity will be rapidly put in their place. However, we hope not to do that. We trust and believe that we shall be able to proceed expeditiously, while properly scrutinising and reflecting on the Bill, to see how best to improve it and fulfil its purpose, which is, first and foremost, the protection of the public.
<P>
In that spirit, and in a Committee which, looking around me, I see is not overburdened with lawyers, I am sure that we shall move with all due expedition to a happy conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): It is my happy duty to echo the Minister's comments in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton, and looking forward to your exercising firm but benevolent control over the Committee's proceedings. On Second Reading my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) made clear the Opposition's objections to some details in the Bill. No doubt we shall have the opportunity to discuss those disagreements in greater detail. Of course a great many other provisions in the Bill are—I was about to say uncontroversial, but at any rate not matters for partisan political debate. Nevertheless, they are complex and deserve detailed examination. The Opposition will, therefore, approach the proceedings constructively. We shall probe the Government's intentions and the meaning behind the words, but in that spirit I am content to agree to the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I will be brief, because I know that all hon. Members want to make speedy progress. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said, there was agreement on Second Reading about the main aims and objectives of the Bill, although views differed on some issues that we shall want to examine in detail.
<P>
I assure you, Mr. Maxton, that as always, our opposition to any aspects of the Bill will be constructive.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in this Room. I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 4; Schedule 1; Clauses 5 to 11; Schedule 2; Clauses 12 to 19; Schedule 3; Clauses 20 to 24; Schedule 4; Clauses 25 to 53; Schedule 5; Clauses 54 to 56; Schedule 6; Clause 57; Schedule 7; Clauses 58 to 64; new Clauses; new Schedules.—[Mr. Boateng.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Purposes of the Chapter</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I join in welcoming you, Mr. Maxton, and hope that you and your fellow Chairman will not find your patience tried too much by any member of the Committee.
<P>
The Opposition were very pleased that the Government finally agreed to the strong representations made, in particular by chief probation officers, about the original proposals for clause 1. I think, but the Minister can tell the Committee whether I am right, that every single probation committee and chief probation officer in the country wrote to object to the Government's original proposals. I know that it was not a comfortable matter for the Minister when my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) raised the issue in Home Office questions and the Government had to climb down. That must have been rather humiliating. Nevertheless, it was welcome recognition of the strength of feeling on the matter. It was no doubt guided by the fact that so many Government Members had signed an early-day motion condemning the proposed change.
<P>
As we said often on Second Reading, it is important that a change in the law should not become a subject for mockery. Undoubtedly the Government were forced belatedly to realise that the Opposition were correct in arguing that the title they originally intended to adopt would have made the probation service a subject for mockery. That was a matter of genuine concern. We sincerely appreciate the Government's wisdom in accepting that the title should be the National Probation Service.
<P>
That appreciation does not mean that substantial concerns do not remain. As we debate subsequent clauses and amendments, we shall undoubtedly stress that the probation service, chief probation officers and probation committees have grave concerns. I have talked to people on the Surrey probation committee about the Bill. The wife of a Surrey county councillor, Mrs. Paula Coffin, who is heavily involved in the probation committee for Surrey, raised with me her grave concerns about the original title chosen by the Government and has welcomed their change of mind. The chief probation officer for Surrey, Mr. Michael Varrah, also wrote to express concerns about it. He has other worries, to which I shall refer.
<P>
The fact that the Government take probation seriously is undoubtedly to be welcomed. All of us who have worked in the courts know its vital role. During my own practice at the Bar in the midlands I met several probation officers who played a significant role in ensuring that those who had fallen foul of the law received support and advice. Undoubtedly, the probation service has many successes to its credit. It is often forgotten, in the concern about reoffending—and I am sure that the Minister will echo this point—how many people are only ever in trouble in the courts once. I am sure that many hon. Members will have seen in their constituencies that many people owe their rehabilitation directly to the dedication and hard work of probation officers.
<P>
When I practised at the Bar, I used to be angered by a sort of trade union rule in the probation service—subsequently it learned more sense—that did not allow any probation officer to write a report to any court recommending a custodial sentence. The problem for the circuit judges in those days was that they could not be sure whether to trust what the probation officers said. Of course, such political correctness soon disappeared. It was clearly nonsense and judges needed completely objective reports. It might be necessary for a probation officer to make a recommendation to the effect that a person is completely beyond hope and that all that is likely to work for him is a taste of custody.
<P>
I remember clearly the words of a distinguished probation officer with whom I worked in Northamptonshire. Alan Bandaranaike came from a Sri Lankan family but worked in this country for many years. His name will be familiar to Committee members, as he was a distant relation of the first lady Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mrs. Bandaranaike. Alan Bandaranaike worked as a senior probation officer, and was concerned to maintain the traditional reputation of the National Probation Service for providing objective views that could be relied on by judges. As I predicted, I have returned to the solid and excellent reputation that the National Probation Service has traditionally enjoyed.
<P>
When we consider the Government's proposed arrangements for the National Probation Service, we must think carefully about whether they will work. We believe that many of them can work and that they can aid co-ordination. We also believe that the aims of the clause are by and large valid, which is why we shall not press it to a Division. However, it is vital that the National Probation Service and individual probation officers feel sure of the support of any Government in respect of the provision of assistance to the courts. I hope that the Committee and the House as a whole will not be divided in our support for the work of probation officers. The supervision of people released from prison on licence is a vital function of probation officers. The arrangement of accommodation in approved premises for people on probation and the regulations that are needed are also crucial.
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee further. I hope that the Minister will recognise the sincerity of our remarks. We are carefully watching the development of the legislation. We welcome the fact that the Government changed their mind about the title of the National Probation Service and we know how welcome that is to probation officers and others. We hope that the Bill will ensure not only that the National Probation Service has a good future but that its reputation is enhanced—if that is possible—from its already high status.
<P>
<B>Dr. Doug Naysmith </B>(Bristol, North-West): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Do you agree that this Room is inadequate for a Committee of this size and that, if possible, alternative accommodation should be sought?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. I agree that the Committee is large and that the Room is not adequate, and I shall take up the matter with the House authorities. I believe that they are already looking to see whether a larger Room is available, and it is hoped that we shall move to another Room next week, depending on which are available.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I listened to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath with some care. His remarks deserve such attention, bearing in mind his many years of experience at the Bar in the midlands. However, I am bound to say that he has a rather selective memory of the history of the National Probation Service under the Government whom he supported. Hon. Members who have the interests of an effective and focused National Probation Service at heart and who support and encourage it in its important work as an enforcement agency well recall that its grant was cut year on year under a previous Home Secretary.
<P>
The spending plans that this Government inherited envisaged a cut in the Home Office grant to probation of almost £6 million. Instead, we increased the grant by £18 million in 2000–01, and further increases of £24 million and £25 million are planned for successive years. Let us be clear about which Government and which party supports the National Probation Service, because it ain't the Conservative party. Far be it from me to start our proceedings on a party political note, which would be uncharacteristic of me, but the hon. Member for Surrey Heath began it and I intend to finish it.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not want the Committee to degenerate at this early stage, but does not the Minister recognise that, in the past 20 or 25 years—let us go back to the time of the Labour Government before last—or even the past 50 years, the biggest concern raised by the probation service has been the Government's proposal to change its name and make it a figure of ridicule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is quite absurd. That is over-egging the pudding, even by the hon. Gentleman's standards. He is entitled to his little bit of fun about the name, but we listened, we consulted and we now move forward with a new national probation service for England and Wales.
<P>
Clause 1 focuses on the main reasons for the existence of the service—the business of assisting the courts in arriving at their decisions, particularly in relation to sentence and the oversight, supervision and rehabilitation of offenders. It outlines the service's raison d'être. Supervision and rehabilitation are at the heart of the service; specifically, it gives effect to community orders, supervises those released from prison on licence and provides approved accommodation.
<P>
I pay tribute to the often unsung work of the probation service in relation to public protection. Too often, we do not hear of its sterling work, because it deals with difficult and dangerous people whose management is a matter of great sensitivity in a community context. It works in close conjunction with the police service to protect the public from such offenders. Just as important is the underrated contribution of those who work in probation hostels, who are at the hard end of the day-in, day-out work of being responsible for supervising and managing the reintegration of offenders into the community. We shall have the opportunity in later debates to highlight some of its excellent work.
<P>
It is important, however, to recognise that the Bill has a modernising agenda. It will restructure the probation service to make it yet more effective, and to allow it to focus on its key tasks of enforcement and public protection. It is therefore right that clause I should give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations in relation to the purposes that I have outlined and, when necessary, to extend them—so long as those purposes relate to persons charged with or convicted of offences. It is important to ensure that the service will have the necessary authority to undertake work with certain categories of serious offenders who have been released from prison, but not necessarily under licence. It is important that, through the Secretary of State's regulating powers, the service should be able to keep pace with the demands made on it.
<P>
Clause 1 is important. It sets out the reasons for the service's existence; establishes the National Probation Service as a single unified organisation; and brings together the present fragmented arrangements, under which there are 54 separate area services with no national accountability. That is part of the past; the future is one of a modernised, effective and focused service, properly funded and with its status and the vital work that it does for public protection properly recognised.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Aims of the Service</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 2, line 8, after `public', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and of property'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is important. Both the Minister and I have referred to the aims of the service during the discussion of the previous clause. It would be helpful to have a clear picture of the amount of criminal damage resulting from offending. Clause 2(2)(a) refers simply to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the protection of the public.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We hope that the Government might be prepared to consider seriously, and to consult the service on whether it would find acceptable, an addition of ``and of property''.
<P>
There is no doubt that huge damage is done to property by offenders. Probation officers—individually and collectively—are concerned about such issues. A school in Yorkshire was effectively burnt to the ground last weekend. The police are investigating a group of juveniles, so one must be careful about the sub judice rules. It is suggested that they are suspected of having caused massive damage to a school, the cost of which probably runs into millions of pounds. The service is concerned for the protection of property as well as of the public. We are considering the future of probation; this might be the only Bill to affect the service for several years. Looking to the future, it might be helpful for the service to have the aim spelt out.
<P>
We make the proposal seriously as a probing amendment and hope that the Government will think about it and consult on it further. I realise that the Minister might not be able to say to us today that we are right and that they will accept the suggestion, but I hope that he will take it in the spirit in which it is intended, as a serious issue for consideration. The Government might consider whether those words or something similar could be a useful addition, in another place if not here.
<P>
It would be relevant to study the figures set out in the criminal justice statistics that the Home Office prepares every year concerning the value of property damaged. I will not bore the Committee by listing the figures—the Minister probably knows them better than I do, and his officials will be familiar with them—but I ask him to study carefully with his officials and with advisers from the service whether the proposed words might not be a useful addition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I consider myself probed, but I am bound to say that my instinctive response to the probing is not one of approbation. I well understand the hon. Gentleman's point—it is always important to bear in mind the extremely damaging impact of property crime on the public. Whether it is a crime against a person or a property crime, it is a crime against the public, and whether the property is private or public, it is still a crime against the public. We should strive in the drafting process for clarity and simplicity, which, wherever possible, should be combined with brevity. Why break up a phrase that encapsulates the whole meaning? Our opinion is that protecting the public means protecting their persons and property, so the amendment adds nothing to the Bill and we will not accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Is the Minister not at least prepared to say that, during the further progress of the Bill, he will consult chief probation officers and probation committees, and if he discovers that they would find it helpful to include such a provision—if he does not discover that, we will—he will give an undertaking to consider the matter further?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It might have been a good idea for the hon. Gentleman to have consulted probation officers before tabling the amendment because I have heard of no such demand from the probation service, although I meet probation officers regularly to discuss a range of issues. I have heard no such demand for the sub-division of public protection, which I believe would be damaging. I intend to reflect on the hon. Gentleman's remarks on many matters and come back to him, but this is not one such matter, so I beg him not to labour the point. On many occasions, he will find that I am receptive, but this is not one such occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I accept what the Minister says and take his remarks in the spirit in which he intends them, but I must tell him that we have consulted some probation officers. From what I have been told by the individuals to whom I have spoken and from whom I have received written submissions, some probation committees and probation officers would find such a provision helpful. Therefore, even if the Minister is pretty dismissive of the issue today, perhaps he will at least allow me to write to him about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I would be only too happy to receive correspondence from the hon. Gentleman, on this or any subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's somewhat grudging concession. I certainly will want to discuss the matter further and, despite the twittering on the Government Benches, I shall write to him. I hope that the Minister will take rather more seriously in future both our genuine concerns and those raised by probation committees and probation officers. I hope that he will decide that the amendment is worthy of further consideration and realise, in the fullness of time, that it is not wise to be so dismissive, even in this early stage of the Committee's proceedings. This is a probing amendment. We probed but found the Minister to be dismissive. However, at this stage, we do not intend to press the matter to a vote, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 2, line 10, after `proper', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and effective'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would alter clause 2(2)(c). The Bill defines one of the aims of the National Probation Service as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the proper punishment of offenders.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 29 would amend that to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the proper and effective punishment of offenders.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I tabled the amendment, to draw out a little more of the Government's thinking on how they intend to ensure that community penalties, as administered by the new National Probation Service, will command greater public confidence in future—something that would be good in its own right—and will be more effective in dissuading those people who have been placed on probation from resuming a criminal career.
<P>
 The Minister and most hon. Members know that a feature of public belief in the criminal justice system is that almost all community penalties are weak and inadequate—they let evildoers get away with crime and fail to give proper punishment or to protect the public against future crimes. That has been a feature of public opinion for as long as I have been following such matters, which was before my election to the House of Commons in 1992.
<P>
If the Bill and subsequent policy initiatives allow the Government to build on previous measures, such as the creation of national standards for probation, and produce greater public confidence, that would be welcome, but the lack of public confidence in community penalties cannot simply be attributed to misinformation or our constituents' naivety, nor can it be written off, as many politicians are tempted to do, as the fault of too many people reading too many tabloid newspapers. We know that the unjust or inadequate sentence makes the best story and is headline grabbing. The case of the offender who breaches the terms of his probation or other non-custodial order and who is allowed to run riot by the authorities without adequate redress, is the incident in the criminal justice system that probably arouses the greatest ire among our constituents.
<P>
It is not simply a matter of the public failing to understand what is going on or the press sensationalising untypical examples. There is prima facie evidence that all too often the system of non-custodial penalties has failed to do its job of protecting the public or punishing adequately those who have committed crimes. I draw the Minister's attention to last year's research by the Criminal Justice Association. Its chairman is Mr. Peter Coad, a former senior probation officer, and it numbers among its patrons those champions of effective criminal justice policy, my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) and the noble Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate—two distinguished names with a proven track record of concern for the victims of crime and for effective criminal justice policies.
<P>
The Criminal Justice Association analysed Home Office figures for 1994 on the conviction of offenders and the application of community penalties, and examined the 1997 prison statistics for England and Wales to get an idea of the likelihood of people who had been subject to community penalties reoffending. It concluded that in 1994 roughly one third of people under 21 who were placed on probation already had between three and six previous convictions. When they examined the 1997 statistics, the current statistics for England and Wales, they found that no fewer than 80 per cent. of people who had been placed on probation after three to six previous convictions were then re-convicted within two years of completing their probation order. These two sets of figures relate to different years and contain information that is between three and six years out of date. They do not represent the whole story, and are only a snapshot of the problem, not a thorough analysis.
<P>
I ask the Minister to consider with his Home Office officials the collection of the appropriate statistics on the new non-custodial measures and some rigorous research on them so that we can assess their effectiveness in protecting the public and providing adequate punishment. The concern that I and many others have is that those who are given non-custodial penalties are almost by definition those most likely to be amenable to rehabilitation; who have not become so habituated to a criminal life, that good supervision and appropriate counselling and mentoring will not help them to lead a law-abiding life. A layman would assume that somebody who is sentenced to a period of imprisonment by a court will already have had previous dealings with the police and have received many cautions and non-custodial penalties before the criminal justice system finally lost its patience with them and decided that prison was the only alternative.
<P>
The key to rehabilitation, whether one is talking about non-custodial penalties or prison regimes, is the readiness of the criminal to co-operate with those who are offering him rehabilitation and a way forward. I vividly remember a conversation that I had with a serious offender in Grendon prison, who could serve as an example of the difficulty of rehabilitation both in terms of custodial and non-custodial sentencing. The man said that he had benefited hugely from the therapeutic regime at Grendon and that he was determined when he was released on life licence that he would try to lead a law-abiding life. He also said to me that if that regime had been offered to him five years previously, let alone 10 years previously, it would have made no difference to him, because he had not realised until recently that he was making a complete mess of his life and was wrecking any prospect that he had of making a reasonable future for himself by his persistent criminal behaviour. For probation to work, the offender has to recognise that what he has done is wrong and must be determined to co-operate with those who are offering a way forward. That is when he stands a chance of making progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point about the efficacy of probation and its impact on people at particular times in their lives. Does he accept that its efficacy may not be confined to the period during which a probation officer is working with somebody? People may reflect upon the words of probation officers many years after they are spoken and only then realise the import of what was said to them and make changes accordingly. I refer the hon. Gentleman to Jimmy Boyle and his book A Sense of Freedom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. However, the problem for policy makers and for those responsible for the administration of the criminal justice system is that they have a duty to protect the public. That duty means that it is not enough merely to say that wise counsels may do some good in 10 or 15 years. Tougher sanctions may be needed immediately to prevent somebody from reoffending until he matures sufficiently to realise that what he has done is wrong and that he has to change his ways. There is no inconsistency between what people such as myself and Peter Coad are arguing and the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the effect that sensible advice from probation officers may have at various times during a person's life.
<P>
Will the Minister say a bit more about how the Government will seek to make effective punishment a cornerstone of their approach to the development of the National Probation Service? Will he reflect on the research that the Government could commission and statistics that could be published to enable Ministers, Members of Parliament and those whom we represent to judge whether such effective punishment has been delivered in practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> It is a pleasure to participate in the Committee stage of this extremely important Bill. I am disappointed by the amendment. The hon. Member for Aylesbury expressed himself in civilised, calm and reflective manner, but his point is tired and old and simply does not stand up. It has been made in a thousand Conservative press releases, which have all suggested that the Conservatives are tough on crime. One can easily envisage the press release that would have winged its way to the newspapers in the unlikely event of my hon. Friend the Minister accepting the amendment. It would have suggested that the Tories had secured a major amendment to the Bill that ensured effective punishment. Such suggestions are nonsense, as they come from a party that had the opportunity to change fundamentally the criminal justice system to protect millions of people from the effects of crime but which failed to do so. The Conservative reign resulted in an increase in crime, which doubled during that sad and sorry period. We should take no lessons from the Conservative party about the effectiveness of punishment.
<P>
Clearly, the Government are prepared to work with what works and to take lessons from experienced professionals in the police, probation and prison services. Such an approach will ensure that those services work effectively together and that crime—all crime is serious crime—is targeted and dealt with appropriately. It is wrong to question the effectiveness of the sort of community sentences that the Government aim to introduce, although I suspect that we will return to that theme many times. The Government should be praised for seeking to introduce community sentences, which will work and punish effectively and ensure that offenders make proper and appropriate reparation to the community. Community sentences provide rehabilitation and, in line with many other policies such as the new deal, will assist offenders in leading decent and worthwhile lives.
<P>
The Opposition should give proper praise to what the Government are trying to achieve by pursuing a criminal justice policy that will bear down rigorously on offenders, deal with offences at an appropriate level and surely produce a far better result for this country than anything that was achieved during 18 years of Conservative government.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall try hard not to be enticed into praising or blaming either Conservative or Labour Members. The Committee process is not intended as an opportunity to play to the gallery on party politics.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury mentioned some statistics on reoffending. The reoffending rate implies that no form of punishment—apart, perhaps, from incarceration for the rest of one's natural life—will ever be 100 per cent. effective at preventing reoffending, regardless of the Government of the day. In many ways, the prevention of offending or reoffending is not about what punishment is meted out. It is about examining the causes of criminality and ways in which social and economic structures can be changed and in which educational opportunities and aspirations can be improved to ensure that people do not end up in a cycle of criminality. It is much more complicated than just punishment.
<P>
Although the public give different answers when they are asked in surveys, their general view, which is represented in the media, is that the best thing to do with criminals is to put them in prison, because at least they cannot reoffend there. Such an approach does not take into account whether such a response is appropriate for particular crimes or whether it is inadequate or over the top. Also, it does not take into account the impact of custodial sentences on employment, future employability, housing and family relationships. Any punishment should be effective; it is impossible for any hon. Member to argue otherwise. It should prevent reoffending and give a signal to people saying that they should not offend in the first place.
<P>
My particular difficulty with the clause is that I do not believe that it is the role of the probation service to impose punishment. It is up to the courts to decide on punishment and up to the probation service to enforce it. The probation service does not punish and is not a punishment service. The sentence is the punishment; the role of the probation service should be to enforce the sentence and to supervise, assist, monitor and educate offenders. Having said that, I could not oppose the insertion of the word ``effective'' in front of the word ``punishment''. It will be interesting to hear how the Minister opposes it, as I am sure that he will, but I must say that I, too, have no enthusiasm for subsection (2)(c) as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry (Banbury):</B> I want to make a brief contribution. Having practised at the criminal bar for a number of years, I have great respect for the National Probation Service, which works in difficult circumstances. When considering alternative sentences to custody, it is important to have due regard to public confidence. A lack of public confidence will be to the great detriment both of the probation service and of the whole criminal justice system. I understand what my hon. Friends are trying to achieve, but perhaps there is another approach. If the Minister could give the Committee some idea of how the Government envisage that they will maintain a review of the effectiveness of alternatives to custody and non-custodial sentences, that would be beneficial to the whole criminal justice system and especially to magistrates courts, because disparity in sentencing policies is sometimes a problem.
<P>
I believe that this circle can be closed with a little good will on the part of the Committee, but it is in everyone's interests that we should reinforce the fact that alternatives to custody, such as community service, can be extremely tough and, very often, effective. The fact that there is also a failure rate does not mean that the whole system has failed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The past 10 or 15 minutes have been instructive because we now have a clear picture of what is in store for us during the rest of the Committee's proceedings. It is simple: the hon. Member for Aylesbury is a nice guy; the hon. Member for Surrey Heath is a hard guy; and the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) is Miss Goody-two-shoes. The days ahead roll out in front of us as we see the approach that will be adopted by the Opposition to every amendment and every clause. However, we heard profound common sense in the contributions of the two Back-Bench Members. I refer specifically to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), and to the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry). His was the voice of practice—practice as a social worker and as someone working on the front line, caring for the needs of young people, including offenders, combined with the practical common sense of someone who has worked at the criminal Bar.
<P>
We must concern ourselves, as a Government and as a Committee, with the evidence base of the practice that we expect the probation service to administer. We must ensure that we have a clear handle on what works and what is effective in reducing crime and reoffending. We must ensure that the probation service is in a fit state, in terms of its focus, culture, and the framework within which it is required to operate, to deliver the proper punishments imposed by the courts and to act as a vehicle for effective sentencing.
<P>
The Committee members who have said that we need to monitor and evaluate are absolutely right. That is why we have put in place the What Works initiative. We have found additional resources to fund that initiative because a growing body of international evidence shows that some ways of working with offenders, if properly targeted and implemented, produce significantly better results in reducing reoffending. We are determined to ensure that the punishment delivered to offenders, whether in custody or in the community, should be based on evidence of what will reduce the propensity of offenders to reoffend. That is why the What Works strategy has two strands: evidence-based programmes jointly accredited by the prisons and probation services, designed to tackle offending behaviour, and action to improve offenders' job and housing prospects to help them to stay away from crime. We know that that will be more effective and more successful where it is properly accredited and evidence based. We shall ensure that because it is important for us to do so. The Bill is part of the process.
<P>
Equally important are national standards and the fact that the Association of Chief Officers of Probation is demonstrating leadership by ensuring that court sentences are properly enforced. That is vital. Unacceptable disparities between probation services in that respect are being addressed.
<P>
The amendment has served its purpose, enabling us to have a good debate. I urge the Committee to reject it, and I ask hon. Members to accept that the word ``effective'' does not add anything. It could be added to almost any provision, but has no legal meaning. It is for the courts to ensure that they are effective in their sentencing policies and for the probation service to enforce sentences properly. We must and shall ensure that the service has at its disposal properly accredited evidence-based programmes that can be demonstrated to reduce offending. Further, we must ensure that its success in doing that is properly monitored and is the subject of research and evaluation. The outcomes of research and evaluation must be made known so that we can ensure that the sentences of the court command public confidence. That is the key point, so vital if we are to ensure that we successfully bear down on crime and the causes of crime. The hon. Member for Aylesbury led a useful debate. I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and for the manner in which he couched it. I am encouraged by the fact that he and his colleagues have clearly accepted the need to ground their approach to the policy on the evidence of what works in practice. For now, I simply reiterate the concern that I expressed in my opening remarks about the lack of proper statistical evidence that would enable us to work out more easily whether a particular type of penalty helped to reduce reoffending.
<P>
That the Criminal Justice Association had to scrabble around to find a set of statistics for 1994 and another for 1997 illustrates that the problem requires tackling. I must accept that one need only study the two years that I mentioned to see that the problem has not come into existence with the present Government. A result of the way in which successive Governments have planned research and statistical series is that it has never been possible to put together evidence to enable us to draw well-founded, clear conclusions about the effectiveness of forms of sentencing. No doubt that was for reasons that seemed good at the time. It is for the Minister and his officials to reflect on whether the right way forward is a detailed cohort study or reorganisation of the Home Office's regular series of criminal justice statistics—I do not know. In the light of what the Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 2, line 10, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) the education of offenders about the effects of crime on the victims of crime and the public.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We regard the education of offenders as one of the most serious matters with which we shall deal today—and, perhaps, during the entire Committee stage. I therefore make no apology for dealing with it in some detail. My experience at the Bar included prosecuting and defending in juvenile courts, and I have worked work with Victim Support before first being elected to the House and since. It is an organisation with which many hon. Members on both sides of the House, including other members of the Committe, have worked, and I believe that they regard the matter to be as important as we do.
<P>
Before turning to the amendment, I shall take a moment to answer the caricature that the Minister offered in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury—his caricature of what the Committee would face. I am sure that the hon. Member for Taunton can stand up for herself, but it occurred to me as I listened to the Minister's caricature that if the hon. Lady is Miss Goody-two-shoes, the Minister is always trying to be Mr. Clever Dick. We are always trying to anticipate him. One of his hon. Friends once told me that the main thing to remember about the right hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) is that he never knowingly lacks swagger. With friends like that, who needs enemies?
<P>
The amendment proposes an extra subsection, which would provide that ``the person concerned'' must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the education of offenders about the effects of crime on the victims of crime and the public. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Opposition take the view that it is important that the Bill should include that as one of the prime responsibilities of the national probation service. Victim Support has long thought that the interests of the victims of crime are not sufficiently recognised at any stage of the criminal justice process. They are certainly not sufficiently recognised when it comes to court proceedings. Indeed, the previous Government, like the present Government, wanted to improve arrangements for the protection of victims of crime when they act as witnesses. I see the Minister nodding. He knows from his experience as a lawyer, as I do, that many victims feel that they are less well treated than the defendants, not only in court but at every stage of the criminal justice process.
<P>
I want to explain why we feel so seriously about the need for such an amendment. Once again, I hope that the Government will consider the matter carefully, not only today but in future proceedings on the Bill. I refer to the detailed analysis of work with victims undertaken by Justice, Restoring Youth Justice, which was published only last week. I appreciate that many members of the Committee may not yet have had the chance to study it. Justice analysed various projects; I have personal knowledge of some of them and other hon. Members may have come across other projects in different parts of the country. Justice wants the experience of those various pilot projects to be taken into account in the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Bill, particularly as they relate to victims.
<P>
The Justice report covers a wide field, but one section deals with those pilot projects. I want to spend some time considering that section, particularly because some of those projects that it covers started when I was still in practice at the Bar, from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, and I saw some of them in operation. Some of course started more recently, and I rely on Justice's analysis for those.
<P>
I want first to talk about a couple of court-based projects established in the west midlands, one in Coventry and one in Wolverhampton, and their involvement with victims. Justice says that great lengths were taken in both of those projects to provide a neutral service. The Coventry scheme worked with what were described as lower-level adult offenders—in other words, those who were not accused of serious offences, but who lived areas with high levels of poverty and deprivation.
<P>
 I know that that is right because I lived in Coventry during my early years in practice at the Bar. There were areas in Coventry with high crime rates and high levels of poverty and deprivation. That was a major concern for the probation service. In this project, the probation service wanted to use mediation and reparation and the involvement of victims as a practical alternative to a fine.
<P>
It has been established—as we all know, it is not a matter of partisan politics—that the problem with fines is that, although a victim may regard them as a good thing, if a fine simply puts further pressure on the already poor family of an offender, it creates a temptation for the offender to commit more offences. This truism has been recognised for many years, not only in this country, but around the world; fines often lead to more crime, not less crime, which does the victim no good at all.
<P>
The staff of the Coventry pilot project would identify potential cases and notify the clerk of the court and the defence solicitor of them. The scheme applied only to those cases in which the accused pleaded guilty and in which there was an identifiable victim. The Justice report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Once a case was identified, the magistrate either requested a mediation assessment as part of the social inquiry report or adjourned for a four-week period to allow mediation to be tried. Some referrals were taken directly from the probation service. The Wolverhampton project was run by an independent organisation called the Crypt.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have had some contact with that organisation because I carried out a number of cases, both prosecuting and defending, in Wolverhampton. That project had a lower referral rate than the Coventry project because of fears that victims might be pressurised into agreeing to be part of the project. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is essential, as the Justice report and many other studies make clear, that no victim should ever feel under pressure to take part in these projects because that would destroy the purpose of them. The view of all the studies on this subject is that victims should be involved only if they are willing to do so, having been given a choice. I am sure that the Minister will agree.
<P>
As a result of the initial low referral rate in Wolverhampton, a new arrangement was introduced under which the project staff also saw cases where the court had ordered a social inquiry report, as it was then called. In both the Coventry and Wolverhampton projects, the staff worked within tight court adjournment times so that court time was not wasted and there were no long adjournments delaying a case. They had only a limited time to prepare and conduct mediation between the offender and the victim. Following any adjournment, the project workers attempted to complete the mediation and to begin what was called reparative work—reparation—before the court reconvened. In that way they hoped to exert some influence on the sentence that the court imposed on the offender. However, there were problems with volunteer mediators, even under the revised arrangements in Wolverhampton.
<P>
At the start, the Wolverhampton scheme emphasised the material reparation by the offender, but it became clear—and this is the importance of the amendment—that the victims valued the meetings with the offenders more than the material reparations, although that is not to say that they thought them unimportant. It was therefore thought desirable to change the procedure and to encourage more meetings between the victim and the offender. That is why we think that the amendment on the education of offenders about the effects of crime on the victims of crime and the public as a whole is so vital.
<P>
I want to refer briefly to a project of which I have less personal experience. It was a court-based project established in Leeds in West Yorkshire to take referrals not from magistrates courts, but from the Crown courts, which, as the Committee will understand, means more serious offenders. That project had a number of aims: to confront offenders with the effects of their crime—once again directly related to the amendment—to assist victims and to provide a further non-custodial alternative for the Crown court. Mediators were trained and in some cases, including that of the Leeds project, were paid. Agreements between the offender and the victim were used to inform the social inquiry report that was prepared by the probation officer for the court.
<P>
Supervision of reparations and of the agreements is vital. There is a danger that bringing a hardened criminal—some juveniles have pages and pages of previous convictions before they are in court for their umpteenth offence—into contact with a vulnerable victim might provide an opportunity for that juvenile to commit more offences against the same victim. Justice concluded that the Leeds project enabled the probation service to provide good-quality follow-up for victims and offenders.
<P>
The Home Office evaluated the project—if the Minister does not have details of that, I am sure that he can get them. According to Justice, the Home Office recognised that there was a benefit of victim-offender mediation. It also acknowledged that many victims welcomed the opportunity to meet their offender. That may surprise the popular press. It does not apply to all victims, but Victim Support has met a large number of people who would like to know more about the person who committed the crime against them. Many victims perhaps not the elderly or the vulnerable value that opportunity.
<P>
The Home Office told Justice that the majority of participants were satisfied with the experience of mediation. They admitted that, if they were in the sad position of being a repeat victim of crime, they would want to participate in more victim-offender mediation meetings and that—significantly—80 per cent. would recommend to other victims of crime that they should get involved in such meetings. The Home Office also found that a key motivation for victims to participate in meetings was a sense of social duty, which might be insufficiently recognised. The huge public concern about crime is reflected in the desire to reduce crime and a sense of social duty. The evaluation confirmed that the process of direct or indirect mediation was of equal value to victims, if not more, than reparation or compensation. That interesting factor relates directly to the amendment.
<P>
The Home Office confirmed that the initial pilot showed up the practical operational difficulties that victim-offender mediation could encounter. We might have the opportunity to discuss the details of those problems, but it appears that the key is to convince sentencers—magistrates or judges—of the usefulness of mediation, and to spend time talking to victims about the importance of mediation and preparing them for the experience. Justice refers to that in its conclusions.
<P>
Justice makes international comparisons with countries where similar projects have been under way for longer. Police involvement in the New South Wales pilot schemes resulted in a drop in the referral rate. In New Zealand, where mediation between victims and offenders was an option, none was attempted, even when victims wanted such a meeting. If the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment or a version of it, we must consider carefully the international experience to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes made in other jurisdictions.
<P>
Another issue arose in the pilot projects conducted in this country. The court-based pilot schemes inevitably operated under great time pressure. As I said, attempts were made to ensure that the whole process was not delayed; as hon. Members know, justice delayed is justice denied for victims and offenders. Long delays also allow significant costs to build up. Time pressure was a big issue in New Zealand. I shall not comment on the details of the report, but I should point out that both New Zealand and New South Wales experienced time pressure.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Justice points out the tension involved in a longer time frame. Longer periods between court adjournments will inevitably allow better preparation, and victims will be given more time to think. However, such an approach conflicts with another imperative that applies in all such proceedings: the response to the offence should be swift and clear so that it is meaningful and effective for the offender. That point was considered in another place, where, during debate of the Bill that became the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, Lord Williams of Mostyn said that he would decline to lay down strict time limits for the operation of youth offender panels, specifically because they might militate against victims' interests. I think that Lord Williams, who is currently Attorney-General, was then Minister of State of the Home Office, as the right hon. Member for Brent, South now is. The Minister should be aware that his predecessor as Minister of State spoke specifically about victims' interests. I hope that he will pay due attention to Lord Williams' remarks about the vital concerns of victims.
<P>
The Home Office evaluation of the pilot schemes also stressed the need for mediation to be properly resourced. If provision ensuring that is included in the Bill, the Home Office will then consider the financial implications. On this occasion, the Minister cannot say, as Ministers often do: ``Oh, well. Here we are—Opposition Front Benchers are calling for more public spending.'' That is not the case; the Opposition are trying to ensure that the Bill makes it clear that the interests national probation service should relate specifically to victims. Savings could be made elsewhere in the Home Office to ensure that proper preparation could be given to dealing with victims' interests. I should make it absolutely clear that we are not calling for an increase in public spending.

<P>

<B>Ms Bridget Prentice (Lewisham, East):</B> I am wearing several hats this morning.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is making interesting points about victims and victim support. I was recently the victim of a crime and received good support from my local Victim Support service. Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge how well the Government have done in supporting Victim Support in the good work that it is doing? Does he accept that we put the victim at the centre of our criminal justice policies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I take that intervention in the spirit in which it was given. First, I express my sympathy to the hon. Lady, although I do not know the details and I shall not comment any further on the matter. As I commented—perhaps when the hon. Lady was moving to take up another hat—all hon. Members would agree that Victim Support is an enormously important organisation. I hope that she will concede that it has received a lot of support from Governments of both major parties. Conservative Members supported it throughout our time in government—I know that that happened because I have had many meetings with Victim Support and its leadership. In the same spirit, I am prepared to accept that the current Government have tried to continue the work done by Conservative Members. Labour Members should bear in mind the fact that Victim Support will welcome our proposed amendment to subsection (2)(d). If the hon. Lady was wearing the hat that she used to wear, she might encourage Labour Back Benchers to vote for our amendment. I am sure that she knows that it will be welcomed by Victim Support.
<P>
There have been other pilot projects involving victims. My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury is especially concerned about the Thames Valley area.
<P>
As many Committee members will know, the Thames Valley police force and its chief constable have been at the forefront of the restorative justice project. In particular, Thames Valley police have been involved with a scheme that relates not to my hon. Friend's constituency, although the restorative justice project covers the whole Thames Valley area, but to shoplifters, which became known as the Milton Keynes retail theft initiative.
<P>
It is well understood that the large shopping centre in Milton Keynes is bound to attract a considerable number of young people and, sadly, it is thought by Justice and perhaps also by the Home Office that the layout of the stores is of particular interest to shoplifters. Therefore, in 1994, the police in Milton Keynes set up the retail theft initiative because they believed that it would be a more effective form of intervention with first-time shoplifters. It was intended both to reduce reoffending and—of crucial significance—to reduce the time that police officers have to spend on such cases, because the police time that is spent on what is regarded as acquisitive crime is an issue for every police force.
<P>
The aim of the initiative was to work with individuals to educate them to understand that shop theft is not a victimless crime. All too often, the juvenile shoplifter thinks that no one really loses. Therefore, the initiative tried to help offenders to appreciate the effects of their actions on themselves, shops and others and to learn to resist peer group pressure, the temptation to reoffend and other factors involved in reoffending, especially among juveniles.
<P>
I should like to explain to the Committee how the initiative works because it is relevant to the issue of dealing with victims. Under the scheme, when any juvenile is arrested in the Milton Keynes shopping centre, the police ask the store detective to give an account of what he or she saw the young person doing and the substance of the allegation. The juvenile is then asked whether he or she agrees with what has been said. If the juvenile agrees, he or she is asked to attend the police station on a specified day, usually with at least one parent, or someone who is responsible for his or her care if the juvenile is in the care of social services. Then a diagnostic interview takes place to try to establish why the juvenile offended.
<P>
Thames Valley police have recognised about 10 common underlying factors that might affect behaviour. They include not only family and social issues, such as bereavement or divorce, but, most commonly, peer pressure. The response to the juvenile's offending tries to address the cause of the offending behaviour. In the case of peer pressure—the gang concept—offenders might be required to attend a course that is intended to help juveniles to understand the physical signs of excitement that precede shoplifting adventures by gangs and to develop a personal strategy to help them to resist that pressure. It is a little bit like attempts that have been made, both in England and America, to deal with drug offending—``just say no''.
<P>
If there are other reasons for offending, the police encourage the juvenile to attend youth activities or watch a warning video about prison life. However—here we come back to the issue of victims—all juveniles must attend an interview with a store detective, who explains the consequences of theft from shops, such as price rises and the inability to employ other law-abiding school children for Saturday jobs. The store detective represents the victim in the Milton Keynes retail theft initiative. The process for a first offender usually ends with the juvenile being cautioned, rather than being brought before a court. As Committee members will know, the police can administer a formal caution only if the juvenile has admitted the crime. It is explained that, if the juvenile reoffends, he or she will go before the court.
<P>
As a result, especially of the interviews with the store detectives in the role of victim, there appears to have been a significant reduction in reoffending, specifically by juveniles who had been through the scheme. It is worth having the reference to victims in clause 2 because the reoffending statistics show that the reoffending rate is only 3 per cent. for first offenders who had been through the scheme; in other words, 97 per cent. of those first offenders did not reoffend.
<P>
The overall reoffending rate in stores in Milton Keynes is 35 per cent. Most interestingly, the reoffending rate for first offenders who were given a caution but did not go through the scheme was 30 per cent. The involvement of the scheme resulted in the difference between 30 per cent. and 3 per cent. That obviously takes time, but it is worth the victims—here, the stores—ensuring that their store detectives and other employees are given time to participate in the schemes.
<P>
The scheme has been operating for only a short period. I agree with Justice that the statistics appear at this early stage to provide support for such early low-level intervention involving consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting speech, but I thought for a minute that we had gone back to the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. Does he accept that the Government have placed the principles of restorative justice, to which they are wholly committed, fully within the legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman was not on the Committee considering the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 but, if he referred to Hansard, he would realise that there were many debates in which it was agreed between the parties, including the Liberal Democrats, that restorative justice was worth trying. I accept what he said—the Government are interested in restorative justice. However, I say to him as I said to the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Ms Prentice) that that is an even better reason for him to join us in calling for the amendment. If we are talking about the interests of victims, the proposal ought to be included as part of the probation service's duties.
<P>
Having referred to what happened in Milton Keynes, I want to consider the way in which conferences with victims take place. The subject was dealt with in the Justice report. The organisation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>conferences are usually restricted to first or second time young offenders. They are essentially structured group mediations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are different in concept from what social workers are often involved in in relation to children in care. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre will be familiar with the family group conference from his experience as a social work manager.
<P>
The report continues by saying that, when the victim is willing, the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>offender(s) and victim(s) and relevant family members attend, and the discussion highlights the consequences of what has happened, in both material and emotional terms, to the offender's family as well as to the victim and his or her family. Everyone is asked to contribute, so that all have a voice. In this way it is hoped that both the background to the offence and its effects will become clear.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Justice says that the opportunity for the offender to apologise directly to the victim and to the victim's family is ``regarded as most important'' and is often
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a turning point in communication between the participants. Conferences do not result in . . . agreements for reparative work, or further action, as there are no procedures for agreeing or supervising such outcomes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conferences are voluntary, and do not take place unless the victim is willing to attend.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That goes back to what I was saying about the importance of not putting victims under pressure.
<P>
There might be a caution
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If a victim does not wish to attend, or if the conference breaks down.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The caution
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>incorporates a discussion of the consequences of the offence on all those affected by it: not only the victim but also the offender and his or her family.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a good deal of support among senior police officers, in particular for what some might regard as a radical departure from traditional policing. The Minister will recognise what one of the police officers involved, who is referred to in the Justice report and highlighted in a separate paragraph in larger type, said. The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One police facilitator we spoke to said that he felt he had done more good in 14 months of running conferences than in 24 years of more conventional detective work.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That proves the case for having the probation service's responsibility for the education of offenders about the effects of crime on the victims in the Bill.
<P>
It is noticeable that police forces other than the ones I have mentioned are now working on the introduction of similar arrangements. There has been a lot of work going back to 1981 in Northamptonshire.
<P>
There is a Northamptonshire diversion unit, which started in the days when I was doing some work in that area. Its work with young and adult offenders and their victims in the county since 1981 aimed at reducing crime and the harm caused by crime is vital. [Interruption.] I hope that the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) will contain her enthusiasm for the subject. We will undoubtedly hear from her later on.

<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I apologise for giggling during his remarks, but I was taken by the fact that all the hon. Members on his side seem to have left the room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Lady will find that there are occasions during the sittings of the Committee when the Government side will be denuded. She will recognise that, because of the enormous pressure the Government have put on the Home Office team, we are faced with a ridiculous situation of there not being enough Home Office Ministers to go round. They are delaying the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill for weeks after Second Reading and starting this Bill first in order to release another Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): Utter rubbish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman says it is utter rubbish, but I know exactly what is going on through the usual channels. The hon. Lady should not provoke me into bringing up the mess the Government have brought on themselves by trying to pack one Queen's Speech with 28 Bills. They should have listened to the late Viscount Whitelaw, who said that there should be no more than 17 Bills in any one Parliamentary Session because no Government could cope with more. That is what the Government are discovering. I advise her not to talk too much about the pressures on Committees and on my hon. Friends. She should learn her lesson from that.
<P>
I was talking about the Northamptonshire diversion unit and its important work. The present unit dates from 1993, but its work goes back to 1981. The Justice report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Referrals are usually made by the police, though a small number come from the Crown Prosecution Service. Custody officers are the initial decision-makers and the scheme depends heavily on two factors: the use of minimum appropriate action and a clear decision-making matrix to encourage objectivity in deciding on the action that is appropriate. The decision-making matrix acts as an objective guide for police considering referrals. It takes into account the gravity of the offence, the number and time span of offences, as well as the length of time since the last offence and the nature of the disposal. It assists in maintaining consistency in referrals.

Most first time, and many second time, young offenders are dealt with by the police by means of ``informal action''. This does not have to be declared to employers, and will not be mentioned in court if the young person should subsequently appear.<P>

But,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Records are kept by police (for three years or until the juvenile offender is 18, whichever is the longer) to assist with future decision-making in the event of re-offending.

Other offenders, provided that there is a clear admission of guilt, are referred to the police administrative support unit<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in Northamptonshire. The most serious offenders are still prosecuted, but the rest are referred to the diversion unit.
<P>
It is at the diversion unit that the contact with victims comes in. Much of the work of the unit is targeted at more persistent young offenders—the ones who cause the main problems, the one-boy crime waves, who have featured in the middle-market tabloids. This normally means two to four previous offences or groups of offences. In the early 1980s, a number of juveniles, who were frequently in detention centres such as the St. John's centre secure unit at Tiffield or the former borstals—which were known by that time by another name—appeared in the juvenile courts where I was prosecuting or defending with four or five pages of previous convictions. Those persistent young offenders are the ones whom the police and social services and other authorities are most worried about.
<P>
The Northamptonshire diversion unit will deal with first offences when there are special causes for concern, such as a young homeless person whose offence relates to food or shelter and who might need the involvement of social services. That could also happen with sexual offences. The unit's assessment of those cases is followed by a team discussion. The views of the offender and the victim are set out in a report. The potential for resolution and further work with the offender are also identified. If resolution is not possible, there is an opportunity to return the matter to the court. Victims appreciate the fact that nothing is set in stone. If a victim believes that an offender is not co-operating, or if the police or other agencies think that a young offender is taking them for a ride, the threat of the court remains. I am sure that most probation officers would welcome that.
<P>
The process in Northamptonshire relies on the voluntary co-operation of victims and offenders. Most victims choose to work with the unit. As with the west midlands project and the Leeds project, there is a free choice. The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The main principles of the Northamptonshire approach are: that it should be forward looking and positive; that offenders, victims and local communities should be included in solutions; that work should proceed in partnership with other agencies—
<P>
</UL></FONT>such as social services; and that juvenile offenders in particular should be dealt with in their local communities and not moved miles away. Justice—and, I hope, the Home Office—regards the scheme as a valuable pilot project. It was working well in the mid and late 1980s, and it is clear from the report that it has developed since 1993. I hope that the Minister will recognise that there are good lessons to be learned from it.<P>

<P>
Justice also refers to the Kent intensive support and supervision programme. I have no personal experience of that and shall not cover it in such detail, partly because Committee members can read about it themselves and discuss the issues at another time.
<P>
Justice says that in all the pilot projects
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there are difficulties in promoting victim awareness among severely damaged young people whose disruptive backgrounds, of abuse, neglect or disadvantage, may make it difficult for them to feel either empathy or remorse.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to recognise that not every crime or juvenile offender by a long chalk is going to be suitable for conferences with victims. Some offenders will not be able to be brought into mediation by the authorities. We are not discussing a blanket approach. Circumstances alter cases, and the approach will need sensitive handling. That is another reason why the Bill should reflect our concerns for victims. It may be years before we have another chance to deal with the probation service and its specific task. We must get the provisions right. Justice stresses that the preparatory work with victims of crime to ensure that they know what they are letting themselves in for, and that they have a free choice whether to participate, is vital. If victims decide not to attend pilot projects, volunteers from the national Victim Support organisation have participated in them, which could be valuable.
<P>
I make no apology for taking time in moving the amendment. The issues are important. We hope that the Minister will respond positively.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I need to respond to the Minister's earlier remarks. I have never, to my knowledge, been described as Miss Goody-two-shoes. I shall try hard to live up to the sobriquet.
<P>
Despite the fact that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath was interesting, if every amendment is moved with such a comprehensive tour of the criminal justice system, we will be here long past my bedtime. We support the amendment. Reparation is important, and I agree with him that offenders often do not consider the impact of their crimes on victims. That is especially true of crimes such as shoplifting, whose perpetrators often believe that they have no victims. In that regard, I was interested to learn about the Milton Keynes initiative. At the other extreme, people who commit crimes such as corporate fraud often think that they have no victims. I wonder whether similar initiatives are in place to help people who commit such crimes to realise their impact on victims.
<P>
Having said that the Liberal Democrats would support the amendment if it were pressed to a Division, I must say that I am disappointed that it is so narrowly drawn in relation to the educative role of the National Probation Service. I would have hoped that education of offenders in its wider sense might include basic skills education, for example. As we all know, such education is needed by the vast majority of offenders, whether or not they are on custodial or community sentences, and it should be a key aim of the probation service. I shall return to that subject later during our deliberations, so I will not comment further on it now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The debate has been interesting and the Committee will want to reflect on it. I have taken a careful note of the comments made by Opposition Members. I paid special attention to the final remarks of the hon. Member for Taunton, who drew attention to a defect in the amendment. In my view, that defect is far too serious to be overlooked. The drafting of the amendment is defective and would have the damaging effect of narrowing the work of the probation service rather than recognising the breadth of its work. For that reason alone, I do not accept it. However, it has been valuable to examine the role of restorative justice and how best to ensure that the probation service responds properly to the needs of victims. Such a response is an acute concern of the Government.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Lewisham, East drew attention to a number of ways in which the Government, in marked contrast to our predecessors, have sought to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. The previous Administration paid much lip service and devoted much rhetoric to victims, but Victim Support did not receive anything like the funding that it should have received. Only under the current Government has Victim Support been funded at a level that enables it to offer a service in the magistrates court. Such funding was not previously provided. I pay tribute to Victim Support for its determination, vigour and civic mindedness in delivering a standard of care and service to the community that is admirable in every way, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East demonstrated with her own example. After all, it was the current Government who paved the way for the change that has enabled restorative justice once again to find a proper place on the agenda of our criminal justice system, with the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Surrey Heath spoke, I reflected on a thematic inspection report that I launched a couple of weeks ago. It came from Her Majesty's inspectorate of probation and was entitled ``The Victim Perspective: Ensuring the Victim Matters''. It is an objective piece of civil service work. At page 98, paragraphs 14.6 and 14.7 give a potted history of restorative justice. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A range of restorative practices have emerged in the criminal justice system, including mediation, conferencing, problem orientated policing and both community and institution based rehabilitation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The probation service was involved in some of those developments. Despite being resourced by the Home Office, the pilot schemes for mediation and reparation in the 1980s did not continue to receive Government funding. The reason for the change appeared to be unconnected to the outcome of the pilot schemes; it was more a question of a fading interest in that approach and a shift to a more punitive criminal justice system, based on an increased use of prison and on the exclusion of offenders.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I welcome the hon. Member for Surrey Heath's endorsement of restorative justice. I hope that he is not obliged subsequently to swallow those words, as he was obliged to swallow his endorsement of home detention curfew, which he gave in the heat of the determination of the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald to make political capital out of criminal justice policy. Nevertheless, I welcome the hon. Gentleman's endorsement; I have no doubt that it is entirely sincere, and I share his analysis.
<P>
The thematic report continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since 1997, a change in the political climate has improved the possibility that a restorative justice approach could become an integral part of the criminal justice system.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then gives evidence of that change. It refers to the Thames Valley police area restorative cautionary scheme. It refers also to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and to the work of the social exclusion unit.

<P>

<B>Ms Bridget Prentice:</B> Will my right hon. Friend remind the Committee what happened in 1997 that led to such changes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I fear that I might be stretching your good nature, Mr. Maxton, if I did that—save to point to the paucity of Conservative Members opposite, and the fact that we are sitting on the Government Benches. I suspect that that, Mr. Maxton, is as far as you would allow me to go.
<P>
We know that there has been change of climate—and the change of heart that seems to have occurred in at least some Conservative Members—and we must take advantage of it. We are determined to ensure that the Bill equips the probation service to take advantage of that change.
<P>
I am unable to accept the amendment in its existing form, because it is defective and too narrow. The aims of the service have been carefully devised to inform everything that it does. The education of offenders on the impact of their offending behaviour on their victims is an important part of the service's work and an integral part of all accredited offending behaviour programmes in prison and in the community. It contributes to two of the service's prime aims—the reduction of reoffending, and the protection of the public. It is one important aspect of its work.
<P>
I am anxious, however, to take the opportunity during the Committee stage to reflect on how we can be sure of continuing the momentum established by the probation service in its work with victims. It is important to do so. The hon. Member for Taunton will return to that issue in due course, as, no doubt, will Government Members and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and his colleagues. Although I understand that Opposition Members might wish to press the amendment to a vote, there will be an opportunity, both in Committee and potentially on Report, for us to consider how we can continue the victim-centred approach that should characterise the criminal justice system in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I welcome the Minister's remarks, which seem to leave the door a little ajar, especially considering that he said that the amendment might be too narrow and mentioned returning to the amendment at a later stage. However, as a Home Office Minister, he might be described as pushing his luck more than a little in referring to a Home Office document and saying that its reference to a change in the political climate presents an objective analysis. If the report were wholly independent and from outside the Home Office, he might be more entitled to say that. I remind the Minister that I listed a series of projects that received support from the Home Office throughout the 1980s when the Conservative party was in government. I believe that the earliest project in the Justice report is the Northamptonshire project, which started as long ago as 1981. When the Minister talks about swallowing words, he should remember that, ever since the election campaign that led to the 1997 election, the Home Secretary has sought to show that the Labour Government are even more macho about punishment than the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) was. So it is a bit rich for the Minister to say, ``Oh, well, there was a change of climate.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, during the time to which he refers, pioneering projects relating to youth justice had to be carried out on an individual basis, often in a piecemeal fashion, and were often undermined by other policies of the Government in power at the time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks from his experience as a social work manager. I can only say that that was not my experience. I found that there was tremendous commitment to such projects from the probation service, both in the east and west midlands, which received full support from the Home Office. When I was studying criminology and penology, there were constant complaints from those involved with such projects that they were not receiving sufficient support from the Home Office at that time, under a previous Labour Government. We could trade statistics and personal experiences until the cows come home.
<P>
I welcome the fact that the Minister has said that we might be able to return to the subject, but we want to give a clear signal today—I am delighted that the hon. Members for Taunton and for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) support us in this—to the probation service, the Government and those outside who take note of our proceedings that we think that concern for victims should be acknowledged in the Bill. Therefore, we propose to press the amendment to a vote. I will not rise to the Minister's specious comments about home detention curfews because we discussed those issues on Second Reading. I simply repeat that I do not accept what he said and that his interpretation is selective.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 64, page 2, line 10, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) the rehabilitation of offenders.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is important to the Liberal Democrats, and my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon will also seek to catch your eye, Mr. Maxton, to speak to it. From listening to debates in the Committee and on Second Reading, one might think that hon. Members are not all on the same side regarding criminal justice. However, we would all accept in good faith that every Committee member and every Member of Parliament wants fewer offenders, offences and victims. We may approach that aim from slightly different angles and propose different ways of achieving it, but we all share it.
<P>
When the National Probation Service was established, its aim was to assist, befriend and advise. It has moved on somewhat since those original aims were set out. Like the National Association of Probation Officers, I am surprised that the existing objective of the rehabilitation of offenders is omitted from the core aims of the probation service as set out in the Bill and in clause 2. I hope that the amendment will give the Minister the opportunity to explain that omission and perhaps even to correct it.
<P>
It is surely in everyone's interests for offenders who leave custody or complete community sentences to be rehabilitated into mainstream society, so that they are less likely to reoffend. In the clause, the aim of rehabilitation appears to have been replaced by ``proper punishment of offenders''. However, on-going supervision is not a process of continual punishment, and nor should it be. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister agrees that supervision that takes the form of continual punishment would be counter-productive and would perpetuate criminality.
<P>
In speaking to an amendment that was debated earlier, I said that the causes of criminal behaviour were many and complex. The three aims of the probation service listed in the clause would not address an offender's underlying problems, which contribute to offending behaviour. It is worth repeating that the causes of criminality include access to education—especially basic skills education, to which, as I said, we shall return—training and work, emotional difficulties, poor housing, poor environment, lack of positive role models and addiction to alcohol and/or illegal drugs, which will be discussed later during our consideration of the Bill. Early-learned anti-social behaviour and being stuck in a particular behavioural pattern are other causes, which will apply especially to people who do not have mechanisms that enable them to see other patterns.
<P>
Such problems cannot simply be punished out of people; there has to be a more positive and proactive way of dealing with them. Rehabilitation should be a priority for the probation service. It could work on such problems through education, especially in basic skills, and through the sort of educational process referred to during discussion of the amendment considered previously. It could also work on them by assisting people in finding suitable accommodation, and, if necessary, providing support in that respect. It could support people in unlearning anti-social behaviour and in funding alternative coping techniques, which would in the end mean that there were fewer victims of crime. I stress again that that is what I want as much as anyone else. It is easy to caricature somebody who expresses concern for rehabilitation of offenders as not caring about victims. Perhaps that will not happen in this Committee, which I hope will be more sensible, but it may occur on Second Reading. I hope that Committee members will not be under that misapprehension. I do not believe that rehabilitation of offenders conflicts with ensuring that the victim is heard. If there are fewer victims in future, the two go hand in hand. Unless the courts and the public understand that the rehabilitation of offenders is a prime function of the probation service, the overall objectives of a modern, national, evidence-based service will be undermined.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider accepting the amendment, either now or later, because it is genuinely constructive and will clarify the role of the probation service for the public, the courts and those who work in the service. It will not weaken the aims of the service, rather it will help to focus and strengthen them.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have considerable sympathy with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Taunton. Like her, I was somewhat surprised to see the omission from the probation service's objectives of any explicit reference to the rehabilitation of offenders. I was pleased to see the three items included in subsection (2)—protection of the public, reduction of reoffending and the proper punishment of offenders. I could understand it if the Government's argument were, for example, that, implicit in the protection of the public and reduction of reoffending was the notion that rehabilitation should take place so that those undesirable outcomes should be avoided.
<P>
My criticisms of some aspects of probation service work over the years have tended to rest on what I regarded as the failure to deal quickly with breaches of non-custodial orders. That is a subject that we shall have opportunities to debate at later stages of the Bill and elsewhere.
<P>
A briefing note that the Central Probation Council was kind enough to send me suggested a slightly different redefinition from that which the National Association of Probation Officers has put forward. The Central Probation Council suggested adding crime prevention to the list in the Bill and amending subsection (2)(c) so that it read ``the proper punishment of offenders through the effective enforcement of sentences and post-custody supervision''. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's explanation for the Government's decision to omit an explicit reference to rehabilitation and whether the Ministers are prepared to enlarge on the scope of the definition in the Bill.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Taunton, I believe that rehabilitation is perfectly compatible with rigorous and effective punishment, and I hope that the new national probation service will have both aims in view.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Before I speak in support of the amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton, I welcome you as Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Maxton. I hope that you will enjoy it as much of the rest of us.
<P>
On my fairly frequent visits to Dartmoor prison in my constituency I recognise a number there. That is not because I was a criminal lawyer; I specialised in taxation and I am happy to say that none of my clients ended up in prison, nor did any end up on probation, although whether they should have done so is another matter. I recognise the prison officers at Dartmoor prison because they served with me in the Royal Marines many years ago.
<P>
The Government and the draftsmen seem to recognise the importance of rehabilitation in clause 1(1)(b), but it is surprising that, in exercising their functions, the persons mentioned in clause 2(1) should not have regard to rehabilitation. Rehabilitation should be an aim of the probation service. When I visit the probation service, the importance of education, training and work is stressed to me not just by members of the service but by offenders. It is in all our interests that offenders should not reoffend, and rehabilitation is essential. The aims listed in the clause, with the benefit of amendments Nos. 29 and 30, are important and should be included in the Bill.
<P>
All members of the Committee know that many of those on probation have never had a real chance of education, training or, for that matter, work. Many of them have never, for one reason or another, had a chance to avail themselves of all the opportunities that most of us take for granted. I am sure that many statistics show that many of those on probation come from broken families or have severe learning difficulties and have not had the encouragement that is so essential to all of us. Much of life has passed them by.
<P>
The existing aims in the Bill are important, but they should not stand alone. To protection of the public, reduction in reoffending, proper and effective punishment and amendment No. 30 should be added the rehabilitation of offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I welcome the amendment, because it gives me an opportunity to clarify the message that the Bill is designed to send out to the service and the wider public and the functions that it is designed to enshrine in the law. I do not in any way disparage the contributions of the hon. Members for Taunton and for Aylesbury, but it was no accident that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was the only hon. Member to speak to the amendment who acknowledged that we had put rehabilitation not only at the heart of the Bill as a function of the service but at the forefront of the Bill, because it appears in clause 1. It is our view that that is precisely where it should be—at the forefront of the Bill and as a function rather than an aim. Perversely, but I know with the best will in the world, through her amendment the hon. Lady would weaken the position of rehabilitation in the Bill.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Taunton looks at clause 5(1)—I invite the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon to do so too, so that he can apply his forensic skills to the task—she will see that it imposes a duty on the board to make sufficient provision for the purposes mentioned in clause 1. As a result of putting rehabilitation as a function in clause 1, we make it a duty of the board to have regard to it in relation to the aims. That is infinitely stronger than putting rehabilitation simply as an aim: it recognises that, in order to achieve our purposes—the protection of the public, the reduction of reoffending and the proper punishment of offenders—rehabilitation must be at the heart of what we do. I shall resist the amendment, not because we do not regard rehabilitation as important—on the contrary, we regard it as very important indeed—but because the Bill as drafted best enshrines the importance that we attach to rehabilitation. The Bill places a duty on the board to exercise its powers so as to ensure that rehabilitation is at the heart of all that it does, for reasons to which I will come to shortly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I do not wish to be obtuse or to press an amendment that could be otiose, but clause 5 relates to the functions of local boards and clause 2(1) draws into its ambit many others, certainly including the Secretary of State—
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is the Secretary of State who, with the local boards, has responsibility for delivering the overarching purposes of the Bill, which are found in the board's functions.
<P>
I stress that the National Probation Service is first and foremost a law enforcement agency. It must deliver in the context of its aims, which are law enforcement aims, not social work aims; we must be clear about that. Without wishing to caricature in any way the position adopted by the hon. Member for Taunton, I must say that there is no sense in which the service is anything other than a law enforcement agency. We are moving away from a social work-type befriending model, and no one should be under any illusions about that. Having listened to what the hon. Member for Aylesbury said on behalf of the Opposition, I have no doubt about where he stands, but the hon. Lady should also reflect on the position that she is adopting. I do not caricature her position, but she should understand that we intend to focus the National Probation Service on law enforcement. Rehabilitation is a central part of that and must be one of the service's functions, but it is rehabilitation with an aim. The service's aims are as I described. The crucial function in respect of which there is a duty on the board includes rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I do not entirely follow the Minister's argument. This is an important issue. I confess my background as a social worker. Twenty years ago, social work was closely aligned to probation, and there was movement in and out of those fields. I was delighted to discover the other day, when I met Harry Fletcher from NAPO, that I used to work with him as a social worker in Waltham Forest. I am aware that I come from that background.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that there is a need to assist and advise—he does not accept befriending—offenders? He seems to be saying that that will not be a function of the National Probation Service, whose function is law enforcement only. If that is to be the case, who will have the role of assisting and advising?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is where the hon. Lady is wrong. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon will advise her on this. The functions of the National Probation Service, which are to be found in clause 1, include the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders. The aims of the service, which are to be found in clause 2, are to protect the public, reduce reoffending and deliver the proper punishment to offenders.
<P>
When the hon. Lady looks back at Hansard, she will find a phrase of her own, ``Unless the rehabilitation of offenders is a prime function of the service''. She goes on to list all sorts of disastrous consequences. I assure her that it is a prime function of the service, and it is referred in the forefront, in clause 1, as a function. It is not an aim; it is a function that the boards have a duty to deliver. Therefore, it is stronger wording than what she proposes.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> We are in danger of getting into a debate about semantics. After my life as a social worker I trained as a teacher, and one thing that was drummed into us was that we had to be clear about the difference between aims and objectives, aims being overarching. The first of the three aims listed is protection of the public. One could argue, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury began to argue, that it is implicit in protecting the public that reoffending is reduced, that offenders are punished and also that offenders are rehabilitated to protect them in future. Therefore, one could argue that there should be only one aim for the probation service, if one is to take that narrow view of the meaning of ``aims''.
<P>
I accept the Minister's word that rehabilitation is important for the Government and is a vital function of the probation service, but I stick to my argument that it should therefore be listed as a fourth aim of the probation service. That sends back a message to the public and to those who work in the service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, as well as being a function, it should also be an aim of the service and that the other person mentioned in clause 2 should have that aim as well?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Yes. My hon. Friend is saying that the Secretary of State should also have the aim of rehabilitating offenders, and I agree with that. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that accepting the amendment would weaken the Bill. However, I accept that he is as committed as I am to the rehabilitation of offenders and expects the future probation service to be as committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I merely want to assure the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon that clause 2(1) applies to the functions of the Secretary of State. One of his functions in exercising his powers under the Bill is, and will remain, the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders. Therefore, it is covered.
<P>
I assure the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman that this is not a semantic argument, but an important legal argument, because we are talking about the need for clarity around functions and aims. It is particularly important in this instance because we are imposing a duty on the board to perform the function of rehabilitation. The fact that it is a duty is important, because later in our consideration of the Bill we shall come to what occurs when a board fails in its duty. When a board fails in its duty, and I hope that we shall have the support of the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman on this, the Secretary of State has certain powers to ensure that rehabilitation is delivered. One difficulty in the past is that rehabilitation has not always been delivered uniformly: the public have not been protected; crime has not been reduced.

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I had almost completed my remarks. I am pleased that at least the Minister's views on rehabilitation of offenders are on the record. As I said on moving the amendment, that is important to us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We have had a good discussion on a number of aspects of the clause and we will clearly not oppose the motion that it should stand part of the Bill. I do not want to detain the Committee further, because we have spent most of the morning discussing various aspects of the clause and the amendments. The Minister has been fair in saying that he will look again at some of the points that we and Liberal Democrat Members have raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury also raised some points, and the Minister was gracious in his response to those.
<P>
The overall concern about the clause, which has been voiced both in the amendments that we pressed to a vote, supported by the Liberal Democrat Members, and in the points made by the hon. Members for Taunton and for Torridge and West Devon, is that all those working in the National Probation Service in the future know where they stand. I welcome the fact that the Minister has said that he will look at those matters again. Clearly in the days since Pepper v. Hart, what is said in the Committee can be taken into account in determining the intention behind the Bill. That is one of the reasons why debates in Committee that clarify matters are so important.
<P>
I remain of the view that a number of matters that we have discussed could add to the clarity with which those working in the probation service in years to come will view their task. I hope that the Minister and his officials, and perhaps the Minister's hon. Friends who are not members of the Committee but will be involved in any ministerial discussions, will take seriously what has been said. Overall, the probation service has welcomed the Government's general approach, as have all parties. We hope, despite our reservations on certain aspects, that the Bill will give the probation service a good and strong future as a national service, which is what the Government intend. Although we are bound to have strong differences of view about the details that should be in the Bill and we hope that the Government will be persuaded to accept some of the Opposition's points in due course, the clause clearly will stand part of the Bill, so we do not propose to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This has been a good morning's debate. We have considered and reflected on two significant clauses that bring into being the National Probation Service for England and Wales and two constituent elements—the Secretary of State, with his functions and responsibilities set out in clause 3, and the local boards, which will have their own specific roles, set out in clause 5. The elements are bound together in one unified service, with its overarching aims around the protection of the public, the reduction of reoffending and the proper punishment of offenders.
<P>
Clause 1 sets out clearly that the role of the service is to deal with offenders and that the focus must be on protecting the public from further offending. That is in stark contrast to the probation officer's current role as enshrined in the Probation Service Act 1993 of assisting and befriending offenders. As I have said, we are moving away from that.
<P>
Probation officers have valuable skills. It is vital that they build up a rapport with the offenders in their charge, but those offenders are not clients, and it is important to make that distinction. No one should be under any illusions about the nature of the change and of the culture shift that we expect: it is a philosophical change. Some of those whom probation officers work with will be damaged, difficult, dangerous or distressed. Others will have all those characteristics and will also be disadvantaged and from excluded sections of society. The service must have staff with the skills to enable it to develop productive methods of working with offenders, but, above all, productive in the community's interests, because the community and protection of the community must come first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> While the Minister is talking about a culture shift, will he address the concern of a number of probation committee members about centralised control, which I know has been raised with him and with those on the Front Benches?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We shall deal with that in much more detail later in our consideration of the Bill, but, yes, the Secretary of State—we shall come on to his powers in due course—must have the means to ensure that the national service is properly directed and that standards can be applied in such a way that, wherever one is in the country, a probation service will be available that delivers the standards of public protection and reduction of offending that we are entitled to expect, as well as high standards of rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister accepts that there will need to be a culture shift for those who already work in the probation service. I am sure that he would accept that, if there were a spectrum from social worker to prison officer, the move along the spectrum is closer to the way in which prison officers see themselves, rather than the way in which social workers see themselves. Given, therefore, that for many people who already work in the probation service it might be a difficult shift to make—it may not be what they were taken into the service to do—can the Minister say what extra resources will be put into training those officers, so that they can make the necessary culture shift?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not accept that characterisation of a spectrum between the work of a social worker and a prison officer. We are developing a new concept for prisons and probation, and we are funding that concept to an unprecedented level in the history of the service. Today's debate has been crucial in recognising the need to ensure a real and credible basis to the sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Minister has spoken about functions and aims, and I understand that. Am I drawing the Minister too far if I put it to him that rehabilitation is an integral part of reducing reoffending?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is a central function of the service. The way in which the service is positioned in clause 1 will focus its attention on the need to work with offenders in a way that reduces the tendency towards recidivism and better protects the public. For that reason, I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, subject to the Standing Order.
