							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): Welcome to the
Committee, Mr. O&#146;Hara. You and I share some areas of
mutual interest&#151;normally in relation to Cyprus. I hope that the
Committee can likewise reach some consensus on the need for alcohol
treatment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I speak in
support of amendments Nos. 105, 106 and 108, which were tabled in my
name and those of other Opposition Members, and which would require an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>alcohol treatment option as part of the generic youth rehabilitation
order. I endorse the comments that have been made about the need to
widen the restricted list of requirements in the Bill to cover alcohol
treatment explicitly, and to address the misuse of substances that
cause many offences. I refer particularly to the case made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Kettering in relation to volatile substances and
their connection with
crime.</div>
					<a name="0710244000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments relate first to the points of principle on how to
differentiate the treatment of adults and the treatment of youths.
Previous debates have recognised the need for different treatment of
young offenders, for proper coverage of their needs and for sentencing
options that are tailored so that young offenders who come before the
courts are diverted from reoffending, as all of us in the Committee
would wish. My experience is that in all too many cases, young
offenders become trapped in the &#147;revolving door&#148;, getting
locked into the system as they graduate through different levels of
crime. The aim of youth rehabilitation orders and of the treatment
requirements is primarily to meet their needs.</div>
					<a name="0710244000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition are concerned
about the fact that there is a different set of requirements from that
which is available for adults. Let us consider the history of the
legislation. In July 2001, the Halliday report set out the need to deal
with community orders holistically and generically, and to move away
from the proliferation of different orders of which I, as a
practitioner, had been much aware. Even at that stage, efforts were
being made to try to straddle the many different elements of orders and
legislation to bring some sense from the madness. The proposal at that
time was to scrap the distinct orders and present them as requirements
within a single, generic, community sentence.</div>
					<a name="0710244000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the genesis of the
provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which overhauled the range
of community orders for adults and substituted community sentences.
Significantly, the range of requirements for generic orders available
for adults included unpaid work, curfews, drug treatment and alcohol
treatment. The first question, therefore, is why that menu of options
is available for adults but is not reproduced in the Bill for young
people.</div>
					<a name="0710244000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
September 2003, the Green Paper &#147;Youth Justice&#151;The Next
Steps&#148; was published. At that stage, the proposed action plan
orders were to include a number of different menus of options,
including options relating to drug and alcohol awareness measures, drug
treatment and testing, and alcohol treatment. The question is why we
have, in many senses, moved backwards from that stage by not including
an alcohol treatment requirement in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0710244000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the evidence-taking
sessions, we heard from Brendan Finegan from the Youth Justice Board,
who informed the Committee:</div>
					<a name="0710244000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Bill in its current
shape probably does not allow us to have that alcohol treatment order.
We would support the addition of an alcohol treatment
element.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Referring to his
colleague, Graham Robb, Mr. Finegan
added:</div>
					<a name="0710244000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Graham&#146;s
view was that the board&#146;s approach to substance misuse and the
misuse of substances, whether licit or illicit, is that we would wrap
them up in a general concept of substance misuse, so that misuse of
tobacco as much as misuse of proscribed drugs can be wrapped together.
In terms of the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>itself, we accept that an amendment for alcohol would allow that problem
to be tackled.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Criminal
Justice and Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>18 October 2007; c.
97, Q211.]</div>
					<a name="0710244000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome that
comment from the Youth Justice Board in favour of such an
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle should be shared. The Minister of State acknowledged a couple
of days before that evidence-taking session, during the preliminary
discussions and questions
that:</div>
					<a name="0710244000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There is
potentially a gap in respect of
alcohol.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Criminal Justice
and Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>16 October 2007; c. 11,
Q2.]</div>
					<a name="0710244000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that we all agree
that it is important to tackle the problem of alcohol when dealing with
young people. All the evidence suggests that more alcohol is going down
fewer throats. On the issue of alcohol-fuelled disorder, it is clear
that teenagers and children are drinking to dangerous levels, with over
45 per cent. of 14 to 15-year-olds estimated to have drunk alcohol in
the past week. One survey showed that 54 per cent. of 15 to
16-year-olds had consumed more than five drinks on a single occasion in
the preceding 30 days, and 27 per cent. of them reported doing that
three or more times within the preceding 30 days.</div>
					<a name="0710244000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at
crime itself, the British crime survey&#151;we do not always want to
rely on that&#151;states that alcohol is a factor in 47 per cent. of
violent crime. That breaks down to alcohol being a factor in 45 per
cent. of incidents of domestic violence, 19 per cent. of muggings, 58
per cent. of incidents of stranger violence, and 51 per cent. of
incidents of acquaintance violence. That is the case whether adults or
young people are involved.</div>
					<a name="0710244000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The primary
aim of the order for which the Bill provides is to intervene as early
as possible, which sadly sometimes has to be at the court order stage.
One wants to get to the heart of the problem of young people&#146;s
offending, which affects the offender, their relationships at home,
which are often broken, and their relationships out on the streets. The
amendment is designed to put in place the provision that is already
available for adults. Basically, what is good for the adults should be
good for the youths. It also seeks to understand that this is a primary
problem for young people.</div>
					<a name="0710244000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also important to see
whether treatment can be delivered in practice. The Minister will
probably say that there is nothing within the generic order to stop
voluntary activities of alcohol treatment being dealt with, but the
real question, which has to be answered whether or not we have an
alcohol treatment requirement, is whether the resources needed to
deliver a step change improvement in alcohol treatment are available.
When one looks at funding across the board, one sees that, compared
with drug treatment, alcohol is very much the Cinderella service, if
indeed Cinderella is even thought of. A recent survey following a
freedom of information request showed that alcohol treatment funding
made up only 6 per cent. of the funding that drug treatment services
receive.</div>
					<a name="0710244000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
opportunities available for an adolescent to seek treatment voluntarily
are limited. It is estimated that around 17,000 adolescents at present
are in treatment, but that can cover many different forms of treatment.
Often that does not include any sense of whether they are receiving day
treatment or residential rehabilitation. The reality is that there is
only one dedicated residential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>service in this country: Middlegate Lodge, which has three beds
available. That is shocking given the statistics that I have
outlined.</div>
					<a name="0710244000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
hon. Members know the impact of alcohol on young people in their
constituencies. Whether we have the treatment requirement or not, the
resources to deliver treatment are very limited indeed. One cannot rely
on treatment taking place voluntarily. It is important, when cases come
to court which merit a treatment order, that that provision is
available. If the Bill is to contain a treatment requirement for
alcohol, as we suggest&#151;the same argument can be made in relation
to drug treatment&#151;it should be there not just for the headlines,
but for delivery. People have a right to expect that if an order is in
the Bill, it can be delivered. The &#163;600,000 or so that will be
put in place to deliver training is plainly not adequate as a dedicated
resource to deliver proper
treatment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation in this country contrasts remarkably with that in other
countries. Very briefly, I would like to illustrate what is needed to
deliver an alcohol treatment requirement with an example from Sweden,
where there is more of a focus on adolescent services. This country
focuses more on adult rehabilitation. Treatment centres such as the
Maria youth clinic are fully state funded. It has 110 staff who see
2,000 families a year. Early treatment for addiction is crucial. In the
Maria youth clinic, treatment is available immediately. The clinic sits
in its own dedicated unit within a police facility and immediately the
offender is arrested and charged, they go straight to the clinic for
treatment, once it has been identified that drugs or alcohol are a
relevant factor.</div>
					<a name="0710244000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Maria youth clinic</div>
					<a name="0710244000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aims
to achieve permanent sobriety in the young patient and straight away he
has individual counselling and his parents and the school are brought
in&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The parents and
school being engaged at an early stage are crucial factors in terms of
any effective
treatment.</div>

following our evidence-taking sessions, Mr.
O&#146;Hara.</div>
					<a name="0710244000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the hon. Members for Cambridge and for Enfield, Southgate
for the amendments that they have tabled. I am also grateful to the
hon. Member for Kettering for raising the issue of substance misuse
and, in particular, solvent misuse.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>
					<a name="0710244000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will declare an interest as I
am currently vice-president of the charity Re-Solv, which deals with
solvent and volatile substance abuse. In fact, my last proper job
before entering the House of Commons was as a director of Re-Solv for
three years until 1992. I therefore have an understanding of the impact
of solvent and volatile substance misuse, particularly on young people.
As has been mentioned, there is a number of substances that are normal,
everyday household items that young people can and do misuse, which
give a temporary kick, but which can lead to instant death or long-term
problems. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to examine
the substance misuse amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge
in conjunction with the alcohol misuse amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Enfield,
Southgate.</div>

					<a name="0710244000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)
intervened on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice
to raise the lack of an alcohol order within the youth rehabilitation
order. My right hon. Friend agreed to look at the issue with me during
proceedings on the Bill. I say to all three hon. Gentlemen that their
amendments are valuable. I am keen to look at them in great detail, and
I hope to produce an amendment at a later stage that meets their
objectives. I obviously need to reflect on matters carefully to make
sure that our definition will do the job that those who have spoken
want to be done. My right hon. Friend and I are keen to make
progress.</div>
					<a name="0710244000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted that,
when giving oral evidence, the Youth Justice Board and the
Children&#146;s Society felt strongly that there should be a
treatment requirement to cover substance misuse. I have undertaken to
look at that in detail, and I am ready to widen our consideration so
that we examine all substance misuse. If we get the definition right, a
provision on substance misuse could cover alcohol misuse as well as
solvent and volatile substance misuse. I shall certainly be considering
whether such a requirement is deliverable and, if so, how we can ensure
that it is appropriate to young
people.</div>
					<a name="0710244000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair to
the hon. Member for Cambridge, I need to examine whether his helpful
definition of substance misuse is appropriate for the Bill. I want to
consider whether it covers substances other than drugs and alcohol, and
how we can define substance misuse to ensure that we catch some of the
volatile substances that are subject to abuse, and whether we can have
a definition that covers the concerns that have been expressed
today.</div>
					<a name="0710244000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to examine whether the drug treatment requirement under the Bill
will or will not be subsumed by the suggestions of a substance misuse
treatment order, because we could consider tabling an amendment that
covers a generic substance misuse order and which would cover drug,
alcohol and volatile substance misuse treatment. I understand where the
hon. Members for Cambridge and for Enfield, Southgate are coming from,
and I have great sympathy with their aims, given both my professional
background before I came to the House and my ministerial
background.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>
					<a name="0710244000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to discuss the matter
with the Youth Justice Board, the Department of Health and others who
will be responsible for examining some of the needs in respect of the
order. I am keen to do that and I hope that I have signalled to members
of the Committee that I am minded to table an amendment of the same
nature as those proposed. I am happy to discuss matters outside the
Committee with hon. Members before I do
so.</div>
					<a name="0710244000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot accept an amendment
today because our discussions and negotiations have not been finalised.
We need to look at the downstream consequences of the actual
phraseology used in the Bill. In principle, however, I agree to examine
such matters in great detail and in due course to table an appropriate
amendment that I hope will be agreed by the hon. Members for Cambridge,
for Enfield, Southgate and supported by the hon. Member for Kettering.
I hope that, on that basis, the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>

						<b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I am very grateful for the
Minister&#146;s remarks and I am hopeful that we can move forward on
the issue in the way that he has described.</div>
					<a name="0710244000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason that the definitions
are drafted as they are in the amendment is, firstly, to ensure that
they depend on the nature of the substances, rather than the legality
or illegality of the substances concerned; and, secondly, so that they
take into account possible future developments. We are always behind
the curve when it comes to youth culture and what youths are
doing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000395"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> One of the reasons why I want to reflect upon this
matter in detail is to cover that very point. In my experience of
solvent and volatile substance misuse, every item that is abused is
something that has a domestic day-to-day purpose and a legitimate use.
We phrase legislation in terms of the sale of those items to cover
their misuse; we need to ensure that we phrase the legislation, in due
course, to cover the misuse of items rather than their legitimate
use.</div>
					<a name="0710244000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000396"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> That is precisely the point. We
must ensure that we are looking at the effects of substance misuse on
young people and their communities, rather than sticking to narrow,
legalistic definitions of whether a substance is legal or used for a
particular lawful
purpose.</div>
					<a name="0710244000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, it is very important to draft legislation so that we can catch
future developments. Our ability to predict the future in this type of
case is very limited. There have been a number of developments, as
mentioned by the hon. Member for Kettering, which were not predicted by
the authorities, the Government or anyone with a position of
authority.</div>
					<a name="0710244000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
brief explanations of the way in which we drafted the amendment, and
with gratitude that the Government appear to be thinking in the same
direction, I am happy to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000397"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> To deal with our amendments, we too welcome the
Minister&#146;s saying that he is considering seriously an amendment
to encompass the elements of substance and alcohol
misuse.</div>
					<a name="0710244000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
add a note of caution. Back in 2003, it was indicated that there was to
be an alcohol treatment requirement. Obviously, time has passed, and it
would be interesting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>to know why that was dropped from the list. We are subject to the
demands of the legislative timetable and there is limited time to come
up with an appropriate proposal. That is, in many ways,
regrettable.</div>
					<a name="0710244000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
share the concern that the treatment requirement should be deliverable.
Within the amendments there is the important requirement that the court
must be satisfied
that</div>
					<a name="0710244000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;arrangements have
been or can be made for the treatment intended to be specified in the
order&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is more
important if we take substance misuse generically. As I said earlier,
in terms of alcohol, a limited amount of treatment is available, and it
is important to be able to deliver what one promises and what the
courts would expect. With that said, if work is done on both the
definitions and what can be achieved, I will not press our
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000401"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> These amendments develop a theme that has
already been debated by the Committee, both in terms of the principles
behind the generic youth rehabilitation order and in relation to
hierarchy of
sentencing.</div>
					<a name="0710244000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 103 would make the reparation requirement part of the generic youth
rehabilitation order. In that connection, I want particularly to note
the comments of the Magistrates Association during our evidence-taking
sessions. The association expressed concern in evidence given on 16
October. In response to Question 61, Cindy Barnett, the chairman,
explained her concerns that a separate reparation order with the
generic youth rehabilitation order might lead to confusion. The
association was concerned to ensure consistency and clarity about
orders, both for the offender and for the
court.</div>
					<a name="0710244000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair, we
also heard that the Youth Justice Board did not share that concern. It
wanted to ensure that there would be an appropriate hierarchy of
sentences, going up the tariff. However, I suggest
that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>the Government cannot have it both ways in the matter of hierarchy. They
argue that the intensive supervision and surveillance order should come
as part of a generic order and that there is an inbuilt hierarchy
within the generic youth rehabilitation orders; but at the same time
they still want to keep an element of separateness with the reparation
order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is concern about clarity.
From speaking to practitioners and others, I know that when they come
to court they want to know exactly what orders are in place. If we are
to move towards adopting a generic order, it is important that it is
all-encompassing, so that magistrates can deal with different levels of
seriousness of offences appropriately, and, if an offence is at a low
level and requires a first instalment of a youth rehabilitation order,
a reparation order should be made within that order. I concede that
there is an element of reparation already within the generic orders.
However, I share the concerns of the Magistrates Association that there
is still a need to deal with the matters together, by way of a generic
order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the
point that I made about the way in which the Bill has come before us
following the discussions about the 2003Green Paper, the plans at that
time for the action plan order entailed a menu to cover fines,
reparation and a range of other specified activities. It would be
interesting to know how we have moved on to keeping reparation orders
separate from other, generic, orders. There used to be other low-level
community sentences, such as attendance centre orders, which were kept
separate, but&#151;properly, in many ways&#151;the generic order is
now intended to include that element, by way of an activity
requirement. The question is why a reparation order cannot similarly be
part of the same order, for the sake of clarity, and for the sake of
magistrates, offenders, practitioners and the
public.</div>
					<a name="0710244000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000402"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> I read amendment No. 104 as
having a slightly broader effect than one of pure reparation. That is
why I support it. The only problem that I have with it is the name
given to the requirement, which should really be something like
&#147;restorative justice requirement&#148;, rather than just
&#147;reparation requirement&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 104 would provide
that</div>
					<a name="0710244000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the offender must
attend an activity or activities involving contact between an offender
and persons affected by the
offences&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not just reparation in the ordinary sense of payback. It includes
the element of an encounter, in controlled conditions, between the
offender and the victim. It is that encounter that is often the most
successful part of a restorative justice exercise. Reparation itself
can be part of the process, but the encounter is important as well.
That is what the order
includes.</div>
				
					<a name="0710244000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0710244000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we now
know about restorative justice is that it is successful. It is probably
the most tested criminal justice intervention of recent years, and the
evidence is piling up, not only of its potential, but of its actual
success. If we look at the research reported by Professor Lawrence
Sherman and Heather Strang for the Smith Institute, we see
scientifically validated evidence piling up in favour of that type of
intervention.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>
					<a name="0710244000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intervention works, often in
surprising ways. For example, it works not just for property crime,
which is what people normally think of restorative justice and
reparation being about, but for some forms of violent crime. In fact,
it sometimes works better for violent crime than for property crime.
Perhaps even more surprisingly, it can work successfully for serious
offences as well as for minor offences.</div>
					<a name="0710244000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is probably because of the
element of the encounter. Offenders often have in their heads a series
of quite unacceptable excuses for their behaviour&#151;excuses they
give themselves, which downplay the humanity of the victim and the
entitlement of the victim to live a safe life. A series of studies
shows clearly that those sort of excuses can be dismantled as a
consequence of the encounter between a victim and an offender.
Therefore, restorative justice works, but it works best for crimes in
which there is an individual
victim.</div>
					<a name="0710244000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
important aspect of restorative justice is the good it does for
victims. Again, it is not just about the payback. Some work might be
done for the victim or some payment might be made, which the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate mentioned. However, it is not just that.
Often victims want to know the answers to quite simple questions such
as, &#147;Why me? Why was I the victim rather than some other person?
Was I being picked on for some characteristic of my own?&#148; What
comes out of the encounter is that the victim discovers that they were
chosen at random. They were not being picked on in any particular way
because of who they were, but were chosen because of the circumstances
or the coincidence of events.</div>
					<a name="0710244000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000403"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I support the hon. Gentleman and the
principle of restorative justice, which my hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Harborough also supports. My concern is that in practice,
some of the reparation orders made at present do not go as far as the
hon. Gentleman seeks to take them, which is properly to address the
issues of the offence with the victim of the crime. Instead, it can be
at a very low level. They might write a letter saying sorry, or make
something that gets sent to the victim, but it often does not go beyond
that and they do not take the opportunity to ensure that reparation
also leads to
restoration.</div>
					<a name="0710244000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000404"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> Yes, the amendment creates the power to do that,
which is a valuable part of it. The effect on the victim can be very
important. Studies show that the degree of mental illness that victims
suffer as a result of crimes can be reduced by this sort of restorative
justice encounter. I therefore support the amendment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The one point to mention here,
which echoes a point made in a previous debate, is that resources are
needed for restorative justice to work. I would like to draw the
Government&#146;s attention to the research finding that says that
restorative justice works far better when it is run by the police
rather than by social workers. If that is going to work, we must think
about the resources that go to the police for this sort of activity,
rather than for their other more usual
activities.</div>
					<a name="0710244000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000405"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Members for
Enfield, Southgate and for Cambridge for speaking to the
amendments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>
					<a name="0710244000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me state at the outset that I
believe that it is important that young people who have offended accept
responsibility for their actions and, where possible, do something
practical to offer reparation that will benefit the victim, or indeed
the community as a whole. That is why, in the Bill, we have included
reparation in the requirements of the youth rehabilitation order.
We also propose&#151;this is the crucial difference
between the amendment and our thinking&#151;to maintain the
reparation order as a separate sentence beneath the YRO for the courts
to exercise. We have done that for a number of reasons, which I hope
the members of the Committee will understand.</div>
					<a name="0710244000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that
reparation is very important. In my previous role as a Northern Ireland
Minister, I was responsible for the Youth Justice Agency there, where
restorative justice was a particular aim. My hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State for Justice also had a brief sojourn in
Northern Ireland for six weeks, following my departure, before moving
to her current post. She joined the Ministry of Justice to take forward
very positive activity too. The use of restorative justice has been
proved to show great benefits to the community at large and to the
individuals who undertake it. We are currently undertaking a number of
restorative justice pilots in England and Wales to see whether there
would also be benefits here. In my experience in Northern Ireland, the
victims of crime and, very often, the young people or others who have
been involved in crime benefit greatly from undertaking that process,
so I feel that restorative justice has merit.</div>
					<a name="0710244000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument between us today
is, I believe, about whether we retain a separate reparation order or
simply subsume it into the YRO. I take the view that we should have a
separate order, because I want to see it used to prevent the escalation
of activity by young people who are made the subjects of such
orders.</div>
					<a name="0710244000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pray in aid
what the Committee heard last Thursday from the representatives of both
the Youth Justice Board and the Children&#146;s Society. They
strongly supported retaining the reparation order as a separate
sentence. Indeed, Ellie Roy, the chief executive of the Youth Justice
Board, told the Committee
that</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): Will the Minister
explain one thing to the Committee? The Youth Justice Board and others
are being entirely consistent in their approach of saying that there
should be a hierarchy. The Minister is not being quite so consistent in
that he is now arguing the exact opposite of the position that he
adopted in respect of ISSOs. I wonder whether he could explain why he
now takes a different
view.</div>

reparation order in itself can act as a useful tool to prevent further
reoffending and to prevent the ratcheting up of offending by the young
person. I accept that I have taken a different view with regard to the
surveillance requirements. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>I think that, based on the evidence that we have, we can involve young
people in undertaking reparation, without ratcheting up the level of
the order that would be proposed for the

							<b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op):
May I suggest that the answer to the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome might be made easier if we put aside the idea of a
hierarchy, because I think that that sometimes gets in the way of
sentencing in the courts? That is because one ends up with
inappropriate sentences, due to the idea that the individual is
somewhere on an inappropriate hierarchy. By contrast, what we have is a
multi-faceted and serious option, which is the one that the Minister is
addressing. However, a youngster who had committed an offence that led
to a decision of guilt, but which was not a serious offence, might
nevertheless undertake reparation. Is it not better, as my right hon.
Friend the Minister of State rightly suggests, to make that provision
available than to trap people in
hierarchies?</div>
					<a name="0710244000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000409"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his
contribution. The essential point that I am trying to make is that the
reparation order provides a separate sentence&#151;in this case,
below the youth rehabilitation order&#151;that is focused on
activities that will help prevent crime and deal with some low-level,
but significant, offences that young people might be responsible for,
such as graffiti, minor damage or poor behaviour in the community at
large. The reparation order would ensure that we focus on activities
that will reinforce principles such as personal responsibility and
ensuring that people learn about the consequences of their actions and
accept and understand the nature of the damage that they have
done.</div>
					<a name="0710244000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we retain the reparation order. The Youth Justice
Board and the Children&#146;s Society indicated the same thing in
their evidence to us. Our experience is that the reparation order can
be effective in preventing the escalation of offending behaviour before
there is a need for the court to consider whether a youth
rehabilitation order should be imposed. Considering the types of
reparation that young people can undertake, such as graffiti cleaning,
repairing community facilities and innovative bespoke
schemes&#151;including bike renovation for people involved in bike
crime and faith-based reparation in conjunction with local
churches&#151;conservation work and community art work, and
considering the youth reparation order generally with regard to wider
restorative justice schemes, all those things have a value in helping
to prevent crime, which all Committee members are concerned
about.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): It is probably my
fault, but I have become a little bit confused about the agreement that
the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth seemed to be
advancing in favour of the Minister&#146;s argument. I thought that I
agreed with him that it is far better to have a fairly open-ended
system whereby the courts could choose the appropriate remedy for a
particular offender without being bothered by the hierarchy, so that if
an individual were charged with a fairly low-level offence but none the
less needed to have his offending behaviour brought home to him, a
reparation order, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for
Enfield, Southgate, might be sensible. What you call it and how it fits
into the Bill does not seem to make much difference; what is important
is getting the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>offender to repair the damage, in some way or other, to the victim.
Whether that is done by a rehabilitation order requirement or by a
self-standing disposal, or a combination of both, and whether the
reparation order fits within both categories, surely does not matter
much, as long as the court has it at its
disposal.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000411"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> As the amendments are drafted, the proposed new
reparation requirement would duplicate the existing order. Provisions
for reparation that are already built into the youth rehabilitation
order and would cause confusion to the courts, the supervising
authorities and, crucially, to the young person. We are trying to
ensure that we have the flexibility of having the reparation order in
place for low-level offences and, equally, including it as part of a
wider youth rehabilitation order if need be. It is important that we do
that to prevent
reoffending.</div>
					<a name="0710244000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate to withdraw his amendment. I cannot
support
it.</div>

							<a name="0710244000412"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I have heard the
Minister&#146;s comments, but I am not convinced by his rationale.
The Magistrates Association, which gave evidence to us, said that its
involvement in consultation on this proposal was limited. At the very
least, the amendment has highlighted the association&#146;s concerns,
which perhaps could have been listened to and taken on board at an
earlier stage. It is, however, worth repeating its comments in written
evidence, as it takes issue with the Minister and looks at whether
having the Bill as a separate order is less confusing. The association
points
out:</div>
					<a name="0710244000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
separation will only serve to confuse young people. Whilst in its own
right it is not a community sentence, neither are many of the other
requirements in the new YRO and therefore the Association cannot see,
nor has it been
given&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0710244000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is an
important point because the level of the conversation has perhaps been
limited&#151;</div>
					<a name="0710244000094"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any good
reason why this order has been excluded and left
separate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000413"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> The Magistrates Association does not always get
it right; the hon. Gentleman should apply his own mind to the matter.
Faced with an offender who commits a mild offence, we might not want to
use the full panoply of measures in the YRO, but merely want to say,
&#147;Put things right.&#148; Surely what the hon. Gentleman seeks
would stand in the way of that.</div>
					<a name="0710244000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000414"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> As a defence solicitor, I do not suggest that
magistrates always get it right&#151;indeed, I often try to convince
them to alter their pre-existing opinion of a particular defendant.
Nevertheless in a case involving a low-level offence, such as that
referred to by the right hon. Gentleman, it might be appropriate to
impose an activity requirement with an element of reparation, or a
measure that had an attendance centre requirement. Those types of order
used to be distinct and separate and were the lowest level of order
before we moved up the scale to supervision orders. Under the Bill all
those requirements are contained within youth rehabilitation
orders.</div>
					<a name="0710244000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The menu of
options contains many low-level interventions that magistrates can use.
It is not clear how one can distinguish a hierarchy of measures such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>as a limited attendance centre requirement or a limited activity
requirement and a reparation order. That is particularly true if the
Government&#146;s position is that intensive supervision and
surveillance orders fall within generic youth rehabilitation orders; by
implication, there is a hierarchy that goes right up the scale to
intensive supervision and surveillance orders. Surely it makes sense to
have all the options available in a clear and methodical
manner.</div>
					<a name="0710244000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I maintain my view, but do not
at this stage wish to press the matter further. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

am not sure what &#147;consulting&#148; really means. I know what
the English word means, but I would be interested to hear from the
Minister what consulting the offender&#146;s parents or guardians and
the local authority is intended to mean as a matter of the construction
of the Bill, so that a court knows what is in the Government&#146;s
mind when it comes to consider a youth rehabilitation order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say that in the context of the
evidence that we heard on Thursday 18 October. Mr. Simon
Hickson, the policy advisor for the Children&#146;s Society,
said:</div>
					<a name="0710244000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;About
&#163;280 million a year is spent on sending children into custody. A
custodial sentence of a year, even if only six months is spent in
custody, can cost nearly &#163;100,000. From our perspective, there
is a crucial need to look at the criteria for custody and the Bill
presents an opportunity to do so. There is an opportunity to move to
something of a virtuous circle, by tightening the criteria for custody
and using the intensive supervision and surveillance programme or ISS
order, as we would like to see it, and the higher intensity measures as
community options.&#148;&#151;&#151;<i class="I">[Official Report, Criminal
Justice and Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>18 October 2007; c.
92, Q200.]</div>
					<a name="0710244000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take it that he included within that the fostering requirement because,
clearly, if we could deal with a disaffected young person through
fostering and improve his behaviour, stop his criminality and reduce
reoffending through fostering or an ISS order, that would save a huge
amount of money.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>
					<a name="0710244000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, Ellie Roy, the chief
executive of the Youth Justice Board also gave evidence on that
occasion. In response to a question from
me:</div>
					<a name="0710244000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
is this money coming from that is going to make this
work?&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0710244000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">she
said:</div>
					<a name="0710244000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
starting point for this is that a lot of money is being spent on these
young people anyway, through various parts of the system, whether it is
on care, social work or various services. This looks as if it is a more
effective way of spending some of that resource to get much better
results. If we manage to reduce the numbers in custody, the Youth
Justice Board would be able to invest more of the money that we
currently spend on custody. Simon Hickson quoted the amount for
custody. In some sectors it is much higher than that. Some of the beds
that we pay for cost up to &#163;200,000 a year. A lot of money is
being spent anyway, particularly on the secure children&#146;s homes.
There are issues about how local authorities identify the children who
are most in need and who are already costing a lot of money, and how
they spend the money that is already being invested in them. There is
also for us a challenge in terms of getting kids out of custody so that
we can spend the money spent on custody in other
ways.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then, Bob
Reitemeier, who is the chief executive of the Children&#146;s Society
added:</div>
					<a name="0710244000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
should like to encourage the Committee to take a long-term view in
addressing this question of finances. Reoffending rates hover between
75 and 80 per cent. for offenders who go to custody. It is not just, as
Simon Hickson pointed out, &#163;100,000 a year, because you multiply
that every time the young person comes back into the system. So what
some of the interventions, such as intensive fostering or intensive
engagement with young people, are trying to combat is the reoffending
rate. It is working in a way that prevents these young people from
coming back into the system. So when you look at finances and the long
term, it sounds crude, but it is pay now or pay later, or pay now or
continue to pay. We need to take a long-term view of
that.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Criminal Justice and
Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>18 October 2007; c. 92-93,
Q202<i class="I">.</i>]</div>
					<a name="0710244000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have set that out
possibly at too great a length, but it is important to understand the
context in which people such as Bob Reitemeier, Simon Hickson and Ellie
Roy are looking at finances and looking at the resources that it is
necessary to deploy if these sorts of responses to young criminal
behaviour are to work.</div>
					<a name="0710244000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said in
the evidence sessions, I have concerns about the nationalisation of
children, as I rather dramatically put it. There are already
arrangements in the family courts for children to be put into the care
of a local authority outside the criminal justice system. Those
arrangements have good and bad results, as we know&#151;I come back
to the figure that 27 per cent. of the people in custody have been
through care. Undoubtedly, however, there will be cases where sadly,
both for the child and for the parents, it is the only answer if the
child is to move into adulthood with any form of safety. If that is
what is required, we must harden our hearts and hope that taking the
child away from its natural parents and placing it in care is the
lesser of two evils.</div>
					<a name="0710244000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem that I see arising
from intensive fostering requirement is again highlighted by Bob
Reitemeier&#146;s evidence. I
asked:</div>
					<a name="0710244000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;So who
will be responsible for co-ordinating this, or does that just fall
through the grating?&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is to say, would the co-ordinating of the resources and providing the
right answer for these youngsters fall through the grating? Ellie Roy
replied:</div>
					<a name="0710244000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should be the youth offending team at the local level. If they have
behind them the leverage of saying that what they are doing is a
requirement of the court, that will facilitate and encourage
discussions with local partnerships about to which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>people priority should be given. If you get that right, you will get the
pay-offs that Simon Hickson described earlier. You can change behaviour
and that will save victims, communities and money in the future. That
is the ideal that we are heading for and I think that the YRO is a
strong lever for us in achieving
it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Reitemeier agreed with her
about</div>
					<a name="0710244000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the critical need
for joining up these
services&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0710244000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">but he
continued:</div>
					<a name="0710244000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
point was made earlier about resources in a different context, but the
other reality experienced on the ground is that this is viewed as a
criminal justice problem, not a broader problem relating to children
and young people.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
reminded
us:</div>
					<a name="0710244000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The reality

life of a young
person&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">children&#146;s
services can move them off their book and place them in the criminal

					<a name="0710244000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am getting to the church by way of the moon, but the question that I
want the Minister to answer is as follows: if the court consults the
local authority, if the local authority has very few resources to
spare, it will say, &#147;Criminal justice disposal? Yes
please.&#148; The criminal justice system, whether it be the youth
offending team or the youth justice system, will then take over the
burden of spending public money on that child, as opposed to the county
council or other local authority departments. There will be an
incentive for local authorities, if consulted in a meaningful way, to
respond that the criminal justice procedure is the best way to deal
with it. Paragraph 4(3) of schedule 1 states:</div>
					<a name="0710244000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But a court may not

probably thinks that the Bill is in a bit of a mess and that it needs
pulling together. There are always difficulties when a Bill is run by
two separate Departments and this is classic example. I look forward to

relationship between the health service and local

							<a name="0710244000419"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am sure that they can be
given enough thought, and today we are seeking to provoke the
Government into thinking. If they do that, it will be a good thing. My
concerns are added to because the Ministry of Justice is new. Although
it may have all sorts of experienced officials and advisors who have
been in other Departments that have dealt with these matters before,
the culture of departmental government means that, by and large, once
one is in one Department, one is in a silo. It is quite difficult to
get the different silos in government to talk to each other. For
example, we are talking about young people who are engaged in the
criminal justice system. That will effect education, health, social
services, children&#146;s services, the criminal justice system and
the police&#151;a host of public authorities and agencies. I wonder
whether the Ministry of Justice yet has the clout, impetus and
experience to handle that. The Under-Secretary of State for Justice is
rising to the challenge of co-ordinating all those great public
authorities, and I hope that she is successful.</div>
					<a name="0710244000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be serious, there is an
organisational and administrative issue here, which will take a lot of
ministerial and political drive and leadership. I hope that we will see
that from the three Ministers who sit on the Committee. However, I am
sceptical and I am concerned that the Bill will fall in its
implementation because of those resource problems.</div>
					<a name="0710244000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to describe that issue
to the Committee in moving amendment No. 2. I assure the Minister that
I will not press it to a Division because there is no point. I do,
however, want some sort of understanding from the Government about how
they think the Bill will work in real life. Local authority leaders on
both sides of the Committee room, practitioners, certainly on this side
of the room, and Ministers who have non-political experience in
children&#146;s activities, such as

						</b> I am sure that the Minister has
done many wonderful things in his life, but I was particularly
interested in his work as the director of Re-Solv. All of us have
different experiences and all of us know that things go wrong if work
is not co-ordinated. We all talk about demanding co-ordination, but
nothing ever seems to get done and how we then have to have another Act
of Parliament to cure it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>
					<a name="0710244000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I ask the Minister, when
he is considering the amendments in the previous group that he said he
would reflect on&#151;amendments Nos. 167 and 105&#151;to find time
to read a book entitled &#147;Wasted&#148; by Mark Johnson. He may
well have read it already. It is clearly one man&#146;s story, but it
a useful encyclopaedia of information about what happens to someone who
falls into the grips of addiction or substance abuse as a result of his
family not providing the support to him as a child that might have been
necessary. He became disaffected with education and with what I loosely
call &#147;normal life&#148;. He went right to the bottom and it
was very difficult for him to rescue himself or allow himself to be
rescued by
others.</div>
					<a name="0710244000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Wasted&#148;
is about someone affected by class A drug abuse and alcohol. Its author
would use anything to get him away, in his head, from where he
was&#151;that is to say, away from the street door or pavement in the
west end&#151;and drugs were the travel system he used to get himself
away. He did not think that he was an addict. He knew that he was in
control of his drug habit, which was costing hundreds of pounds a day.
He stole money or stole goods to sell to raise the money. There are
some big issues in this book that are perhaps hidden by the
ordinariness of the black print of these
pages.</div>
					<a name="0710244000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Minister and his colleagues to read &#147;Wasted&#148;. The right
hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth seems to have read it, but I
urge other Committee members who have not done so to read it, because
it demonstrates the seriousness and the huge nature of the problem that
we are all trying to get to grips
with.</div>

							<a name="0710244000422"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough for raising some important questions. I
do not think that he addressed his amendment at any stage, which is a
good thing because I do not agree with it and I might say why right at
the end of my remarks. Instead, he used his amendment as a vehicle for
expressing some proper concerns about the intensive fostering scheme,
which I think the whole Committee agrees is a bold, imaginative scheme
with enormous potential, if it is allowed to work and if it has the
resources to make it work. I do not want to suggest that it is not well
worth considering and including in the Bill. However, there are some
important questions, which we will discuss further in the context of
schedule 1 and which we have already discussed, albeit superficially,
in our earlier consideration of the Bill. The hon. and learned
Gentleman set out some of the
concerns.</div>
					<a name="0710244000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Resourcing is
not peripheral; it is absolutely central to the operation of the
measure. I do not want to be unkind to the Minister, but I do not think
that he answered precisely the questions put to him this morning on
this subject. There was certainly no clarity about how the measure will
be funded, but that will be critical to its
operation.</div>
					<a name="0710244000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
local authority experience is years out of date. I was the leader of a
county council with social services responsibilities and, certainly in
my time, although almost any amount of resource could be put into
social services and it would be used effectively, they would still
require more to deal with vulnerable people. The limitation was always
the budget that was available, rather than the demands that the
services put on the budget. I am clear in my mind that any directors of
social services&#151;although 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>they are not called that any more; they are called all sorts of other
things that reflect the Children Act 2004 and what flowed from
it&#151;or any officer of an authority who has responsibility for
child protection will grasp an opportunity to shift significant amounts
of expenditure off local authority budgets on to a central Government
budget. However, I want to be clear that that is what is envisaged,
because although the Minister said this morning that his Department and
the criminal justice system would have responsibility for organising
implementation of the measure, I was not clear whether there would
still be a duty on the local authority to provide. If there is, that
would be an onerous duty for many local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="0710244000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
distinction&#151;I come back to the point because I do not think that
we have clarified the position&#151;between what is required for the
child&#146;s protection, which is clearly part of the duty of the
local authority but is no part of a criminal justice disposal, and what
will be required in making orders under the Bill. The latter is part of
a criminal justice disposal and is therefore not purely for the
child&#146;s protection, but its purpose, quite properly and
significantly, is to seek to provide an environment where the young
person is less likely to reoffend.</div>
					<a name="0710244000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to understand the system
that will get us from A to B&#151;that gets the young person into an
intensive fostering place in each local authority area in the country.
Is the Department going to maintain lists of approved intensive foster
parents for each criminal justice area? Will those individuals be
funded directly from Department of Justice funds for the very difficult
job that they will be doing? Alternatively, will the Department, at the
time of disposal, simply ask the local authority whether it has any
foster parents who might fit the bill and work on an ad hoc, or an ad
hominem, basis? Which is it going to be? It will require significant
resources, so what thought has gone into the
provision?</div>
					<a name="0710244000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without some
clarity it is hard to accept at face value that the disposal will be
available in every court across the country to every young offender who
would benefit from it. If it is not to be so, we shall have a postcode
lottery, to use a hackneyed term, in the disposals that are available
to particular magistrates benches.</div>
					<a name="0710244000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it envisaged that the foster
parents who are engaged for the purpose will be in the same local
authority area as the young person, or indeed the court before which
they appear? Or is it the intention to take children out of inner
cities to a&#151;for them&#151;totally alien environment to remove
them from the temptation and pressures that they might otherwise
experience? There is an argument for doing that. There is a case to be
made for saying that the best thing one can do for a young offender in
Lambeth is to take them away from an inner-city environment to a
suburban or rural environment. That has happened in the past. There is
a school in my constituency that is intended for young people who
display behavioural difficulties. It is a local authority school, but
it is not run by Somerset local education authority; Bristol education
authority does. It is miles out in the country, although it is not in
the middle of nowhere. It is in a very sweet little village, but it is
certainly a long way from St. Pauls or Knowle West in Bristol, or the
other places where the children at the school might have come from. Is
that what the Minister of State has in mind?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>
					<a name="0710244000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister of State cannot
provide that clarity here and now, will he write to the Committee to
tell us how the scheme will work? It would put a lot of minds at rest
to know that sufficient thought has gone into its working, and into the
duties that will exist for local authorities, and to know that the
scheme has been discussed with the Local Government Association and
others, so that there is clarity as to the source of funding for
supporting particular
individuals.</div>
					<a name="0710244000366"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0710244000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The placements
must be very special placements if they are to work successfully. It
will not do a young person much good to simply put them into a standard
local authority home&#151;not a foster home&#151;and expect that
that will do the trick of dissuading them from criminal behaviour. All
the evidence shows that it is unlikely to do so, despite the best will
in the world on the part of those who are trying to operate such homes.
We need clear assurances that there are sufficient numbers of people
who can address the problem and who have a high degree of altruism and
the ability to care for what may sometimes be disturbed individuals,
and that we have a way of funding them.</div>
					<a name="0710244000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return to the
amendment&#151;</div>
					<a name="0710244000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000423"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>You should not
bother.</div>
					<a name="0710244000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000424"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman says that I should
not bother, and perhaps that is entirely sensible. I shall just say
that I have been consistent in my view that if a child is taken away
from their familial home by court order, that is a significant disposal
and should be done with proper care. The criterion that would be
removed by the amendment is that it should be done in relation to an
offence that would otherwise attract a custodial sentence. I think that
that is a necessary threshold for such a disposal. I do not wish to
remove it from the order and that is why I would not support the hon.
and learned Gentleman if he were to push the amendment to a vote, which
he is clearly not going to do. I hope that the Minister will be able to
respond to the cogent points that he made, which perhaps I have
amplified a little in my
remarks.</div>
					<a name="0710244000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000425"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful for the positive way in which the
amendments have been moved by the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough, supported in part by the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome.</div>
					<a name="0710244000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be clear
what the amendment would do. It would remove the fostering requirement
from the custodial threshold. I strongly believe that the fostering
requirement retains a place as an alternative to custody provision
alongside the intensive supervision and surveillance provision, on
which we touched earlier this morning. The requirement is based on the
Youth Justice Board&#146;s intensive fostering pilot, which offers an
alternative to custody and which is currently being examined. It may
help if I outline some of the thinking behind the pilot scheme being
operated by the Youth Justice Board, with a view to rolling it out if
the pilot proves to be successful.</div>
					<a name="0710244000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Youth
Justice Board is running small-scale pilots in Staffordshire, Hampshire
and London, funded by a grant of &#163;1.5 million per year. Young
people involved in the pilot are sentenced to the intensive fostering
supervision order under section 88 and schedule 2 of the Anti-social 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>Behaviour Act 2003. Individuals are put in a foster placement for
approximately nine months, although it could be up to a year, with
potentially further time spent with a family after that.</div>
					<a name="0710244000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment, we are funding 13
placements on the pilot in those three areas. So far, 36 young people
have been sentenced to intensive fostering. We are monitoring the
pilot. Again, this is a generic provision in the Bill&#151;we are
trying to prepare legislation in the event of successful roll-out. The
pilot is due to end in October 2008. It is being evaluated by York
university and the interim results show a very positive impact on the
young people involved, including a reduction in reoffending rates among
those who have been through the intensive fostering process.</div>
					<a name="0710244000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to put in the caveat that
only a very small group have been involved in the pilot and we cannot,
as yet, assess its impact. For the reasons I mentioned earlier in
discussions with the hon. and learned Gentleman, there is a need for
intensive fostering where the circumstances of the home situation mean
that an individual needs to be taken out of that to provide all the
important things that fostering can provide, such as role models, love,
support, encouragement and a range of benefits that may be absent in
the original family home. It is not about nationalising young people
and children; it is about trying to meet the needs of what is a very
small group on the pilot, bearing in mind that, if the pilot is
successful, we may roll out the scheme in
future.</div>
					<a name="0710244000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The very
important issue of resources has been raised. This morning I indicated
that we needed to look at that in the round. The Youth Justice Board,
the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Children, Schools and
Families will be accountable and responsible for setting standards,
encouraging schemes and looking at those matters generally. We are
discussing funding for intensive fostering with all three bodies. We
have not made any final decisions yet and I cannot give the Committee
any encouragement in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="0710244000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
even if we did roll out the scheme nationally from the pilots, based on
the legislation, only a very small number of individuals would be
sentenced to intensive fostering. It is not to be confused with the
normal fostering that local authorities throughout the country provide.
Intensive fostering is significantly different in standard to the
fostering arrangements that are for local authorities to determine as a
welfare issue. Intensive fostering is based on an evidence-based model
delivered by a team who work directly with the young person and,
critically, with the family of origin, to try and ensure that we
prevent reoffending, which is the whole purpose of the
order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of very
important points have been made by the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough in relation to the role of the local authority. Let me
assure him that, to date, we have only operated a pilot scheme; we are
looking at the implications of it before deciding whether to roll it
out. As he mentioned, paragraph 4(3)(b) of schedule 1 says a court may
not impose a fostering requirement
unless</div>
					<a name="0710244000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it has consulted
the local authority which is to place the offender with a local
authority foster parent.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>
					<a name="0710244000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practical terms, that will mean that a
court can impose an intensive fostering requirement only if the local
authority has confirmed that a place is available. I expect that, in
the event of both the pilot and the roll-out of the scheme proving
successful, it would not be a question of merely consulting the local
authority, but of a partnership with the local authority in which it
and the court would work together, as part of a general pre-sentence
report, to ensure that that place was available. It would not simply be
a matter of saying to the local authority, &#147;We intend to impose
that order and you have to provide a place.&#148; It would be about
consulting the local authority to ensure that a place was available
when the order was
passed.</div>
					<a name="0710244000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0710244000426"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): I am sure that the
Committee understands why the Minister is not in a position to give a
funding commitment. In his comments, he suggested that he had some idea
of the parameters of how many children might be involved in a national
roll-out of intensive fostering. Could he be more explicit about the
scale that might be measured through a national roll-out and what broad
costs might be attached to
it?</div>
					<a name="0710244000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000427"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I cannot do that. At the moment,
as I have said, we are undertaking a small-scale pilot in
Staffordshire, Hampshire and London, with a cost of about &#163;1.5
million per year. We have had 13 places available and approximately 35
people have passed through those places during the course of the pilot.
We are evaluating the pilot, which is undertaken under different
legislation. The purpose of this Bill is to subsume the provisions of
that legislation into a generic order to make that available. We hope
that the pilot will be evaluated and rolled out. I am discussing
funding with colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and
Families and the Youth Justice Board. We will consult with local
authorities on those placements, but I have to say that local
authorities will almost certainly have to take up a large part of the
cost of those placements.</div>
					<a name="0710244000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again, however, I would
like to refer the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and the rest
of the Committee back to our helpful evidence-taking sessions. During
our fourth sitting, Councillor Les Lawrence, speaking on behalf of the
LGA and replying to the hon. and learned Gentleman,
said:</div>
					<a name="0710244000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The early
indication is that the number of places and the resources, working with
the court and the other agencies, are sufficient at this point, as is
the number of places that are required to match the number of available
resources.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Criminal Justice
and Immigration Public Bill Committee, </i>18 October 2007; c. 141,
Q285.]</div>
					<a name="0710244000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">He was speaking in
relation to intensive
fostering.</div>
					<a name="0710244000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am seeking the Committee&#146;s permission to ensure in the
legislative framework that we have intensive fostering available as
part of the YRO. I hope that the Committee will understand that the
benefits for individuals who have experienced intensive fostering are
accepted. The pilot will run its course and be evaluated, but to date
it has been shown to be quite successful in preventing reoffending. I
hope that the Committee takes on trust my statement that the Government
are considering funding arrangements with the YJB and the Department of
Children, Schools and Families. However, in the event of this scheme
being rolled out, consultation will take place with local authorities
about the availability of places, if courts sought to exercise the
order.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>
					<a name="0710244000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would again like to quote from
the YJB&#146;s written evidence to the Committee. The YJB
said:</div>
					<a name="0710244000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
also welcome that the YRO will include a fostering requirement as
another clear alternative to custody allowing for use of the Intensive
Fostering programme currently being piloted by the
YJB.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clear intention,
as shown in the evidence to the Committee from the chief executive of
the YJB, is that an intensive fostering requirement will be an
alternative to custody. From my discussions with colleagues in
Committee, including Opposition Members, I know that one of their
objectives is to ensure that we keep young people out of custody. This
order, which is being piloted and examined in detail, gives the
potential to meet that objective, subject to the caveat that the local
authority would have to be consulted. In other words, in real terms the
local authority would have to agree to take on the burden of funding
that place and meeting that resource. We are looking to see what
guidance and support that we can give centrally, in terms of monitoring
standards, examining that provision and encouraging its wider
use.</div>
					<a name="0710244000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I hope
that the Committee will agree, not only with me, but with the LGA, the
YJB and others, that intensive fostering has the potential to make an
important contribution to the mix of community penalties that are
available to the courts, and to provide a robust and effective
alternative to custody. I hope that the comments that I have made have
reassured the hon. and learned Gentleman about the use of that
provision. I urge him to reflect upon what I have said and to withdraw
his amendment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000428"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I thank the Minister for what was certainly
intended to be a helpful
response.</div>
					<a name="0710244000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
question&#151;certainly not from the Liberal Democrats, nor from the
Conservatives, I think&#151;that there is a recognition of the
utility of this disposal; it is transparently a good thing. However,
the questions about resourcing will continue to worry us.</div>
					<a name="0710244000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the Minister said still
prompts some really important questions in my mind about the level of
funding. He gave the examples of the pilot scheme and suggested that,
if we were to see a roll-out on the same terms, there would be about
four of these placements per county area, or per principal authority
area, because that is the level at the moment. Minister said that
providing those placements would cost about &#163;500,000 per county
area&#151;that was the figure for grant that he gave. He said that it
would be provided primarily by the local authority.</div>
					<a name="0710244000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, that is why I could not
understand the rather sanguine attitude of Councillor Lawrence when he
was giving evidence. In any other circumstances, if local authorities
are asked whether they will shoulder a further burden of
&#163;500,000 a year out of resources that are not there, they
immediately start banging on the door of the Treasury and the
Department for Communities and Local Government to say that they cannot
meet such requirements from existing budgets. Yet Councillor Lawrence
said that it would not be a problem to provide, on the
Minister&#146;s figures, an extra &#163;500,000 a year for
individuals for whom local authorities do not have a duty under welfare
legislation. It is an additional responsibility. The Youth Justice
Board said that the measure was a cheaper 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>disposal than a custodial sentence. That is correct, but the custodial
sentence is paid for through the criminal justice system from the
budget of the Ministry of Justice, not from local government social
services. That is what worries me.</div>
					<a name="0710244000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall accept the
Minister&#146;s assurances and accept that he is working on the
details, but we shall need greater clarity on this matter before we
reach the Bill&#146;s later stages. We must be clear about how the
measure will be funded. If it is not funded properly, it will not
work.</div>

							<a name="0710244000429"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome and to all those who have contributed to the debate, whether from
the Labour or Opposition Benches. As I said, we must get the area under
discussion right, and there is not much room for party political
banter.</div>
					<a name="0710244000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Gentleman, I found the LGA witnesses the least satisfactory in the
sense that they were the least inquisitive, the least curious and the
least questioning about the Bill. I do not know enough about the
individuals who gave evidence, but I, too, was surprised when they
seemed to be fairly relaxed about the financial burdens that would be
placed on local authorities as a consequence of intensive fostering.
That might be a function of representing Birmingham and Coventry, which
are two large local authority areas, but Leicestershire, part of which
I represent, has a revenue budget of about &#163;750 million for the
entire range of activities. I dare say that Birmingham has a larger
budget than that, but Leicestershire is always having to look carefully
at its annual budget to see whether it can afford the things that the
Government, by statute, require it to do already without having to face
a further bill for &#163;250,000 to carry out a justice
function.</div>
					<a name="0710244000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the fostering requirement is based on crossing the custody
threshold. Let me put aside for one moment my worries about the
fostering arrangements and whether they are always a good thing. If the
requirement works for the more serious offences of those crossing the
custody threshold, why restrict it to that? Why not allow it to be used
to prevent the young person in a difficult family from reaching the
stage at which he does cross the
threshold?</div>
					<a name="0710244000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back
to the book &#147;Wasted&#148; by Mark Johnson. He used to spend
weekends on an entirely voluntary basis with a married couple who were
teachers at his school in Kidderminster. During those
weekends&#151;as he admits in the book&#151;his behaviour improved
immeasurably. It was when he went back home that he fell into his old
habits. When his teaching family moved to another part of
Worcestershire, and he was unable to join them at weekends, things got
worse and worse. At that stage he had not done anything that would have
crossed the custody threshold, but clearly he was benefiting from
contact with that other family. I would be interested to know more
about the 13 placements and the 36 youngsters who have been sentenced
to the system in Staffordshire, London and Hampshire. Can I be assured
that those people were placed with real families, and not local
authority homes? There is a provision within the Bill, if foster 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>parents are not available, for children to be placed in the care of the
local authority, which would mean putting them into children&#146;s
homes or other institutions and that would defeat the
object.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000430"></a>Mr.

of the 35 young people on all the 13 placements are with &#147;real
families&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000431"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Good, that is reassuring and I look forward to
reading next year the York university evaluation of the system. It begs
the question whether we are introducing this too early&#151;can we
delay, will we delay or is it necessary to delay the implementation of
this aspect of the Bill until the York university study has been
completed?</div>
					<a name="0710244000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still
concerned about the multiplicity of Government agencies that will be
looking after the system. I now discover that the Department for
Children, Schools and Families will get its oar into this, as well as
local authorities and the Ministry of Justice and its subsidiaries,
such as the Youth Justice Board. There are far too many people running
the show. We need to have one agency co-ordinating the system and a
Minister of State driving it, because once the political drive and the
organisational coherence are lost, the thing begins to splinter and
people start empire building. It is we, the public, who lose out
because we, the public, are the ones who suffer from the reoffending.
The youngsters falling into the criminal justice system lose out as
well.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000436"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> We come now to consideration of the youth
rehabilitation order with fostering requirements, and what might be
suggested by such an order. The amendments are small and it might be
said that they state the obvious, in terms of the provisions, but they
also cover areas that are not explicit in the Bill. The present wording
of schedule 1 requires the court to be satisfied</div>
					<a name="0710244000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the behaviour which
constituted the offence was due to a significant extent to the
circumstances in which the offender was living,&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
					<a name="0710244000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the imposition of a fostering
requirement would assist in the offender&#146;s
rehabilitation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes
on to say that before any fostering requirement is made, the
court&#146;s assessment needs to be accompanied by consultation with
the offender&#146;s parents or guardians and consultation with the
local authority in which the court intends to place the offender with a
foster parent.</div>
					<a name="0710244000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
axiomatic in what Ministers have said about the orders that they would
be derived from a proper consultative process by all concerned. The
measure would not be imposed by a court out of the blue sky, but would
be the result of all the agencies involved with the care and future
management of the offender sharing the view that this is a disposal
that they would recommend. The courts will make the decision as to
whether it is an appropriate disposal, but other agencies must be
involved. There is no mention of that in the Bill but it is assumed
that that will be the case.</div>
					<a name="0710244000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 174 tries to
ensure that the court will have properly consulted with
children&#146;s services and the youth offending team before it
considers this fundamental, and as we know expensive and perhaps
difficult to effect, order. The court must be satisfied that it is the
right and proper disposal for that individual.</div>
					<a name="0710244000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may intend to
include that in sentencing and other guidelines to the court, but it is
important that the point is made. This is a culmination of a
consultative process rather than ex cathedra judgment by the court.
Quite apart from the interests of the criminal justice system, it is
fundamental to the child&#146;s
interests.</div>
					<a name="0710244000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 171 might be taken as a statement of the obvious. Again, it is an
important consideration that the court must take into account. It
touches on the point made in the context of the previous amendment by
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. It would be wrong to take
somebody out of an environment that may be conducive to them offending
or reoffending, only to place them in an environment which is no
better. We have already had assurances from the Minister about pilot
schemes, and I see no reason not to include the latter point made by
the hon. and learned Gentleman, although whether it can be rolled out
is a different matter from whether it should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>form part of the provision within the Bill. Even though a criminal
justice Bill arrives every few weeks, there is no reason not to use
this one to make the necessary amendments to the
law.</div>
					<a name="0710244000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the pilot schemes,
individuals were placed with foster families and not into
children&#146;s homes&#151;some of us have serious doubts as to
whether children&#146;s home accommodation could possibly provide the
stability and safe refuge that would be required. We must be satisfied
that the order would do the same. Amendment No. 171 states
that</div>
					<a name="0710244000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the imposition of a
fostering requirement would tend to improve the circumstances in which
the offender was living&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is modest wording for what we intend
to accomplish. It should very significantly improve the environment in
the context of the behaviour that constituted the
offence.</div>
					<a name="0710244000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0710244000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I just say
one thing in parenthesis? Is it correct to say
that</div>
					<a name="0710244000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the behaviour which
constituted the offence was due to a significant extent to the
circumstances&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0710244000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">rather
than that the circumstances contributed to the likelihood of the
offending behaviour? There is a difference. I would hate it if a clever
person were challenging this at some later stage and said, &#147;You
cannot possibly imply causality from the family environment with any
certainty.&#148; I ask the Minister not to respond now, but to ponder
whether there is any difficulty with the bald expression &#147;the
offence was due&#148;. Of course, the offence was due to the
behaviour of the individual and perhaps the circumstances in which he
or she found themselves on that day, having the opportunity to commit
the offence. It is not due to the environment, but the environment can
affect the propensity of an individual to commit an offence, which is
what we are dealing with through the intensive fostering arrangements.
That is an aside.</div>
					<a name="0710244000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two separate points to make, neither of which I intend to seek to
divide the Committee on. First, I should just like to gauge the
Minister&#146;s reaction to the orders arriving out of a genuinely
consultative process with all concerned with the individual&#146;s
welfare and management. I think that that is intended, but I want to
ensure that that is always so. Secondly, I want to ensure that the
placements are, as far as can possibly be arranged, to the benefit of
the individual and will not be allowed where a local authority has
failed to make proper provision&#151;if it is their responsibility to
do so&#151;and the different environment is no better than the one
from which the child was taken as a result of the rehabilitation
order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000437"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I sympathise with the intention
behind amendments Nos. 174 and 171. However, instead of &#147;after
considering advice&#148;, in amendment No. 174, I would prefer to use
the words &#147;after considering evidence&#148;, because a court
would be making decisions based on evidence rather than advice. Advice
might be useful&#151;opinion evidence is sometimes
permitted&#151;but I think that we want to know the facts before we
make a decision.</div>
					<a name="0710244000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s criticisms in relation to
paragraph 4(2)(a), under which the offence
is</div>
					<a name="0710244000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;due to a significant
extent to the circumstances in which the offender was
living&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>
					<a name="0710244000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to know about the
circumstances in which the offender was living, then we can draw our
own conclusions, based on the offence and those circumstances, about
whether there was a relationship between the two. Plenty of people live
or have been brought up in difficult circumstances and never commit a
crime in their lives and far too many people who have had privileged
lives none the less go on to commit offences. Equally, I suppose that
if the circumstances in which the offender was living affected the way
his mind was working or his morals, his understanding of right and
wrong or what was due to his actions and what was not, the court should
be informed. We want information given to the court on the basis of
which it can make a sensible
decision.</div>
					<a name="0710244000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not
have written the Bill as it has been drafted. Perhaps, when the
Minister takes the Bill back, in the gap between this Session and the
next, a different form of words can be produced. That is just a
suggestion. It is not something that I will go to the stake on, because
I suspect that when the courts are advised by advocates, or what used
to be called justices&#146; clerks, they will take a common sense
view of this issue.</div>
					<a name="0710244000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman said that he was doing no more than putting forward the
blindingly obvious; perhaps I am paraphrasing him inaccurately.
Amendment No. 171 is fairly close to being within that category. It is
tough being in opposition; it is even tougher being the third party in
opposition&#151;not that I intend to change his position in relation
to the two main
parties.</div>
					<a name="0710244000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000438"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The amendment was tabled in order to have the
debate that the hon. and learned Gentleman managed to have under the
previous group and to examine the circumstances in which a person could
be placed in foster care and whether that could include a local
government home placement rather than a foster
family.</div>
					<a name="0710244000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000439"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Now we are getting back to the meat of the
discussion. In paragraph 18 of schedule 1, which is married to the
paragraph that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to amend, sub-paragraph
(6)
states:</div>
					<a name="0710244000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
paragraph does not affect the power of a local authority to place with
a local authority foster parent an offender in respect of whom a local
authority residence requirement is
imposed.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that we discussed this issue with the Minister a moment ago when
debating the other group, but it is important that if the fostering
requirement is to work, the fosterer should be a human being or a human
family, not a local government institution. Otherwise, the whole point
is lost. The expression &#147;a local authority foster parent&#148;
may be well known in the social service and family court worlds. It may
be defined later in the Bill&#151;I should have checked&#151;but it
is important that paragraph 18(6) refers to human beings.</div>
					<a name="0710244000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only other
comment that I make in relation to paragraph 18 relates to
sub-paragraph (7). That requires the Secretary of State to certify that
there is a fostering family or a fostering system available in the area
of the local authority that is to place the offender. That brings me
back to the York university evaluation and the pilot scheme that the
Minister told us about not so long ago. The Bill, all being well, is
likely to complete its passage through Parliament some time after
Easter and will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>presumably receive Royal Assent in the early summer. However, as we
know, Bills do not come into force on the day of Royal Assent nowadays.
They come into force in various sections or at a date to be appointed
by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="0710244000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest gently
to the Government that the date to be appointed should be after the
evaluation of the York university pilot scheme because if this
system&#151;or this disposal, to use a hideous expression&#151;is
put on the statute book and made available to the courts before it is
ready, we will just get into a muddle. I would rather that we did this
slowly and sensibly than speedily and less sensibly, albeit that
Governments are often tempted to do and say things in order to get a
headline.</div>
					<a name="0710244000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000440"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough for the way in
which they have approached the amendments. I hope that I can give them
some comfort in relation to the objectives that they seek. I remind the
Committee again that we have had a long discussion on the question of
intensive fostering, and it is a primary requirement of intensive
fostering that the offending must be associated with the individual
offender&#146;s home environment. That is clearly set out in
paragraph 4(2) of schedule 1. I raise that point again because it is
important to recognise that the intensive fostering requirement states
that the behaviour that constituted the offence must have
been</div>
					<a name="0710244000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;due to a
significant extent to the circumstances in which the offender was
living&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
expect that the use of the order will be very limited and fully
anticipate that, before agreeing that the intensive fostering
requirement is necessary, those professionals and individuals involved
in assessing the individual will have undertaken a full assessment of
the individual and judged that their home is a contributory factor
towards the offending and</div>
					<a name="0710244000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the imposition of a fostering
requirement...would assist in the offender&#146;s
rehabilitation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the objectives that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome put in
amendment No. 174, of</div>
					<a name="0710244000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;considering advice from
children&#146;s services and the youth offending
team&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">and those of
amendment No. 171, will be implicit in the work that will go on to
prepare for the likely imposition of the order by a court. I fully
expect that, before recommending to the court that the fostering
requirement is appropriate, the youth offending team will have
undertaken a full assessment not only of the young offender and their
needs, but of the impact on the young offender&#146;s family, who are
equally part of the objective outcome of the order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not consider the amendment
to be necessary for the reasons that I have stated today regarding good
and appropriate practice and guidance for those who will study the
legislation. It will be essential that the individual organisations
that he has mentioned in his amendment are involved in the full
assessment of the order prior to it finally being made.</div>
					<a name="0710244000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The youth
offending teams are involved not simply because it is a good and
positive thing that they are or because I say that they should be. They
will be involved 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>because, under section 156 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, there is
already a requirement for a pre-sentence report, which the youth
offending team will have to prepare prior to any consideration of the
order by the court. I fully understand where the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough are
coming from, and simply say that I hope they will understand from my
perspective that those bases are covered and the encouragements that
they want to see are provided for in the 2003 Act. They are also
provided for by my encouragement of good practice in relation to
pre-sentence reports made prior to the exercise of the intensive
fostering order by a court. That will take place when the legislation
reaches the stature book in January
2008.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000441"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am extremely grateful to the
Minister for his response, which entirely satisfies me. The only
comment that I will make is that, when he mentioned the circumstances
in which the offender was living, he used the valuable phrase
&#147;contributory factor&#148;. I would be much happier if his
provision was so worded, so that the court had to be satisfied that the
circumstance in which the offender was living was a
&#147;contributory factor&#148; to a significant extent to the
behaviour that constituted the offence. That would satisfy my slight
quibble concerning the causality implicit in the current wording. I
will leave him to ponder that, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000444"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 22 to 24 make changes to the
bandings of the aggregate hours for which offenders may be required to
attend at an attendance centre. They will change the hours set out in
the Bill to those currently used by the youth courts, so effectively we
are not making any change. The Bill proposes a change but we are not
making it. The number of hours will be as they are now: a maximum of 12
hours for under-14s: between 12 and 24 hours for 14 to 15-year-olds;
and between 12 and 36 hours for 16 to 17-year-olds.</div>
					<a name="0710244000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had discussions since
the Bill was published with key stakeholders who agree that the
attendance hours should not be increased, particularly for the younger
age group, and we have accepted that. Essentially, the changes I am
making are neutral in their effect. Amendment No. 49 makes a small
textual correction. Amendments Nos. 50 to 53 make changes to schedule
5, which modifies the requirements of the youth rehabilitation order to
apply them to youth default orders. They change the hours that can be
offset against an outstanding fine in a similar way to the amendments
made to the hours in schedule 1. I hope that these are fairly
straightforward amendments. They should not be controversial. They are
small textual changes and I commend them to the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000445"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The Minister says that the amendments are small
textual changes: they are to some extent, but they have some
considerable effect. It was not quite clear from what he said how the
figures in the Bill got in there as opposed to the ones that he now
wants in. Presumably someone must have thought quite carefully about
how the Bill was constructed. Amendments Nos. 49 to 53 affect pages 150
and 151. I have lots of little read marks all over my copy of the Bill.
I am sure that the Minister is itching to tell us how it was
created.</div>
					<a name="0710244000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000446"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> It is probably a fair cop in the sense that this
was an error in the Bill that I am trying to rectify, following
consultation after its publication. The figures in the Bill should not
have been included. They should have been the figures in the amendments
that I have proposed. I am trying my best to make that clear. I am
taking this on the chin and doing it according to the
Committee&#146;s
will.</div>
					<a name="0710244000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000447"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The Minister has a very delicate chin and I do
not want it to come to too much harm. In a sense this is a small and
childish debating point. But that is not the point that I am trying to
get across to the Committee. My point is that when a Bill like this is
pulled together from all sorts of different places, and it deals with
all sorts of different things, errors of this nature will happen. In
the great scheme of things it is probably not very important that the
figure 18 was put in when it should have been 12 or whatever. Nor does
it very much matter that it says convict instead of conviction. I think
we all know what the draftsman was trying to do.</div>
					<a name="0710244000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an object lesson that
shows us that essentially the Bill should be deconstructed. There
should be a separate Bill for youth justice, a separate Bill for the
police stuff and a separate Bill for the immigration status stuff, and
so on. I know that it is convenient in some respects to lump everything
together on a great Christmas tree and then Ministers can come in
during the Committee stage or on Report or in the House of Lords and
just hang additional things on.</div>

the 1997 through to 2007 Parliament&#151;has seen hundreds of Bills
come forward. In the criminal justice field we have seen lots of these
funny Christmas tree Bills which give Ministers additional powers to do

on the proposal after listening to other advice, and they are restoring
the status quo. When they make a concession of this sort, we should not

in line with the Mental Health Act 2007. The amendments change the
wording in schedule 1 surrounding the mental health drug treatment and

in schedule 2, which deals with breached revocation and amendment to
youth rehabilitation orders.</div>
					<a name="0710244000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">An indication
of willingness to comply with treatment will be required, whatever the
age of the young offender and not simply for those aged 14 and over, as
the Bill provides. Guidance will deal with those who are of an age that
they cannot fully understand the implications of such a requirement. We
brought forward those changes because of the changes that I have
mentioned in the Mental Health Act 2007. They have been brought forward
in consultation with the Department of Health to ensure consistency of
approach. The Department of Health will separately provide detailed
guidance to medical practitioners on the issue of consent to treatment.
That is different from the matter of willingness to comply, which is
required before the court may impose a treatment requirement in a youth
rehabilitation order. I hope that the Committee will accept the
amendments to update the Bill, following the Mental Health Act. I

child consent to treatment, medical or otherwise, or express
willingness to receive it, without the agreement of his parent or
guardian? Obviously, if he cannot that may undermine the thrust of
these paragraphs of the schedule. If the Minister wishes to take advice
on that issue I do not expect him to answer the question now, but I
cast that fly across the water so that we can view it. I will also

have a double diagnosis. They could be mentally ill and could also have
a drug addiction. If is often difficult to distinguish what causes
which. Clearly, a court that was thinking about giving a mental health
treatment requirement would want to be satisfied before it did so that
the individual defendant in front of it could usefully attend
treatment. Obviously, it would not be able to second-guess the doctors,
but it would want to know that whatever treatment outlined would be
applied and have a beneficial effect. While not wishing to delay the
Committee with a debate about the Government&#146;s amendment, we
ought in fairness to the public whom we represent not pass over

willingness to comply with a term, but equally 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>the offender could refuse particular treatment if it were reasonable to
do so. The judgment on what is reasonable would be made in light of

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 120, in
schedule 1, page 95, line 42, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) A court
may not specify treatment falling within sub-paragraph (2)(a) in a
youth rehabilitation order unless it is satisfied, on the evidence of a
registered medical practitioner approved for the purposes of section 12
of the Mental Health Act 1983, that the medical condition of the
offender is such as requires treatment as a resident
patient.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0710244000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the mental health treatment requirement. As I
understand it, under paragraph 20(2) of schedule 1 the offender can be
required to be treated as a resident patient or as a non-resident
patient. The question is, what place will medical evidence play in the
decision to place an offender in either residential or non-residential
care? It appears from sub-paragraph (3) that the medical evidence used
in the decision making for a mental health treatment requirement does
not require the medical practitioner&#146;s view to be taken into
account on that question. Sub-paragraph (3) says that the court has to
be satisfied</div>
					<a name="0710244000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on the
evidence of a registered medical
practitioner&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">approved
under the Mental Health Act 1983, merely that the offender&#146;s
mental condition is</div>
					<a name="0710244000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
as requires and may be susceptible to treatment, but ... is not
such as to warrant the making of a hospital order&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>
					<a name="0710244000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face of it, it seems that
the choice between residential and non-residential is not a matter that
the mental health practitioner has any influence over. That seems to be
a gap in the way that the Bill works. It seems to me&#151;not as a
person with any qualifications in the area&#151;that this sounds more
like a medical matter than a legal matter that the court could come to
a conclusion about by
itself.</div>
					<a name="0710244000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, if
there is a non-medical element in this matter, it is a policy element.
Over the last few years, Government policy has been moving in the
direction of saying that mental health should be a matter more for care
in the community than for residential care. There is some dispute about
whether that is the right direction and I do not wish to get into that
debate. However, it seems to me that the right way to approach that
question as well is as a matter of medical evidence and not just as a
matter of
politics.</div>
					<a name="0710244000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
be a requirement in the Bill that the decision between residential and
non-residential treatment should be taken on the advice of a medical
practitioner. The underlying anxiety that prompts the amendment is that
it is very important that mental health is not seen as a way of
producing an alternative form of imprisonment. Mental health decisions
about residential or non-residential treatment should not be criminal
justice decisions. This is not an in or out decision, in the criminal
justice sense. It has to be seen, for the integrity of the mental
health practitioner, if for no other reason, as more of a medical than
a legal
decision.</div>

							<a name="0710244000478"></a>Mr.

hon. Member for Cambridge&#146;s remarks in support of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">A moment ago
we were discussing the willingness of a child or a minor to agree to
certain forms of treatment. I would like to ask the Minister to clarify
whether, in the event that a mental health treatment requirement is
thought to be appropriate by the magistrates or the court and there is
available hospital or non-residential space to carry out the treatment,
but the defendant refuses or is unwilling to comply, the only
alternative is to section the person and detain him compulsorily, or
will he be sent into
custody?</div>
					<a name="0710244000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
we have to anticipate people being unwilling and, therefore, what do we
do when they are unwilling, because the Government are building into
the system a requirement that they should be willing? Certainly, many
of the people whom I have had to sentence in 10 years as a recorder
have not always been very
willing.</div>
					<a name="0710244000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000479"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member
for Cambridge for tabling the amendment and I hope that I will be able
to deal with it to his satisfaction. It is very similar to the existing
provision under sub-paragraph (3) of the mental health treatment
requirement, which requires that the court be satisfied on the evidence
of a registered medical practitioner that the mental condition of the
young offender requires and is susceptible to treatment. The amendment
would require that the court seek similar satisfaction from the
evidence of a registered medical practitioner to support residential
treatment, in particular.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>
					<a name="0710244000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice a mental health
treatment requirement will be made by a court only if it has been
recommended by a registered medical practitioner and the court is
satisfied that a treatment place is available. Residential treatment,
similarly, will be ordered only if it is deemed appropriate by the
medical practitioner. I hope that I can reassure the Committee by
indicating that, as with many other orders before it today, the court
order treatment will be used only as a last resort and the requirement
can be added to the youth rehabilitation order only if a young
person&#146;s mental health is linked to their offending behaviour
and if they have failed to seek and receive
treatment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having

							<b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): When I sat on the
Mental Health Bill Committee a few months ago before the summer recess,
one of the concerns raised was that there are not enough places for
young people in mental health units specifically structured around the
needs of young
people.</div>
					<a name="0710244000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too
often young people end up in mental health wards populated by adults,
and that concern was expressed by all parties and by many of those
organisations coming to see us. What safeguards or guidance to
sentences does the Minister envisage incorporating in the legislation
to ensure that the type of residence will be taken into consideration?
It would be a disaster if a young child of 14 or 15 was placed in an
adult mental health ward, where they could be subjected to some
appalling acts of brutality. It would certainly not be in their
interests for them to be in that
environment.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. I
hope that, if he examines <i class="I">Hansard</i> for my earlier remarks, he
will see that I have tried to deal with that point. For the sake of
repetition, the mental health treatment requirement will be made by a
court only if it has been recommended by a registered medical
practitioner and if the court itself is satisfied that a treatment
place is available. I shall not determine today what that treatment
place is. Obviously, any court that is considering a mental health
treatment order would need to have background discussions with medical
practitioners to ensure that the placement was appropriate for the
individual.</div>

					<a name="0710244000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
if the court was considering residential treatment for an individual it
would have to be satisfied that a treatment place was available. Again,
the appropriateness of such treatment would be a matter for the court
to consider. There would be a medical report, a recommendation of a
placement and the security that that placement was available. I do not
want to delineate the details precisely because I cannot second-guess
what the court might wish to say. I hope that there are sufficient
safeguards to ensure that the court&#146;s consideration is dealt
with in an appropriate
way.</div>

Hanson:
						</b> The whole purpose of our discussions is to improve
the lives of those who have orders placed against them and to prevent
them from reoffending. If, as in this case, mental health issues are
related to the offending behaviour, the whole purpose of the order is
to ensure that those issues are dealt with in an appropriate way,
either by placement or in a residential setting. I cannot second guess
what happens down the line, but what I can say is that there will be a
medical assessment. The court will be aware of that and the individual
facing the order will have consideration given to their best needs.
Ultimately, the court will have to be satisfied that the reoffending
issue will be addressed by the placement. I hope that that offers some
satisfaction to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="0710244000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Member for Harborough asked what would happen if an
offender refused to comply with the court and whether they would then
be sectioned. Normal mental health legislation applies and if
sectioning is an appropriate course of action, that might be the case
for that individual. However, it would not be seen to be done simply in
sentencing terms. If the individual refused to comply with the order,
the court could consider alternative sentence options to help prevent
reoffending issues. If an individual met the criteria for statutory
sectioning under the Mental Health Act 2007, that could happen, but it
would not be linked under an order of the court because treatment
cannot be forced on an individual, and that is made clear in the
legislation. I hope that that helps to clarify the concerns of the hon.
Member for Cambridge, and that he will now withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0710244000484"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> I accept what the Minister
says. Most of the time, the court will be looking at the medical
practitioner&#146;s report, which will probably mention the issue of
residential or non-residential treatment. Most of the time, the system
will work in the way that the Minister said. I accept the
Minister&#146;s intention that that is how it should work. However, I
ask the Government to think about the problems of busy courts, busy
medical practitioners, reports that do not always cover all the issues
that perhaps they ought to cover, and magistrates and district judges
not fully understanding the law or the Government&#146;s policy
intentions. When a district judge or a magistrates clerk looks at the
statute&#151;that is where they go for guidance in a real
case&#151;it would be better if they could see what the Government
mean and how they intend the system to work in the statute itself. I am
happy with the Minister&#146;s assurance, but I ask the Government to
reconsider the wording of the schedule. I have no intention of dividing
the Committee although I may return to the matter should the Government
reconsider it and come to a conclusion that I do not fully agree with.
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000487"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The amendments have been suggested to me by the
Standing Committee for Youth Justice. They deal with the overall
proportionality of the order and the Minister will be aware from our
evidence sessions that this matter has caused concern in some
areas.</div>
					<a name="0710244000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having a wide
palette of disposals available to the court has obvious benefits,
especially when tailoring requirements to the individual before the
court. However, unless there is clear guidance, there is a risk that
the courts will tend towards a wider range of requirements within an
order than might have been the case were they assembling different
orders on a different statutory basis. If that happens, the risk is
that a young person or child might be faced with a long list of
requirements that they must meet in order to comply with the order. In
those cases a breach of the order and a further descent into criminal
sanctions becomes more likely, simply because of the person&#146;s
inability to cope with the range of sanctions that has been placed upon
them by the court.</div>
					<a name="0710244000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that will not happen. Evidence from the Magistrates
Association suggests that good sense from the magistrates bench plus
any future guidance that might be given would prevent that from
happening. However, it must be acknowledged that there is at least the
risk that a disproportionate outcome may arise from what is a perfectly
sound reasoning process in so far as it looks at each of the separate
provisions available within the rehabilitation order, and applies them
to the circumstances of the offender in question.</div>
					<a name="0710244000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could be
argued that there is already a requirement for broad proportionality
under section 148 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It is right that
that applies to the offence rather than the individual. Amendment No.
169 would ask the court to make an assessment of the emotional and
intellectual maturity of the individual before making an order, so that
it is in a position to decide whether the range of sanctions and
disposals that apply through the order is appropriate, not only to the
offence, in terms of condign punishment, but to the individual who is
before the
court.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000488"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> I hear the charge that the
hon. Gentleman is making. Is it not the case, however, in this area as
in many others, that we need to be careful of the issue of
over-legislating? There is a need to allow guidance to develop, and
indeed the Sentencing Guidelines Council will no doubt issue guidelines
in relation to these new sentencing options. Obviously, those
guidelines, as existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>guidelines do now, will seek to ensure that magistrates are consistent
in their approach to sentencing, and also take account of the points in
relation to the offender, balanced with the points in relation to the
offence.</div>
					<a name="0710244000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000489"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That is, generally speaking,
true. However, there are a number of provisions already in the schedule
that we are referring to&#151;part 3 of schedule 1&#151;about
factors that the court must take into account. What is missing from
those factors is the emotional and intellectual maturity of the
offender.</div>
					<a name="0710244000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure that it is over-proscriptive to say to the court, in statute, that
maturity is a factor that ought to be a consideration. It certainly
would not become a paramount consideration; it is only one of the
factors that would be taken into account. However, it would be useful
for the court to have evidence about that maturity.</div>
					<a name="0710244000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">This issue refers back to some
of the debates that we had earlier, about the enormous range of
maturity that is evident, particularly among young offenders where age
is very often not a clear determinant of the maturity of the offender
and their ability to understand the consequence either of the offence
or of being in breach of the order. Therefore, it seems to me that
maturity is a material consideration that the court ought to take into
account.</div>
					<a name="0710244000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
that the Minister will say that guidelines and advice to the bench are
the right way of approaching this subject. I would not take the matter
further if he were to say that guidance would be clearly set out.
However, it is important that an assurance is given that maturity is a
factor that must be taken into
account.</div>
					<a name="0710244000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
170 deals with welfare and well-being. Again, it deals with a
suggestion from the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. The standing
committee sought to make the point that one can provide for the welfare
and well-being of the child offender in a variety of ways, some of
which, under these orders, will be coercive and some of which will not
be coercive but will be part of the standard fare, as it were, of the
welfare services. It is important that the court does not confuse the
two in reaching its verdict and giving its sentence.</div>
					<a name="0710244000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is at least a fear that,
when a person who is perhaps living under chaotic circumstances and has
a multitude of problems in their life, the court may, with the best of
intentions, wish to deal with everything that is having an impact on
that young person&#146;s life rather than simply addressing those
issues that are part of the reason for the offending behaviour. It is
only the latter type of issue that the court should be concerned with;
the other issues are matters for the welfare services and other
agencies.</div>
					<a name="0710244000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that help is given, but it is not essential that it forms
part of a requirement on the young person through a rehabilitation
order, the breach of which would constitute grounds for further action
through the criminal justice system. That seems to me an important
distinction and one that, again, I hope can be made clear to courts in
the advice that they are given on sentencing. There is not a
requirement to ensure that absolutely every provision that could be
made in order to make that young person&#146;s life better is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>made, under threat of coercion through a sentence, and there are other
means of achieving that purpose. That is the principal purpose of
amendment No. 170 as a probing amendment. We seek assurances of the
sort that would ensure that the courts directed themselves properly to
the offending behaviour, rather than to the offender&#146;s general
welfare interests. I look forward to the Minister of State&#146;s
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000490"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I want briefly to make a
suggestion. I understand what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is
seeking. However, surely the simplest solution&#151;we could just
substitute it in part 3 of the schedule&#151;would be to insert a
requirement that no court should make an order without a pre-sentence
report. It could then be made a matter of guidance or practice, as I am
sure it already is, that all the things that we are concerned about
should be in that report.</div>
					<a name="0710244000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000491"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I was going to make that very
point. Before the courts make a youth rehabilitation order they will
already have a pre-sentence report that will cover all the factors that
have been mentioned. The youth offending team will undertake detailed
assessments of the offender, their needs, and their welfare. We should
also recall the purpose of the provisions, which is to help prevent
reoffending through the imposition of the order. Pre-sentence reports
are not the subject of legislation but will be available as a matter of
course before imposition of a youth rehabilitation order, and are
key.</div>
					<a name="0710244000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned that, when sentencing, the court must already
have regard to the young person&#146;s welfare. In particular, when a
court proposes making a youth rehabilitation order, the existing
provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will apply. The court will
therefore be required to consider whether a youth rehabilitation order
is the most suitable sentence.</div>
					<a name="0710244000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an example from the
main body of the Bill. Schedule 1, paragraph 27 indicates that there is
a need to have regard to family circumstances and to the likely effect
of such an order on those circumstances. To me, that indicates that the
welfare of the child and the impact on the family are crucial
considerations in considering whether to make an
order.</div>
					<a name="0710244000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000492"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The Minister of State partly makes my point by
referring to that provision. The fact that that will be specified in
statute as a consideration, but that the maturity of the offender is
not, is precisely the omission to which I seek to draw
attention.</div>
					<a name="0710244000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000493"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> In my defence, I refer to the point made by the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough to the effect that the
pre-sentence report will be a decider in the imposition of any youth
rehabilitation order. The court&#146;s main purpose is, and should
remain, the need to reduce reoffending. The factors that will be
considered in the round by the youth offending team will be generic to
the assessments, so that a holistic approach can be developed before
the court makes the appropriate sentence.</div>

							<a name="0710244000494"></a>Alun
Michael:
						</b> My right hon. Friend makes a
powerful point. It has always seemed to me that, if the court is to
look at the problems of offending, it must consider the individual
circumstances and take maturity into account. What we do not want to do
is allow the court to become confused by taking its mind off the
importance of reducing and preventing reoffending, the central point of
my right hon. Friend&#146;s
argument.</div>
					<a name="0710244000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000495"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his help
and support. I am sure that the Committee will examine aspects of the
order. For example, paragraph 28 of the schedule is entitled:</div>
					<a name="0710244000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Compatibility of
requirements, requirement to avoid conflict with religious beliefs,
etc.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0710244000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court is
required to ensure that the order is compatible with the
offender&#146;s religious beliefs and does not conflict with work,
education or the requirements of another youth rehabilitation order. I
appreciate where the hon. Gentleman is coming from, but within the
safeguards already in the Bill and in the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
and those provided by the need for a pre-sentence report, the welfare
of the child and the best interests of the young person are catered
for, so I ask him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0710244000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0710244000496"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am genuinely grateful to the Minister for setting
out the process. If no reference had been made to such matters in the
Bill, I would entirely accept his saying that they will be given proper
weight in the guidelines because the pre-sentence report would be
expected to cover all issues. However, because some aspects are dealt
with under paragraphs 27 and 28 in part 3 of the schedule to which the
right hon. Gentleman drew the Committee&#146;s attention emphasises
the fact that other issues are not. That begs the question why it was
thought proper to mention the offender&#146;s family circumstances,
which is part of the holistic approach and undoubtedly are matters that
should be taken into consideration, yet it is not thought important to
mention other factors such as those outlined in the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0710244000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more
that I think about it, the more I think that the alternative
formulation put forward by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough
would be entirely appropriate. The Bill draws attention to the
importance of the pre-sentence report in such a context because it is
crucial to the operation of the rehabilitation order. However, I am not
worried about matters as long as factors are taken into account
properly and by whatever means it is appropriate to do so. The Minister
may appreciate that the omission emphasises the fact that some areas
are included specifically in part 3 of the schedule. He has given us
some useful assurances of what will be written into guidance. On the
basis that no doubt we shall return to the such matters, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
