Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 25, in page 2, line 4, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) The Treasury, in making regulations under any of the functions transferred by subsection (1) above, shall ensure that payments of the tax credit are not made to individuals who have an income or to couples who have a joint income in excess of the income at which the higher rate of tax would be payable by an individual.'.&#151;[Mr. Pickles.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): If I many, before we move on&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. As I recall, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) was intervening on my contribution when we adjourned. I am sure that the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) would not want to prevent me from completing my point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, that is true, and I think that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton had finished intervening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The amendment is based on a point that I hold in common with Conservative Committee members: that we should not use tax credits to subsidise higher rate taxpayers. The lower income taper allows tax credit to extend far up the income scale. The role of tapers is an important part of the scheme and the Government have lowered the taper in good faith, believing that the change will create work incentives. What is the evidence for that? The lower taper clearly has an undesirable consequence, which the amendment attempts to tackle.
<P>
As far as I am aware, the only empirical work on the effects of the tax credit system suggests that the inducement to work will be marginal. However, if the Financial Secretary has other evidence, I would be happy to hear it. We do not need the tax credit to extend all the way up the income scale. The evidence that lower tapers are good incentive is not self-evident. Indeed, if it were, it would be easy to generate empirical research to prove it, but it is not provable or necessarily true.
<P>
Although the amendment might not be the best way to deal with the problem, the Minister should accept that we need to do something. We do not need to go so far up the income scale. The case for lower income tapers is at best unproven. I have reservations about the proposal because it creates discontinuity at the higher rate threshold. There must be a better way to deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb). I would hate to shut him up when he appears to be agreeing with us.
<P>
I want to reinforce the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar. (Mr. Pickles). When confronted with people who pay 40 per cent. tax and receive further help through the working families tax who credit, most normal people would find it odd and strange because they cannot understand the logic. In our sophisticated way, we consider how the taper works and the Government's problems with the current taper on family credit. We may understand why the taper goes so far up the income scale, but most normal people cannot understand why. That confusion was reinforced by provisions in last year's Budget. I would not induce the Financial Secretary to reveal what will be in this year's Budget, but let us indulge in a moment or two of thought about the potential.
<P>
Higher rate taxpayers who receive benefit will be taxed on child benefit. Child benefit is a tax credit that is paid in cash, so we are taming a tax relief. It would be interesting to know&#151;perhaps the Minister can take advice on this before she replies-the estimated cost of collecting the tax, on a purely hypothetical basis and without committing the Minister to the contents of the Budget. How much will it cost the Treasury and the Inland Revenue to collect the tax on on child benefit in the case of 40 per cent. taxpayers?
<P>
Will the Minister also take advice on how much it will cost to pay working families tax credit to families that pay 40 per cent. tax? It is sensible, sane and logical for that money to be churning over in the Inland Revenue? Are we not complicating the tax system unnecessarily and making it more expensive to collect, thereby costing all of us considerably more? Does it not complicate the taxation system, when one of the achievements of the Conservative Government in the past 18 years was simplification of the system?
<P>
Now, the Government are reimposing a range of complications to favour one group or another, but this measure is especially complex because the Government are taking money away from people with one hand and giving it back with the other. Most people will find that difficult to cope with when they see people on higher rate tax benefiting from the situation. That is a ludicrous and unnecessary complication. It also increases dependency on the state because, instead of receiving the full child benefit, which everyone takes for granted because it is a tax relief, more people higher up the income scale will become dependent on the state.
<P>
That contradicts the express purpose of the Bill, which is to try to get people back into work and become less dependent on the state. So there is a contradiction in the Bill that has not been resolved and the only way logically to resolve it is to ensure that the taper ends at the point at which people pay 40 per cent. tax. Therefore, I support the amendment, which would ensure that higher rate taxpayers do not suffer from the churning involved, and do not become more dependent on the state merely because of the Government's desire to lessen the taper.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Barbara Roche): I shall resist the opportunity to call amendment No. 25 the von Trapp family amendment, but simple concern for the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar forces me to say this; I have resisted his attack on Whips, and I have resisted rising to his attack on the Revenue, but his attack on Julie Andrews is a step too far. I tried to save the hon. Gentleman from himself, but clearly he is an even braver man than you or I give him credit for, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not think I would refer to myself as a brave man.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I was referring to the hon. Gentleman, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Even if I were minded to agree with the basic premise behind the amendment, which I am not, the amendment simply would not work. First, it refers to the Treasury making regulations about the administration of the tax credit scheme and the functions transferred to it.
<P>
Secondly, the amendment appears to involve limiting the opportunity to pay applicants the working families tax credit, which implies that everyone above the higher rate threshold would be entitled to an award, although it could not be paid. That is a rather peculiar way to tackle the problem.
<P>
Thirdly, a close examination of the amendment's effects suggests that the Opposition would want to link the award, which is based on a snapshot of current circumstances, to a ceiling that can be set only by reference to certain circumstances, including, for example, the applicant's tax allowances, which cannot be finally known until after the end of the tax year. Would payment need to be held back until the figure could finally be worked out&#151;that is, after the end of the tax year and after the applicant's tax return has been submitted?
<P>
Fourthly, the limit that the Opposition would use does not involve a single set figure. It would differ from person to person, depending on several factors. There is no single higher rate limit that can be used in the way in which the Opposition envisage, especially in relation to couples.
<P>
The amendment would not work. Moreover, we do not want to introduce the cliff edge that the Opposition's scheme would inevitably involve. The Opposition might be concerned about money going to those on higher incomes, but a combination of the rates threshold and the taper will deal with that. The tax credit will spread further up the income scale, especially when a family has more than two children and is paying for child care. However, it will tailor the amount that is available to that family's circumstances, and the threshold and the taper will ensure that the amount that the family receives gradually reduces as its members earn more. That avoids putting the family in the position in which it is no longer an advantage to earn more.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), who has considerable expertise in this area, made some interesting points, but he appeared to be saying that high marginal rates do not act as a disincentive to work. However, a consensus runs across the party political spectrum in the House that states that such rates do act as a disincentive to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I would not dream of saying that very high marginal rates act as a disincentive, but the Government's view seems to involve saying, ``The 90-odd per cent. figure is a clear disincentive, so we'll get rid of that, but we'll whack lots of people on to the 60-odd per cent. level.'' Is the Minister saying that the 90-odd per cent. figure is clearly a disincentive and that having more people on the 60-odd per cent. level is a net gain? What evidence does the hon. Lady have?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I hope he appreciates mine, which he has to answer. At the end of the day, this a matter of judgment and it is our judgment that we have framed the provisions correctly.
<P>
The amendment would not work. We do not want the effects that it would involve to be imported into the tax credits system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar):</B> Perhaps in the excitement of hearing my views on Rodgers and Hammerstein it escaped the Financial Secretary's attention that this is a probing amendment. What is the Government's justification for giving people on very high salaries the working families tax credit? We want a justification. We know that the amendment will not work. It has been tabled simply to discover why the Minister wants to take dependency further up the socio-economic ladder.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but if he tables an amendment to be included in a Bill, he must expect it to be closely scrutinised.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar laughs, but the amendment that he and his hon. Friends have tabled is clearly unworkable and does not make sense. It is my duty to point that out to him. However, I understand why he tabled it.
<P>
A number of conditions must be taken into account when we consider where and how the entitlement comes about. If people fulfil those conditions because they have a large number of children and their family circumstances are tailored, why should they not gain the advantage of the working families tax credit? I return to the fact that Labour Members believe that the value and dignity of work are all-important. We do not seek to draw the unjustifiable lines that the hon. Gentleman seeks to draw. We want to provide working families with an opportunity to gain advantage from the proposed tax credit in the context of work.
<P>
The amendment would not work and would certainly not have a desirable effect&#151;in fact, the contrary. If Opposition Members will not seek to withdraw it, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We tabled this probing amendment because we wanted to know why it was desirable to put the working families tax credit higher on the economic scale than the current credit. The Government's view on the amendment seems to by, ``Why not?'' There does not seem to be any logic in it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon was persuasive when he said in answer to this and earlier arguments, particularly on Second Reading, that the money is simply being dissipated further up the economic scale. Therefore, I am happy for this to be called the von Trapp amendment, because there is a song in the film about going up the scale. I think that what is happening here will be remembered as moving up the economic as well as the musical scale.
<P>
However, it was a probing amendment, because we thought there was some logic behind the Government's proposal. On the clear understanding that there is no logic behind it, but it is simply a side effect of the policy, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 5, leave out `(5)' and insert `(4)'.
<P>
This technical amendment simply corrects a typo, to help the Government. We are here as their friends.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I rise to thank the hon. Gentleman very much for pointing out the printing error in the Bill. We had intended to amend it in the reprint. I shall now delight the hon. Gentleman by saying that we shall accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is a golden day in my career. I thank the Minister most sincerely.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 22, leave out from `to' to end of line 23 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief in speaking to the amendment, which relates to the use in the Bill generally, and in clause 3 in particular, of negative resolution statutory instruments. Such statutory instruments are being used increasingly by the Government. In the Finance Bill, the Government made colossal use of negative resolution statutory instruments, so much so that a practitioner from Price Waterhouse said that we were encroaching on constitutional matters in the use of such legislation. Although the statutory instrument provided for in clause 3 will not be of the same importance as some of the statutory instruments provided for in the Finance Bill, it is nevertheless a concern if the negative resolution procedure is being used increasingly in secondary legislation.
<P>
The amendment would change the statutory instrument referred to in clause 3(5) from one that requires a negative resolution to one that requires an affirmative resolution. I note that I have not seen any statutory instruments, in draft or otherwise, that relate to the clause. In reply to the debate, will the Minister say when the Government intend to publish statutory instruments under this subsection, if indeed they intend to do so?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall be brief but I want to support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb). I share his concern that use of the negative resolution procedure means that matters that are quite controversial, especially when contained in regulations rather than being included in brief form in the Bill, will not be open to the scrutiny that they require. It would be valuable to have the opportunity to debate the regulations because only as their details become available, can the Opposition, Government supporters and outside organisations understand the actual impact of the measures on people's incomes and behaviour patterns.
<P>
It is important for us to debate the regulations, especially the more important ones, so that they are not implemented without debate, leaving us to pick up the pieces in our surgeries and return to amend Bills when the measures do not work. It would be helpful if the democratically elected representatives were able to debate the issues before they hit the pockets and purses of the people outside who will be the victims of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is amazing to see the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton assuming the role of champion of the constitution. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong with the Opposition. They need a working definition not only of the word that I must not mention, which is not an Anglo-Saxon word, but of the word, ``irony''. It is odd to see the hon. Gentleman posing as the champion of the constitution, because he has obviously forgotten completely the previous Administration's record on that subject. I am also surprised because I seem to remember that, last Tuesday, he told Committee members that he had not read the Bill. If he has read it, he certainly has not understood it.
<P>
The amendment seeks to ensure that the statutory instrument providing for transfer of staff in the Northern Ireland civil service should be subject to affirmative resolution. Clause 3 will provide for the transfer of staff in the Northern Ireland civil service to the home civil service. The staff who administer family credit and disability working allowance in Northern Ireland are employed by the social security agency of the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, which is part of the Northern Ireland civil service. They are not part of the home civil service, which can transfer staff without the need for legislation.
<P>
The transfer of staff in Belfast who currently administer family credit will need to be made by Order in Council. Clause 3 provides for the transfer by Order in Council through statutory instrument, which will be made by negative procedure. The clause sets out in a straightforward way the procedure that will bring about the smooth transfer of staff.
<P>
On any reading of the clause, it is an administrative measure that is necessary only because the staff belong to a separate part of the civil service. The amendment seeks to prolong the procedure by obliging Parliament to vote on the matter. I have looked at the issue carefully and, as far as I am aware, it is not controversial. The process mirrors the provision in the transfer of functions legislation for the merger of the Contributions Agency with the Inland Revenue.
<P>
The amendment&#151;I say this more in sorrow than anger&#151;is therefore totally unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have second thoughts about it. If not, I urge my hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Financial Secretary knows full well that I have read the Bill; the worry that I expressed last Tuesday was that Labour Members clearly had not. When I asked the hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) to say, in her intervention, whether she had read the Bill, she declined to answer. In my view, that constituted an admission that she had not. I suspect that some Labour Members of the Committee have still not read the Bill, despite having had a weekend in which to do so.
<P>
The Financial Secretary failed to say why the statutory instrument should not be subject to affirmative resolution. I therefore urge Opposition Members to vote to insist on affirmative resolution of the statutory instrument in the clause, as in all other clauses where negative resolutions are used.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 3, line 12, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(8) The accounting conventions published by the Office for National Statistics in `UK National Accounts: Concept Sources and Materials', in respect of the accounting treatment of tax credits shall apply to the tax credits.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to enshrine in the Bill the way in which the tax credits will be accounted for and presented in the Government's Green, Red and Blue Books.
<P>
We have seen on many occasions how the Government have manipulated the presentation not only of the tax credit but of many other items in the Red and Green Books. For that reason, Opposition Members now feel that it is necessary to begin to enshrine in legislation how such measures should be presented in the accounts, so that the numbers are presented fairly and transparently.
<P>
In July last year, the tax credit was excluded from social security expenditure in the comprehensive spending review. It was hidden away on page 16 of the review, Cm 4011, under an obscure line in table 2, ``Annually Managed Expenditure''. The line ``Accounting and other adjustments'' will increase from &#163;13.4 billion in 1998-99 to &#163;20 billion by 2001-02. Probing through parly Questions revealed that the tax credit expenditure was included in that line rather than in the line on social security benefits. It included the element paid in the pay packet over and above the reduction in tax. It also includes direct payments to the recipient. The amendment would avoid that.
<P>
The amendment mentions the publication, ``UK National Accounts: Concept Resources and Methods'' produced by the Office for National Statistics. Paragraphs 21.69-71 refer to the distinction between tax credits and how we should account for them. The gist of the principle is that where a tax credit is merely a benefit paid through the tax system and not part and parcel of that tax system, it should not be taken out of negative taxation. The ONS insists that if an allowance or genuine tax credit results in a taxpayer paying less tax to the Exchequer, there is a case for regarding that expenditure as negative income tax. Instead of recording it as income tax in and expenditure out, it is recorded as less income tax received.
<P>
Personal tax allowances are treated in the same way. They are not regarded as public expenditure, but they do reduce the amount of tax that we pay. They are accounted for by the Treasury in how much tax is raised. Because of personal tax allowances, the Treasury raises that must less income tax. But a tax credit is ambiguous. For example, mortgage tax relief allows us to pay less money to a building society. That could be construed in two ways: either as a subsidy paid to building societies by the Government, which makes it part of public expenditure, or as a mortgage holder paying less income tax to the Government by virtue of having a mortgage.
<P>
The ONS decided to set down clear guidelines. It said that, if a tax allowance is to be treated as negative taxation, it must meet three criteria: first, that the benefits to the individual taxpayer do not exceed the amount of tax paid by that individual; secondly, that the tax allowance is made as a matter of economic policy; and thirdly, that the allowance is an integral part of the tax system. To determine whether a tax credit is an integral part of the tax system, we must see whether the refund or allowance can be calculated independently of the procedure for calculating an individual's tax payable, for which we should use different criteria. The ONS went on to say that the refund or allowance should not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``depend on the actual amount of tax to be paid, or the marginal rate of tax''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that it should not be construed as part of the tax system.
<P>
Tax relief on mortgages was available at all rates of tax, but that has been reduced over the years to just 15 per cent. It could be argued, however, that because the level of mortgage tax relief would depend on a taxpayer's marginal tax rates, that would be a genuine tax credit. Therefore, any loss of revenue caused by that measure could be account for as lost revenue rather than public expenditure.
<P>
Where the same benefit is given to taxpayers by way of tax allowances and to non-taxpayers by way of cash benefits&#151;as with WFTC&#151;the ONS is clear that the availability of the rebate to non-taxpayers is usually a strong indicator that it is not negative taxation. The ONS believes that WFTC should not be regarded as negative taxation.
<P>
Between publishing the comprehensive spending review in July and the ``Pre-Budget Report'' in November, the Government changed the accounting procedure. They accepted that the tax credit should be construed as public expenditure. The Library briefing says that the effect of the change in accounting is to add &#163;2.7 billion to total managed expenditure in 1997-98.
<P>
That is largely the result of private health insurance premiums, residual life assurance premium relief and, on a smaller scale, mortgage tax relief. But by 2000-2001, when WFTC will feed through, the effect of the change will be about &#163;2.5 billion to &#163;2.75 billion.
<P>
The Government have accepted that the tax credit should be regarded as part of public expenditure and not hidden away in ``Accounting and other adjustments'' because it has become regarded as tax forgone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow, as he has made a convincing argument on this point. We discussed whether lone parents should receive the money directly or through the pay packet this morning. A direct payment to someone would count as a social security benefit, whether or not it is called a tax credit, and is therefore public expenditure. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has been rumbled by the Government's demand that lone parents receive the credit through the pay packet, as that is the only pretence on which it can be regarded as negative expenditure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. That was a principal motivation in the past, but the Office for National Statistics has laid down guidelines that&#151;if incorporated into legislation&#151;would make it impossible not to regard the whole amount as public expenditure. If I am wrong on that point, I am sure that the Financial Secretary will correct me.
<P>
The Government are still being sneaky in their treatment of revenue. In the March 1998 Red Book and the Comprehensive spending review, they accounted for the tax credit in the tax receipts line of a table that determines the proportion of gross domestic product taken in tax. They took it all out, not just the element of the tax credit relating to tax credits paid through the payroll. If a recipient receives the working families tax credit through the payroll and the working families tax credit is insufficient to wipe out totally the income tax of that recipient, that element could be regarded as tax forgone. However, the Office for National Statistics has stated that where it is paid to taxpayers and recipients not paying income tax, none of it should be regarded as tax forgone. But in table B9 of the ``Pre-Budget Report''&#151;Cm 4076&#151;which was published in November 1998, the Government take out the element representing the working families tax credit. As a result, the proportion of gross domestic product is lower than it would otherwise be. But that figure was used by the Government to recalculate all of the historical payrolls at the back of the report. It will no doubt also be used by the Government to try to demonstrate that they have not raised taxes, or that they have raised them less significantly than is the reality.
<P>
The main bold sub-heading, ``Net taxes and social security contributions'', does not include working families tax credit. The next line down, ``Other receipts and accounting adjustments''&#151;with which the Government have made us familiar&#151;reinserts the figure. The figure at the bottom of the table therefore fits in with the rest of the figures in the Green Book. But it is the figure without the working families tax credit that will be focused on and used in the historical tables.
<P>
Opposition Members are worried that the Government are using, or has tried to use, the working families tax credit to manipulate accounts. That should not happen. The amendment would ensure that the recommendations of the Office for National Statistics, which the Government can abide by or ignore&#151;such organisations are merely advisory&#151;are incorporated into the law.
<P>
The Social Security Committee is also worried about this matter. In document HC 29, it recommended that separate lines be provided for working families tax credit and disabled person's tax credit in the reporting of tax receipts. I note that that has now been introduced in the Green Book. It is a welcome addition, which helps to increase transparency and clarity in the Government's accounting. On that note, I end my comments by saying that I hope that the Financial Secretary will take on board those serious points. If she cannot accept the amendment, perhaps she will state that there will be no more manipulating of the figures in the books and records on which people rely to assess not only the Government's performance but how the economy is functioning. The figures matter, not just for judging the Government, but for judging the level of public expenditure, which has a direct impact on the economic activity of the country.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall try to reassure the Committee. The comments of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) have no basis. The Government's approach to accounting for the tax credit entirely accords with the rules laid down by the independent Office for National Statistics. There is no need for a specific clause legislating on the treatment of the working families tax credit within national accounts. I assure the Committee that the Government are not trying to hide the cost of the working families tax credit or to carry out an accounting fiddle.
<P>
In line with the rules of the Office for National Statistics under the European system of accounts, the cost of the working families tax credit is included in the presentation of the national accounts public expenditure aggregate&#151;``Total Managed Expenditure''. The cost is shown under ``Annually Managed Expenditure'' in the ``Accounting and other adjustments'' line. A full breakdown of the ``Accounting and other adjustments'' is presented annually in the ``Public Expenditure and Statistical Analyses'', which is published in March or April, along with the main estimates and departmental reports. That is a clear statement from the Government and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Financial Secretary explain why the expenditure should not be included in the social security line of the public accounts? We are discussing social security expenditure. It is a benefit paid and calculated on the same basis as family credit, but with different tapers and different figures at which the tapers start to apply. Some of it is paid through the payroll, but, in essence, it is family credit delivered by a different method and with slightly more generous tapers. Surely the expenditure on that credit should be accounted for as social security spending. Why does the Financial Secretary insist on accounting for the expenditure in, as she said, the obscure line of ``Other receipts and accounting adjustments''? That does not make sense.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am disappointed and surprised. The hon. Gentleman moved his amendment, which I took to be a probing amendment asking me to give some assurances on Government accounting, which I have done. He then responded by returning to the question raised on Second Reading, which divides the Committee. He does not seem to have appreciated that we are discussing a tax credit and a Treasury Bill, not a social security Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Therein lies the reason for the need to incorporate the ONS recommendations into statute. The ONS states clearly that the working families tax credit is not a tax credit but should be accounted for as public expenditure. The Financial Secretary said that it will be included in the global total for public expenditure. She accepts that it is public expenditure, but then she says that it is not social security public expenditure. If it is not social security public expenditure, what is it? Is it agriculture expenditure, or perhaps defence expenditure? It is ``Accounting and other adjustments'' public expenditure. That is not right. Either it is a tax credit, in which case the ONS is wrong, and it should be included under negative tax receipts, or it is public expenditure, in which case it is social security public expenditure. The Financial Secretary's answer is, therefore, totally unacceptable.
<P>
I shall press the amendment to a vote and I hope that my hon. Friends will support the amendment.

<H4><center>Payment of Tax Credit by Employers etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``except that any costs borne by the employer in pursuance of this obligation shall be refunded by the Board''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 44, in page 3, line 17, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(1A) The Board shall make regulations to provide that the funding by the Board of tax credit paid by employers shall, at the election of the employer and in so far as the employer's liability to the Board allows, be by way of set off against the employer's liability to the Board.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendments Nos. 10 and 44 would have slightly different effects. Amendment No. 10 would transfer the costs of administering the burden of the WFTC from the employer to the Inland Revenue, whereas amendment No. 44 states that the board ``shall'' make regulations to allow the employer to set off the funds that he has to pay on the WFTC against what he receives under PAYE, national insurance and student loan repayments. That amendment differs from clause 5(2)(d), which states that the Treasury ``may'' make regulations to allow those funds to be set off. We believe that the Bill should use the word ``shall'' rather than the word ``may''.
<P>
On amendment No. 10, the administration of the WFTC will place a considerable burden on many employees. That is why the CBI expressed concern about the administration of the WFTC and fears that the obligations on employers will increase considerably. I want to return to the burdens on business when we discuss amendment No. 31, which is about smaller employers, on whom a higher burden is imposed than generally, or on large employers. As a starting point, the amendment would transfer the administration costs of all employers to the Revenue. If the Government cannot accept that, we shall debate whether they will accept it for small employers.
<P>
The draft regulatory impact assessment makes horrifying reading. Paragraph 30 lists the additional work for employers that is ``likely to arise'' and it will arise in four main areas. First, employers will have to provide information about their employees' applications. Secondly, they will have to make the necessary changes to their payroll. That could mean a significant amount of work, involving changes to computerised payroll systems, which will involve a great deal of expense. Thirdly, they may have to apply to the Inland Revenue for funding if they believe that they will pay out more in working families tax credit in a pay period than they will receive in income tax and national insurance. Fourthly, they will all suffer from a reduction in the cash flow benefit that they have at present as a result of deducting PAYE and national insurance from their employees' pay before handing it over to the Revenue 19 days later.
<P>
When we look at the draft Tax Credits (Payment by Employers) Regulations, the horror becomes worse, as we realise the burden that is imposed on employers. The details are set out copiously in regulation 5. They require employers to calculate the tax credits for any pay period, based on the daily rate applied by the Inland Revenue to the employer, and add that amount to net pay. Secondly, they must enter that amount on the employee's payslip and record the total tax credits. They must enter the total tax credits paid in the year for those employees on two Inland Revenue forms, P14 and P60. They must enter the total credits for all employees on the P35 form from the Inland Revenue, together with the total amount of Inland Revenue funding in that year. Finally, they must produce certificates of payments for leavers. As we saw, during a trade dispute a similar certificate must be supplied by the Inland Revenue for employees who do not receive a pay packet during that period.
<P>
Clearly employers will suffer an enormous burden in administering the working families tax credit. The regulatory impact assessment calculates that the recurring compliance costs of the tax credit will be about &#163;103 million a year, with an additional one-off, set-up cost of &#163;43 million. That, in anyone's opinion, is a large sum of money, which is in addition to the existing burdens on employers, and most regulatory impact assessments tend to underestimate the real cost to employers.
<P>
Therefore, significant sums of money are involved. Given that the Government have imposed that burden on business, they should pick up the tab. By passing it on to employers, the Government are effectively taxing them to the tune of &#163;146 million and then spending that amount on administration. To avoid that, the Government should absorb these costs instead of imposing them on employers. When we debate amendment No. 31, we shall return to the significant hardship that small employers will face, but for the moment I shall rest my case on the general issue of the burden to employers and urge the Government to respond to my concerns and accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): I rise in support of my hon. Friend to make two additional points on the amendment, both of which relate to timing.
<P>
First, we are considering the amendments at a time when, according to the latest figures, manufacturing output in this country is experiencing its worst period for about 18 years. The Confederation of British Industry is extremely gloomy about the economic outlook and, without the amendments, we will impose further unnecessary burdens on employers. The last thing that the manufacturing, agricultural and, arguably, other sectors need is central Government imposing further burdens.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My second point relates to timing. If the costs are to be incurred by employers, one should note that subsection (4) provides that clause 5 will come into force on 6 April 2000. That is about 90 days after many employers will have to cope with the impact of the millennium bug. Further onerous changes in regulations and responsibilities are the last thing that the House should introduce at a time when employers are coping with economic difficulty and, possibly, complications relating to their existing computer and payroll systems. Therefore, I strongly support the argument so eloquently advanced by my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to make a couple of brief points. This use of employers constitutes a major difference to what they have been used to. It will require them to set up different systems and, possibly, different bank accounts to ensure that payment is made. As I said in relation to another clause, the payment of tax credits by employers differs fundamentally from the collection of tax by deduction from the same employees. For example, the Revenue will, in principle, be in a position to know exactly how much each employer should pay to each employee during each pay period, but with tax credits, it cannot know exactly what deliberations it will be involved in with regard to pay. There will be certainty with regard to the tax credit, but not to pay and its interaction.
<P>
My main concern is that, unless we get this provision right, it will make the Government's intentions even more unworkable because it will actively encourage firms, especially small firms, to differentiate between people who look like prospective tax credit claimants and those who do not. The Government could point to the protection offered by schedule 3, but that protection will be difficult to enforce. Therefore, people will be told that they are self-employed and that they must take care of their own tax arrangements.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): The hon. Gentleman suggested that employers might discriminate against potential working families tax credit claimants. Will he tell the Committee what a working families tax credit claimant looks like?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That point is also made by TaxAid, an organisation that helps small firms. As a matter of common sense, most employers, presented with two applicants at interview, would be able to work out whether either applicant looked like a prospective tax credit claimant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> In support of my hon. Friend's argument that the case advanced by TaxAid should be given serious consideration, does he agree that it is notable that TaxAid's letterhead refers to Lord Barnett, whom I seem to recall was the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the previous Labour Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes, although I am sure that my hon. Friends accept that TaxAid does not have a particular political axe to grind. It is fine to ask in Committee, ``What will prospective claimants look like? Will they wear a scarf, and what sort of jumper?'' However, that is not my point. We are supposed to be embarking on a radical change that will offer greater help than is currently available under family credit, but it would be ironic if that system closed doors on the people who wanted to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> There might be uncertainty about whether someone was a tax credit recipient, but does the hon. Gentleman accept that many of the people involved are towards the bottom of the labour market and may be on contracts? They may be able to get an initial contract, based on ignorance of their status, but when the contract is due for renewal after six months, the position will be obvious&#151;the employer will know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;he anticipates the point that I was about to make.
<P>
The amendment should be examined in conjunction with schedule 3, in which the Government clearly state their intention that it should not be lawful to act in a prejudicial way against someone who is on WFTC. The provisions are difficult to enforce and the people who go for low-paid jobs tend to feel intimidated by an employer. If they failed to get a job they might say, ``I do not think I got the job because I was on WFTC. Someone else got the job who I'm sure is not collecting it.'' However, having that suspicion is a long way short of proving it.
<P>
The amendment would reduce the burden on firms&#151;we shall discuss small firms presently&#151;and thereby remove the prejudices that would otherwise operate against people who we want to get into jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I support the amendment. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that the regulatory assessment shows that after the initial start-up costs of &#163;40 million, businesses will pay &#163;100 million each year, and the amendment states that that cost should be borne by the board.
<P>
The only argument against the board's bearing that cost is the suggestion that businesses will benefit from the tax credit. The regulatory impact assessment lists three possible benefits that the tax credits might have for businesses, and they might constitute reasons why businesses might not expect all of their costs to be covered. The first is that the arrangement is likely to reduce staff turnover. If businesses had an extra &#163;100 million, they could do an awful lot to reduce staff turnover, and use the money in much more sensible ways than simply spending it on administration and payroll clerks. If staff turnover is the concern, the money would be better spent by the firms and not on administration.
<P>
The other arguments that suggest that businesses might benefit from the system and should therefore pay for it are that the arrangement would remove obstacles to work&#151;or returns to work&#151;and that it would improve labour supply. As far as I can see, those two suggestions involve broadly the same point. In general, firms have access to a greater pool of labour because of, for instance, returns to work. However, the Paymaster General failed to give any evidence for that claim. The only empirical evidence of which we are aware is the study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which was published by the Bank of England, which gave the 40,000 figure. I have trouble with noughts in this context, but comparing that figure with the &#163;100 million does not seem to be a good bargain.
<P>
Firms will not get a substantial benefit from the tax credit, except&#151;possibly&#151;the opportunity to depress wages, which will probably happen but which the Government will probably not want to shout about. For both of these reasons, companies will incur all of the scheme's costs but few of the obvious benefits, and for that reason I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Although our debate on this matter has not been long, it has been reasonably far reaching.
<P>
The tax system does not provide, and has never provided, a direct subsidy or compensation to employers who fulfil their tax obligations. This is a Treasury Bill. Employers are not reimbursed for operating the PAYE system. I see no reason why the payment of tax credits should be treated differently. Opposition Members had the opportunity to do something when they were in office, but, of course, they did not.
<P>
When tax credits are paid through the pay packet, employers will be able to set off the amounts paid against their PAYE and national insurance contributions liabilities and, if necessary, against student loan repayments deducted from their employees' pay. If the tax credits to be paid are expected to exceed all those deductions, employers will be able to apply to the Inland Revenue for funding. They will be able to do that in advance of paying the tax credits, so they will not be out of pocket.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> As the Financial Secretary will recall, I tried to estimate how many firms will have to make advance claims. What is her estimate of that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It will depend on the circumstances of the individual company. I repeat, if tax credits to be paid are expected to exceed the deductions, employers will be able to apply to the Inland Revenue for funding in advance of paying the tax credit. They will not be out of pocket.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked how that will benefit the employer. The benefit is that there will be an immediate connection with the world of work. I strongly believe that the arrangements will greatly help people to identify with a company and that they will improve productivity and employee retention. I do not deny that employers will face some extra work in connection with paying tax credits through the pay packet, and of course that will involve some costs, but as we have repeatedly stressed, we are determined to keep the extra costs to a minimum. That is why my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has been consulting, and will continue to consult, representatives of employers and payroll system providers on details of the scheme.
<P>
The compliance costs to employers of paying tax credits will vary according to the payroll system used and other factors. Those costs must be seen in the context of the many measures that this Government have introduced to help businesses, especially smaller businesses. I wish that Opposition Members would stop talking down our economy. I am frequently told by business men and women around the country that they are dismayed when they discuss this matter with representatives of the Opposition parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Of course I accept that no one should hope that the British economy does anything other than spectacularly well, but does the Financial Secretary deny that manufacturing output figures published earlier this week were the grimmest for 18 years?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I will not use again the word that dare not speak its name, but it is a cheek for a member of the party that caused the loss of so many manufacturing jobs to say that. What have we done? If one looks at the rate of corporation tax for small companies, at first year capital allowances, and changes to the national insurance system, one will see that this is an incredibly business-friendly Government. Indeed, employers' organisations have welcomed the transfer of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue and the planned transfer of national insurance policy to the Revenue.
<P>
I would take the protestations of Opposition Members rather more seriously had they not voted as they did last night. Employers throughout the country will look at that vote with dismay.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I can guarantee that the one thing that boardrooms, shops and small businesses throughout the United Kingdom are not discussing is the transfer of the Contributions Agency.
<P>
I understand why the Financial Secretary wants to pad this out, but we are worried that the measure, which will be burdensome to business, will actively discourage businesses, particularly small businesses, from employing people who are likely to be beneficiaries of the working families tax credit. Can she explain why she believes that that burden will encourage businesses to employ such people?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It always pains me to disagree with or correct the hon. Gentleman, but the measures that were discussed last night in respect of the Contributions Agency were of great significance to businesses.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, we should debate small businesses, and we intend to do so during consideration of the next group of amendments. In my experience, the overwhelming consideration of small businesses&#151;and, indeed, of any business&#151;when taking on staff is the suitability of the prospective employee to do the job. That is the factor to which any business that has regard for its bottom line will look.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sure that the Financial Secretary is right to say that the primary concern of any business is a prospective employee's suitability for the job. However, we contend that, where one of two applicants of similar abilities receives the working families tax credit and the other does not, the employer will plump for the latter.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have let this debate range fairly widely, because the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who moved the amendment, felt the need to put it into the correct context. I accept that, and the Financial Secretary has simply replied to the points that were made. However, the amendment is narrowly drawn and we should therefore return to the substance of the amendment. Although the points made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar were interesting&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was just about to say that you were justified in bringing me to order Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Oh, good. That is an acceptance by the hon. Gentleman that his previous remarks were not in order. I am glad that he realises that. On that point, perhaps he will resume his seat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Can I have another go?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will remain in order this time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I will.
<P>
The amendment would ease the burden on businesses by removing the need to plump for a particular candidate on the basis of receipt or otherwise of the working families tax credit. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am always willing to let the hon. Gentleman go over the top first.
<P>
I now turn to amendment No. 44, which I find a little puzzling. Taken at face value, it would provide for the setting of tax credits against employers' PAYE and national insurance contribution liabilities&#151;something that has already been announced as a feature of the scheme. Another possible interpretation of the amendment is that the intention is to allow employers to set off tax credits paid to employees against their own company tax liability to the board. If that is what is meant, it would be virtually impossible to implement.
<P>
The great virtue of our scheme for employer payment of the tax credits is that employers will not have to suffer delay in being reimbursed for amounts paid to their employees. But they would have to wait until after the end of the tax year before they, or the Inland Revenue, would know what the employer's own company tax liability was. Therefore, there would be no certainty about the level of funding that might be needed.
<P>
I hope that I have obeyed, your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody, to confine my remarks to the amendments, which I believe are unnecessary or unworkable. I hope that hon. Members will not press them. If they do, I shall urge my hon. Friends to reject them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister doth protest too much when she refers to the Bill as a Treasury Bill. Everyone outside the narrow confines of the Treasury bunker knows that this is not a Treasury measure. It may be presented to the House by junior Treasury Ministers, but it is not a Treasury Bill. It is a benefit dressed up in a Treasury Bill, which is to be delivered through the payroll, and it imposes enormous burdens on employers. That is why the regulatory impact assessment comes up with the staggering figure of &#163;100 million. I was astonished when I saw it and I can understand why the Government kept the assessment away from the public for as long as possible.
<P>
In her response the Minister said that she was keen to minimise the burdens on business. If she is so keen to do so, she should have accepted earlier amendments that would have taken away the administration of this benefit through the payroll. That would have been the clearest and best way to minimise the burdens on business and it would have saved business &#163;146 million.
<P>
The Minister also referred to reductions in the rate of corporation tax, but she failed to point out that, during this Parliament, the burden of corporation tax has impacted to the tune of nearly &#163;40 billion. That is the burden that the Government have already imposed on employers. On top of that, they now want to impose an administrative burden of some &#163;100 million.
<P>
This was a probing amendment to try to ascertain the Government's attitude to the burden on business. The Government are not business friendly. That is clear from what they have already done in the first 18 months of their Government. This is not a business-friendly measure. It is annoying the CBI, the Institute of Directors and many other employer and business organisations. However, as it is a probing amendment and as we have ascertained the Government's negative attitude to the burdens that they are imposing on business, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 3, line 21, after `employers', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with the exception of employers who employ fewer than 21 people'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment inserts into clause 5 an exceptional exemption for small employers from having to administer through the payroll the working families tax credit and the disabled persons tax credit. Employees of small companies who were eligible for those two benefits would be able to receive them direct, by a cheque or to their bank account, as though they had opted for that and qualified for direct payments in some other way. In this instance, they would qualify for direct payment by virtue of the fact that they worked for an employer who employed fewer than 21 employees.
<P>
In our debate on the previous amendment, I outlined how the working families tax credit will involve significant extra work for employers. We saw in the regulatory impact assessment all the different new burdens that will be imposed on employers who have to undertake to administer the benefit and that it will cost a recurrent annual figure of &#163;103 million, with a one-off, set-up cost of &#163;43 million. However, &#163;49 million of that &#163;103 million is for employers with fewer than 100 employees and &#163;35 million is for employers with fewer than 10 employees. These figures are set out in the table in the regulatory impact assessment. If all employers with fewer than 100 employees did not have to administer the working families tax credit, only 200,000 WFTC beneficiaries out of a total of 730,000 would not be administered by their employers. The amendment calls for only employers with fewer than 21 employees to be taken out, rather than those with fewer than 100 employees, which would reduce the 200,000 figure further still.
<P>
Our main contention is that a significant proportion of the &#163;100 million cost&#151;&#163;49 million&#151;relates to small employers, yet the number of people employed by those small employers who will have their working families tax credit administered through the payroll is relatively small in relation to the whole. The Government's project would not be jeopardised if they accepted the amendment and removed from small employers the burden of having to administer the working families tax credit.
<P>
The Minister looks puzzled, so I shall recapitulate for her as she will have to respond. Of the &#163;100 million, about &#163;50 million relates to employers of fewer than 100 employees. If all those employers were relieved of having to administer the working families tax credit, that would remove only 200,000 WFTC recipients from administration through the payroll.
<P>
Many outside organisations are concerned about the effect of the WFTC on small employers. The Chartered Institute of Taxation stated in its submission:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are concerned that overall the extra burden on employers may end up as disproportionate to the benefits gained.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe it is the smaller employer who is likely to have most difficulty in coping with the payment of tax credits on top of everything else.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry is enormously concerned about the administration of the tax credit. It believes that it will be an enormous new burden for companies and that the cost will be significant, particularly for small companies, which are always hardest hit by red tape. It was the CBI's recommendation that led to the amendment. The CBI, which represents a large number of employers, said that that burden should be removed from smaller companies.
<P>
The CBI also said that smaller firms should be exempt from the requirement to administer the WFTC through the pay packet and that employees of very small companies should have their benefits administered by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Ms Margaret Moran </B>(Luton, South): The hon. Gentleman waxed lyrical about the representations from a variety of organisations purporting to represent the views of small and medium-sized enterprises. Does he accept that that may not be the whole picture in relation to smaller businesses? Is he aware, for example, that the Forum of Private Business, which represents small businesses to the same extent as the Federation of Small Businesses, has conducted its own survey? It asked whether its members were for or against piloting plans to pay in-work benefit through the wage packet. That survey showed that 44 per cent. of its members supported in-work benefit being paid through the wage packet. Does he accept that his views are only partially those of small businesses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady makes two points. First, she asked whether employers are in favour of a pilot scheme. Such a scheme would have been advisable to show just how burdensome the system will be. She demonstrated with her figures that 56 per cent. of those polled were against administering the working families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Ms Moran:</B> The survey referred initially to a pilot scheme, but the question set out the arguments for and against a scheme rather than a pilot scheme: 44 per cent. were for a scheme, 38 per cent. were against, and some small businesses had no view whatever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Those small businesses will form a view once they realise the burden involved. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) said, shops and small businesses in her constituency are completely unaware of what will hit them when they must implement the new system.
<P>
It will involve a considerable burden on top of the burden that they already suffer. If we want to help business, we should try to find ways to ease the existing burden on businesses. They already administer PAYE and national insurance contributions, which we accept they have to do, but we should find ways to ease or lift the burden on employers, especially small employers. We should not be devising a system that will cost employers an additional &#163;100 million a year, every year, as a result of the extra administrative burden, and will cost smaller businesses an additional &#163;49 million.
<P>
The Federation of Small Businesses has said that the working families tax credit will place another administrative burden on small business owners, who are already unpaid tax collectors on behalf of Government for income tax, national insurance and value added tax. Businesses also have to fund such benefits as statutory sick pay, maternity pay and redundancy pay. That is a huge burden, and exempting employers with fewer than 21 employees would help to mitigate the impact of the proposals on the British economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Collins:</B> My hon. Friend is uncharacteristically understating the strength of his case because the Federation of Small Businesses went on to say, categorically, that it opposes the measure. There are no ifs and buts, nor any question of it saying ``If you make this change, we may be able to support the Bill.'' It says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We are opposed to this measure.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right; it is opposed to the measure. The Government are walking into a minefield because once the Bill has an impact on the real economy and on the real businesses that will have to administer it, they will be in serious trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Could it be that small businesses might have been able to manage the scheme had it been included in the tax code, as the Government originally intended. Now the Government are asking small businesses to set up a benefit system, virtually over the kitchen table.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. That is what the architect of the scheme, Martin Taylor, envisaged. He thought, as I did, that it could be administered through the PAYE code. Once I realised that it could not be&#151;having read the evidence given to the Social Security Committee&#151;I concluded that it should be scrapped. I am surprised that the Government did not come to the same conclusion.
<P>
I think that Ministers believe that all employers are people who can just telephone NatWest and ask the bank to administer their payroll. In fact, most small employers administer their pay packets on a kitchen table, and they will have to write out the words ``tax credit'' on the payslips of their employees. They do not just press a few buttons and out pops ``tax credit'' printed on the payslip. They will have to make calculations and multiply the daily rate provided to them by the Inland Revenue, by the correct number of days to generate the figure that must be paid. That will be hugely burdensome.
<P>
The organisation TaxAid has been quoted. It is a charity that provides free tax advice to people in financial need&#151;a very worthwhile organisation. It, too, is greatly concerned about the working families tax credit. It says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This is an untested and unfamiliar scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Had it been tested, as the hon. Member for Luton, South (Ms Moran) hinted, several solutions for administering the scheme could have been found. TaxAid believes that the scheme will impose considerable stresses on employers and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We have serious concerns about the ability and willingness of small firms to deliver the new tax credit because of the additional compliance burdens that will be imposed on them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to Inland Revenue economic paper No. 3, the smallest employers&#151;who amount to 30 per cent. of all employers&#151;bear 75 per cent. of total compliance costs in operating PAYE. Therefore, a disproportionate burden of compliance costs is borne by smaller companies. The same disproportion will apply to the administration of working families tax credit.
<P>
The amendment would mitigate the effect of the scheme, at least for small employers with fewer than 21 employees. Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, for the sake of the small business sector in this country, which is a driving force for innovation and change and employs enormous numbers of people in this country. I hope that the Government will try to do their best to mitigate and reduce the burdens on business, rather than continue to add to them, which has been the Government's record in their first 18 months in power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Agreeing with the Conservatives once is difficult; agreeing with them serially makes me very uncomfortable. But I find myself in such a position this afternoon. The case for refunding costs to all employers has already been made, but it is especially strong with regard to small firms. I will not repeat all the arguments that have been made, but I will add a couple of different perspectives.
<P>
First, on the day that the working families tax credit is introduced, about two thirds of the recipients will be existing recipients of family credit&#151;I am sure that the Financial Secretary will correct me if I am wrong. The employers of those people will get no benefit whatever; they will continue to employ the same people, but they will have incurred an administrative cost. The immediate aftermath of the introduction of WFTC will therefore provide no gain whatever for the employer, apart from the opportunity to depress wages, which the Government would not want to shout about. A small firm with one employee who currently receives family credit will suddenly have the same employee doing exactly the same job, but will have an extra burden. That is hard to justify.
<P>
Secondly, I want to return to the regulatory impact assessment. Any benefits produced by the tax credit, such as reducing turnover and increasing labour supply, are likely to be felt&#151;to be generous to the Government&#151;only on a macro-scale. They might be felt by employers with 5,000 employees across a wide labour market and travel-to-work area, but it is hard to imagine that individual small employers will receive such benefits. The chances are that their job turnover will be low anyway; if they only employ one person, that person will probably have been working for them for 20 years. Such employers will continue in the same way, and will not receive the macro-benefits that a large firm might receive. Even if large firms are made to pay for the alleged benefit, small firms are very unlikely to see any of those benefits. Those points reinforce the case made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which is why I must support Conservative Members again.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I rise to speak in support of the amendments and to increase the embarrassment of the hon. Member for Northavon. I welcome his support for Conservative Members&#151;long may it continue on this Bill.
<P>
I am especially worried about the impact on small businesses because although my constituency is more of a commuter constituency than a business constituency, it has a number of businesses, some of which are relatively large. None of them are huge in terms of the number of employees; the bulk of the businesses are small employers. I poll those businesses once a year&#151;last year was the first time&#151;and last year I received the expected percentage of complaints about red tape. This year, almost 100 per cent. of responses from those businesses have criticised the regulatory burden that they feel is being imposed. They have not yet realised that the working families tax credit is heading inexorably in their direction.
<P>
Given that those businesses already complain of being overburdened by the working time directive and the national minimum wage&#151;even though most are not affected, they have to keep the records&#151;the regulatory burden of WFTC might just be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Although our calculations indicates that the sum of money per small employer is not huge&#151;the regulatory impact assessment is that the average increaes will be about &#163;37, which is only 5 per cent. of the annual &#163;700 cost of collecting PAYE and national insurance contributions&#151;an extra &#163;37 can have a serious impact, not just on the bottom line but on the employer's time.
<P>
With the best will in world, most small employers are not making mega profits. I could be uncomplimentary to a business and say that if that employer takes 10 hours to do the compliance work, he is in effect paying himself only &#163;3.50, which under the national minimum wage is not allowed&#151;end of business; or I could say that if it takes him five hours a year, his cost will be &#163;7 an hour.
<P>
The problem is that most Conservative Members are deeply sceptical about the estimated amount of time it will take a small employer. I once ran a business and I thought that calculating value added tax was not a complicated matter, because I had set it up with the proper systems in place. I am sure that any small employer who sets out in business will feed the working families tax credit into the calculations. The problem arises for those whose systems are already in place, because those systems must be adjusted. There may be non-recurrent costs in addition to the estimated &#163;35 or &#163;37, a figure about which I am deeply sceptical. The calculations and the returns will be required every six months, even if the work force is stable. Children get older and the levels of child care tax credit will change, so there will be continual change to the payroll.
<P>
Most of the businesses that we are talking about cannot use banks or a payroll company to do the work for them. If they did, they would have to pay more, because it would inevitably cost more. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, most of them do it on the kitchen table on the back of an envelope. It is time taken out from developing products and manufacturing processes, from selling and from making the business successful, and in a small business the owner is the key to making it successful. Such businesses do not have personnel advisers or human resource directors: they are the business. If the employers take yet more time away from driving that business forward and making it successful, the chances are that that will have a greater effect on the bottom line than a simple calculation of the number of hours that it will take any one person to administer the tax credit.
<P>
I therefore beg the Government to think much more positively about the simple suggestion that we made earlier&#151;that employees in small businesses should have the tax credit paid through the post office or their bank. That would take the regulatory burden away from those whom we can least afford to lose, because they are the economic drivers of this country. If we put more burdens on small businesses, I fear that they will start to say that it is not worth the candle. It is the last straw that makes the difference.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbridge </B>(Bromsgrove): I, too, support my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the hon. Member for Northavon, who I know does not want our support in these matters because he finds it embarrassing. Nevertheless, we are a united and happy team for the time being, which may continue in view of the some of the measures that the Government are introducing.
<P>
Like the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), mine also tends to have smaller employers. It has no major employers; insurance companies are the biggest. The rest are small and medium-sized enterprise, many of them small retail outlets, which will be affected by this measure. When we are in the Committee discussing these provisions, I think of the people from whom I buy my pound of potatoes, or my filet steak if I want to treat myself on a cold, wet Saturday night when I am fed up and have had enough.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Labour Members' eyes are glazing over because we are going on and on. Although we would all readily accept that we have busy lives, our lives are structured for us by the House of Commons and its staff. Our support structure is taken care of for us. Small employers, on the other hand, have to do everything: work out what product to sell; organise premises; recruit staff; administer wages; and now they have a juggernaut of regulations from the Government. At the same time, they are meant to make a profit, succeed and, hopefully&#151;we share this Government aim&#151;employ more people. It beggars belief that they will have enough time, among the stresses and strains that the Government are imposing, to trade successfully, as my hon. Friend the member for Beckenham pointed out. The Government will dampen their spirit of enterprise and their desire to make a success of their business by imposing what most business men see as unnecessary burdens. Business men feel that they are banging their hands against a wall, whereas their job is to make and sell products, make a profit and employ people. That is in all our interests.
<P>
The Government like to pose as a business-friendly Government. We applaud the reduction of corporation tax because that is a positive step, but many measures are antipathetic to what businesses want, and the working families tax credit is the piece de resistance. It is especially disadvantageous to smaller businesses that employ fewer than 20 people, as that sector employs more people in the economy than any other business sector. We tend to think that more people work for the big names such as IBM or Sainsbury, but the greatest volume of employment is created by companies that none of us has heard of, and it is those companies that will be affected by the Government's plans.
<P>
I was intrigued by the figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who said that we could cut the bill by &#163;50 million. Companies that employ fewer than 20 people are especially sensitive and could have the &#163;50 million burden shed if they were excluded from the provisions.
<P>
I implore the Government to listen. Those smaller companies maintain a payroll and administer sick pay. They also provide statutory maternity pay, for which they receive recompense. The new working families tax credit is more akin to statutory maternity pay than to the tax payroll analogy favoured by the Financial Secretary. We are talking about the administration of a benefit and of the welfare state. If the administrative burden is not removed&#151;our preferred option&#151;smaller companies should at least be recompensed.
<P>
On top of those burdens, smaller companies have to contend with the impact of the minimum wage&#151;I hear about that all the time&#151;paternity leave and the working time directive. Those are three major policies. I see you making a face, Mrs. Dunwoody&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order, I try not to make faces at anyone, but I hope that there will not be too much repetition. The amendment is narrowly drawn. It would be a good idea if we could avoid mentioning every piece of legislation on the statute book.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I shall desist from doing so, Mrs. Dunwoody, because I must do what you say.
<P>
We hope that the WFTC will be the last burden that the Government impose on small businesses, although I fear that it will be most awesome for them. The impact assessment does not make it clear whether the provisions will apply to a &#163;35-a-year job or whether the smaller companies, which work out their employees' wages on the kitchen table, will also have to work out the WFTC.
<P>
Small employers&#151;people who have small shops on the high street&#151;have few employees and have not appreciated the nature of the WFTC. They have not read about it in the newspapers because, frankly, it is too complicated an issue for newspapers to get involved in. Newspapers are much more interested in personality politics than in the finer workings of the WFTC, so small employers have not begun to wake up to the proposal. A new burden will be imposed on butchers and bakers, for example, some of whose employees will be eligible for WFTC. Once it is established who gets paid what, small employers will have to decide whether they need to apply to the Inland Revenue&#151;they may need a cash float because they do not have enough money from the tax and national insurance payments that have already been sought from their employees.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I think that the proposal is a complete nightmare, and I urge the Financial Secretary to reconsider whether small businesses could be excluded from the provisions. That would exclude relatively few&#151;although a significant number&#151;of the employees whom the Government seek to benefit. Excluding small businesses would be of great benefit to those businesses, and to people who work for them, and I urge the Government to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I rise to speak with some nervousness, Mrs. Dunwoody, because I see that you are going through the Standing Orders of the House and I suspsect that you will soon be able to stop us if we deviate for one moment from the path.
<P>
I do not want to add to the ills of the hon. Member for Northavon, who feels embarrassed because he agrees with Conservative Members on this issue. However, the Committee must face the hard truth that we are right on this matter and that the British public will be with us when they find out about the proposal. I believe that the Government felt that the Bill was unproblematic, but in clause after clause we have exposed its inadequacies and the fact that it will not work. The amendment would pull the Government back from their folly. They are about to impose on small businesses a body blow from which many will not recover.
<P>
I shall begin with a short quotation, Mrs. Dunwoody&#151;it is one sentence long&#151;and I shall give the right reference. It appears on page 13 of the first report of the Select Committee on Social Security, HC 29, 1998-99. In its submission to the Select Committee, the Institute of Directors stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is in principle not the job of employers to administer the benefits system.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is a Treasury job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> On Thursday night, Mrs. Dunwoody, I saw ``Shakespeare in Love'', which is an excellent film. I recall a quotation from ``Romeo and Juliet''&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Are you sure that this is relevant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, you will never forgive yourself if you do not let me finish.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Please do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was about to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a rose<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By any other name would smell as sweet''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This might look like a Treasury Bill, but it involves the administration of benefits.
<P>
Until a few months ago, everyone assumed that the tax credit would be incorporated in the tax code and that the provision would be no harder to cope with than PAYE. We had reservations about it, but we believed the mechanism to be sound. The Bill was prepared and evidence was taken, but, virtually at the eleventh hour, the Social Security Committee, much to its credit, discovered that it could not be done. Businesses, particularly small businesses, will therefore have to administer the benefit system.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham made an excellent point about the burden that the provision will impose. Her strongest point concerned the amount of time that small businesses will have to devote to the measure. The traditional allusion is of the man or woman who returns home at night to do the paperwork on the kitchen table. However, the burden placed on small businesses will be disproportionate.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned a number of reports by TaxAid, which demonstrated that the bulk of the administrative burden will fall on small businesses. Important social legislation, in which the Treasury are involved, will be administered by people sitting at the kitchen table, working out sums on the backs of envelopes.
<P>
Last September, I had a unique opportunity to listen to the Minister talking in Poland about small businesses. I could not have been more proud. She represented our country in exemplary fashion. Through translators, she explained to the assembly how to set up a small business. I actually stood on my chair and applauded. I might even have whistled, because what she said made a lot of sense. She was received with rapture by the audience. Had she gone on to say to the audience, ``And we'll expect you to administer the benefit system,'' her stay in Poland might suddenly have proved inconvenient. She would have needed me to help her to her car, and protect her from Poles saying, ``I want to make money, I want to do business, I want to employ people: I don't want to administer this.''
<P>
In effect, we are saying to small businesses, ``Never mind how tricky it is to run or set up a small business; we are going to add an extra burden.'' More people are employed by small businesses than by large businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, but they are also more susceptible than large businesses to the extra burdens imposed by cash flow problems and fluctuations in the market. As a result of the measure, all that we shall see is an increase in the rate of insolvency.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As I said earlier, it is always a genuine pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. I am grateful for his kind remarks about what was a pleasant occasion in Poland, although I seem to recall a rather hairy car journey the following day.
<P>
To respond to a quotation with a quotation, the hon. Gentleman's speech was, in all kindness,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``full of sound and fury,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Signifying nothing.''
<P>
However, I shall begin on a note of agreement with the speeches of Opposition Members. All Committee members will agree that small businesses are vital to our economy. The hon. Member for Beckenham used the expression, ``economic drivers''. I agree with here wholeheartedly. She also mentioned innovation and creativity, and she was right to do so.
<P>
I should appreciate Opposition Members' praise for small businesses more if they did not have such a dismal record themselves. I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) who said that, under the previous Administration, a business went bust every three minutes. I would think more kindly of what Opposition Members say about regulation had not their own deregulation unit had hardly any representatives of small business, unlike the better regulation unit under this Government, half of which is composed of representatives from small business.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I noted with some sadness that Ministers in the previous Government suffered the ignominy that a considerable number of their own Back Benchers signed&#151;the shame of it&#151;an early-day motion criticising them for over-regulation of the business sector and not doing anything about it. The hon. Member for Beckenham, who was a Whip at the time, must have looked at that early-day motion with considerable dismay.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I want to bring the Minister up to date. Is she aware that the Deregulation Committee, of which I am a member&#151;I shall bring this intervention into order, Mrs. Dunwoody&#151;has not been overburdened with work from her Government recently, nor was the chairman of the better regulation unit forthcoming when he gave evidence to us about more deregulation work coming to us. Can the Minister tell us whether she has asked the better regulation unit whether the Bill complies with what it considers to be regulation?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can draw the Minister's attention to the amendment and invite her to talk about that. It might be unique.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall do as you say, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I should be delighted to engage the hon. Member for Beckenham further on that matter, perhaps on another occasion. Having responded briefly to some of the points put by Opposition Members, I shall return to the amendment.
<P>
The amendment would exempt from paying tax credits employers who employ fewer than 21 people, but it would eliminate about 925,000 employers from the employer payment scheme. As hon. Members know, that would be inconsistent with out objectives in proposing employer payment of the tax credits. Payment by the employer would emphasise the place of the tax credits in the tax system, help to break their links with benefits and clearly demonstrate, as I and the Government have said all along, the rewards of work. Exemption of so many employers from the scheme would mean that more than 80 per cent. of them would not be able to pay tax credits to their employees with their wages. That would not only be unfair, it would be nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Page 8 of the regulatory impact assessment contains a table. The first line shows an employer with one one to four employees, the second line an employer with five to nine employees and the third line an employer with 10 to 99 employees. The total number of individuals in those three categories who will be paid working families tax credit through the payroll is 200,000. The Minister may be right to say that 80 per cent. of employers will be exempt from the measure, but only 200,000 entitled individuals will come out of the system. Therefore, the amendment would not drive a coach and horses through the Minister's plans to have them paid through the payroll, because it would take out only a small proportion of employees. Surely it is an important aspect that the benefit of taking those people out is that 900,000 employers will be exempted from this burden.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but it would be manifestly unfair&#151;and would make nonsense of the scheme, as I have said before&#151;to take out more than 80 per cent. of employers. The proposed amendment would also increase uncertainty for employees, especially those employed in a business with a regularly fluctuating work force of around 20 employees. Such employees would sometimes be paid tax credits with their pay and sometimes directly by the Revenue. Similar uncertainties would affect many employers, and I know from my experience of the small business sector that they want certainty above everything else. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Financial Secretary advanced a series of nonsensical arguments, which leads me to believe that the Opposition are right on this point, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's first argument was that the amendment would take 70 per cent. of employers out of the scheme. That is an irrelevance. It is the number of employees who will be taken out that is significant, and the amendment would not take out 80 per cent. of employees who are eligible to receive WFTC through the payroll. On the basis of the figures in the regulatory impact assessment, it would affect 200,000 out of 730,000.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's next argument was that the number of employees fluctuates from week to week and month to month. That may be the case, but it is an easy problem to get around by stipulating that whether the company is small or large must be determined every two or three years, or some other fixed period. The average could be taken and the category fixed for a certain period, which is the practice of the Inland Revenue. The Financial Secretary keeps telling us that this is a Treasury Bill and that the credit is a payment not a benefit. For example, it is the Inland Revenue's job to determine whether a company is an investment company. That definition fluctuates from month to month and year to year, depending on the activities in which the company is engaged. The Revenue does not uproot its determination because of a small change of activity during the year, and could therefore easily administer such a process.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's two main arguments are nonsense. I therefore urge all members of the Committee to vote for the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed to the next amendment, it will be useful for the Committee to know that rule No. 82 of the procedure in Standing Committees warns hon. Members that reading speeches is even less suited to Standing Committees than to the Chamber. It also asks hon. Members to keep any extracts from documents, quotations and so forth reasonably short. A Chairman once told a Minister not to make a detailed speech, and another ruled against reading out letters.
<P>
I want Committee members to understand that it is in order to quote and to make it clear where documents come from, but they will be well advised to remember that a Standing Order prohibits the citing of documents that are not before the House. I ask them to take pity on those who produce the Official Report. Members must make it obvious what they are quoting and the quote should be precise and short. I hope that that is clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 33 and 35, which is consequential on No. 33, and briefly to amendment No. 36. I also have much sympathy with the Liberal Democrat amendment.
<P>
I thought that this would be a significant matter when I went through the relevant papers but, on listening to the earlier debate, I realised that it is more than significant&#151;indeed, it is very serious. Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 open a new vista on what is wrong with the measure. In general, it is bad to use unrestrained regulations to allow a Government organisation to gain information across a sphere of activity as broad as the economy. A party that talks about respecting people's privacy is inherently confused when it also says that arrangements will be delegated to regulations that will allow the Revenue to get what it wants out of people. We are expected to rubber stamp those regulations.
<P>
The amendments attempt to deal with the specific threat to commercial confidentiality. Before I entered the House, I worked for several years in corporate finance and spent a lot of time dealing with corporate takeovers. After that, I worked for a number of years as a management consultant. The bulk of my time was spent devising competition strategies, which is when companies decide how they should stack up against another company to overcome it. We worked entirely legitimately. I was not party to any suggestion that an organisation should seek illegal or immoral methods of getting information on competitors. However, it is no secret that information that passes through the hands of the Inland Revenue on a regular basis would, were it to become available either to competitors or to companies that are considering takeovers, be extremely valuable. What distinguishes information gathered in the context of the working families tax credit from information that goes through the ordinary Inland Revenue process&#151;I appreciated this only an hour or two ago when the Financial Secretary reminded us of the complications involved in changing from family credit to working families tax credit&#151;is that the tax credit will be dealt with by a single group of individuals, in a single place, on a different basis.
<P>
I have never in my professional life come across a case where it was even rumoured that vital information in a takeover or a competition context had been leaked from the Inland Revenue. It has an extremely good record of probity. Every tax inspector takes an oath and each one is responsible for a small group of companies. If there were a leak, there would be accountability.
<P>
If the Bill does not limit the information that can be handled by the large, centralised group of people who will manage the WFTC, the scope for serious commercial leaks is difficult to exaggerate. Even now&#151;12 or 15 years later&#151;I could write on the back of an envelope summaries of the sort of information for which, had I been a corrupt employee in my earlier incarnation, I would have been willing to pay huge sums of money. It would be needed by a client who was seeking to take over an employer or trying to outmanoevre an employer in a corporate context.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The only information that the Inland Revenue needs to calculate the WFTC is that suggested in amendments Nos. 33 and 35. The proposed body&#151;I was about to call it a new body, but it will not be, although it will be new to the Inland Revenue&#151;will be subject to theoretical safeguards, but it obviously will not be subject to the Chinese walls in the Inland Revenue because it is centralised and its staff will deal with large numbers of companies. It might be impossible to police the situation. Unless Parliament establishes tight controls on what the body can demand from employers, the scope for breaches of commercial confidence will be large and the tremendous record that the Inland Revenue has for protecting material that is commercially confidential might be undermined.
<P>
I am sure that the Financial Secretary and her officials have thought long and hard about that matter. She should either accept the amendments or give a clear undertaking to come back on Report with amendments that will introduce the necessary safeguards. The matter cannot simply be left to regulations.
<P>
Mrs. Dunwoody, when you included amendment No. 36 in the group of amendments you no doubt had in mind my earlier comment that this was a poor area to leave to regulations. Amendment No. 36 would protect employees from the prying eyes of employers. I know that that matter especially concerns my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who has spoken several times today in support of employees who are harassed by their employers.
<P>
Not all the recipients of WFTC will be especially vulnerable. I should not dream of returning to our earlier debates, Mrs. Dunwoody, when we pointed out that recipients will extend a long way up the income scale. However, I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree that some of the recipients are extremely vulnerable. The Minister should welcome amendment No. 36, which limits how much an employer can demand or interfere in the private life of his employee. Why should an employer need to know anything more than what he needs to make the relevant payments? Conservative Members do not want employers to make payments at all, but we have moved on from that argument. The least that we can do to protect those peoeple is to say that employers should be told the basic minimum necessary to make the payements accurately.
<P>
I urge the Financial Secretary either to accept amendment No. 36&#151;a very modest little amendment&#151;or, failing that, to suggest her own wording, and to present appropriate amendments on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, you chose to include amendment No. 17, tabled by the hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and me, in the group of amendments. The amendment is similar to amendment No. 36. Our concern in tabling amendment No. 17 was with the second set of arguments put by the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) about the privacy of employees rather than the privacy of the firm. I want to add a couple of reflections on that point.
<P>
The tax credit already breaches the privacy of employees in one simple way: we know that about a third of the recipients of family credit are on the maximum credit. Given that there is a specified rate per adult and a specified rate per child at certain ages, it almost certainly follows that, for that third, the employer will be able to work out the number and ages of children. That may not be particularly sensitive information, but in some cases it might be something that the employee would not want the employer to know. As the benefit will be paid through the pay packet, there is already an unnecessary breach of privacy.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that the breach goes no further. We do not want employers to have the right to know more&#151;for example, if family circumstances change. A couple who receive family credit, which is paid to the man as sole breadwinner, may split it. I believe that I am right in saying that, although most family credit awards, and therefore tax credit awards, run for six months, in those circumstances there would be a reassessment and the newly created lone-parent family would have the right to receive the tax credit immediately. Therefore, the male employee would immediately lose the right to receive the tax credit.
<P>
I assume that the process would be that the newly created lone-parent family would contact the Inland Revenue and say, ``I am now entitled to receive the tax credit direct'' and the Inland Revenue would instruct the employer to stop paying the tax credit to the father. If the father chose to contest that or wanted to keep the payments for another month, he might ask the employer, ``Why are you stopping my tax credit?'', because he would perceive it to be the employer who delivers the money. That is the point of the tax credit: the father will see that it comes through the employer and will ask the employer why it has stopped. Our amendment would prevent the employer from ringing up the Inland Revenue and finding out why the money has stopped. We do not believe that it is the employer's business whether the family relationship has broken down. There is already a danger that that will happen anyway, because employers will be told to stop paying.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My experience is that in a number of well-run firms an employee would ask the employer to do the finding out for him or her. Might that be a difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Our amendment seeks to prevent the employer from finding out, if asked to do so by the employee. The hon. Lady suggests that that might create a conflict, but that would be preferable to the employer having the right to know such information, which in many cases the employee might not want.
<P>
To conclude my example, there is already a danger that employers will become involved in these matters. The amendment would enable the employer to wash his hands of that intrusion and say, ``I am sorry, I have no right to that information. It is no good me ringing the Revenue, because it cannot tell me. All it tells me is what to give you, and I give it to you.''
<P>
This modest amendment is consistent with amendment No. 36 with which I have no argument. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 seek to restrict the regulations relating to the requirement for employers to produce documents and records to enable the board to satisfy itself that the tax credit has been paid in accordance with the regulations. The amendments propose that employers should be obliged to produce only documents and records that relate to the number of hours worked by the employee and to the employee's entitlement to remuneration.
<P>
I appreciate the spirit with which the hon. Member for Canterbury spoke to the amendments, but they are at odds with the purpose of the clause, which concerns how employers pay tax credits through the payroll.
<P>
Information about hours worked and remuneration rights is more likely to be relevant to the applicant's entitlement to tax credit than to the employer's payment of it. A restriction such as that proposed in the amendment would make it difficult for the Inland Revenue to ensure that tax credit was being paid properly by employers to their employees, which I am sure is a consequence that the hon. Gentleman would not want.
<P>
I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody, for going into detail, but it is relevant to the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. Clause 5(2)(b) provides for regulations to require employers to produce wages sheets and other documentation. The subsection provides that that is for the purpose of enabling officers of the board to satisfy themselves that the tax credit has been and is being paid in accordance with the regulations.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Canterbury that the provision provides a perfectly clear safeguard as to the type of information that employers may be asked to produce and the amendments are, therefore unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving way and I am listening carefully. She made a general objection to the amendment, saying that it would restrain the ability to work the credit out correctly, but did not give an example. Will she do so? Will she also think again about what she has just said? Does she really believe that laying down what the underlying purpose should be provides real protection? The only way to protect is to lay down the content that the figures asked for can have. Otherwise, the true purpose could easily be disguised under an innocent purpose.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> First, the hon. Gentleman asked me for an example. Restricting what can be done would lead to the adverse consequences to which I referred.
<P>
Secondly, we are writing the purpose into the Bill. We are discussing officers of the board having to satisfy themselves that the tax credit has been and is being paid in accordance with the regulations. We are writing that into the Bill.
<P>
If I can make some progress, I may be able to reassure the hon. Gentleman. Defining the purpose for which the information is needed is the normal way of imposing a requirement to provide information. The provisions in the Bill merely follow that procedure.
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) is based on the phrasing of section 203(2)(b) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which applies to PAYE. During our consultations with employers, we canvassed that with them. Employers' representatives agreed that the compliance regime for tax credit payments by employers should follow the PAYE model as closely as possible and subsection (2) does just that.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 36 and 17 propose that clause 5 should include the provision that the board should only provide&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving way, but I genuinely think that she has missed by point. I tried to explain why we should not follow the PAYE model. Although the national body is part of the Inland Revenue on paper, we are not dealing with the same organisation. At each local tax office&#151;I have a good working relationship with my local tax office&#151;the tax inspector deals with a few local companies in a ring-fenced manner. We are talking about a single national body that will handle information across the economy. We are dealing with something that is much more difficult to police.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention because it allows me to make it absolutely clear to the Committee that the staff who will deal with this will be members of the Inland Revenue, who will be subject to exactly the same procedures and high standards of conduct as all other members of the Inland Revenue. In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for Canterbury was kind enough to pay a generous tribute, quite rightly, to the record of the Revenue in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am still baffled about what the Minister thinks the other documents will provide to the Inland Revenue that it cannot get from details of numbers of hours worked or remuneration. That concerns Opposition Members because clause 5(2)(b) says, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the production of wages sheets''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One has no objection to that because one can understand it. The problem is the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and other documents and records to officers of the Board''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to enable them to check the regulations. That is fine, but all they need is details of the hours worked and remuneration. I cannot work out what else the Inland Revenue will need. It would be helpful if the Minister could give an example of a document or record that the Inland Revenue will need, other than details of hours worked and remuneration apid.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The legislation is framed in such a way as to provide for different circumstances, but enshrined in the legislation are the safeguards that Opposition Members wish to ensure.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 36 and 17 propose that clause 5 should include a provision to the effect that the board should provide employers only with details that are strictly necessary for employers to pay employees the correct amount of tax credit. The amendments are obviously motivated by a fear&#151;the hon. Member for Northavon spoke to this effect&#151;that the board will provide employers with extensive personal details about their employees. Let me assure the Committee that that is not the case.
<P>
The regulations published last week clearly show what information the board will provide to employers. It is information that will enable the employer to pay the right amount of tax credit for the right period of time to the right person.
<P>
Let me say, once again&#151;I make no apologies for emphasising this because it is important&#151;that the Inland Revenue has considerable experience of holding large amounts of sensitive personal information. There are very strict rules on the confidentiality of information about individuals. Information is disclosed only in clearly defined and carefully controlled circumstances, and all information received is held in strict confidence.
<P>
In addition, all Inland Revenue staff are required to sign a declaration of secrecy prohibiting them from disclosing information received in the execution of duties in relation to the board of the Inland Revenue, except for the purposes of those duties or in accordance with the board's instructions. Any unauthorised disclosure of information held for the purposes of the board's function is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment or fine.
<P>
Those are important issues, and I understand why the amendments have been tabled. I hope that I have managed to reassure Opposition Members, but if not, I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I am afraid that I am not reassured. We continue to be troubled by the two central points that were not covered. The Financial Secretary has still not given an example of what documentation might be needed. She has failed to understand the difference between a huge centralised office, dealing with large amounts of information across the economy as a whole, and the careful, compartmental construction of the Inland Revenue in its current form. Trying to fit the one culture to the other will prove impossible. For that reason, I am unable to accept her strictures on the first two amendments.
<P>
I do not wish to cut across my Liberal Democrat colleague, the hon. Member for Northavon, but I am not reassured by the Financial Secretary's comments on amendment No. 36, either. Therefore, I urge my hon. Friends to press for a division.
