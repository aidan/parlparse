<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume the debate on schedule 3, I inform the Committee that amendments Nos. 123 to 125 and 127 to 133 were not printed on today's amendment papers, in error. Those amendments have therefore been issued in a supplementary paper, copies for which are available in the Room.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>General exclusions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That this schedule, as amended, be the Third Schedule to the Bill.
<P>
 Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): It is a pleasure to welcome you back, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
As I was saying at 1 o'clock when we adjourned, in a letter dated 10 March, the chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority sought clarification from the Lord Chancellor on the level of damages that might be awarded by UK courts. He was told that the letter should be readdressed to the Home Office, which it has been. No response has yet been received.
<P>
Without wanting to over-egg the pudding, the cumulative impact of this and several other recent legislative measures, such as the Data Protection Act, the distance selling directive and the comparative advertising directive, has been to make members of the Committee of Advertising Practice doubt the Government's oft-proclaimed support for a self-regulatory system. Increasingly, members of the CAP perceive matters that would hitherto have been resolved by self-regulation as likely to end up in the courts.
<P>
The CAP believes that, as far as the Bill is concerned, the only effective solution to such problems is for the self-regulatory regime for advertising to be specifically excluded from chapter I and II prohibitions. It believes that that could be done either by introducing an additional paragraph in schedule 3, or by adding an additional sentence to paragraph 4. As will be apparent, I have tried to do the latter, stating in terms that the system is deemed to fall within the definition of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``services of general economic interest''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CAP appreciates that the paragraph is intended to mirror article 90(2) of the EC treaty, but it does not believe that it would be inconsistent with Community law for specific examples to be given of activities that fall within the scope of the exclusion. A further addition of, perhaps, a paragraph (iii) in clause 9 could make it clear that agreements must be shown to contribute to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``ensuring that information provided for consumers is legal, decent, honest and truthful, in order to maintain trust in advertising as a form of commercial communication.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CAP has raised those matters with the Minister, so he is not without warning. It is worried that the Government may not have appreciated the significant adverse effect that the Bill may have on effective self-regulation. I emphasise that the CAP has no desire to make a major issue of the matter, but any comfort that it can be given to reduce their unease would be welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I begin by saying how glad I am to see the Minister of State here today, because when the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs was with us questions that I raised were not answered. I hope that today the Minister will vouchsafe us the answers.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has already drawn the Committee's attention to paragraph 4. I should like to repeat and amplify three or four questions that are of critical importance to the operation of the Bill because of how the schedule is drafted.
<P>
First, I hope that the Minister will be able to tell the Committee unambiguously what constitutes a revenue producing monopoly and, in particular, what does not. Secondly the most important question, resulting from a genuine lack of understanding, is whether the Minister intends by that phrase to capture, for example, the Inland Revenue, which is a revenue producing monopoly, and might be held to be connected with a service of general economic interest--
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> The Inland Revenue is a gathering monopoly rather than a producing monopoly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is a helpful comment--in which case my question is whether the ordinary acceptation of the term ``revenue-producing monopoly'' therefore includes only, and all, those monopolies that remained after competition had been introduced into a larger industry, such as the electricity industry, and what qualifies as a monopoly? How monopolistic does something have to be, and in how many parts of an industrial landscape, to count as a monopoly? For example, is it the same sort of presumption that was made under the Monopolies and Mergers Commission--that someone having what counts in the chapter II prohibition as a dominant position would qualify as a monopoly? More precisely, would National Power qualify as a revenue producing monopoly?
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): On a rather smaller scale, would the BSkyB encryption service constitute a revenue-producing monopoly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> As usual, my hon. Friend lights exactly on my next point, but which I would have made with a less apposite example. If a tiny area is fully occupied--my hon. Friend's example is a particularly good one in that respect--is that potentially a revenue-producing monopoly?
<P>
That brings me to the more general question, what is a revenue-producing monopoly? What does one have to do or to be to be sure of not being one? The Minister seemed to suggest in his helpful intervention that the general framework for that discussion is the ordinary acceptation of the term. We are not discussing a term of art. The Bill is about competition and should therefore be aimed at those businesses dominant enough to be a monopoly, particularly if they are revenue producing--for instance, economic in character. Why does the Bill exclude them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Does my hon. Friend think that the danger is that those organisations may get stuck on Morton's fork? If they fall within the monopoly definition, they may be caught under the revenue-producing provision; conversely, if they are loss-making, they may be regarded as predatory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is a highly ingenious argument. Alas, it may have some application in the real world and not be merely clever.
<P>
I ask those questions because it seems likely to me--I look to the Minister for guidance--that an enterprise that, by any definition, is dominant, that is arguably monopolistic in a rather constrained industrial sector, that is clearly revenue producing--lying on that side of Morton's fork--and that has engaged in an abuse of its dominant position, will not be caught by the Bill because, paradoxically, it can establish before the commission, and, if necessary, before a court, that it is not.
<P>
It is a strange defence against the accusation that one is distorting competition that it is all right because one is so good at it that in a narrower sphere one would have established a monopoly. I find that so implausible a line that I am driven to the conclusion--erroneously, it seems--that a revenue-producing monopoly must be a term of art referring to something else, such as the Inland Revenue. However, the Minister assured us that that is not the case. In that respect, at least, schedule 3 has blown an enormous gaping hole in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood </B>(Wokingham): It is possible that the Government are terrified that many of their activities and the activities of their agencies are anti-competitive--as, indeed, they are. They have therefore put a series of gateways into the schedule, including one on public policy and the one referred to by my hon. Friend. The Minister owes the Committee an explanation. How many of the Government's anti-competitive practices do they wish to justify, and why do they need more than one gateway for those anti-competitive practices to get through?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is obviously absolutely right. It would be interesting to know whether, if I was wrong about the Inland Revenue, other Government agencies are meant to be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Or Government trading businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Or Government trading businesses, which are appended to agencies. Is that the cause of the problem?
<P>
Before I move on to the other terms about which I would like to hear from the Minister, I should mention that ``revenue-producing'' is an extremely odd phrase. No business produces revenues: it produces goods or services; it receives revenue. I do not want to be pedantic, but that raises the question: why that phrase, ``revenue-producing''? What is it that somebody--presumably a highly intelligent person who understands a good deal about business and the law--intended to convey by using that extremely odd and un-English phrase? The suspicion must be that something makes that a sensible item to include in schedule 3, rather than the demolition job that it appears.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point, from which I certainly do not want to detract. However, is not it possible that the draftsmen are guilty of nothing other than a rather sloppy use of the English language, of which no one would ever accuse my hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> People have certainly accused me of that, and I have pleaded guilty on occasion. However, we are not dealing with an incidental matter, we are talking about what does and does not qualify to be caught by the Bill as a whole, so I suspect that parliamentary counsel, under the guidance of the Minister, must have focused a great deal of attention on it, and it is therefore implausible that it is sloppy. If it is sloppy, my goodness, it is very sloppy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Might I offer my hon. Friend a different interpretation? Although it is not made explicit, the term ``revenue-producing monopoly'' may be quite familiar within government, as the revenue produced is revenue to government.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend takes me back to the Inland Revenue in a most interesting way.
<P>
	With that, I shall let lie the question of revenue-producing monopolies. I hope that by now the Minister will be clear that before we can possibly subscribe to schedule 3, we need to understand what that important part of it is about. I reiterate that plenty of occasions have been offered for the Under-Secretary to tell us about that; so far, answers have been there none.
<P>
My second set of questions relates to another phrase of great importance--``services of general economic interest''. Almost every service is, in the English language meaning of the term, of general economic interest. At one point, the Under-Secretary made great play of the meaning of the word ``trade'' in connection with the Bill. He helpfully told us that trade ``encompasses all economic activity.'' I think that I quote him ipsissima verba. I take it that the draftsman knows the difference between his terms of art, and that we are dealing with something that is not trade, and which does not mean all economic activity. So ``services of general economic interest'' are something other than economic activity.
<P>
Again, my question is whether that term of art is trying to describe an item such as the Bank of England, which I suppose in a rather odd way one could regard as a service of general economic interest divorced from ordinary economic activity--it is not about getting and spending, it is about controlling macro-economic variables. I use that example because we were assured at an earlier sitting that the Bank of England did not need to be exempted from the Bill because it was never caught by them in the first place. If that is true, the Bank of England is presumably not a service of general economic interest.
<P>
So far, the Under-Secretary's guidance has given us the impression that ``services of general economic interest'' does not mean normal economic activity; nor, manifestly, is it charitable activity, because we are told that that is exempt from the Bill for other reasons; nor is it a service such as the Bank of England, if that can be described as a service rather than as an authority. I must say that I am genuinely left in doubt as to what is a service of general economic interest.
<P>
There may be a perfectly reasonable explanation; the only reason that I doubt that is that we have asked that question several times in previous debates and, again, answers came there none. It would be most helpful if the Minister were to clear up the question of what are services of general economic interest. In fact, it is essential that he do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend might like to think about some of the interesting cases, such as the London tube, and the London bus systems, which are not deregulated as some others are, or the water industry, which I have mentioned in trying to elucidate the debate. If that is what the Minister has in mind, it seems that he will have at least three ways to exempt such practices from the Bill's provisions. However, as my hon. Friend implies, that might be all that the Minister wants to do but, unfortunately, the Bill's wording goes so much wider that, for example, it will be difficult to deny British Telecom such a defence for its practices. I suspect that that was not what the Minister intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. This debate is very important. Ministers have repeatedly assured us, and it is stated in the notes on clauses, that European jurisprudence saves the Bill from the need to contain definitions. I profoundly doubt that that will be true in that English courts, which operate in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, might find it difficult to interpret matters in the way that they have been interpreted in European legislation.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said in a lapidary comment during the previous sitting, other provisions seem to compel all tribunals, including the Competition Commission, to deal with European jurisprudence definitions. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult to know how an English court will interpret such matters. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that people can read the parliamentary record to understand what the Minister intends the phrases to mean. This line of questioning is intended to allow British industry to know in advance, and without having to spend extraordinary sums on legal fees, what is intended to be caught by the two phrases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As the wording is so gloriously vague, my hon. Friend will agree that all members of the Committee are left to grope in the dark. However, we must try to find the light at the end of the tunnel. Does my hon. Friend think it possible that the terms ``general economic interest'' and ``general public interest'' might be equated or even synonymous in this context? Might not the wording be intended to refer to the provision for the operation of a public service that is also in the national economic interest? For example, a public service such as refuse collection undertaken by a large organisation for many local authorities that was not provided would become a matter of general economic interest and, indeed, of general economic crisis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Clearly, as a result of our acquaintance of the past year, a kind of telepathy has emerged between my hon. Friend and myself. I was about to refer to paragraph 7, which deals with such matters. I ask myself--members of the Committee who happen to be looking at the Bill, rather than at their correspondence, might also be asking themselves--what is the difference between a service of general economic interest and the grounds of public policy?
<P>
To an ordinary English reader--I admit that that might be the wrong thing to be in the context of the Bill--it looks as though paragraph 7 will allow the Secretary of State to reintroduce a notion of public interest that was incorporated in the old, much lamented legislation, which will be largely obliterated by the chapter I and chapter II prohibitions. However, the public interest is not defined as such in the Bill. We are in a new Labour world, and the term ``public interest'' has disappeared and the phrase ``compelling reasons of public policy'' has emerged. I hope that that phrase has an echo in English jurisprudence; it has no echo in ordinary English.
<P>
I have traced only one constitutional case that referred to compelling reasons of public policy. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) will be fully acquainted with the incident and will, no doubt, be able to enlarge on it in much more detail than I can. I refer, of course, to the issue of Pym's ears, which were dislodged from Pym's head by royal prerogative and because of his attitude to ship money--an earlier precursor of the poll tax, some might say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Is this Francis Pym?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> No. His ears were merely boxed.
<P>
At that time, the king spoke of compelling reasons of public policy. Whoever drafted the Bill may have had that in mind, but I doubt that we are talking about a prerogative power. The question that arises, which is a serious one for the British firms that are trying to work out whether they will be caught, is what is a compelling reason of public policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Neither my hon. Friend nor I is a lawyer, but my hon. Friend is advancing a fascinating argument. Does he recall that the Attorney-General must always decide whether such a prosecution is in the public interest? It appears to be anomalous to have shifted from the consideration with which law officers and others who advise the Crown are thoroughly familiar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree. The point that I am trying to make is exactly that. We have moved from the territory of the familiar to that of the unfamiliar. Unless there is a jolly good reason for it, it is a bad idea because it will cause confusion, which, in turn, will add to costs.
<P>
In the light of the lack of clarity, I can only guess at what the Minister intends, which is to introduce a provision allowing the Secretary of State--the President of the Board of Trade--to decide what constitutes a compelling reason of public policy, more or less without restraint. Operating something that cannot be defined gives the greatest possible scope for discretion. If the Secretary of State can decide what is accepted, schedule 3 is giving us the makings of a Bill providing that everything will be prohibited save what the Secretary of State decides on the day will not be prohibited. That is not a form of legislation that is acceptable in this country. I hope that the Minister will clarify whether the compelling reason of public policy has a clear and strict definition, limiting that discretion, or will accept that the schedule should not remain in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I cannot hope to compete with my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) in the elegance of his comments on the schedule. I am afraid that I must confine myself to one or two prosaic questions for the Minister.
<P>
First, paragraph 1 of schedule 3 refers to planning obligations. I am not a planning lawyer, but being a Member of Parliament representing South Cambridgeshire makes one familiar with planning law, as everyone seems to be wanting to build something in the area these days. I understand that planning obligations under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990--I am becoming quite familiar with section 106 agreements--are discharged after a period of five years. Does such an agreement become an infringement of the prohibition after that period has elapsed, or will the company, which enters into the agreement and which thereafter behaves without material change in the ways agreed, be protected from the prohibition? The question seems simple, but the answer is not obvious.
<P>
Secondly, paragraph 2(7) refers to circumstances in which the director can make a direction to withdraw the protection for section 21(2) agreements. Paragraph 2(7)(a) is straightforward: the director may give a direction if he considers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the agreement will, if not excluded, infringe the Chapter I prohibition''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, under paragraph 2(7)(b), he is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not likely to grant it an unconditional individual exemption'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which means an exemption that would not have conditions attached to it under the preceding provision.
<P>
The words ``not likely to'' give me pause for thought. The director, in examining an agreement, concludes either that it will infringe the prohibition, in which case he will not grant it an unconditional, individual exemption, or that he will grant it such an exemption, perhaps with conditions.
<P>
That seems an odd way in which to proceed. If the director withdraws the section 21(2) protection and pre-judges the issue of it infringing the chapter I prohibition, presumably he has conducted a sufficient investigation for that purpose. Under paragraphs 2(7)(a) and 2(7)(b), he either believes that there has been an infringement, pending an investigation to establish whether it was anti-competitive, or that the agreement definitely infringes the prohibition, in which case he will not grant it an unconditional, individual exemption. I am not sure that we can have it both ways.
<P>

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend draws attention to a matter of great importance. Does he agree that, on further inspection, it appears that the director would be able to give the relevant direction and, hence, disenable the section 21(2) defence ex post facto? There is nothing to suggest that that cannot be done retrospectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend tests my knowledge of the Bill. Under clause 3, in so far as such a direction brings any such agreement within the normal provisions of clause 2 and subject to a prohibition, it will apply retrospectively to the establishment of the agreement. I do not see any reason why that should not be the case. However, I am sure that the Minister will let us know if he believes that I am wrong about that.
<P>
Thirdly, my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset entertained us by drawing attention to the unusual drafting of paragraph 7, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``compelling reasons of public policy'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a phrase that is preceded by the words ``exceptional and''. It would be interesting to know, if only for an academic purpose, on what previous occasions Governments have considered it wise to draft Bills in such a form that they can act to secure a particularly objective only under pressure of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we deal with the role of regulators and others, no doubt we shall find that the Bill assumes that the director general and the regulators will all act reasonably, with full co-operation, with utter consistency and in a measured way under all circumstances. It seems that, under the Bill, the Secretary of State has no confidence that she will behave in such a way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend concede that two persons are involved in the provision that covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``compelling reasons of public policy''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is the compellee--the Secretary of State, who is so compelled--and there is the compellor. We need to know who that compellor might be. It might be an external force, such as an international obligation, but having followed my hon. Friend's argument, it is entirely unclear to me who else might fall within that category. Would it be the Chief Whip?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is quite right. It is interesting that he should say that; I had thought of that point and he is right to raise it. If the reasons are compelling, they are in a sense acting upon Government rather than arising within Government.
<P>
That is a curious way of proceeding, because any future Government may conclude that there are reasons of public policy arising from the public interest--essentially, this is the public interest test to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset referred--why an agreement should be given the benefit of exemption from either of the prohibitions. It is curious to say that that should occur only where the Governement is compelled to such a conclusion--presumably by an external source--and to add that it must be exceptional, so that by extension it will not arise in relation to an on-going issue of public policy but only when something occurs that has not previously occurred and has not been eexpected to occur.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State does not appear to have confidence that she could be trusted with the power for reasons of public policy, public interest or whatever, to make exemptions from the prohibition, so that it must be explicitly circumscribed in the Bill. It appears that when Ministers or others were drafting the Bill they reached this point and thought, ``We could leave it there, with paragraphs 1 to 5, 8, 9 and so on.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has hit on an extremely important point. A moment ago, he referred to the exceptional reasons of public policy, and suggested that, by their nature, they would probably be reasons of temporary application and relevance. If that is the case--I believe that to be the thrust of what my hon. Friend is arguing--aught not there to be a time limit imposed on the exclusion? On the other hand, if it is the character of the agreement rather than the temporary circumstances that require its exclusion from the prohibition, a time limit is not needed. Surely some specificity about the circumstances is required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. I am sure that he is right to say that if the Secretary of State concludes under that paragraph that a particular agreement ought for such reasons to be exempted, the exemption applies ex post facto to the point at which the agreement was made. Presumably, thereafter the agreement would remain for ever excluded.
<P>
The use of the word exceptional does not necessarily help, because it may well be that it is applied not to the nature of the agreement but to the reason of public policy. The reason of public policy may be of not an exceptional but a continuing character, and therefore give rise to a class or description of agreements that ought to be excluded. As we read in paragraph 7(1)(b), agreements ``of a particular description'' may benefit from the exemption. The use of the word exceptional and the application of the paragraph to agreements of a particular description is an odd conjunction.
<P>
Rather than simply say that, for reasons of public policy or on grounds of public interest, the Secretary of State can exempt agreements from the prohibition, it was probably thought during the drafting that Opposition Members of the Committee, or others in another place, would say that that was most unsatisfactory, and that if the Secretary of State were to have the reserve power to exempt agreements from the prohibition, it should be circumscribed in some way. The conclusion was, why not so trammel it with language that it appears as though it will never happen? The words ``exceptional'' and ``compelling'' were therefore arrived at. However, for all the reasons that we have detained the Committee to discuss, those words do not serve the purpose. If the Secretary of State is to have a power to exempt on the ground of public interest, that should be stated. However, if the intention is that specific criteria should be applied to the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can go beyond the current structure of exemptions and exclusions and apply her own exemptions, those criteria should be specified. It would have been better if the Government had proceeded in that way.
<P>
If the Government cannot do that, a question arises. If it is so exceptional and compelling, and therefore rare, under what statutory-instrument-making power will it occur? You, Mr. Atkinson, will be much better at this than I am--indeed, all members of the Committee are probably better at this than I am--but I tried hard to work that out. It seems that the paragraph, in so far as an order is made under it, relates back the power that establishes the Schedule in clauses 3 and 20. In a subsequent clause that determines what the order-making powers will be, orders under clauses 3 and 20 are to be subject to affirmative resolution.
<P>
Given that, as I understand it, schedule 3 is not specified as a part of the Bill under which orders will be subject to affirmative resolution, it seems that an order made under paragraph 7 will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. If so, that is odd--an exemption to a prohibition that is obviously exceptional and compelling, arising only in extreme circumstances, will nevertheless be passed by the negative resolution procedure. Perhaps the Minister will either answer that point now or reflect on it and return to it when we examine how orders will be made under the Bill. Perhaps this is the point to specify that an order should, necessarily, be subject to an affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for South Cambridgeshire and for West Dorset for their remarks on the issues that we have been exploring. I am reminded of the son of a peer who was also an archdeacon. There was a prolonged argument, in terms of the relations between the Church and state, about whether he was the venerable the honourable; the honourable the venerable; the honourable yet venerable; or the venerable yet honourable. A squash ladder of questions might be asked in the context of the words before us. Is it exceptional but not compelling; is it compelling but not exceptional; or is it, of all things, exceptional and compelling? The entire Committee must be looking forward to the answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Good afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. I have not seen you for some weeks--
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Minister has not been here.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Matters of state have called me away from the Committee--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Compelling?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Very compelling, as hon. Members may have read in the newspapers. I missed the Committee--and Opposition Members--at times, until we reached this debate. I shall try to provide a comprehensive response to the questions raised. I shall do so in my own language, rather than in that of the hon. Member for West Dorset. Hon. Members should not expect it to be any different--it is still English. I shall go through each of the points that hon. Members have raised, and at the end, I hope that, overwhelmingly, hon. Members will be satisfied with my responses. If not, it will be tough, but not on me.
<P>
We intend the two prohibitions to apply widely across the economy. However, there are some sorts of agreement and conduct from which the prohibitions should be disapplied. The schedule sets out a number of general exclusions from the probitions. I believe--and hope--that there is a general view across the Committee that there should be an opportunity to do that. The schedule also contains two powers that enable the Secretary of State, on specified grounds, to provide by order for further exclusions. Again, it is generally accepted that the Secretary of State must have the capacity and flexibility to examine issues that arise from time to time. If they have any sense, Governments of all persuasions make such provision in considering such areas to enable them to examine issues as they arise and to respond to them effectively.
<P>
The reasons for the general exclusions vary, ranging from compliance with our EC obligations in respect of coal and steel products; to ensuring that there is no conflict between the prohibitions and other provisions of the law; to seeking to minimise the cost of business and concentrate regulatory resources where it matters by disapplying the chapter I prohibition from agreements that the Secretary of State has not regarded as of such significance as to call for investigation by the restrictive practices court. Each case in schedule 3 needs to be considered on its own merits--[Interruption.] The right hon. Member for Wokingham says that he has heard all this, but with due respect to him, I have listened to him and to his colleagues deploying their arguments. It is for me to deploy the reasons why the Government take the view that they do. I do so not only for the Committee, but for those outside who want to know precisely what the Government want to do. Opposition Members would complain immediately if my responses were not thorough enough.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am intervening to clear up a confusion and for no other purpose. We were saying that we are broadly happy with the argument that the Minister has advanced so far. I should be delighted if he were to give a full explanation of the Government's general approach and answer the specific questions that my right hon. and hon. Friends have posed, because it is important for the future conduct of businesses that they are fully appraised of what is in the Government's mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that reassurance. Whether the reassurances that I shall give him from now on are acceptable is another matter, but I shall respond as positively as I can to the issues raised.
<P>
The first charge made by several hon. Members was that the approach was vague and too wide. That is the catch-all phrase that I would use for what has been said so far. The Bill follows the language of article 90 of the European treaty, and clause 60 will ensure that the words are interpreted in the same way. There is great value in following the European approach--otherwise we could impose two different prohibitions on business. It is crucial that we follow the process adopted in article 90, and that will be seen through under clause 60. That is a reasonable, clear approach to take, and United Kingdom businesses have understood it for at least 25 years in relation to European treaty matters.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham dipped his toe in the water to gauge our reaction to new clause 6, on the water industry. I am sure that we shall deal with such matters when we debate new clause 6; I do not intend to do so now. However, the prohibitions will not remove the need for any part of the regulatory regime for the water industry. An important role will remain for sector-specific regulation and for ensuring that the licence obligations are adhered to, although the Bill will complement the regime by prohibiting, for example, abuses of dominant market position not explicitly covered by licence. That is a reasonable approach to take. On environmental requirements, to the extent that agreements or conduct are legally required, they will be excluded automatically from the prohibitions. Again, that is a reasonable approach to take. There are no plans to use the powers in the Bill to make exclusions for the water industry per se.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham raised several other issues, the first being planning obligations. Paragraph 1 disapplies the chapter I prohibition from agreements to the extent to which they are planning obligations for the purposes of sections 106 and 299A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990--or the corresponding provisions for Scotland and Northern Ireland, as appropriate--or Crown planning obligations. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will know more about such matters in the context of Northern Ireland than I do, so I shall give way if he wants to intervene.
<P>
Planning obligations are defined in the 1990 Act and can either be agreements between those interested in the relevant land and the local planning authority, or a unilateral undertaking by those interested in the land which is enforceable by the local planning authority in the same way as an agreement. They may restrict the development or the use of the land, require specified operations or activities to be carried out in, on, under or over the land, require the land to be used in any specified way, or require payments to be made to the authority. That is an important aspect. It puts together a range of measures and planning arrangements for complex areas of land in regeneration or redevelopment and construction projects. That is why it is set out in such a way.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Planning obligations are intended to operate in the public interest. Once entered into, they are similar to legal requirements: they are enforceable as a matter of public law. Just as we do not want the chapter I prohibition to conflict with legal requirements, so we do not think that it should apply to planning obligations. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I and my hon. Friends were happy with the parts of schedule 7 that the Minister defended. Our concerns relate to the public policy, the general economic interest and the revenue--producing monopoly elements, because they allow too many opportunities for anti-competitive practice. In his defence, the Minister said that those elements are important, because they bring us into line with article 90 of the old treaty, now article 86 of the new treaty. As I understand it, article 86 points in the opposite direction to the suggested by the Minister. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in this Treaty, in particular to those rules''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those rules include the two prohibitions incorporated in the Bill. The old article 90 brings into doubt the three large gateways that the Minister puts into the Bill; we remain worried that revenue monopolies and public policy monopolies will escape scot free when they should not.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I reassure the right hon. Gentleman that paragraph 4 of schedule 3 copies into the Bill article 90(2) of the treaty. I apologise if the right hon. Gentleman misunderstood my explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I and my hon. Friends did hear the Minister say article 90. I am delighted to learn that it was a different article. The case remains that article 90 explicitly prevents the sort of things that are propsed in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We shall have to disagree on the matter. The Government believe that it does not; the right hon. Gentleman's view is a personal view, strongly held. I do not agree with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, I cannot add to the matter. The right hon. Member for Wokingham made an assertion. I made it clear where we stand and why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, it is one of those issues on which we shall have to disagree. I am responding to a debate that lasted for about three quarters of an hour. I want to answer it. I am not trying to avoid a debate, but the right hon. Gentleman and I have expressed a view, and I have come to the judgment that the right hon. Gentleman's view is wrong. Without being arrogant about it, the Government's view is right.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of schedule 3 is about services with a general economic interest, and at least three Opposition Members mentioned it. It provides an exclusion from chapter I and chapter II prohibitions. To a large extent, it reflects article 90(2) of the treaty. It disapplies both prohibitions from undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of a general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly, in so far as the prohibition would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to the undertaking. By virture of clause 60, the inclusion would be interpreted in a way not inconsistent with the interpretation of article 90(2).
<P>
Article 90(2) provides a limited derogation from the full application of competition law for some public service functions. For example, it provides a basis for the cross-subsidisation that is necessary to support uniform letter pricing. The exclusion is provided so that activities that benefit from article 90(2) in relation to articles 85 and 86 will not be in a less favourable position with respect to domestic prohibitions. On those grounds, the Post Office asked us specifically to adopt an article 90(2) look-alike in its response to the August draft Bill.
<P>
That seems fair for organisations such as the Post Office which provides a universal service with a single tariff and whose services in rural and other areas are distinct in economic and social terms from other services. As a consequence of that, it must have resources for its operation to ensure that there is not a failure in the services because of a failure to integrate the economic circumstances of the enterprise. That is a reasonable explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I appreciate that the Minister is trying to be reasonable. If such an activity were no longer conducted in the public sector, albeit in part or in whole, but which was operated by a privately owned organisation along similar universal service lines, can the hon. Gentleman clarify whether it would be exempted under the provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to draw me into issues concerned with privatisation. The Post Office is a publicly owned enterprise and will remain so. Consequently, it provides those services, which is why provision is in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am really too soft on the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry raised an important point and he did so in his characteristically understated way. Will the Minister admit that the provision, while applying to the Royal Mail and to a publicly owned and controlled corporation, could apply to a privately owned operation which had public service responsibilities? I am not asking him to refer to particular cases, but to clarify for the benefit of the Committee whether the wording of the schedule could apply to such an enterprise.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Article 90(2) can apply to both public or private undertakings that have been entrusted with the operation of services of a general economic interest, but there must have been an act of public authority, such as a specific national law. My views about the Post Office are still relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Not for the moment. The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to sloppy drafting and National Power. Undertakings with the character of revenue-producing monopolies are those that enjoy a fiscal monopoly to raise money for the state. National Power could not qualify because it does not raise money for the state. I do not want to be party political, but one of the reasons why is that the right hon. Member for Wokingham privatised the organisation.
<P>
	It has been overlooked that paragraph 4 of the schedule must be interpreted in line with European jurisprudence. That shows that the exclusion is limited to the context of the articles. Jurisprudence operates in relation to the prohibitions, which is set out in paragraph 6. The matter cannot be made more clear than that. We could go around all the houses and nit-pick here and there, but the common principle is plain: it is clear from the jurisprudence that the scope of the exclusion is limited and that the various definitions contained in it are to be interpreted strictly. As I said, article 90(2) can apply to both public or private undertakings, but it is important that the derogation applies also to undertakings with the character of a revenue-producing monopoly that enjoy a fiscal monopoly in order to raise money for the state. Again, that is an aspect of United Kingdom legislation that is being brought in synch with European legislation. A number of countries in Europe have such revenue-producing monopolies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Tobacco?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Tobacco is one example; alcohol is another. I am not asking people to have either--particularly one of them. I think that that answers the point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset.
<P>
It should be noted that we want to exclude only what undertakings are strictly required to do. Where a legal requirement leaves discretion as to how they comply, or where they go beyond what is legally required, we want to be able to apply the prohibitions.
<P>
I think that the right hon. Member for Wokingham referred to paragraph 6--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Avoidance of conflict with international obligations''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That paragraph enables the Secretary of State, if satisfied that exclusion is appropriate in order to avoid a conflict between the provisions of part I and the UK's international obligations, by order to disapply the chapter I prohibition from particular agreements or agreements of a particular description, and to disapply the chapter II prohibition to specified conduct. The order may provide that chapter I or II prohibitions are to be deemed never to have applied.
<P>
The Secretary of State is given those powers to ensure that in practice the prohibitions do not operate in conflict with our international obligations. If it was necessary to make the exclusion retrospective in order to avoid such a conflict, it would clearly be right to do so.
<P>
The paragraph also provides that arrangements relating to civil aviation are to be treated as an international obligation for the purposes of the paragraph if designated by order of the Secretary of State. The purpose of that is to ensure that agreements made to comply with inter-governmental understandings in the aviation sector that fall short of being treaties come within the scope of the exclusion-making power. Examples of such arrangements are memorandums of understanding. In practice, such memorandums are honoured as if they were treaties.
<P>
A number of Opposition members of the Committee referred to paragraph 7, ``Public policy''. That paragraph provides a similar order-making power to paragraph 6, but in relation to public policy. It enables the Secretary of State, if satisfied that there are exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy why the chapter I or chapter II policy ought not to apply, by order to disapply the chapter I prohibition from particular agreements or agreements of a particular description, and/or to disapply the chapter II prohibitions in particular circumstances. An order may provide that the prohibitions are to be deemed never to have applied.
<P>
We have no plans to excercise that power, and we believe that its exercise should be subject to the high test of ``exceptional and compelling'' reasons of public policy. But where such grounds exist, it is right that the prohibitions--which, as the Committee will appreciate, may have serious consequences--should be disapplied. [Interruption.] Conservative Members laugh about that. I am just old enough to remember 1971, when a Conservative Government used exceptional and compelling reasons of public interest to nationalise Rolls-Royce because of Britain's economic and defence interests, and took powers to do so. That has made them quiet; we have silence.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset made great play of that issue. Indeed, I think that at one stage he brought King Charles I into play. The difference between him and the Secretary of State is not just gender; the Secretary of State has a public and a parliamentary accountability. Charles I did not have one of those and lost his head as a result. I am sure that my right hon. Friend has no intention of losing her head over this or any other issue. She is taking a great deal of care about the issue of exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy.
<P>
	That test is deliberately intended to be a higher test than the public interest test. It is designed to limit the Secretary of State's power to truly exceptional cases. It represents not a weakening but a strengthening of the arrangements to prevent the Secretary of State from being able to use the public interest as a narrow threshold on which to make decisions. We are genuinely trying to ensure that a serious test is applied to the Secretary of State's actions.
<P>
Paragraph 8 on coal and steel provides that the chapter I and chapter II prohibitions do not apply to agreements relating to coal and steel products, as defined in the European Community treaty, to the extent to which the treaty gives the European Commission exclusive jurisdiction, until the expiry of the treaty. That exclusion is necessary as a matter of law, no more and no less than that. The treaty confers an exclusive jurisdiction on the Commission in respect of certain matters relating to coal and steel products, as defined in annex I to the treaty.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraph 9, on agricultural products, disapplies the chapter I prohibition from certain specified agreements to the extent to which they relate to the production of or trade in ``agricultural product'' as defined in annex II to the treaty. The exclusion is along the lines of EC regulation 26/62, which covers agricultural agreements, including agricultural co-operatives. The exclusion is designed to ensure that agreements in the agricultural sector will be treated under the bill in a similar way to the way in which they are treated under EC competition law. That furthers our overall objective of seeking, as far as possible, consistency in the treatment of agreements under the EC and UK prohibition systems.
<P>
With regard to general exclusions, in the case of exclusions for mergers and agreements cleared under section 21(2) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, the director general will have the ability to claw back individual agreements and to consider them under the prohibition. However, such a clawback can be exercised only when an undertaking has failed to provide the director general with information or upon a high threshold that he considers that the agreement is likely or is intended substantially and unjustifiably to prevent, restrict or distort competition in relation to an agricultural product. That will ensure that the exclusion does not prevent the director general from curbing any abuses that there might be.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster raised the matter of missing correspondence. Although it is not part of my responsibility, I have taken it upon myself to try to trace that correspondence between the two Departments; I hoped to be able to do it before the start of the Committee stage. I have not been able to do so, for which I apologise. By Thursday, I hope not only to have traced the correspondence but to ensure that the right hon. Gentleman has received an adequate response. I hope that my customer-friendly policy helps the Committee.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked about the ASA. We recognise the benefits of the ASA's self-regulating system. It is for the Director General of Fair Trading to confirm that the system is compatible with the Bill. Prohibition of agreements bites upon only those agreements that are appreciably anti-competitive and the prohibition is subject to a power of exemption. The Bill provides for the director general to give exemptions, guidance as to whether an agreement is likely to infringe a prohibition and a decision as to whether an agreement does so. A range of measures is available, of which the ASA can avail itself if necessary.
<P>
I understand that the ASA is in touch with the OFT about any competition concerns with its agreements, and how, if necessary, the director general could clear them. I am told that the director general has made it clear that the arrangements which the OFT does not currently regard as anti-competitive will be so regarded under the Bill. I hope that that explanation helps the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
	Prohibition in respect of a market dominance bites only upon abusive conduct. Again, guidance may be issued and decisions given by the director general. If the industry is still concerned, people can always speak to the Department or the director general. My job is to ensure that the legislation is brought in smoothly and that those who have to comply with it know that we are taking an interest in whatever difficulties they perceive, and to ensure that no difficulties arise in relation to the Bill's implementation. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is happy with those assurances.
<P>
The hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire and for West Dorset made similar points in respect of the prospective withdrawal of section 21(2) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. Paragraph 2(9) makes it clear that an exclusion may not be withdrawn retrospectively. The hon. Gentlemen also asked about parliamentary procedure. We believe that the negative resolution procedure is right for that power and for the power given in paragraph 6. Subject to that check, the Secretary of State should have the primary responsiblity for deciding what needs to be done in order to comply with our international obligations, or what are exceptional or compelling reasons of public policy.
<P>
The latter test is a high hurdle, which must be surmounted for the power to be exercised. The Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee did not question the fact that the power was subject to negative resolution, so we submitted the proposal to another place to consider. The Committee deemed it appropriate, so we decided to leave it as it stands in the Bill. I hope that that satisfies righ hon. and hon. Members and that they will feel able to appprove the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I regret to say that the Minister did nothing to help the Committee understand the terms of the definition--he did not even mention it. We shall let that be for the moment; it will fall to expensive lawyers who will be hired by industries around the country to find out the answers.
<P>
I wish to comment on the Minister's pretence that paragraph 4 of the schedule is somehow merely a translation of article 90(2) of the treaty. I hope that he will attend to the matter because I suspect that he was reading something that was provided to him by officials and that he did not look at article 90(2). Had he done so, I do not think, with his intelligence and seriousness about the matter, that he would have said what he did.
<P>
Article 90(2) is the inverse of what is contained in paragraph 4. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in this Treaty, in particular to the rules on competition, insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It could be argued that the inverted case has the same real effect as the converse one. But article 90(2) continues with a sentence that is not contained in paragraph 4 of schedule 3. There can be no explanation for that, other than that the Minister or his officials intended that it should not be included. The sentence reads: ``The development of trade''--the development of economic activity, as referred to by the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For ``community'' in this context, we should read United Kingdom.
<P>
Even if the obverse and the inverse are the same in their intent, we have a qualifying sentence of the utmost importance that removes from the exemption or exclusion any action that is contrary to the economic interests of the United Kingdom. That has a wholly different force from paragraph 4. Whatever the explanation of paragraph 4 may be, it is not that it brings the provision into line with article 90(2). I do not know why the Minister has been briefed to tell the Committee that it does; it does not. As it does not, the Minister should work out whether he wants to exempt all the revenue-producing monopolies in the United Kingdom, which is what the Bill does, being the first Competition Bill in history to enshrine monopoly, or whether he wants it to do what article 90(2) does, which, on inspection, is quite reasonable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend is being a little generous in his interpretation of the Government's position. I do not think that the inverse and the obverse have the same effect. If one legislates the positive rather than the negative, there is a different inference in the spirit of the legislation and people look to let things off under the British version of the law, whereas they are looking to catch things under the European treaty. On this occasion, I much prefer the European treaty to the version before us.
<P>
My hon. Friend has also given us a specific illustration of a general point that we have often made in Committee, that the law from Europe cannot be applied simply as if there were no difference between inter-state and intra-state trading. Missing out applying it to intra-state trading removes most of the force of the treaty clause. It must be applied directly to intra-state trading because that is what the Bill is about. Inter-state rules will apply intra-state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I fear that my right hon. Friend is right. I was lax in supposing that putting the matter the other way round would necessarily have the same effect, or would be even more likely to do so.
<P>
The last sentence of article 90(2) makes it perfectly clear what was going on when the treaty was developed. There would have been the usual tension in the development and evolution of the European Union between countries that wanted to protect their national interests--the French Government would have wanted to protect Electricite de France, for example. In all those cases, they would have encountered the zeal of those who wanted to see the maximum expansion of free trade principles and competition. The article seems to be designed to say that as far as they could get away with it, so to speak--against the vested interests of certain Governments--all such undertakings had to comply with competition, with the exception that if a member state had been entrusted with a specific monopoly activity, it was to be exempted. Even then, that was qualified by the last sentence of article 90(2), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``trade must not be affected to such an extent'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which was the biting back of the director general.
<P>
The Bill does not contain that articulation. It tilts the court, the Commission or the director general in the opposite direction to look prima facie at a revenue-producing monopoly as something that ought to be allowed to persist without the slightest attack on competition grounds. It is extraordinary for the Minister to write that into a Competition Bill. It should be renamed the Competition and Monopoly (Preservation of Monopolies) Bill. The Minister must face that the Bill will have the opposite effect to the one that he has pronounced. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham will want to bring that to the public's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I do not intend to spend much time on the comments of the hon. Member for West Dorset. He merely repeated his earlier remarks and those of the right hon. Member for Wokingham, to which I responded effectively.
<P>
Paragraph 4 of schedule 3 follows the language of article 90(2). It does not copy all the words, only those that are relevant in a domestic context. The Government have got it right, but the Opposition cannot accept that. We have a Bill which, for the first time in a long time, provides comprehensive proposals on anti-competitive behaviour. I ask my hon. Friends to retain schedule 3 as part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry to detain the Committee, but we are in an even more extraordinary position. The Minister has said that the circumstances to which I referred is not relevant to the domestic context. If that is true, his hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs spent an extremely long time taking the Committee up the garden path. He told us repeatedly that trade was relevant to the domestic context. I remind the Minister that the phrase refers to the development of trade, which the Under-Secretary told us meant the development of economic activity. If that is not relevant in this context, the Bill is not relevant, so I do not know why we are considering it. Clearly, the sentence in article 90(2) is material. It has been omitted for a purpose that the Minister has not explained.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I must admit that I cannot scale the heady heights of intellectual curiosity that has been demonstrated in the Committee during the past hour, and I do not intend to try. I would rather stick to the nuts and bolts of the amendments in the hope that I shall not detain the Committee too long and perhaps elucidate a constructive response from the Minister.
<P>
The Minister will realise that these are probing amendments, concerning issues that have been raised by the Association of Consulting Engineers. I should declare an interest because I am a consulting engineer--non-practising is the phrase, I beleive. Consequently, I receive no remuneration. The only costs involved are my fees, so I receive little in reward, apart from very good company.
<P>
The Association of Consulting Engineers has taken advice on whether the Bill's provisions will change the practice and activities of trade associations. It readily concurs that the dominant view is that the current position will probably remain unchanged. However, a significant minority believes that the Bill could seriously interfere with the legitimate activities of trade associations. The amendments have been tabled to try to end that uncertainty and clarify the position. Of course, it would be unfortunate if the Government were to hamper the legitimate work of trade associations in assisting their members in the development of the business environment in which they operate.
<P>
For example, in the engineering profession and the engineering industry, forms of contract are often extremely bulky and very difficult to assimilate. They may contain unduly onerous terms that may have been incorporated in contracts by clients to their obvious advantage. Small firms rarely have in-house resources to analyse such documents in the time provided. Nor do they have the funds to engage legal advisers to do so on their behalf.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Trade associations such as the Association of Consulting Engineers--there are many others--act on behalf of their members by working with clients to ensure that terms and conditions satisfy the legitimate business needs of all the parties: the client, the consultants, the insurers, the contractors and so on. The ACE has a policy to achieve industry improvement through discussion and negotiation with clients, rather than via confrontational tactics. It issues a series of health warnings about particular developments in contracts that it feels may damage its members' interests.
<P>
This is the nub of the amendments with which we want to probe the Minister. Members of an association are not bound to take the advice that it offers; they decide on a commercial basis whether to accept the risks inherent in signing conditions of engagement about which they have received a health warning from their trade association. That sort of behaviour neither represents a collective refusal to bid for a contract, which would be anti-competitive, nor has as its object or effect the prevention or distortion of competition. Any advice issued by an association to its members is intended to ensure that genuine business needs are properly served. In many instances, such advice is issued to try to prevent a client with a dominant market position from abusing that power.
<P>
Clearly, a balance needs to be struck so that the market is fair to both purchasers and suppliers in the construction services profession. Any advice or guidance by the Director General of Fair Trading should recognise that trade associations serve a crucial commercial purpose. They provide members with statistics, they liaise with and lobby Government and they facilitate cross-border trade through links with overseas associations and undertakings. Trade associations representing professionals, such as the Association of Consulting Engineers, to name but one, have enforceable codes of conduct, and are therefore able to help maintain quality and standards and to protect consumers.
<P>
Amendment No. 138 is intended to extend the clause to include decisions or practices that are not in any formal agreement but which are part of the day-to-day actions that all professional institutions and trade associations of professionals undertake.
<P>
	Amendment No. 139 is intended to extend the clause to cover trade associations for the professional people covered by the schedule. In the past there may have been a marked distinction between the purposes and activities of trade associations, but in recent years the lines have become blurred. There is some overlap between the types of advice proffered by professional institutions and trade associations representing the various professions. If the clause is not amended, there will be a distortion of competition as between professional institutions and trade associations.
<P>
	Amendment No. 136 would extend the clause so that it covered trade associations of those professions specified in paragraph 17, provided that the actions of the trade associations were not an attempt to create a price cartel or to instruct members to fix a price or charge. That should remove the fear that we want to give trade associations any sort of privilege.
<P>
The amendment is intended merely to allow trade associations to go about their normal business of giving advice, without the need constantly to seek the permission of the Director General of Fair Trading. That is the nub of the amendments, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's explanation of how the Bill might deal with those matters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I concur with the broad thrust of the speech of the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey), to whose engineering expertise I defer, which is why I need not extend my remarks. I have only two concerns to mention, the first of which is on the points that the hon. Gentleman made about trade associations. Clearly, there is a degree of sensitivity in ensuring that they do not receive an unfair advantage. That is a proper concern.
<P>
I am unsure about cases where a professional body has an associated organ that functions as a trade association. Although they might be required to be legally separate to maintain the body's professionalism, it is important for the Minister to tease out the relationship between them because it might lead to a redistribution of resources or activity and cause difficulty in the conduct of the profession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I want to question the hon. Gentleman a little to gain a clear understanding of what he is saying. Is he referring to the possibility that a professional organisation or association, having set up a trading body, might offer opportunities to its members, by virtue of their being professionals, that are anti-competitive or unfair within the marketplace? Does he agree that the most important aspect of a professional association is to provide its members with professional guidance, however large or small the member companies might be? Of course, if they are small, they might not be able to afford the market price for such advice. Is not that of the essence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I readily agree with the hon. Gentleman. That is precisely the point, but in certain circumstances--I have no specific case in mind--an association might carry on at a distance an associated trader function, because it did not think it appropriate to retain it within the professional body. That might represent an awkward interface. Although such arrangements might seem perfectly reasonable and might be exempted under another provision, the point must be got right now.
<P>
I would appreciate the Minister's response to my second point. He will have heard Opposition Members express concerns about people using the Bill as a stick to beat the reasonably sensible activities of those in the public domain. We are thinking not only about the conduct of private companies in their commercial activities, or trade associations in connection with their public interest activities, but about whether a private monopoly can operate for a public purpose. There were some interesting exchanges about that during the debate on schedule 3.
<P>
I want to flag the concern about a disaffected member of a profession who had been disciplined under rules that have stood the test of time and are about the maintenance of professional standards. Does the Minister think that such a person could avail himself of the Bill to have another go at a disciplinary hearing that had been properly held? In some cases, it would already be possible to seek relief through judicial review if it had been a kangaroo court, or if the hearing had not been carried out procedurally properly. I do not want to suggest that that should be accpetable, but I am worried that the schedule might by accident introduce another stick with which to beat a professional body that had, for all practical purposes, acted entirely reasonably and responsibly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The list of professional services in schedule 4, to which the amendment relate, is no more, effectively, than a reproduction of the list that appears in schedule 1 to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. Its purpose is simply to carry forward the exclusion under that Act to the new regime. When a professional body's rules have not had to comply with the current Act, they should not be subject to the chapter I prohibition, subject to the ability to withdraw the exclusion when it has been established that there are competition abuses.
<P>
The definitions are not designed to confer recognition or respectability--even if that were deserved--or to establish new statutory definitions or anything else. We have therefore not included any power to add to the provisions that are excluded. On the contrary, duties are imposed on the Secretary of State and on the director general to keep the exclusions under review and, where justified, to revoke the designation of the rules which confers excluson.
<P>
I am surprised that amendments Nos. 136 asnd 139 have been tabled by the hon. Members for Eastleigh, for South-East Cornwall (Mr Breed) and for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). On Second Reading, Liberal Democrat Members tabled a motion that criticised the exclusion of professional rules from the chapter I prohibition. The motion said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``That this House|declines to give Second Reading to the Competition Bill [Lords] because of fundamental weaknesses including the exclusion of professional rules from the prohibition, which will lead to a continuation of unfair competitive advantage for many of the professions listed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Eastleigh said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other rules, which restrict advertising or the display of prices, or which set minimum fees, regardless of the service level provided, are clearly anti-competitive.``--[Official Report, 11 May 1998; Vol. 312, c. 57.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats now propose to extend the scope of the exclusion and to do so for matters for which there is no justification to treat the professions differently from other sectors of the economy. We understand that the amendment may be probing. However, it is not quite in line with what Liberal Democrat Members proposed on Second Reading.
<P>
	I empahsise that the scope of the exclusion in schedule 4 is much narrower than that provided by the equivalent schedule in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, which covers all agreements that relate to prescribed services. For example, competing members of a profession in one area could agree among themselves the rates that they charge and would not be caught by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. There is no justification for such an exclusion from the Bill.
<P>
The exclusion in schedule 4 extends only to some professional rules. Such rules are different from the normal run of agreements into which businesses may enter. Their purpose is to protect the public, and they have attached to them disciplinary arrangements, which often involve some judicial process under which penalties can be severe. They are often subject to approval by Ministers or by members of the judiciary. In such ways, they may be a form of public law. We believe that, in the light of those considerations, when professional rules have not hitherto had to be subject to the procedures of the relevant competition law, there is a case for giving them a form of presumptive validity, with the proviso that the director general can review them for competition anxieties, and that the exclusion can be brought to an end in appropriate cases. That is what schedule 4 achieves.
<P>
However, those considerations are not relevant to the matters that the hon. Gentleman would like added to the exclusion. I see no case for advice by professional bodies to be capable of exclusion from the chapter I prohibition, except to the extent to which it constitutes a professional rule. I see no case for treating the activities of trade associations for the professions any differently than those for any other occupation or sector. Although I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman has been careful to leave prescribing charges and fees outside the scope of the exclusion, many other matters would be covered by the amendments that in principle could be anti-competitive and that should fall to be considered under the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
In tabling amendment No. 138, Liberal Democrats seem to have overlooked clause 2(5) and (6). It is unnecessary to add the words in the amendment, because in part I of the Bill, and hence in schedule 4, unless the context otherwise requires, references to ``agreements'' are to be read, with any necessary modifications, as including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 137 proposes that the director general should give advice to trade associations within 10 working days. I presume that it refers to the provisions of clauses 13, 14, 21 and 22, under which parties can notify agreements and conduct to the director general for guidance or decision.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand business's interest in guidance and decisions being given promptly. With this in mind, schedule 9 elaborates on the rules that may be made under clause 51. Paragraph 2 of the schedule provides, among other things, that the rules may make provision for an application for a decision and an application for guidance to be dealt with according to a timetable.
<P>
As we confirmed in another place, the Secretary of State intends that the director general should make rules setting himself a timetable once the system has bedded down. My right hon. Friend has a power under clause 51(10) to direct the director general to make rules about a particular matter if she thinks that he should do so.
<P>
I do not think that it is reasonable to go any further in respect of a timetable, or positively to discriminate in favour of trade associations as opposed to other businesses that will notify the director general. The Bill already provides a remedy when there has been undue delay on the part of the director general in determining an application, which I expect to bring into force when the system has bedded down. Paragraphs 7 of schedule 5 and 6 provide for a person to apply to a court, which may give such directions to the director general as it considers appropriate for securing the determination of the application without unnecessary further delay. We are proposing arrangments under which the director general must operate fairly and effectively and consider applications without delay.
<P>
I am informed that the guidelines that are being published under clause 52 will deal with the activities of trade associations. I expect the guidelines to help trade associations to decide whether their activities are likely to be in breach of the prohibitions, and so cut the number of unnecessary notifications. I will ensure that the trade associations are involved in the processes so that, in practice, they can contribute to discussions on the matters that I have set out in my response.
<P>
I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Member for Eastleigh to withdraw the amendment. My reply has been technical, but the subject matter of the amendment is technical. I hope that I have satisfied him that the Government have an even-handed and balanced view on trade associations and professions and that we support the increased activity of those organisations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened to the Minister's opening remarks with surprise almost bordering on shock. I have never heard anyone suggest that I would say one thing in one part of the House and the opposite in another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a Liberal Democrat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> For the benefit of the Official Report, I should point out that that was said ironically.
<P>
I still feel that the Minister was unjust in his response. I did not suggest that the amendment would give a professional association or body the opportunity to engage in any anti-competitive practice. I believe that I said that a balance needs to be struck, which is the essence of my argument.
<P>
I was gratified to hear the Minister say, albeit grudgingly, that he takes seriously the technical issues that the amendments raise and that he is prepared to discuss them with the trade associations. I am a little heartened that, at the end if his tirade, he acknowledged that I was making constructive comments. Consequently, in all good faith, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 58, line 8, after `advocates', insert `, notaries public'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 57, in page 58, leave out lines 10 and 11 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `2. The services of medical practitioners.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 82, in page 58, leave out line 16 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `4. The services of ophthalmic opticians, optometrists and dispensing opticians other than the sale or supply of optical appliances.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 51, in page 59, leave out lines 17 to 25 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `17. The services of chartered or incorporated engineers or engineering technicians'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Once more into the fray; let us hope that we have a constructive debate on these amendments.
<P>
The Minister will be aware from Second Reading--I speak from clear memory and will be saying exactly what I said then--that there is a great deal of confusion in the Bill about the description of the various professions. A number of professional organisations have approached not just Opposition members of the Committee but, no doubt, the Minister and his colleagues.
<P>
The amendments deal specifically with the description and definition of various professions within their professional rules. Advocates and notaries public, medical practitioners, opticians and, of course engineers, to mention just a few, have expressed deep concern about the way in which their professions are described in schedule 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): I intervene on the hon. Gentleman because at one stage of my professional career, I was a notary public. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman knows what a notary public does. I wonder if he knows whether there are any notaries public in Scotland who are not solicitors. I wonder whether he knows about the statutory basis of the rules for notaries public, which have absolutely nothing to do with agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> What a splendid intervention--and so unexpected as well. The issue that I am trying to bring to the Committee's attention is the definition of the names of various professions. I would not for one minute profess any knowledge of what notaries public do or how they earn their money; but I suggest that they are probably pretty expensive--compared with engineers, anyway. The issue is the names and descriptions of those professions in schedule 4.
<P>
As was said on Second Reading, the Engineering Council, which expressed a number of concerns, pointed out that it is recognised by the Government as the voice of engineering, and that it maintains a register of about 300,000 engineers, many of whom would not currently be covered by the definition in schedule 4. The engineering profession has established through the Engineering Council three grades of professional engineer: chartered and incorporated engineers and engineering technicians.
<P>
The Government have a memorandum of understanding with the Engineering Council, which was referred to on Second Reading; the Government recognise the authority of the council. It is only logical that the definitions already used by the Engineering Council should also be recognised by the Government. Indeed, they are recognised by the Government, so why are they not used in the Bill? That appears illogical.
<P>
If you do not rule me out of order, Mr. Atkinson, I would like to ask whether we have an ophthalmic opticians, optometrists or dispensing opticians in Committee today who may want to explain to me what they do. Perhaps they will give me a better pair of glasses. Nevertheless, times have moved on since earlier legislation dealt with professional services and professional rules.
<P>
I think that the Minister will agree that the purpose of the Bill, at least in part, is to update existing legislation. The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, for example, is obviously more than 20 years old. The Government have said in numerous statements and in correspondence that they propose simply to carry forward into the Bill an exclusion for professional rules of those professions currently excluded under the old Acts. They appear to be saying that they want to carry forward the existing exclusions because they want to carry forward the existing exclusions. I hope that by the end of the afternoon we can do better than that.
<P>
Moreover, it appears that if the rules of a profession are in danger of falling foul of the 1976 Act, the Government are saying that they see no reason why they should not have to comply with the chapter I prohibition of the Bill. That misses the point. Surely the purpose of updating the legislation is precisely to improve it. The fact is that the services listed in schedule 1 to the 1976 Act are now out of date.
<P>
The Government may prefer to have no exclusions for professional rules; perhaps they realise that if the Bill did not carry forward the existing exclusions, quite an argument would result. Times have changed. Professions have developed. Professional services are modified; they expand or contract; they are unproofed. The rules of professional bodies are consequently modified to take account of those changes.
<P>
If schedule 4 is to serve any purpose, it must surely take account of the new reality. If the Goverment disagreee, why do they not simply withdraw it? It is either worth having or it is not. If it is worth having, it is worth getting right.
<P>
I could entertain the Committee by describing the differences between optometrists, ophthalmologists, opticians, dispensing opticians and ophthalmic opticians, all of whom have different roles in their professional societies, all of which have distinct responsibilities. Seeing your face, Mr. Atkinson, perhaps I should not go any further. However, on the question of competition, optometrists and dispensing opticians recognise that any professional rules relating to their activities must stand or fall on their merits. I seek clarification from the Minister on how those rules will be interpreted under the Bill.
<P>
If the Bill has been designed to catch only anti-competitive agreements, there will presumably be no need for exclusions for professional rules. In other words, professional rules would be the subject of an objective test of anti-competitiveness. I suspect that that is being done because the Government do not want to be forced to deal with professional rules on a case-by-case basis. Schedule 4 is designed to remove that problem, yet some of the rules excluded by schedule 4 are more than 20 years out of date. The Government's proposals are flawed. Unless they bring the Bill up to date and recognise how the professions have changed, we shall have bad legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Again, I understand the line of argument developed by the hon. Member for Eastleigh, and I have some sympathy with it. Perhaps it should be taken in conjunction with the Minister's clarification on earlier amendments, when he made it as clear as he could that the existence of professional rules, if not an embarassment, was something that he was anxious to cut down and narrow. He explained the interpretation of the 1976 Act, and how he was further narrowing the scope of professional rules to the bare minimum of what Europeans would call the acquis--those professional rules that are currently excluded under the RPTA.
<P>
There is a further point, which concerns not only the nature of the rules to be excluded but the nature of the professions to be defined. I might differ with the hon. Member for Eastleigh on the most interesting part--if I may say so, modestly, it is the part that I mentioned on Second Reading--which is the definition of professional services rather than the procedural point on the rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I may be pre-empting the hon. Gentleman, but in his remarks about his understanding of, and perhaps agreement with, the Minister's remarks, he mentioned an attempt to tighten the application of professional rules. Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that defining engineers in only three grades, as proposed in amendment No. 51, is a considerably tighter definition than that proposed in the Bill, which, among many other trades and professions, calls farmers engineers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman specifically anticipates a point that I was about to make. I have no particular professional involvement in any other profession. I could not readily tell the difference between the various practitioners connected with eyes in a way that would be plausible to the Committee. If they want changes better to reflect the actual pattern of those matters, unless in some way they create a difficulty for the Minister by widening the definition, it would appear sensible to bring it up to date and improve it. That is not a disguised attempt to widen the Bill; it is an attempt to achieve a slightly sharper focus.
<P>
If I were a judge considering a case fought about whether an exclusion should be applied, I should like to see that based on an up-to-date definition of a profession or a professional service, rather than on a 1976 definition. We should not be informed by a misplaced conservatism, just because the Act happens to have been passed under a Labour Government and operated broadly satisfactorily by their Conservative successors.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh is right; there is a problem with what the Bill says about engineering. It may be--I remember making inquiries about this with reference to a previous Bill--that the description of engineering in paragraph 17 of part II of the schedule is a piece of bad architecture. It is not strictly amendable, I think, to read, ``Engineering etc.''; perhaps it should read, ``Engineering and other professional services.''
<P>
When I first read the schedule, I was slightly surprised to see that if I were practising or employed as a consultant in the field of agronomy--I never have been, but I know a little bit about it--I might appear as an engineer. If I may say so, that is an insult. I am not sure that an engineer would want to be called an agronomist either. That appears to be a little sloppy.
<P>
The Minister may choose narrowly to re-enact everything; no doubt he is worried that if he does not do that he may widen the scope of the Bill. If he comes out and says that that is why he does not want to change the definition, we will consider that sympathetically. Alternatively, he can try, within the framework of his intention not to widen the definition, to reshape it in a way that makes it slightly more relevant to modern conditions. The specific points that I have mentioned make me worried that it may do more harm than good if the definition appears in an unrealistic form in a modern Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 141, moved by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I had not noticed that he had tabled it, and tabled an alternative form of words in an amendment that is at present still starred.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) on his vigilance in interrupting the placidity on the Government Benches by leaping into the debate with what was obviously extremely relevant practical knowledge. Perhaps because he was armed by that degree of knowledge, he explored the debate that occurred in another place on the subject of notaries public with particular relation to Scotland.
<P>
On 9 February, Lord Haskel replied on behalf of the Government and explained that notaries public were not in the list in schedule 1 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, but those who had moved the amendment argued that that was an oversight that should be corrected. Lord Haskel stood on the position that the wording should simply be transferred from the RTPA.
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland, to which the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun will pay at least some deference, has advised the Committee that the professions of barrister, advocate and solicitor are not the only legal professions in the United Kingdom that issue professional rules or are regulated by law. The profession of notaries public is regulated in Scotland by the Law Society of Scotland under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. I observe from the illuminating debate in the House of Lords that, in Scotland, notaries were nationalised as long ago as the reign of Mary Queen of Scots; the royal prerogative in relation to notaries was given up only in 1990. The Act to which the Law Society of Scotland refers is the 1980 Act.
<P>
The noble Lord Haskel concluded his speech by commenting on the position in Scotland. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am not sure whether it is appropriate to discuss that at this stage. We shall be debating later the effect of the Bill in Scotland. It may well be that Scottish notaries could be debated then.''--[Official Report, House of Lords, 9th February 1998; Vol. 585, c.978.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not, I fear, sufficiently familiar with the progress of the Bill in the Lords to know whether that debate has been held; none the less, the profession believes that it was omitted from the previous Act as a result of an oversight, which raises the question of whether such an oversight should be corrected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Doran </B>(Aberdeen, Central): I assure the right hon. Gentleman, that we are not trying to pack the Committee. I, too, am a former Scottish notary. It is a long time since we have outweighed other professions, so we will make the most of it.
<P>
The simple point that needs to be made, and my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun did so, is that the office of notary in Scotland has a statutory base; it therefore is not a trade or profession that should be covered by the schedule. I understand the points made by the Law Society of Scotland, but, as a former member of that society, I must say that they are not relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman's comment. It is a refreshing feature of the modernisation of the House that the Committee can draw on the expertise of a parliamentary private secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I do not want to go over our earlier debate, so I shall deal with the specific points made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the Fair Trading Act 1973 as a Labour Act, whereas it was a Tory Act; the 1976 Act was a consolidating measure. I am not attacking him, but I must ensure that the historical record is correct because the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has historical records stretching back to Magna Carta.
<P>
I shall now deal specifically with amendments Nos. 82 and 51. It is far from clear why it is thought necessary to expand the definition of ophthalmic services--``the testing of sight''. If, for example, there is currently a professional rule that requires that when an optician is testing sight he or she must check for the presence of glaucoma, that is a rule regulating the profession of the testing of sight. Only if some aspect of the services involved were services performed in their own right rather than as preparatory to or in the course of sight testing would there be any difficulty with schedule 4 as drafted. The position will be no different when that provision is enacted than it is under the 1976 Act.
<P>
Concerns have been expressed that the profession of engineering is not properly dealt with in the Bill. We accept that engineering has been an undervalued profession in this country, and we welcome the efforts that are being made to raise its status.
<P>
Hon. Members have always taken opportunities to work with the industry on projects that the DTI has run under this and the previous Government aimed at promoting engineering in schools, at promoting engineering as a career and at promoting the interrelationship between engineers and political organisations to further understanding of the importance of engineering to the life of this country. I have met members of the profession and I value the contribution that they are making.
<P>
The purpose is not to confer a mark of respectability on particular professions but simply to carry forward an existing exclusion from competition law for certain professional rules. Some professions have had to adapt their procedures to competition law; those excluded from the 1976 Act have not had to do so, and we are reluctant to cut across the procedures whereby professions adopt rules. That is the point that the hon. Member for Daventry asked me to make, and I am happy to confirm that that is the case.
<P>
The definition of engineering has been a legal basis for exclusion from the relevant competition law since 1973. We are not aware that any problem has arisen from that; nor has any argument for change been made on the grounds of practicality or experience. We have found no evidence to support the argument for change.
<P>
A difficulty with amendment No. 51 is that it would significantly narrow the scope of the services, the professional rules of which may be designated under the Bill. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Eastleigh and others have consulted practitioners in all the services that are described in paragraph 17 of part II of schedule 4, including those who practise in anlogous forms of engineering or technology, as to why their current exclusion should be ended.
<P>
On amendment No. 141, there are two further reasons why it would be inappropriate to add notaries to the list. Frist, there is substantial overlap between the profession of solicitors and that of notaries. Solicitors are already included in the list and, therefore, it seems somewhat supernumerary to add notaries. Secondly, we consider the addition of notaries to the list to be not only redundant, but inappropriate.
<P>
The chapter I prohibition bites on agreements between undertakings, decisions between associations of undertakings and concerted practices. It does not deal with requirements imposed under statute, which is the basis of the regulation of notaries. Clearly, there is no need to exclude something that does not apply in the first place. That is not necessarily the case for all the rules of the professions listed in schedule 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I was thinking carefully about what the Minister was saying about the description of engineers. Of course, I thank him for his kind words about the profession, but it is not a matter of a profession's status. We have our own furrow to plough about such issues, which are not part of the Committee's deliberations. The reason for tabling the amendment was not, primarily, professional status; it was to recognise the fact that the Government want to narrow the applciation to bodies with professional rules.
<P>
The concern is that the general list of those who might loosely be called engineers--even if they are also farmers, or whatever--that has been introduced from previous legislation is, first, cumbersome and unnecessary, and secondly, unable to embrace engineering professions that might emerge in future. We do not know what those professions might be, given how technology changes. Will the Minister accept that we are trying to narrow the definition, rather than expand it?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I recognise the hon. Gentleman's point; it was made when I met the engineers' organisations themselves. We had an extremely lengthy meeting, during which they had an opportunity to put their case, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. We were carrying forward an exclusion, and we found no justification for making a change. Hitherto, professional services that have been subject to the regime under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act regime have had their rules designed so as to conform to the requirements of the relevant legislation.
<P>
I listened carefully to the organisations and considered whether the submission that they made would require us to table an amendment. On balance, I decided that it would not require such an amendment and that we had taken the correct decision. That does not mean that we have no sympathy with the profession's activities and the reasons why it wants to promote itself and develop relationships; I think that the hon. Member for Eastleigh can take it as read that that is not the reason I am resisting the amendment. We have made a balanced judgment, no more nor less than that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister said. We understand each other, even if we do not agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman concludes, will he join me in remarking on the fact that he and I have sought to find alternative wordings in our amendments? I mean no discourtesy to the Minister, who has conducted the Committee in an extremely good-natured manner, but he read the reply given by the noble Lord Haskel, with the omission of one sentence that related to the first argument. It says:

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman. It would seem clear that we need the servcies of a notary public.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> One is wiser after the event.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> In some cases. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 4 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Individual exemptions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I hope that it will not be misinterpreted if I rise to speak to clause 4. I shall be brief as I am conscious of the time, but I should make one or two remarks on matters that may arise on clauses that we shall consider later.
<P>
The clause brings us back to the chapter I prohibition and introduces us to a new character--the director. The clause is an extraordinarily constipated way of defining the director. The notes on clauses, which are not always helpful, does so in a way that even I understand. They explain that, according to the definition of clause 59, the director means the Director General of Fair Trading, but they also suggest that references to the director are to be read by virtue of clause 54 and schedule 10 as including reference to the sectoral regulators, who are to be entitled to exercise concurrently with the director most of his functions under part I of the Bill. There may be a better opportunity to discuss concurrent powers later, but I make that point because it does not spring from the drafting that the director may be one of eight persons acting concurrently.
<P>
The Director General of Fair Trading is engaged in an extensive programme of consultation, which will give rise to a number of documents and guides to the Act--I notice, indeed, that the consultation period on one of the documents expires today, and I hope that we shall hear more about that--but the director will need a series of ground rules, which will need to be understood by people in business, on how the individual exemptions, a narrower and less extensive concept than the exclusions that we have hitherto been debating, are to be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As my hon. Friend rightly observes, it is of the utmost importance that businesses know of the framework in which they will be obliged to operate; that certainty is essential. Does he agree that it is important that subsection 3(b) is clarified? At present, it specifies that the exemption
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has effect for such period as the Director considers appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important that at the time of the granting of that exemption businesses are informed by the director of the minimum period for which it can be expected to apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a characteristically helpful comment. We would like a little more clarification on the timing.
<P>
<B>Mr McCartney: May I also be characteristically helpful? Under subsection </B>(4):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``That period must be specified in the grant of the exemption.``<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That pretty well deals with the point. However, it would be helpful if the Minister, on behalf of the director general, could tell us a little more about the circumstances in which exemptions might be considered, how much information there is currently available on how they will operate, and the sorts of cases that might be appropriate.
<P>
Having said that, my concluding point is to stress to the Minister that I find nothing to cavil about in the business of exemption. There will be consideration under clause 5 of the withdrawal of that exemption. Frankly, it is a more sensitive matter because it is taking away exemptions that have been given, rather than conferring exemptions.
<P>
As there is nothing in the clause that is apparently objectionable, it would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that there have been no material adverse representations about it and that everyone is happy with it in its present form. In other words, if the Minister can tell us a little more about what it is about, and that no one is upset about it, we can give it a fair wind.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he has put his argument. I hope that my response is helpful. To my knowledge, there has been no adverse comment about the clause. Of course, there may be correspondence about it in the Department, and if so, I will inform the hon. Gentleman. It is my understanding that the clause has not stirred up any controversy in any shape or form.
<P>
The clause empowers the director general to grant an individual exemption from the chapter I prohibition for a particular agreement which meets the exemption criteria set out in clause 9. The clause confers on him the flexibility to grant an exemption subject to conditions or obligations and for such a period as he considers appropriate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me for an example. An example of an agreement which might have anti-competitive effects, but may merit exemption because of its countervailing benefits, is a joint venture between competitors to produce an improvement in their existing product lines. Such an agreement might have benefits for the consumer in terms of increasing the range of products available. In those circumstances, on balance that agreement may merit exemption because of its countervailing benefits. A judgment has to be made. The evidence has to be produced and matters must be handled in a transparent way. There must be opportunities to comment on that.
<P>
The power conferred by the clause reflects the power the European Commission has to grant individual exemptions from the article 85 prohibition. Here, it is the director general and the sectoral regulators, where relevant, who will be able to decide whether an agreement merits an individual exemption. This goes back to the evidence-based approach.
<P>
In addition to individual exemptions granted by the director general, there will be those which are granted at Community level, whether individually or by way of block exemption. Agreements which are exempt at European level are parallel exempt from the domestic prohibition by virtue of clause 10.
<P>
I hope that those explanations will enable hon. Members to agree that that clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
