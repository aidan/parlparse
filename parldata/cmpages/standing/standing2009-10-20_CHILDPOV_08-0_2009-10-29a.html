Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): I am delighted to have
discovered just now, Mr. Key, that your daughter is one of
my constituents, which is a very nice thing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>say. I am sure that you had impeccable child care
for her when she was being brought up, which brings me back to the
subject that I was talking about before the Committee adjourned. I will
not be long.</div>
<a name="09102944000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North in saying that we should include child care as a
specific point in the Bill. I oppose putting in a load of amendments
that cover specific categories of people or geographic areas, but child
care, as a specific service, deserves to be put explicitly in the Bill.
I was of that mind before I heard my hon. Friend&#146;s speech, but
after she went through some of the many complexities that need dealing
with, I was even more convinced that child care should stand as a
separate aspect of the Bill and a separate building
block.</div><a name="09102944000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Bishop Auckland, intervened just before the Committee
adjourned, to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s
Park and Kensington, North on her concerns about the migration of lone
parents between income support and jobseeker&#146;s allowance and the
difficulty in relation to child care issues. That made me realise even
more one of the many complexities involved, how all the various issues
that we are talking about, including a number of the building blocks in
subsection (5), interrelate and why it is therefore important that
child care should stand as a separate item. Child care is fundamental
to dealing with the issues of child poverty and the family
relationships that we talked about earlier, and to how we deal with the
issues in the Bill and meet our
objectives.</div><a name="09102944000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not rehearse all the arguments, because my hon. Friend covered
many of them. I shall refer just to two other issues that make me
concerned that child care should be highlighted separately. The county
of Derbyshire, which is my county and that of my hon. Friend the Member
for Erewash, has been at the forefront of promoting and taking up the
Government&#146;s initiatives on child care in recent years and of
promoting Sure Start schemes. I am deeply concerned that if child care
does not have the prominence that it needs, that could&#151;even
though there will be good intentions and good statements from other
political parties&#151;be under threat. That will be very damaging to
the cause of trying to eliminate child poverty.</div>
<a name="09102944000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
we have just lost the elections in our county and I do not trust the
current regime. Specific ideological issues are raised about how we
proceed. I know that the Opposition say that they, too, support Sure
Start, but that would be in a very different way, because they plan to
cut money from that programme. They say that they will deal with it by
increasing vastly the number of health visitors, but by removing other
outreach workers; they will also cut that
scheme.</div><a name="09102944000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102944000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): I may have
missed this, despite being a member of the Select Committee on
Children, Schools and Families, but the Government have not stated that
the parlous level of cuts as a result of their financial mismanagement
will not necessarily come down on Sure Start
centres.</div><a name="09102944000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000459"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> The hon. Gentleman may have noticed that we do
not think that the recession should be dealt with through cuts. The
recession should be dealt with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>through increased growth and, although obviously there will be very
tight financial regimes, it is clear if one looks at the record of last
week&#146;s debate in Westminster Hall on Sure Start that we have a
continuing and very strong commitment to
it.</div><a name="09102944000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
my point is about not the level of funding for that area as much as the
different views on how we make progress and what type of services
should be provided with regard to child care, Sure Start and the whole
provision for the under-fives and children over that age. That has been
highlighted in debates that we have had and will continue to have. It
is very important that we highlight child care as a specific area to
which attention needs to be paid. I shall raise one
other&#151;</div><a name="09102944000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000460"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Will the hon. Lady give way
again?</div><a name="09102944000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000461"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> We do not have much time in this debate, but I
will give
way.</div><a name="09102944000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000462"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Lady is raising important points, so I am
grateful to her for giving way again. One difference in approach that
she rightly identifies between the parties relates to health visitors.
The Labour Government have dismantled the universal health visitor
system, but the Conservatives are committed to restoring universal
health visiting&#151;not a token health visitor in each Sure Start
centre, but universal health visiting. Does the hon. Lady support that
Conservative initiative?</div>
<a name="09102944000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000463"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I completely contest that that is the situation.
Families do have health visitors. The question is what kind of workers
they have, for how many visits and for what ages. When I was canvassing
in a recent election, I put that point to one parent, who said,
&#147;We as a family do not need a health visitor for a long time; we
need some other provision for my older child, who&#146;s not an
under-five.&#148; This is a complex area, and that is precisely my
point. I am sure that we will continue to have these debates. I contest
that taking away all the other outreach work is of any benefit
whatever. That highlights the importance of including child care as a
separate building block.</div>
<a name="09102944000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000464"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> My hon. Friend will have heard the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness say that he wanted to stop overstating his
case. Does she, like me, look forward to this new era
commencing?</div>
<a name="09102944000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000465"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I do indeed, but I did feel that I should allow
him to intervene&#151;he was very good at provoking me into wishing
to intervene on him, so it was only
fair.</div><a name="09102944000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other example of the complex way in which all these building blocks fit
together is equal pay. Earlier this week, I was a bit astounded to hear
on the radio a Conservative Front-Bench spokeswoman who was discussing
equal pay with the Solicitor-General fall into the trap of implying
that the equal pay gap, which we all deplore&#151;I have tabled an
early-day motion on the issue, and I hope that everybody will sign it,
if they have not already done so&#151;was caused principally by
direct discrimination. The equal pay gap is important because it
relates to whether women, especially those who live 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>by themselves, have enough money to bring up their
families. It has three main causes. One is discrimination. Another,
huge reason is occupational segregation. Then, there are all the issues
relating to child care, family and living relationships, which also
affect occupational segregation. All those issues lead to an equal pay
gap, which makes it difficult for women to earn an income for their
families. That is another area of complexity, which ties into child
care provision. It is one of the key reasons why women go into
particular jobs and why they have particular types of pay.</div>
<a name="09102944000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
just a couple of examples. One is Sure Start, which has already
provoked some debate about what we should be doing. The other is equal
pay, and my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North spoke cogently of the complexities earlier. We should
therefore highlight child care as an important issue, and it should
have its own specific place in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09102944000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000466"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I welcome you back as Chairman of our Committee,
Mr. Key. This is the first opportunity that I have had to do
that today.</div>
<a name="09102944000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday,
we debated the clear focus in the Bill on tackling income poverty and
material deprivation, because of the evidence of the impact of poverty
on children&#146;s lives&#151;their experiences now and their
chances for the future. A strategy to tackle child poverty will need to
be wide-ranging and will certainly need to cover many, and perhaps all,
of the issues that Members have raised in their amendments. However, my
concern is that we should not lose the clear focus on income poverty
and material deprivation by, as my hon. Friend the Member for Amber
Valley has suggested, adding lots of extra things. Were we to go down
the road of putting lots of baubles on the tree, we would necessarily
end up with a strategy that tackled each of the issues, but which
perhaps did not tackle other things that, as might become clear, were
also important.</div>
<a name="09102944000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The strategy
required by the Bill will need to consider measures in a number of
broad policy areas, encompassing the main drivers of child poverty,
including parental skills and employment; financial support for
families with children; promoting outcomes for children in health,
education and social services; improving the quality of housing; and
promoting social inclusion. Those issues are set out in the clause, and
they were chosen as a result of lots of detailed analysis of the
barriers to eradicating child poverty through extended discussion and
consultation with organisations and people both inside and outside
Government.</div>
<a name="09102944000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
deliberately avoids being too prescriptive about the content of the
strategy. Each three-year strategy will need to respond to
circumstances that change between now and 2020, building on evidence
about what works in tackling child poverty. More specific measures will
need to be considered, as appropriate, for each three-year
phase.</div><a name="09102944000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000467"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am struggling to follow the Minister&#146;s
case. He seems to be saying that the focus of the Bill is on income
deprivation, and subsection 5(a) and (b) are about improving the skills
and employability of parents and the provision of financial support,
which go to the heart of what he is saying. However, what I do not
understand, and he has not really explained it, is why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>health, education, social services, housing,
environment and social inclusion are there but not transport and other
things. If the Minister&#146;s point was intellectually correct,
surely he should drop paragraphs (c) and (d) because inevitably and
rightly Members across the Committee will put forward other things that
they think are just as relevant and
important.</div><a name="09102944000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000468"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> No, and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
referred to that earlier on. Those broad areas have been widely
discussed in the specific context of this legislation and tackling
child poverty. Our view is that the broad areas set out in that part of
clause 8 cover the principal
drivers.</div><a name="09102944000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102944000469"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I think that the
Minister will agree that subsection (5) really relates to the original
building blocks in the document, &#147;Ending child poverty:
everybody&#146;s business&#148;, which his Department signed up to
earlier this year. Why has family, which was in that document, been
dropped from subsection
(5)?</div><a name="09102944000056"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000470"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to the extent that the
document that he showed to the Committee earlier set out the building
blocks. There was a lot of consultation around them, and the
consequence of that is what we can see in the Bill. I will come to the
topic that he has raised when I get to his
amendment.</div><a name="09102944000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1, which the hon. Gentleman moved, suggests that promoting economic
enterprise should be added to the list of areas that need to be
considered. Taking steps to promote enterprise, particularly among
low-income families, will certainly have a role to play in reducing
levels of child poverty. A strategy will need to address job creation.
The flexibility associated with self-employment could, in a number of
cases, help lone parents back into work. We are working to ensure that
as many people as possible can get back to work in the economic
downturn, and the hon. Gentleman will welcome the fact that in the
six-month self-employment offer, introduced nationally from April this
year, specific support for self-employment among jobseekers is being
offered. Self-employment was a major strand in the early new deal. For
some time, I have felt that we could make more of the potential of
self-employment, and I am pleased that that is now being
done.</div><a name="09102944000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
clause 8 already requires a Secretary of State to consider measures in
relation to promoting and facilitating parental employment and skills,
it would be superfluous to add the specific point that amendment 1
includes. I would make similar points about a number of other
amendments in the group.</div>
<a name="09102944000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 2
is on family breakdown, and I will come to the point that the hon.
Gentleman raised and spoke about this morning. I applaud his efforts to
seek a consensus on the issue of family breakdown. He was very careful
in the language that he used, and he is right to say that that
consensus would be a desirable state of affairs. However, the
relationship between family breakdown is not a straightforward one.
That point was made in other speeches this morning, but let me go a bit
further.</div>
<a name="09102944000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sweden,
Norway, Finland and Denmark all have relatively high rates of family
breakdown, but relatively low levels of child poverty. That is because
they have relatively high levels of lone parent employment: in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>Scandinavian countries, it is about 70 per cent., or in the 70s, whereas
in the UK it is 56 per cent. The UK figure is a great deal higher than
it used to be, but is still lower than that in
Scandinavia.</div>
<a name="09102944000423"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09102944000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire for
acknowledging that poverty has a negative impact on relationships and
can often be the cause of family breakdown. I agree that that does not
mean that the Government should not care about family breakdown. There
is certainly a link between parental separation and a raised risk of
poverty, and we are committed to supporting families who are
experiencing relationship problems. In the next two years, we will
provide more than &#163;7 million to third-sector organisations that
work with such families&#151;the kinds of organisations that he has
praised this morning.</div>
<a name="09102944000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
promoted measures to support parents in maintaining strong
relationships and to support those who are experiencing family
breakdown. Last December, the Department for Children, Schools and
Families announced a series of measures, including local pilots. The
hon. Gentleman might be particularly encouraged to hear that we will
soon publish a families Green Paper that will set out further proposals
on how the Government can support families. That document will give him
and other Members, on both sides of the House, the opportunity to
explore these important points further. We have also commissioned
independent, qualitative research to help us to understand what
relationship support adults, particularly parents, need. We expect the
results of that research to be available by the end of this year, and
they will be used to inform the development of future policy.</div>
<a name="09102944000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other issues
have been raised in the debate on this sub-group of amendments,
including support for families, families who have a disabled member and
ethnic minority groups. Those are just three of many factors that we
will need to consider when preparing our child poverty strategy. We
anticipate that the strategy will outline the specific action required
to meet the needs of the most vulnerable groups of children and
parents.</div>
<a name="09102944000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 20
highlights the role of the criminal justice system. Again, there is a
good deal of work going on in this area. We are prioritising action to
support families who are at risk, including the families of offenders,
through the national roll-out of the &#147;Think Family&#148;
initiative. A multi-agency approach to supporting children, families
and offenders will be launched at the national &#147;Think
Family&#148; conference next week. The National Offender Management
Service and the DCSF have a joint programme that includes the
&#147;Hidden Sentence&#148; awareness training programme for people
who work with families in custody, as well as the use of family support
workers in three prison pilot sites.</div>
<a name="09102944000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North, who was unable to
attend this afternoon&#146;s sitting, will be interested to learn
that an estimated 160,000 young people are affected each year by
parental imprisonment; the problem is not a small one. Those young
people often suffer hardships such as poverty, bullying, stress,
educational disadvantage and other forms of exclusion. The children of
offenders are three times more likely than their peers to have mental
health problems or to take part in some kind of antisocial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>behaviour. Nearly two thirds&#151;65 per cent.&#151;of boys who have
a parent in prison will go on to commit some kind of crime.</div>
<a name="09102944000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend raised important points on this issue, particularly about the
delay between someone leaving custody and being able to get into the
benefit system and access housing and job support. She is absolutely
right about how much of a problem that can be, and that is the reason
for the fresh start programme, which focuses directly on accelerating
the progress of offenders into job searching, through Jobcentre Plus,
and into the benefit system, through my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary&#146;s Department. For people leaving prison, getting
a job is the best possible thing that can
happen.</div><a name="09102944000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
30 raises the issue of transport. I certainly agree that good,
accessible, affordable transport can help to tackle child poverty, for
example, by enabling access to services and employment. However, as
with the other issues, it would not be a good idea simply to add
transport to the list. The clause already captures the need to ensure
the provision of good local services, including transport, under the
topic of the built and natural environment and the promotion of social
inclusion.</div><a name="09102944000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subject of transport is also reflected in the duties on local
authorities and other bodies in England to co-operate to reduce and
mitigate the effects of child poverty. Indeed, integrated transport
authorities are listed in clause 19 as partner authorities, with which
the responsible local authority must co-operate to reduce child poverty
in the local area. We have also specifically listed Transport for
London in clause 19.</div>
<a name="09102944000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 47,
which was moved by the hon. Member for Northavon, and amendment 50,
which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park
and Kensington, North and supported by my hon. Friend the Member for
Amber Valley, makes some telling and important points. My hon. Friend
the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North highlighted
how much progress there has been on child care. We have invested well
over &#163;25 billion in child care and early years services since
1997 because it is absolutely the case that affordable child care can
remove one of the key barriers to employment for parents. Good quality
child care and pre-schooling also has important beneficial effects for
children&#146;s development, particularly for those from the most
disadvantaged
backgrounds.</div><a name="09102944000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could make a compelling case in saying that if one looked&#151;my
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary anticipated this point&#151;at clause
8(5)(a), on the promotion and facilitation of the employment of
parents, and at subsection (5)(c), on education, one would see that it
would be difficult to compile an effective strategy without giving a
good deal of attention to the topic of child care. Nevertheless, I have
heard clearly what has been said and, having had the opportunity of a
leisurely lunch break, over a sandwich, I have reflected on the case
that my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington,
North has made. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley
and the hon. Member for Northavon will feel able to withdraw their
amendments on the basis that I will come back to the House on Report
with a Government proposal on how we can explicitly ensure that child
care is included in the Bill. I hope that that will address the
concerns of my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div><a name="09102944000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 58
suggests that improving the well-being of children should be added to
the list. Of course, we have underlined our commitment to promoting
child well-being in Every Child Matters. I hope that Opposition Members
would accept that the main policy area in clause 8 will positively
improve the well-being of children. Clause 8(2)(b) requires the
national strategies to ensure</div>
<a name="09102944000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as far as
possible that children in the United Kingdom do not experience
socio-economic
disadvantage.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strategy will, by necessity, include measures to promote child
well-being. I do not think that the amendment would take that
further.</div><a name="09102944000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
60, tabled by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, addresses
the issue of rural poverty. As I indicated in my intervention, I was
particularly pleased to hear his rather unexpected announcement to the
Committee that he plans to cease over-stating his case. I hope that he
will let us know what date this new era in his rhetorical career will
commence, because I think we are all looking forward to it.</div>
<a name="09102944000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the hon. Gentleman has raised some important issues. The Government
take the problem of rural poverty very seriously. Children growing up
in low-income families in rural areas may well face additional
difficulties&#151;in accessing services or employment, for
example&#151;because of their location. However, it is not necessary
to explicitly specify rural poverty in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09102944000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
ensures that the local environment of every child will be taken into
account during the development of local and national strategies. Clause
8 requires the Secretary of State to consider what action is needed to
promote social inclusion, and to promote and improve the built and
natural environment. The local authority will be required to prepare
and publish an assessment of the needs of children living in poverty in
the area. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels reassured that his
legitimate concern will be addressed.</div>
<a name="09102944000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 67
and 68, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North,
relate to the provision of services for looked-after children and
children of asylum seekers. As she indicated, we have debated that
subject already, and I pointed out that clause 8(2)(b)
requires us to ensure that as far as possible, children in the UK do
not experience socio-economic disadvantage. That provision has been
deliberately included to ensure that the Bill covers all children, and
does not neglect the needs of any vulnerable
group&#151;including the small but significant number of children who
would not be covered in the survey, for the reasons that we have
explained.</div>
<a name="09102944000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have set
out the main policy areas in clause 8(5), to allow the strategy to
respond to changing circumstances between now and 2020. We are carrying
out a thorough review of the evidence base, to help us understand
causal pathways and identify how different sets of policies can
contribute to the 2020 target. The strategy will tackle the root causes
as well as the symptoms of child poverty, and help ensure that poverty
is reduced and that the targets in the Bill are achieved.</div>
<a name="09102944000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to hon. Members for putting on the record a number of important
considerations that the strategy needs to address. I will come back on
Report with a Government amendment picking up on the point made by
amendment 50. I hope that those who have  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>tabled other amendments in the group will feel reassured by what I have
said, and that their concerns will be addressed by the Bill as it
stands.</div>

Selous:</b> We have had a full, interesting and useful debate.
I am grateful to the Minister for his customary courteous, full and, in
some cases, placatory reply. I intend to press amendment 1 to a vote,
because I think that it is significant. It touches on the balance
between public and private sector activity to reduce child poverty. All
we are asking is for the Secretary of State to consider the promotion
of economic enterprise. That point is fundamental and goes to the heart
of how we believe we can best get children out of poverty, the roles
played by the state and taxpayer and what private industry can
do.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000489"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> All these amendments relate to one specific set of
issues: the needs of children who are cared for by friends and family
but not their parents. Observant members of the Committee will have
noticed that amendments 52 and 64 have a certain similarity. Initially,
we thought that the only difference was that one used Roman numbering
and the other used letters (a) to (e). The very perceptive will notice
that we added the words &#147;per year&#148; after &#147;28
days&#148;, which we thought was tidying up but we now think might
not have helped 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>at all. Essentially, amendments 52 and 64 are the same. We and the hon.
Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North seek to highlight
a group of children and families who perhaps have not had the attention
that they
deserve.</div><a name="09102944000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will not astonish the Committee to know that we did not write the
amendment. It was drafted for us by Grandparents Plus, which is a very
effective charity. Its profile has been raised considerably recently,
including at an event yesterday in the House chaired by the Chairman of
the Work and Pensions Committee. The concerns were also raised at Prime
Minister&#146;s Questions yesterday. The set of families we are
talking about are those where for a variety of reasons a child is not
with the natural or step-parents but is being brought up by
grandparents, other family members or friends. The campaign is trying
to highlight the fact that there is a gap in the system. The
arrangements under which a child may be placed with a grandparent, or a
carer who is of the family or a friend, can be diverse, and not all
such arrangements bring money with them.</div>
<a name="09102944000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 52
specifically focuses on the need to assess the financial needs of
carers who are friends or family. Research evidence from a sample
survey shows that whereas 15 per cent. of foster carers&#151;the
closest analogue&#151;said that they were in financial
hardship, 75 per cent. of friends and family carers did so. We
are looking at a group of children who may fall through the net unless
an amendment of this sort is accepted. The financial mechanisms of
support for such families are varied and complex. Although there are
specific forms of support such as guardianship allowances, they often
apply only in very specific cases. Certainly the mechanisms for
financial support are leaving many in financial hardship.</div>
<a name="09102944000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very often
the friend or family carer will make sacrifices for the sake of the
children. One grandparent carer wrote on the discussion board of the
Family Rights
Group:</div><a name="09102944000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Like
most we have had a dramatic change of life style. All
&#145;retirement&#146; plans gone. I had to give up work and if I
try and return later I will have lost all seniority therefore will be
on minimum
wage&#148;.</div><a name="09102944000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
the carers are making sacrifices for the children. When we assess child
poverty we do so in terms of the household&#146;s income, so
obviously the living standards and needs of the whole household are
relevant when we are looking at the well-being of a child. So if there
is a set of children whose family arrangements leave the adults in
hardship, its needs have to be properly identified and responded to.
One way would be to put them in the Bill under amendment 52.</div>
<a name="09102944000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 53
would define the group that we are talking about. Amendment 54 would
find out from the Secretary of State the number of children involved so
that we can assess the scale of the issue and know more systematically
than we currently do how many children are being brought up by
grandparents, relatives and so
on.</div><a name="09102944000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must consider the well-being of children. The alternative may be local
authority care; we want to avoid situations in which although friends
and family are available to provide a more loving, secure and familiar
home environment than foster care or that of an institution, they
cannot do so because of the lack of financial support. To reduce child
poverty, we must track down the causes and, if one is that friends and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>family cannot afford to have the child with them, the well-being of the
child will suffer, which I am sure the Government would not want.
Amendment 55 would require that, when the local authority is doing its
needs assessment, the needs of that particular group should be taken
account
of.</div><a name="09102944000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
ever, we could have come up with a lot of groups that needed their own
bit of the Bill so, in a sense, our proposals are probing amendments to
see how much, for example, the Government already know about such
groups, what assessments they have already made of the scale of the
problem and what policies are either in place to tackle the needs of
the groups or would be in place under the Child Poverty Bill. I commend
the amendments to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="09102944000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000490"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I commend the hon. Members for Northavon and for
Regent's Park and Kensington, North for introducing the amendments.
They are useful, probing amendments and I shall listen with great
interest to the Minister&#146;s response. My briefing on the subject
is from the Family Rights Group, and other groups including
Grandparents Plus, Family Action, the National Children&#146;s
Bureau, the Fostering Network, the Frank Buttle Trust and the
Grandparents Association&#151;a wide range of organisations that have
interest in such issues. We are discussing about 200,000 to 300,000
children throughout the United Kingdom, so it is not a small group. It
is interesting that, of those children, only 6,900 are looked-after
children as defined under the Bill, their local authorities having a
specific and statutory interest in
them.</div><a name="09102944000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
25 local authorities have admitted paying friends and family carers,
even when they had been approved as foster carers, at a lower rate than
other foster carers. That seems odd, to say the least. It is
particularly unfair that grandparent carers are discriminated against.
In many ways, it is a false economy not to do something about that,
given that outcomes as a result of placement stability are much better
when the family are
involved.</div><a name="09102944000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must bear in mind what life is actually like for the child. When
friends and family are involved as carers, it often enables the
children to stay on at their school, and to keep up with their local
group of friends, which will have significant outcomes for the children
and their earning ability when they, too, become parents. The
amendments are useful. The Department for Work and Pensions does not
know how many friends and family carers are in receipt of income
support. The fact that it is not aware of that supports the point made
by the hon. Member for Northavon when he said that the group is
slightly invisible in the statistics, so I shall listen with interest
to what the Minister has to say on the

<a name="09102944000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102944000491"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): I
inadvertently got a few sentences into my speech on this very topic
earlier, so I shall not strain the Committee&#146;s patience by
repeating myself. The hon. Member for Northavon set out the basics of
the case extremely well. I will repeat the fact that shocked
me&#151;reading the Family Rights Group briefing brought home to me
something that I confront every week or two in my advice surgery and
that has massive policy implications. I feel ashamed that I had not
realised what the policy implications were. Clearly, a huge number of
people are providing care for the children of other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>adults, often temporarily but sometimes
permanently&#151;the Family Rights Group put a figure of 200,000 or
so on the table. That is almost always as the result of crisis, which
has massive implications for the family and significant implications
for their
finances.</div><a name="09102944000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the cases that I am dealing with now is that of an 82-year-old
grandmother whose daughter, sadly, is a crack addict who has been in
and out of prison and rehab fairly consistently over a number of years.
The grandmother has brought up three of her grandchildren in those very
challenging circumstances. I am dealing with a specific issue for the
family at the moment. I was speaking to the grandmother a few days ago,
before having read the briefing for the Bill, and she was talking about
everything that she looks for to help the 13-year-old grandchild
materially, such as having a computer in his house. He has a
statement&#151;special educational needs&#151;and has been excluded
from school once. He has no computer because she has to go to the
social services department to ask if they would make provision for him
out of the social services budget as an exceptional case. She said, for
example, &#147;They are always promising me things, and then they
never deliver&#148;, or, &#147;They promised him a
bicycle.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
13-year-old kid is growing up on an estate that is a super output area
and the most deprived estate in the whole of England; he does not have
a bicycle or a computer at home because the family does not have the
level of financial input that one would expect for someone who is
looking after the children of another adult. Almost all the cases of
people who come to me are as a result of a parent in prison, a parent
who has drug or severe alcohol problems, a parent with a severe illness
or disability&#151;cancer or a major injury&#151;or something of
that kind. That puts extreme pressure on a family, almost always
including the fact that the child or children being cared for overcrowd
the house. We talked about overcrowding and poverty earlier on an
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North.
Bringing in the children of another adult will almost invariably lead
to overcrowding and physical pressure on a house. The family income
will rarely stretch to providing holidays, outings or extra-curricular
activities for a child, often because the arrangement is not
permanent.</div><a name="09102944000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102944000492"></a><b class="B">John
Barrett</b> (Edinburgh, West) (LD): I listened to what the
hon. Lady was saying, and she is making some important points. She
referred to an 82-year-old grandmother, but would she accept that there
is another group that is badly affected&#151;the many grandmothers
who are still of working age? Dealing with a crisis immediately puts a
stop to their income and has a knock-on
effect.</div><a name="09102944000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000493"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> That is a good point. The Family Rights Group
briefing talks about one of the major drivers of the financial pressure
of looking after another person&#146;s children being that it will
frequently&#151;again, often because it is born out of
crisis&#151;require people to give up their earning
capacity.</div><a name="09102944000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case has been well made and we understand that the group concerned is
very important and very overlooked. In connection with the amendment, I
urge the Minister to take the matter away and think about how,
cross-departmentally and within the Department, there could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>be some proper analysis of needs and numbers, looking at some of the
particular points that have come up in the briefing, such as, for
example, what proportion of people looking after a child for more than
three or six months would be entitled to trigger foster care payments
and to raise their family income in that
way.</div><a name="09102944000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is very important, raising some very important issues, which
are not necessarily appropriate for inclusion in the Bill. However, the
Family Rights Group has done a service&#151;certainly to me&#151;by
making us think about a challenging and often tragic group of people
for whom we do not have an adequate policy
response.</div><a name="09102944000425"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09102944000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000494"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I spoke to Ministers about these proposals last
week. I draw attention to the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) and a similar
one stimulated by Grandparents Plus, which has attracted considerable
support across the House. Hon. Members outside this room think that
this issue is
important.</div><a name="09102944000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
week, I explained to the chief executive of the Family Rights Group
that it would not be appropriate to put the detail of the amendment in
the Bill even though I consider this to be an important issue, for the
reasons set out by hon. Members. I have asked Ministers whether they or
their appropriate colleagues can respond to those organisations about
these issues. The chief executive referred specifically to the lack of
data. One of the big problems is that we do not know exactly what is
involved. It can involve people with a long-term caring relationship
with family or a short-term
relationship.</div><a name="09102944000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
most recent example I heard about was when I was out canvassing. A
woman opened the door and said, &#147;I&#146;m glad you&#146;re
here. We were about to try to get hold of your office.&#148; Her
sister had been sent to prison unexpectedly for benefit fraud, against
the advice of the probation service, and she had taken in the children.
One of the children was at school and so needed to be collected and
brought home and the other was older and a bit school-phobic. She had
no problem with taking them in, but was concerned that nobody from
social services had been to ensure that they were being looked after
properly while their mother was in prison temporarily. That is another
eccentric example that demonstrates the range of circumstances in which
this issue can come about. It is hardly surprising that there is a lack
of data and that it is so difficult to get the appropriate cross-agency
action that is needed to deal with these
problems.</div><a name="09102944000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that Ministers will ask colleagues to look at this issue and to
give some thought to the groups that are taking up these issues. It has
generated a lot of interest this week, as is reflected in the early-day
motions and the lobbying. Although it is not appropriate to put this
issue in the Bill, I hope it will be looked
at.</div><a name="09102944000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000495"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We have had another interesting and thoughtful
debate. I am sure that all hon. Members sympathise with the points that
have been raised. I am grateful for the way in which they have been
raised.</div><a name="09102944000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear from the evidence that care by family and friends is the best
approach for many children who cannot be looked after by their birth
parents, for whatever 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>reason. We want to recognise fully the additional support needs of that
group and the contribution that family and friend carers make to the
life chances of vulnerable children. We are taking steps to encourage
families to bring up children and to ensure that family and friend
carers receive the appropriate financial and practical
support.</div><a name="09102944000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that grandparents play an ever-increasing role in family life
by supporting parents and caring for children, as has been emphasised
in this debate. They are an important provider of full-time kinship
care for children whose parents are unable to care for them. Many
grandparents provide flexible and affordable child care, particularly
in the gap between school and formal child care. I remind the Committee
that it was announced in the Budget that grandparents and other family
members with significant child-care responsibilities will be eligible
for national insurance credits. We have heard of a number of examples
of grandparents giving up work to care for their children&#146;s
children. Under that measure, they will at least continue to receive
national insurance credits for state pension purposes. It is estimated
that 135,000 grandparents, and other adults under state pension age,
are caring for family members aged 12 or under for 20 or more hours a
week, of those, an estimated 45,000 could gain basic state pension
under the Budget announcement.</div>
<a name="09102944000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
helpful to clarify that in the Bill &#147;parent&#148; means more
than &#147;parent&#148; in the normal sense. It includes any
individual who has parental responsibility for a child under the terms
of the Children Act 1989, which, under sections 3 to 5 and 14C,
includes many of the persons described in paragraphs (i) to (v) of the
amendment, specifically, parents, step-parents, persons appointed as
guardians and persons with residence orders or special guardianship
orders. Section 17 of the 1989 Act places a general duty on local
authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need in
their areas through a range and level of services appropriate to
fulfilling those children&#146;s needs. That includes providing
services, including financial support, to any member of the
child&#146;s family, which includes persons with whom the child has
been living even if they do not have parental responsibility. The
Children and Young Persons Act 2008 amended section 17 of the 1989 Act
to make it easier for local authorities to provide regular and
long-term financial payments to families caring for children, where
they assess that to be appropriate.</div>
<a name="09102944000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way that
hon. Members have spoken about the amendments reflects that there will
be more to do. I take the point of the speeches urging me and other
Ministers to reflect on the issues and see what further action can be
taken. Perhaps it would be helpful if I undertake, on behalf of my hon.
Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland, myself and other Ministers, to
write to the organisations mentioned to set out the steps that we are
taking to address the perfectly proper and right concerns raised in
this relatively short but important debate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000497"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000498"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> It has been a very constructive debate. There is a
desire in the Committee to recognise the needs of this group, perhaps
not through these amendments specifically but through the sort of
mechanisms discussed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000499"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 8, in
clause 30, page 15, line 25, after
&#145;Child&#146;, insert &#145;and
Family&#146;.</div>
<a name="09102944000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000500"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I do not think that the debate on this will take
long because we have had very full debate on clause 8. The amendment
adds &#147;family&#148; to the Bill&#146;s title, so it would be
the Child and Family Poverty Bill. I pray in aid the brief from the
Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services that Committee
members were given before the witness
session:</div><a name="09102944000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
terminology...of &#147;child poverty&#148; is unhelpful and
does not encourage local authorities corporately nor local communities

business&#148;.</div><a name="09102944000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colin
Green from the association made the point in the evidence session that
the children we are talking about live in families and in
communities:</div><a name="09102944000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not a children&#146;s issue; it is a consequence to

not want to go on at greater length as we are talking about a word in
the Bill&#146;s title, but I think that that change would be helpful
for the purposes of emphasis and will return to that point at an
appropriate
time.</div><a name="09102944000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000501"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I have a couple of brief points on what has just
been said and on clause 8 itself. I sympathise with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that children live in families, not in
isolation, but I have two concerns about putting the word
&#147;family&#148; in the title of the Bill so that we focus on
family poverty. My first concern, and it is not an entirely pedantic
point, is that many people would say that they are part of a family
even if they do not have dependant children. As soon as we call it is a
family and child poverty Bill, we broaden the scope. Poverty matters,
of course, whomever it affects, but the Bill is specifically about
children, even though we understand that they live in a context, so I
wonder whether such a change in the title would slightly dull the
focus.</div>
<a name="09102944000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000502"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> We have had many references throughout our
deliberations to comparisons with Europe on the measures we are using,
and quite rightly so. In the last Parliament the hon. Member for
Regent's Park and Kensington, North and I travelled across various
European countries, and many of the people we spoke with were slightly
puzzled by the UK&#146;s focus on the term child poverty. Poverty was
very much recognised as a serious issue for them, but child poverty was
not a worldwide term.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div><a name="09102944000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000503"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am sure that that is right, but we measure the
economic well-being of a child by looking at the income and material
circumstances of the entire household. For example, half of the
material deprivation indicators used relate to the child and the other
half relate to the adults in the household, so the family context is
included, although it is perhaps not as explicit as the hon. Gentleman
would like, but I do not feel terribly strongly about it.</div>
<a name="09102944000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
concern, which the Equality and Human Rights Commission has also
commented on, is that on average larger families are more likely to be
poor than smaller families, so if we target 10 per cent. of families,
rather than 10 per cent. of children, unless we are careful we risk
missing out that dimension and not getting to those most in need. I
think that that is a slightly marginal point.</div>
<a name="09102944000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern is that the clause begins:</div>
<a name="09102944000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State
must...&#148;.</div><a name="09102944000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally
in legislation it is obvious who the Secretary of State is, but I am
slightly unclear in that case. When we had an evidence session we heard
from three Departments, and I entirely welcome them talking together,
but given that the clause deals with health, social services,
employment, housing and the built environment, it will involve nearly
half a dozen Departments, so is there a lead Secretary of State? I am
aware that technically and legislatively &#147;Secretary of
State&#148; refers to all Secretaries of State, but someone has to
take the lead, take the rap and be held
accountable&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="09102944000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
entirely reassured to see the Minister shaking his head. There is a
serious point behind all of this. Who will take the lead, because we
all know, as we have seen with efforts to tackle climate change, that
it is difficult for an individual Department to have clout across
Government. Sorting out the climate is not the job of just the
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, so child poverty is
not the responsibility of just the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions and the Treasury. A little insight on what duty the clause
will put on whom would be
helpful.</div><a name="09102944000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000504"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The Bill has its origins in the commitment made by
the Government in 1999 to eradicate child poverty within a generation,
and that is reflected in the title. It is right that tackling child
poverty will require us to tackle the poverty of the families in which
the children live, but it is important to keep the focus that the
current title gives. I notice, for example, that the Child Poverty
Action Group, in its response to the Bill&#146;s consultation,
stated:</div><a name="09102944000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
child poverty legislation is an opportunity to ensure policy clearly
puts children&#146;s needs
first.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
view was widely reflected in the points made by those who commented on
the Bill. That priority would be lost if the amendment were made. The
Bill gives a good opportunity to make sure that the child becomes the
focus for policy and that will enable us to tackle child poverty
effectively. The focus on children in the title of the Bill will be an
important driver for action. This is not about poverty in a vague sense
but about the particular circumstances of children, about which people
rightly feel strongly. I accept that the amendment would not change any
of the provisions of the Bill, which makes it clear that eradicating
child poverty would require support for children, parents and families.
It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>would be a mistake to weaken the focus on children as the animating
preoccupation of the Bill. I hope that when we get to clause 30,
Opposition Members will not wish to press the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09102944000426"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="09102944000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of which Secretary of State we are talking about, the hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right. The term can apply to any Secretary of
State. It depends on how government is structured at a particular
point. Who knows, there might be some changes between now and 2020. In
the current arrangement, my Department leads on the public service
agreement, the PSA target, but it is a joint responsibility. I work
closely with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and with the Secretary
of State for Children, Schools and Families. At the moment, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer would fulfil that responsibility but it may
shift over the coming

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000505"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> I beg to move amendment 51, in
clause 9, page 5, line 16, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) If after
receiving advice from the Commission the Secretary of State lays before

showing:</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the extent to
which he has, in framing the strategy, given effect to the advice of
the Commission; and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) in so

the amendment seeks to probe the Government&#146;s thinking on how
responses might be given to the recommendations of the child poverty
commission. My hope and intention is that the
commission&#146;s recommendations will be more likely to be responded
to in a manner mirroring the responses to&#151;I hesitate to use
these words&#151;the Social Security Advisory Committee, than in the
production of a report such as &#147;Opportunity for All&#148;.
There is a lot to be said for the way in which the Government produce
such broad and comprehensive reports, which set out a great deal of
useful information and look at targets. However, it would be a missed
opportunity if the child poverty commission did not receive a more
specific, line-by-line, detailed explanation of how and why the
Government felt that any recommendations should not be taken forward.
Recommendations and advice that are accepted do not need such a
comprehensive response. However, where the Government choose to differ
from the advice and recommendations of the child poverty commission, or
need to explain a failure to implement them fully, it would be sad if
they did not set out the arguments and provide evidence for so
doing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div><a name="09102944000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a temptation for Governments of all colours to prefer to use such
opportunities to set out their own case and to congratulate themselves
on what is done well. I understand why that is, but it is not
necessarily the best way to progress towards meeting our objectives. I
encourage the Government to think about the kind of rigour that they
will adopt in their responses, and I hope that the Minister will
concede that
point.</div><a name="09102944000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000506"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Lady has explained her amendment well. It
is a perfectly sensible amendment, which seeks clarity and
transparency. I have no problem with the fact that advisers advise and
Ministers decide. That is the prerogative of power, which the two
Ministers in Committee enjoy. If Ministers come to a contrary view,
which they are perfectly entitled to do, following any advice that they
are given, it is reasonable for them to justify why they have taken a
different decision and to put that in the public domain. Time may prove
them right. The amendment is about public openness and transparency,
and it is
sensible.</div><a name="09102944000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000507"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Helen
Goodman):</b> It is a pleasure, Mr. Key, to serve
under your chairmanship this afternoon.</div>
<a name="09102944000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North, has
tabled an amendment that would require the Government, when laying
before Parliament a strategy or revised strategy, to provide a copy of
the commission&#146;s advice, and a statement showing the extent to
which the Government gave effect to that advice in framing the
strategy. If effect has not been given to the advice of the commission,
the Government would have to give reasons why
not.</div><a name="09102944000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the Government place a high value on expert and independent advice to
inform the development of strategies to tackle child poverty. It is
clear that the child poverty commission is central to the development
of effective child poverty strategies that focus on sustainable
long-term solutions, rather than short-term fixes. Those views were
made clear in the consultation on the Bill. Following the consultation,
we have made it clear that the Bill will ensure, first, that the
Secretary of State must ask the commission for advice in preparing or
revising the strategy, as set out in subsection (1). Secondly, that
advice must be made public, so that it is clear what steps the
commission thought were necessary in the development of the strategy.

the extent to which the commission&#146;s advice has shaped the

its advice, it will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>be clear whether the Government have followed the
commission&#146;s advice. It is intended that the initial and revised

advice accepted and not
accepted.</div><a name="09102944000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
enshrined in law, the Bill will ensure that the commission provides
quality advice to the Secretary of State, and it will give Parliament
and the public powerful tools to exercise the appropriate
accountability. I agree with my hon. Friend that we need to provide for
an effective child poverty commission. I hope that she will agree that
the existing provisions of the Bill meet the aims of her amendment. I
am afraid that I did not have quite as good a lunch as my right hon.
Friend the Financial Secretary; I hope that my hon. Friend the Member

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000510"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 57, in
clause 22, page 13, line 14, leave
out &#145;or&#146; and insert
&#145;and&#146;.</div><a name="09102944000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000511"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Clause 9 is headed &#147;Provision of advice by
Commission and consultation with others&#148;, and subsection (4)(c)
states that the Secretary of
State</div><a name="09102944000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
consult such children, or organisations working with or representing
children, as the Secretary of State thinks
fit&#148;.</div><a name="09102944000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would modify that to read, &#147;consult such children and
organisations working with&#148; children. As the wording currently
stands, it appears to be possible to draw up a strategy without
consulting children; that is where we are coming from. One will be able
to satisfy the condition in subsection (4)(c) by consulting only
organisations that work with children, and not children themselves. All
that we are trying to do&#151;it is clearly good practice to do
this&#151;is to make consulting children a requirement. I do not need
to labour the point, as I am sure that the Committee knows where I am
coming from.</div>
<a name="09102944000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
issues here. The first is about consulting children, and the second, a
sub-issue, is about consulting children in poverty. It is important
that actions on child poverty are not things done to people, but are
things done with them and for them, and are shaped by those who are
meant to be influenced. To quote from the UN Development Programme,
people living in
poverty</div><a name="09102944000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
be considered as the principal actors of development; they can no
longer be seen as passive recipients; they are strategic partners
rather than target groups.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div><a name="09102944000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, this should not be a patronising, top-down,
we-know-what-is-best-for-you measure. With children, that is a
particular risk. However, parts of the Bill already ask children what
they think. For example, for the child material deprivation indicators,
children will be asked about their hobbies, such as swimming, from
their perspective. That is entirely welcome, but we would like to see
the Bill strengthened so that there is consultation not just with
representative groups, but with the children
themselves.</div><a name="09102944000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000512"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I will not speak on the amendment, but I fully
support what the hon. Gentleman says, and I hope that Ministers will
take that on board
immediately.</div><a name="09102944000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000513"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am sure that the Ministers will take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s support on board immediately; I am grateful for his
support.</div><a name="09102944000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Save
the Children endorses the amendment, and I think the Equality and Human
Rights Commission might even have written it&#151;although even I can
draft &#147;delete &#145;or&#146; and insert
&#145;and&#146;&#148; on a good day. An important point is being
made: consultation with organisations is supplementary to, not a
substitute for, consultation with children and families. One only has
to run through some of the frameworks for consulting children and young
people&#151;the UN convention on the rights of the child, the
Children Act 1989, the Every Child Matters programme, the national
service framework for children&#151;to see that all of them stress
the importance of seeking and taking into account children&#146;s
views. Indeed, the UN convention on the rights of the child states
that</div><a name="09102944000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;parties
shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own
views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting
the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance
with the age and maturity of the
child.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the views of younger children will differ from those of older
children.</div><a name="09102944000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot help but feel that listening to the voice of a variety of
children with disabilities will be particularly important. I suspect
that all of us have attended fringe meetings at our party conferences
that were organised by the Every Disabled Child Matters coalition. It
produced a DVD that disabled youngsters had made. A parliamentary
colleague and I were on a panel with disabled teenagers, who were able
to hold up a card that said &#147;Jargon&#148; if we used jargon. I
recall that meeting more than most; I hope that no one on the Committee
has such a card. It was different to hear things from the
horse&#146;s mouth, rather than just from an organisation acting on
people&#146;s
behalf.</div><a name="09102944000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102944000514"></a><b class="B">Julie
Morgan</b> (Cardiff, North) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman makes an
important point: it is important to communicate directly with children.
However, does he agree that communicating directly with them is not
easy, and has to be done in a way that allows one to find out what they
truly mean? In those situations, organisations that work with children
can sometimes help facilitate the coming forward of children&#146;s
views. It is important to bear that in
mind.</div><a name="09102944000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000515"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Absolutely. I do not underestimate the difficulty of
communicating with children, nor do I underestimate the contribution
that children&#146;s organisations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>can make. We do not do that, in any sense, by
converting &#147;or&#148; to &#147;and&#148;. By putting in
&#147;and&#148;, we will require consultation with
children&#146;s organisations. However, we have to ensure that the
voice of the child is heard clearly. I think that the point has been
made, and I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div><a name="09102944000427"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09102944000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000516"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I support the amendment, and I agree with my hon.
Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness. The amendment is
important. We should not underestimate the fact that adults are not
always good proxies for children&#146;s views. As the hon. Member for
Northavon said, the task may not be easy, and we need to talk to
organisations that work with, for and on behalf of children. At my
party&#146;s conference I saw a film produced by Save the Children
called &#147;Wee Shots&#148;&#151;both Ministers may have seen it
at a showing in Portcullis House&#151;and met children who live in
poverty in Bradford, London and elsewhere in the UK. The amendment
brings an extra dimension, and I echo the reference that the hon.
Member for Northavon made to the United Nation&#146;s words about
doing things with and for people, rather than to them. The amendment is
therefore sensible, and we will support him if he chooses to press it
to a
vote.</div><a name="09102944000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000517"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Subsection (4)(c) requires the Secretary of State
to</div><a name="09102944000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consult
such children, or organisations working with or representing children,
as the Secretary of State thinks
fit&#148;</div><a name="09102944000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
preparing a UK strategy. Similarly, clause 22(6) requires the
responsible local authority
to</div><a name="09102944000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consult
such children, or organisations working with or representing children,
as the authority thinks
fit&#148;</div><a name="09102944000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
preparing or modifying a joint child poverty strategy. The hon. Member
for Northavon proposes to change the word &#147;or&#148; in those
subsections to &#147;and&#148; to require consultation on national
and local child poverty strategies to take place directly with
children, as well as with organisations working with or representing
children.</div><a name="09102944000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government fully appreciate the spirit in which the amendment has been
tabled. Ensuring that children&#146;s views underpin Government
policies to improve outcomes for all children has been and remains at
the heart of our approach. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the
participation of the child is one of the three key principles in the UN
convention on the rights of the child and has been incorporated into
English law since the Scarman judgment on the Gillick case. We have a
long history of doing that where we believe it to be appropriate.
Article 12 of the UN convention urges state parties to allow
children who are capable of forming their own views to have a say on
issues that affect
them.</div><a name="09102944000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking
into account the views of children and families living in poverty is
central to the development of our strategies for tackling child
poverty. During the development of the Bill, we commissioned Save the
Children to carry out a series of consultation events with children and
young people aged five to 19, seeking their views on the Bill, as well
as on the Government&#146;s vision for meeting the 2020 targets. We
have also commissioned Dr. Tess Ridge from Bath university, who gave
evidence to the Committee last week, to research the experience of
children and families living in poverty. Her report was published in
July and will help to inform the development of the child poverty
strategy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div><a name="09102944000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe, however, that it will always be appropriate for the
Secretary of State to consult children directly, as well as those
organisations whose role is to identify and represent children&#146;s
views and interests. While we want to ensure that both the local and
national strategies are informed by the views of children and young
people, we acknowledge, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North
implied in her intervention, that Government may not always be best
placed to achieve this goal. In reaching the most disaffected children
or those with complex needs, we want to work with those organisations
that represent groups that do not usually take part in Government
consultations, and that have the necessary specialist
skills.</div><a name="09102944000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon suggested that the Government were failing in
their obligations to take the views of children and young people
seriously. I do not accept that. We have made the participation of
children and young people a priority. The Children&#146;s
Commissioner and the DCSF&#146;s children and youth board play a
crucial role in ensuring that the views of children and young people
inform the development of policies. I have taken the trouble to check
the obligations of the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, and
they include the &#147;and&#148;&#151;rather than the
&#147;or&#148;&#151;approach that the hon. Gentleman would like
us to take. However, the Children&#146;s Commissioner differs
significantly from the child poverty commission, because he has the
function of promoting awareness of the views and interests of children,
whereas the role of the child poverty commission is to advise on
strategies to tackle child
poverty.</div><a name="09102944000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000518"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The Minister refers to the child poverty commission,
but clause 9(4) imposes a duty on the Secretary of State, not on the
child poverty commission.</div>
<a name="09102944000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000519"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I understand that, but in implementing strategies
and seeking to meet targets, the Secretary of State tries to implement
a policy that will be effective in another objective. That is different
from being effective in representing the views of children to the
world, which is the role of the Children&#146;s Commissioner, and
that is why we have handled their role
differently.</div>
<a name="09102944000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000520"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> I am still a little confused as to what
difference changing the wording, as proposed by the amendment, would
make. The tenor of the amendment is not clear. Would the Minister
explain further what she understands would happen as a result of the
amendment?</div><a name="09102944000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000521"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> My understanding is that in preparing a UK
strategy, the Secretary of State&#151;or the local authorities, as
set out in clause 22&#151;would have to consult children and
organisations working with or representing children in every single
case. As the provision is currently drafted, the Secretary of State has
a choice about how best to secure the views of children and young
people on the issues being considered&#151;namely, drawing up a
strategy to tackle child
poverty.</div><a name="09102944000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members will accept my reassurances that we intend that
the development of the national and local strategies should benefit
from the views of children who have direct experience of living in
poverty. In our view, clause 9(4)(c) and clause 22(6) make that
intention clear, and the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Northavon is unnecessary. The important point is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>how we put those requirements into practice and
ensure that the views of children and their families are properly taken
into account. On that basis, I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
his
amendment.</div><a name="09102944000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000522"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I feel that that was the answer to a different
question. The Minister said that it is important to listen to children
and that test groups have been commissioned to do research, which has
informed policy. She said that Save the Children had undertaken a
consultation in which it talked to children, which was good and
worthwhile, but she did not want to make it a duty on the Government to
do that again. If this is all so worthwhile, why would the Secretary of
State want to retain the option of not consulting with children under
the Bill as currently drafted?</div>
<a name="09102944000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000523"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The Secretary of State retains the option of
doing it, but is not required to do it in every instance. I think there
is a difference.</div>
<a name="09102944000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000524"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I think it is the same thing. I cannot conceive of a
Secretary of State wanting to draw up a child poverty strategy where he
or she did not consult children directly, so I do not see why we need
to leave that option in the Bill and I seek to test the view of the
Committee on the amendment.</div>

Goodman:</b> Amendments 33 to 39 and 46 relate to the clauses
that place duties on the Scottish and Northern Irish Governments, and
they have been tabled at their request. This set of amendments has two
purposes. First, the amendments will add a requirement on Scottish
Ministers and the offices of the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister to report annually to the Scottish Parliament and the Northern
Ireland Assembly respectively. The report must detail progress made in
implementing their child poverty strategies, including how measures
they have taken have contributed to the UK-wide child poverty targets
in clauses 2 to 5. That is broadly similar to the requirement on the
Secretary of State in clause 13 to report annually to this Parliament.
The amendments will increase accountability to the devolved assemblies,
and will ensure that there is an annual progress check of steps towards
meeting the 2020 goals.</div>
<a name="09102944000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
purpose of this group of amendments is to ensure that the Bill is
technically correct by removing a number of references to
&#147;Northern Ireland department&#148; and replacing them with
&#147;Northern Ireland departments&#148;. The amendments will
ensure that the Bill recognises the role and responsibilities that
central Northern Ireland Departments, other than the offices of the
First Minister and Deputy First Minister, have in relation to the
Northern Ireland
strategy.</div><a name="09102944000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the offices of First Minister and Deputy First Minister have overall
policy responsibility for poverty and social inclusion matters, the
goals of the child poverty strategy can be achieved only if all
Northern Ireland Departments take steps to tackle child poverty.
References to the duties of Northern Ireland Departments are, in that
respect, similar to references already in the Bill to the duties of the
Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers that signal collective
responsibility.</div><a name="09102944000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
40 to 45 clarify the wording of the UK annual report
clause&#151;clause 13. They are minor, technical amendments that will
make the precise timetable for laying annual reports before Parliament
clear and they will make those references consistent with the
references to the timetable for Northern Ireland or Scottish annual
reports. I am sure the Committee will agree that the amendments further
strengthen the UK-wide framework for tackling child poverty that the
Bill will
establish.</div><a name="09102944000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000543"></a>Julie
Morgan:</b> I support the Government amendments. In developing
a UK-wide child poverty strategy, it is important that what happens in
the devolved bodies is fully involved and integrated. It is therefore
good that the amendments have been tabled. I note that there is nothing
about Wales in the amendments, but I assume that is because Wales has
not asked for an amendment to be made. I know that Wales already has a
child 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>poverty strategy&#151;I believe that it has had
one for some time&#151;and is about the launch another one. I
certainly welcome the proposals for the other two devolved bodies and,
as I say, the key to the success of a child poverty strategy in the
sort of UK we have at the moment is making sure that what is happening
in all the devolved bodies is tied in with what is happening in the UK
as a
whole.</div><a name="09102944000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000544"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The Welsh are, as my hon. Friend says, ahead of
the other three nations on this issue at the moment. On 2 March 2009,
the Welsh Assembly Government introduced the Children and Families
(Wales) Measure, which effectively places the same duties on Welsh
Ministers as the Bill places on the Secretary of State, Scottish
Ministers and Northern Irish Ministers. The Assembly measure places on
Welsh Ministers a duty to prepare a child poverty strategy that should
be updated every three years. It also requires them to publish a report
containing an assessment of the extent to which the objectives in the
strategy have been met. Clause 9(5) of the Bill provides that the UK
Government must have regard to the Welsh strategy when preparing a UK
child poverty strategy. The Bill also requires Welsh Ministers to
appoint a member of the child poverty commission. We intend that the
two pieces of legislation should complement each other and provide a
joint framework to ensure that the four nations work together towards
the 2020
target.</div><a name="09102944000428"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000545"></a>Julie
Morgan:</b> I want to ask the Minister about the differences
between the age in the Welsh measure, which concerns children up to 18,
and the age in the child poverty strategy, which is up to 16. Has there
been any progress on that issue, which I know concerns the
Assembly?</div><a name="09102944000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000546"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I know exactly what my hon. Friend is talking
about, and it is something that I have considered very recently. The
definition of the child in the Bill is consistent with the definition
used by the family resources survey, which has been the main survey
used to measure child poverty since it began in 1993-94. To change that
definition now would smack of moving the goalposts, and would mean that
we were not consistently measuring progress over time. That issue does
not arise for the Welsh measure, which does not set a child poverty
target in the same way, so we feel that it is acceptable to progress
with those slightly different
measures.</div><a name="09102944000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<a name="09102944000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the Minister to clarify a point that arises as a consequence of Mike
Brewer&#146;s evidence in one of our evidence sessions. Clause 10
relates to Scottish strategies, and is therefore relevant to this
point. Mike Brewer was asked what the distribution of child poverty
would be like if we had a figure based on the regions, rather than
having a national figure. He
replied:</div><a name="09102944000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;poverty
in London goes up and poverty elsewhere goes down, particular in
Scotland, which ends up with the lowest level of child poverty of all
the nations and regions of Great Britain, once 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>you account for the lower costs of living
there.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child Poverty
Public Bill Committee, </i>22 October 2009; c. 108,
Q210.]</div><a name="09102944000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Scottish strategies relate to the targets set out in clauses 2 to 5.
The Bill does not state that they are UK targets, but I assume that
that is the case. Will the Minister clarify whether the Scottish
strategies will be required to meet UK targets rather than specifically
Scottish targets? Clearly, it would be easier to meet a Scottish-only
target, as the median income and cost of living are lower there, than a
national target. The Bill is not absolutely explicit on this, but I
think it concerns national
targets.</div><a name="09102944000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000548"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The
targets in clauses 2 to 5 are UK-wide, so they apply to children across
the whole UK, no matter where they live. The levers for tackling child
poverty include a mixture of devolved and reserved measures. Obviously,
Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh Ministers cannot be held responsible
for delivering on the reserved matters in the strategy. They cannot be
legally accountable for child poverty targets that cover the whole of
the UK because they do not have influence over all the necessary
levers. The Bill requires the Scottish and Northern Ireland Governments
to set out how their child poverty strategies will contribute to the
targets in clauses 2 to 5. I hope that that clarifies the matter for
the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09102944000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000549"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification, but it raises questions about legal accountability. Can
I confirm that Scottish Ministers have a responsibility to contribute
to the targets, but not necessarily to meet them so, in other words,
they must do their bit? Presumably, it could be a defence for the
Secretary of State to say that the targets would have been met, but for
the Scottish Government&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I
do not know whether I am intervening or making a speech, but I would be
delighted to give
way.</div><a name="09102944000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000550"></a>John
Barrett:</b> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman.
This issue becomes quite complicated because it is within the power of
Scottish Ministers to devise a strategy that requires UK benefits to be
raised to a certain level to wipe out poverty in
Scotland.</div><a name="09102944000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000551"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point; I
am sure that the Minister will respond to it. There is the distinct
possibility of buck passing. This problem is easier to identify than to
solve. There is a tension in a UK-wide target that must be met partly
through reserved powers and partly through devolved
powers.</div><a name="09102944000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000552"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> To go back to an earlier point in my hon.
Friend&#146;s speech, the evidence was that Scotland had the lowest
level of child poverty in the UK on a regional scale because of lower
living costs. Does he think it is due entirely to that, or are lower
median incomes in Scotland also a key
contributor?</div><a name="09102944000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000553"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The quote from Mr. Brewer refers to
lower costs. We have touched on this matter briefly and I assume that
lower median incomes would be a large factor. The nature of a relative
income measure is that lower median incomes can reduce child poverty,
as happens in a recession.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div><a name="09102944000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000554"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I wanted to find out whether that was the case
because it reminds me of the dictum of Winston Churchill that the vice
of capitalism is its unequal sharing of blessings, whereas the virtue
of socialism is its equal sharing of misery. There is an irony that the
more socialist and economically failing an area of the UK, the lower
its child poverty appears to be, in regional
terms.</div><a name="09102944000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000555"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend tempts me to go in a direction that
would not help the Committee, but I note his
comments.</div><a name="09102944000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000556"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> However, is the Bill not about the UK poverty
threshold? Therefore, under the clause, Scottish Ministers must enable
Scottish children to get above 60 per cent. of not just the
Scottish median&#151;which may or may not be measured&#151;but the
UK median. That means that it is even harder for Scottish Ministers to
achieve the goal, because they are further behind to begin
with.</div><a name="09102944000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000557"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is right. I raised the query to get some
clarity on record about what the obligation is. I am grateful to the
Minister for providing that
clarity.</div><a name="09102944000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000558"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The UK strategy will incorporate the devolved
strategies, for which the devolved administrations will be responsible
to their Parliaments and Assemblies. It will also cover the measures
taken under the reserve powers. Together, they must consult and produce
an overall strategy that hits the overall target. The UK Secretary of
State has an absolute duty to meet the UK targets, whereas the
Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh have a duty to contribute to meeting
them. That seems reasonable as the Secretary of State, obviously, has
control over a wider range of levers than those in the devolved
administrations.</div><a name="09102944000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000559"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Does the Minister think that there is a concern
about the Secretary of State having an absolute responsibility when
there is also a need, as I think we would all agree, for a contribution
from the devolved Executives, over which the Secretary of State does
not have control and which he cannot order to perform in a particular
way? Fulfilling the absolute requirement with regard to child poverty
might prove more problematic for the Secretary of State at a practical
level in Scotland than in England or Wales.</div>
<a name="09102944000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000560"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> It is reasonable. If we did not operate in that
way, it would be too easy to have a get-out clause. At some level, we
must rely on the fact that all the Administrations are interested in
tackling child poverty. As we move forward, we will work to ensure that
the consultations are effective. Obviously, in the event that a target
was missed and the Secretary of State was taken to judicial review, if
the devolved administrations had failed to fulfil their duties to
contribute effectively, that would form part of the UK Secretary of
State&#146;s defence. However, as we embark on the programme, our
objective should be to have an open, transparent process that
facilitates all parties to make a reasonable contribution to the
overall objective.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000563"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Excellent. Is the Minister satisfied, following
the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire, that having a UK-wide child poverty figure and target is
appropriate for each area of the United Kingdom? I ask because, as has
been said, if it were done on a regional basis, Scotland would be shown
to have the least. The Ministers and all of us have said that the
reason why we think that relative poverty is the right fundamental
measure involves comparators with other children and how things operate
within a school or village. If one is considering making the relative
figure correct, it should reflect the surroundings and communities in
which one finds oneself.</div>
<a name="09102944000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
Minister sure that having a UK-wide number is right and has no
distortions? In particular, there might be an area of the United
Kingdom&#151;one might want to call it Scotland&#151;with a greater
dependency culture than some other parts, where a higher percentage of
people are dependent on the state for employment benefit and other
benefits. If the rules were UK-wide and if levers were pulled and
benefits were increased specifically to deal with the problem, that
could further remove economic incentives in the area to go to work.
While seeming to have helped eradicate child poverty, I put it to the
Minister that the Government could actually be helping,
counter-productively, to ensure a lack of dynamic economic activity in
a whole region or, indeed, nation of the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="09102944000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

is an objective that is widely shared. There are different policy
levers in different places. We have had a great deal of co-operation
from all the devolved Administrations in working together on the Bill,
as was demonstrated by the fact that the Scottish and the Northern
Irish were promoting tougher responsibilities and duties on themselves.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000565"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have two questions for the Minister. The clause
requires the Secretary of State to present reports to Parliament on
progress towards meeting the targets and in implementing the UK
strategy. Subsection (2)
states:</div><a name="09102944000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
report dates are each anniversary of the day on which the most recent
UK strategy was laid before
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3)
states:</div><a name="09102944000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
end of the target year, lay before Parliament a report on the progress
made in implementing the most recent UK
strategy.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first question is slightly complicated and I hope that the Minister
will bear with me.</div>
<a name="09102944000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we
have an annual report ending with the target year, which is laid before
Parliament on the anniversary of the most recent UK strategy. So, we
will presumably receive an annual report at some point in the target
year: the year after 1 April 2020. That is the last of such reports. We
then have the report mentioned in subsection (3), which
should be delivered as soon as is reasonably practicable after the end
of the target year. That may not be the final assessment, but it is the
big assessment of whether the 2020 target is met.</div>
<a name="09102944000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
of precedent, that report on 2020 will take some time after the
completion of the relevant year. Therefore, it may be 2022 when it
comes out. I mainly ask for clarification, but it seems that we will
have a gap in reports. There will potentially be annual reports running
up to 2 April 2020. We will then have a period of two
years&#151;perhaps two and a half years&#151;before we have another
report, if I have understood correctly, because the requirement is on
an anniversary basis. Could the Minister confirm whether that is the
case and explain whether there is a need for an interim progress report
some time in
2021?</div><a name="09102944000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question concerns the evidence provided by Ministers during the
evidence sessions. The Financial Secretary, in response to questions
from the hon. Member for Northavon, explained why he thought that by
2016-17 we will not be in a position in
which</div><a name="09102944000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
are surprised to find that we are not on track. By that
stage&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09102944000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">stating
the
reason&#151;</div><a name="09102944000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
will have had a number of iterations&#151;two I think&#151;of the
strategy. We will have had regular annual
reports&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child
Poverty Public Bill Committee, </i>20 October 2009; c. 10,
Q23.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div><a name="09102944000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government clearly see the annual report as a significant driver in
meeting the 2020 target. In the run-up to the 2010 target, how have the
Government reported progress on child poverty? Can the Minister explain
why that process was
deficient?</div><a name="09102944000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000566"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks a series of complex
questions, but not the same series of complex questions that I asked
when I read the
clause.</div><a name="09102944000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hitherto,
obviously, the assessment as to whether we are on track has been
produced when the national statistics for the most recent year are
available. That is why, for example, our most recent full set of
statistics relate, unfortunately, to as far back as 2007-08. That is
one of the reasons why we have debates about the effectiveness of
Government measures since then. As the hon. Gentleman is fully aware,
we do not have the statistics for the level of child poverty, and we
shall not know if we have hit the targets until the first
quarter of
2012.</div><a name="09102944000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we move forward, the situation will be different in a number of
respects: we will have a wider range of targets than hitherto; we are
putting duties on to the local authorities as well as formalising the
responsibilities of the Secretary of State; and we are producing
forward-looking strategies. Saying something about the forward-looking
strategies might help to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second
question, as well as to inform an answer to his first
question.</div><a name="09102944000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first strategy must be produced within a year of Royal
Assent&#151;probably 2011, possibly 2012. Thereafter, a revised
strategy must be produced within three years. It could be produced
earlier, but the latest possible date that it could be produced is in
2014. If the whole process was stretched out, the next latest possible
date would be in 2017, then in 2020. Meanwhile, we would be getting the
data back on progress and producing annual reports, which we would, in
effect, map against what we had set out in the
strategies.</div><a name="09102944000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked, reasonably enough, if
there is a gap at 2021. On the basis of what is laid out here, my
immediate response is that he has a good point. However, we shall still
be producing all the annual statistics. It is possible that by that
period we will have changed how we produce the statistics&#151;we
might have speeded up, because there are improvements all the time. I
suggest that the hon. Gentleman has alighted on a small and technical
point, but I do not think it impacts significantly on the
accountability arrangements because the most important one is a
requirement to produce reports up until the end of the target year. The
amendments were intended to clarify the situation for the Committee. I
hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire now understands
our
intention.</div><a name="09102944000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000567"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It is a question of alighting on a small, technical
point but what are Committee stages for, if not that? If we are going
to be pedantic, may I correct the Minister? The requirement is not to
report up until the end of the target year, but for a report ending
with the target year. If the date of the last strategy is, for
argument&#146;s sake, 2 April, as I read it the last anniversary
ending with the target year would be 2 April 2020. There would be no
requirement to make another report until we got to the report under
subsection (3), which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>could be some time later. The Minister is right that the matter could be
processed more quickly or more slowly. She sets out the reasons,
including dealing with local authorities and so on. I do not pretend
that this is a major point but, as I read the Bill, we might miss a
year of annual
reports.</div><a name="09102944000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000568"></a>Helen

the Bill, but not in reading the amendments. The purpose of the

<a name="09102944000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000569"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I have one question about the intriguing subsection
(4) of clause 14. Subsection (1) says that the &#147;report under
section 13(3)&#148;&#151;which is the report at the end asking how
we did&#151;must give the four figures for targets in the Bill.
Subsection (2) means that they must be kosher, and 14(3) asks whether
the number is bigger or smaller than the target. That is not
unreasonable. However, 14(4) is rather fun, as it says that if we have
failed, we must say why. The whole point of the exercise is to place a
statutory duty on the Secretary of State to achieve the targets. It is
intriguing that in the middle we find a clause saying that if we fail
we will have to explain ourselves.</div>
<a name="09102944000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
intrigued to know the explanations that might be prompted by 14(4).
Could one say, &#147;We changed our minds and decided that child
poverty was not all that important.&#148;? Or could one say,
&#147;We would have liked to have done more but the economy was in
such a mess we did not have the money.&#148;? I am not sure what the
point is. If we try to abolish child poverty over a 10-year period,
fail to do so and breach a statutory obligation, what is the value
added of an excuse clause? Presumably, we are hoping that someone will
take legal action to enforce the provision.</div>
<a name="09102944000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relevant
point is that it is not clear whether legal enforcement of the
Bill&#146;s duties comes before or after 2020. Could one say, in
2018, &#147;We are miles away from this.&#148;? Could one take the
Government to court to make sure? In a sense, there is no point taking
the Government to court after 2020 because they will have failed. They
will have breached the statutory duty and it cannot be un-breached. The
only valid legal action would have to be pre 2020, in which case, what
is the point of 14(4) asking why we failed? It seems odd. It might make
an interesting article, I suppose, but it is not clear what it is
for.</div>
<a name="09102944000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Under-Secretary clarify the matter? What excuse could be given for
failure? Is it her understanding that the statutory duty to reach
targets must be susceptible to legal action prior to 2020? Subsection
(4) concerns a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>post 2020 excuse, which one hopes we would never get, since there would
be no point in having the Bill in the first
place.</div><a name="09102944000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09102944000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000570"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am struck by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
naivety. Does he really believe that, under the Bill, a court would
enforce such targets, that it would intervene and imprison the
Secretary of State for successive failures? The only thing that
has ever happened when a statutory target has been missed is that the
court makes a declaration. There has been no suggestion by anyone
involved in the law that there could be another response unless we
brought in specific provision to allow a court to intervene and
overrule the democratically elected
Government.</div><a name="09102944000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000571"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> A democratically elected Government are passing this
law; it is not undemocratic to enforce something that an elected
Parliament has introduced. I am intrigued by the thought that the
responsible Secretary of State, whom I now understand to be
&#147;probably the Chancellor&#148;, could be locked up.
Presumably, the effect of court action is to require the Government to
take steps to meet their statutory obligations. If the court says,
&#147;You&#146;re not going to meet your targets. You are in breach
of the Child Poverty Act 2010. What are you going to do about
it?&#148;, we hope that the Government, rather than saying,
&#147;Well, you can lock us up if you don&#146;t like it&#148;,
say, &#147;Right, we will take the following measures.&#148; I have
made my main point, but it is a bit odd that we have an excuse clause.
Being able to explain the reason for failure after the event
undermines the whole point of having a statutory binding
target by
2020.</div><a name="09102944000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000572"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I am slightly concerned by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s use of the word &#147;excuse&#148;; it is not
appropriate. Producing a report that explains what has not happened is
different from making an excuse. The truth is that the duty is
absolute. What is being produced is an accountability mechanism for the
end of the period. However, it would be possible for legal action to be
taken before 2020, not, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, if forecasts
suggest that the targets will be missed, but if the Government&#146;s
actions, strategy or decisions will not be sufficient to allow them to
meet their
duties.</div><a name="09102944000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
duties of the Government prior to 2020 are to produce credible
strategies. If they fail to do that, they will be open to legal
challenge, and the claimants would need to produce clear evidence that
they have failed to do that. In that case, there would not be a
Government report before 2020 stating whether or not the targets had
been met. The argument would be about whether the approach being taken
was reasonable and, obviously, it would be up to the Government to show
that they had a credible strategy. If the hon. Gentleman takes those
two things together, he should be reassured that the measure will be an
effective discipline on any Government. It will maintain the
pressure&#151;that is what he is primarily concerned about&#151;and
it will strengthen the force behind our objective of achieving the
targets.</div><a name="09102944000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

preparing a UK strategy, and the Commission, in considering advice,
will need to take into account this
obligation.</i></div><a name="09102944000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
ever, it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Key. The amendment follows on neatly from the points
made rightly, albeit naively, by the hon. Member for Northavon; the
credence that he gave to the Government&#146;s promises was overly
great. Before I deal with the specifics of my amendment, I want to
focus more on statutory targets. What do statutory targets mean? I
asked the Library to investigate the history of statutory targets, and
it duly produced a note on the subject. I wanted to find out whether
they had a history, because it has always seemed manifestly absurd to
put targets in statute, whether in this Bill or in the Climate Change
Act
2008.</div><a name="09102944000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Time
and again in debate on the Climate Change Bill, Ministers boasted of a
legal duty on Government to deliver. When I looked into the history of
statutory targets, I found that no Government prior to this one had
ever put targets into statue, at least according to the House of
Commons Library. Many Back Benchers had come forward with private
Members&#146; Bills that suggested doing exactly that, but they
always had to change the wording to refer to a provision for setting
targets, so as to give the Government of the day the flexibility to
respond in the right way. The Library came through with a list of the
provisions that have been made. The Water Act 2003 has concentration of
fluoride targets, the Housing Act 2004 has energy efficiency of
residential accommodation targets, and there are other targets that
have been put together by the Government. It is a relatively novel
thing to do.</div>
<a name="09102944000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one looks
for legal advice on such matters, one finds the article by Harriet
Townsend on the Climate Change Act 2008. That goes to the point of what
the hon. Member for Northavon said: what enforceability is there? As he
said, why bring genuine child poverty charities and campaigners to
Parliament and make them believe that if the agenda, which they rightly
say should be more central to Government policy making, is put in
statute, the justice that they have long sought for children in poverty
can be had? What is the point if it turns out that we are talking about
sleight of hand, or Government posturing, with no enforceability
mechanisms whatever for those who feel that they had been made a
binding promise, and who believed that it was binding by dint of being
in
statute?</div><a name="09102944000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Harriet
Townsend&#146;s paper on the Climate Change Act 2008, which is well
worth reading because of its relevance to the matter at hand,
effectively says that she cannot see that any duty set in statute can
be enforceable. So far, the only cases that have come before a court,
which I will come to in a moment, have resulted in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>declaration only. I feel that a fraud is being
perpetuated at the heart of the Bill. It is a fraud on all those who
campaign for and care most about child poverty, because the statutory
targets set in the Bill are not, in fact,
enforceable.</div><a name="09102944000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102944000574"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000575"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I would be delighted to hear from the hon.
Gentleman, who I know is a decent and passionate member of this House.
He will be able to tell us how we can, or whether we should, change the
situation.</div><a name="09102944000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000576"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> The feeling is mutual, I assure the hon. Gentleman.
I seek clarity, but not for purposes of mischief. Does he believe that
the eradication of child poverty should be a statutory
obligation?</div>
<a name="09102944000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000577"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> That is a very good question. No Government prior
to this have specialised in setting targets and failing to meet them,
and in painting a picture of a society joined together in social
justice, harmony, happiness and enterprise. Enterprise used to be
allowed, in the early days at least. No Government have ever painted a
picture so compelling, and yet so signally failed to deliver, despite
the vast spending of resources in pursuit of that nirvana. Sadly, it
looks increasingly as though that was money that the country could not
afford.</div>
<a name="09102944000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000578"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I am afraid that I missed the answer; is that a yes
or a no?</div>
<a name="09102944000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000579"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No, for the reason that no previous Government
have set targets in statute. I do not believe that it is right to do
so. There are a number of reasons why, but I shall give him one,
because I think that that will suffice: it had been a fundamental
constitutional principle that one Parliament could not bind another.
After a general election, when a democratically elected Government
comes in, they will doubtless have to take some very tough decisions
indeed, following the wreckage of the UK economy by the Financial
Secretary and his friends; we can all imagine that.</div>
<a name="09102944000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
impossible to imagine that a court of law would intervene and say,
&#147;This statute was passed by a previous Government when they were
still spending money like it was going out of fashion, before we had
our credit withdrawn by the international bond markets. So I&#146;m
afraid your ability to maintain basic public services and the armed
forces, and all other duties, have to be set aside, because there
happens to be a statute in place specifically for this one area of
social policy.&#148; Do pensioners&#146; problems have to go to the
wall while we ensure that the issue of relative poverty is dealt with,
because that one issue was plucked out by a Government desperately
flailing around in their final months, trying to find a dividing line
between them and the Opposition? Is that to be the case? I suggest to
the hon. Gentleman that it is not.</div>
<a name="09102944000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to
my amendment, my timing is probably fortuitous. A fiscal responsibility
Bill proposed in the Prime Minister&#146;s party conference speech on
29 September will</div>
<a name="09102944000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;impose a
legally binding obligation on the Government to reduce public
borrowing.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="09102944000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding the fact
that the Government have introduced the Climate Change Act 2008 and
want to introduce this Bill, they are introducing another legally
binding measure, which apparently means that public borrowing has to be
reduced. My amendment seeks clarification as to whether the Secretary
of State, in preparing a UK strategy, and the commission, in
considering advice, will need to take into account that obligation, as
it would be rather peculiar if they did
not.</div><a name="09102944000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the proposed fiscal responsibility obligations, the
Government are bound by law to meet several other statutory targets. I
will quickly go through some examples. There is a legally binding
target to ensure that the net UK carbon account for 2050 is at least 80
per cent. lower than the 1990 baseline, and a duty to eradicate fuel
poverty in all households by 2015. The Government also propose
legislating for a legal obligation to ensure that the target for
expenditure on official UK development assistance amounts to 0.7 per
cent. of gross national income. This Government love to take things
that we all devoutly wish to see and turn them into law, and they then
expect that that will make those things happen. All those targets will
involve additional public spending, at a time when the Government will
be compelled, either by law or by bond markets, to drastically&#151;I
should say, &#147;drastically to&#148;; I hate split
infinitives&#151;reduce public borrowing. The Institute for Fiscal
Studies said in 2006&#151;this has been frequently quoted in our
proceedings&#151;that an additional &#163;4.3 billion
will have to be spent on tax credits and benefits if we are to meet the
2010
target.</div><a name="09102944000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need clarity on the priority of targets if the Bill is to have any
credibility, notwithstanding the fact that I do not think that it has
any. That need was highlighted by the judicial review brought by
Friends of the Earth and Help the Aged against the Government for
failing to keep their legal duty, as the hon. Member for Copeland will
be aware, to eradicate fuel poverty under the Warm Homes and Energy
Conservation Act 2000. &#147;It is an open-and-shut case&#148;, the
hon. Member for Copeland, or even the hon. Member for Northavon, may
think. The Government&#146;s defence was that it was not</div>
<a name="09102944000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonably
practicable to take all of the measures that would be required to
eradicate fuel poverty, as...the resources are not available to
pay for them all at the present time given the money
available.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say to any child poverty group outside the House that they should bear
that in mind before they accept any promises from this failing
Government.</div>
<a name="09102944000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court
agreed with the Government, and dismissed the claim that they had
breached their duty under the 2000 Act on the grounds that they had

purpose of my amendment is to tease out the issue and ask about the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000580"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Key. Are you
minded to have a separate clause stand part debate? It would be
possible to make the stand part points on the amendment, but if not I
will shut up now and wait for the stand part
debate.</div><a name="09102944000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000581"></a>The

that.</div>
<a name="09102944000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000582"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Mr. Key. I also thank the
hon. Member for Northavon for a helpful clarification there. One or two
points arise from the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness, which I will address in the context of the
stand part debate, but I turn more specifically to amendment 61 and the
background to it. I thank my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment as
it enables us to probe a little deeper the Government&#146;s thinking
in this
area.</div><a name="09102944000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until
relatively recently we have had 10 years of benign global economic
conditions. The Government were running a deficit through many of those
years, but until a couple of years ago we were travelling through
relatively good economic weather. But we are not going to meet our 2010
targets. The explanation Ministers have given us has been that we are
constrained by the financial situation. The Financial Secretary told us
during the evidence
session:</div><a name="09102944000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the current environment, Government spending is very tightly
constrained. That, in particular, is what has limited what has been
possible over the last couple of
years.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child Poverty
Public Bill Committee, </i>20 October 2009; c. 9,
Q21.]</div><a name="09102944000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a time when the Government consider that large deficits are part of
their economic strategy in an attempt to revise Keynesian economics and
to spend our way out of a recession. We have seen deficits reaching
record peacetime levels as a percentage of GDP. We suspect it will
reach 14 per cent., which is twice the figure it was when Denis Healey
had to go to the IMF in 1976. This has not been a time when the
Government have been noticeably diligent in keeping deficits down at a
low level, yet that has still been a constraint on Government policy
and the ability to meet the 2010 target.</div>
<a name="09102944000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">If this has
been a period of highly restrained public spending, I should like to
know what would constitute an unrestrained period of spending. We are
about to enter into a period of severe financial constraint, despite
the rhetoric that we occasionally hear now and heard more earlier in
the year about the difference between Labour investment and Tory
cuts.</div>
<a name="09102944000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000583"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> We do not hear quite so much of it
now.</div><a name="09102944000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000584"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> No, we do not, although we heard a little bit of it
from the hon. Member for Amber Valley earlier today. We know that the
Government intend to reduce public spending significantly in the period
from 2011. We have now seen Treasury documents showing reductions in
departmental spending over a period of three or four years of over 9
per cent. Of course, we heard the Prime Minister&#146;s party
conference speech on 29 September, to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>which my hon. Friend referred. It consisted largely
of unfunded spending commitments, but it also mentioned a fiscal
responsibility Act that would make it legally binding to reduce the
deficit. Presumably, legally binding means legally enforceable.
Somebody would be able to take the Government to court in an attempt to
reduce the deficits, in much the same way as somebody will be able to
bring the Government to court for failing to deliver on their child
poverty
strategies.</div><a name="09102944000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that the Child Poverty Bill may result in higher public
spending as a consequence of action taken pursuant to it. The Financial
Secretary was clear about that when in his evidence to the Committee
on 20 October he
said:</div><a name="09102944000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
certainly could be a judicial review that in effect required the
Government to spend more on tax credits or some other element of the
benefit or tax credit
system.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
also
said:</div><a name="09102944000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under
the Bill, a court could, in response to a judicial review, require the
Government to make substantial spending commitments in order for the
targets to be met.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Child Poverty Public Bill Committee, </i>20 October 2009; c. 11,
Q26-28.]</div><a name="09102944000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
quotation is interesting, and I hope that some of us will get the
opportunity to debate the fiscal responsibility Bill. One could easily
reword the Minister&#146;s statement. Indeed, I might have the
opportunity to ask the Financial Secretary whether it would be possible
for the Government to be subject to judicial review to meet the deficit
requirements. He might respond, &#147;Under the Bill, a court could,
in response to a judicial review, require the Government to make
substantial spending cuts in order for the targets to be met.&#148;
We could face two actions simultaneously; one requiring the Government
to spend more money, and the other requiring them to spend less. That
is something of a
mess.</div><a name="09102944000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000585"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The hon. Gentleman is astute and he will appreciate
that the money required to tackle child poverty is but a relatively
small subset of total public spending. He will therefore fully
appreciate that it is not inconsistent to do more on child poverty
while simultaneously reducing overall spending or the deficit. I think
that he is saying that, if he is a member of a future Conservative
Government, he would not like to be bound by the child poverty
obligation. He would like to be able to say at that point,
&#147;Money&#146;s tough; we&#146;ll put it on hold.&#148; That
is what I think he is really
saying.</div><a name="09102944000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000586"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am trying to get some clarity from the
Government. The Government have a tendency, for the reasons outlined by
my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, to pass
legislation that is essentially declaratory in nature. Why not extend
the principle to a statement about spending on the NHS, the armed
forces or a whole range of other areas? I do not want to stray into a
wider critique of legislation by declaration, because I want to say
something about that in the stand part debate. However, who determines
the balance of priorities? Should it be a matter for politicians and
for Ministers accountable to Parliament? I accept the point made by the
hon. Member for Northavon, but we could find ourselves in a crisis or
in a situation similar to the one we are in at the moment. The
Government are saying, &#147;We are not going to meet our child
poverty targets or do more to meet them, because we have run out of
money.&#148; If we are in such a situation in 10 years, what will
happen when two pieces of legislation are going in diametrically
opposite directions?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div><a name="09102944000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000587"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> This goes to the nub of the Bill. Presumably, the
point is, as the hon. Gentleman said, that any future Government can
repeal the Act or amend it. However, what we are doing today is
increasing the political price of doing so. Given that we all care
about the abolition of child poverty, is that not a worthwhile thing to
do?</div><a name="09102944000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000588"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Again, the hon. Gentleman prompts me to say
something that I was going to say a little later. The Bill has two
provisions that put political pressure on Ministers. The first is the
report, the publication of the strategy, and the fact that Parliament
has an opportunity to review and scrutinise. Everything is in the
public domain. It is clear what the targets are and the Government must
be clear about what they are doing and how successful their strategies
are. It would be fair to say that Kate Green&#146;s remarks during
the evidence sessions were principally about political pressure. I
think that evidence reflects generally what is being said by the
outside bodies.</div>
<a name="09102944000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the judicial review point, which I feel a degree of uneasiness about,
because it puts essentially political questions to the judiciary. There
is a danger in that. My hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and
Holderness alighted upon the point that when there are two particular
measures&#151;the targets that the Government seek to legislate
for&#151;they could well move in opposite directions. As we speak,
they are dragging the Government in different directions. I think it is
right to highlight
that.</div><a name="09102944000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000589"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that it is a binary
equation that to reduce child poverty we must increase public
spending?</div>
<a name="09102944000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000590"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a helpful point. Our
argument on tackling child poverty&#151;it is a point that the
Government have made as well; they set it out very clearly in the
explanatory notes&#151;is that it is not simply a matter of spending
more money in income transfers. That is not a sustainable way of
addressing child poverty. We fully endorse that and have been arguing
that point for some time. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman
agrees. Nonetheless, if we want at all costs to meet the target and we
have a binding obligation that we have to meet, and if, particularly
towards the end of the strategy period, we want a quick fix, we can do
that quickly by raising benefits and tax credits. The evidence of the
IFS, for example, is that if the Government in the pre-Budget report,
which is due in a few weeks&#146; time, decide to go down that route,
they could still meet their 2010 target. We do not expect them to do
that. We do not think that it is sustainable, and the public finances
cannot support that. I am not criticising the decision that will be
made in the PBR, but we must bear it in mind that the Bill could be
used as a way of saying, &#147;You must spend more on benefits and
tax credits,&#148; which the Minister, to be fair, acknowledged
during the evidence session.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000591"></a>Mr.

binary equation. Given that we all accept that it is not a binary
equation, that we all recognised on Second Reading that it is about
priorities and that there is flexibility within any democratically
elected Government&#146;s portfolio for choosing priorities, surely
there can be no grounds for objecting to this being a statutory
obligation?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div><a name="09102944000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000592"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> In a way, the hon. Gentleman is perhaps arguing for
some clarification, which is what the amendment seeks to provide. If I
understand it correctly, it seeks to make it clear that meeting the
targets is subject to the fiscal responsibility Bill&#151;assuming it
comes into force. What the hon. Gentleman argues for is fine&#151;we
can meet the terms of the fiscal responsibility Bill, because it is not
just about money, and I do not disagree with his essential analysis.
The amendment is trying to explore what would happen if we were in a
similar position to our current one in 10 years&#146; time. When
faced with an obligation, would the Government be able to say,
&#147;Hold on, getting our deficit down is very important.&#148;? I
think the amendment makes it clear which one would
prevail.</div><a name="09102944000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="09102944000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we have two separate obligations going in different directions, I am
not entirely sure what the judges are supposed to do. Do they just pick
the one that they like most? Do they pick the most recent one? As I
understand it, subsequent legislation is seen to be superior
to&#151;overrides&#151;previous legislation, but it does not always
work like that. For example, going back a long time to when I was an
undergraduate, if I remember correctly the European Communities Act
1972 is an implied term in every piece of legislation passed since the
Act, so unless the legislation expressly overrides that Act, it is
subject to it&#151;that is what the Factortame line of cases
established. I do not think that that applies here, but there is
potential uncertainty.</div>
<a name="09102944000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether this is an opportunity for the Minister to save some legal fees
for the likes of the Child Poverty Action Group, or whoever might
subject the Government to judicial review, and provide some clarity as
to how the two pieces of legislation&#151;one before us and one
promised&#151;will hang together. That clarity would be useful in
understanding exactly how the Bill works.</div>
<a name="09102944000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000593"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I could not help but notice as the hon. Member for
Beverley and Holderness opened the debate that the new era he announced
to us this morning&#151;the one in which he will not be overstating
his case&#151;has not started yet, although I look forward to it. I
found myself firmly in agreement with one point that he made&#151;his
antipathy to the use of split infinitives. I share that with him, but I
am afraid not a great deal else.</div>
<a name="09102944000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The essential
point is that the goals of fiscal responsibility and eradicating child
poverty are not incompatible&#151;we have to achieve both. The
targets will certainly have to be achieved in a fiscally responsible
way. If that was not possible, the long-term sustainability of our
child poverty commitment would not be delivered. The
strategy&#151;when it is published within 12 months of Royal
Assent&#151;will need to set out how that will be achieved, and how
the targets will be delivered in a fiscally responsible way. Those
goals are consistent with clause 15, which requires the Secretary of
State to take into account fiscal and economic circumstances. I shall
argue, when we come to the stand part debate, that that obligation is a
strength of the Bill because, in fulfilling it, the Secretary of State
will need to take the likely impact on public borrowing into account
when preparing a strategy to meet those targets. The clause requires
the Secretary of State to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>have regard to those responsibilities when setting out his proposed
action for meeting the targets.</div>
<a name="09102944000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fiscal responsibility Bill will require the Government to reduce the
budget deficit year on year to ensure that national debt remains
sustainable in the medium term. That is, and must be consistent with,
the Secretary of State&#146;s obligation to take into account the
impact of child poverty measures on public borrowing. The publication
of annual reports will provide a transparent accountability framework
to enable regular monitoring and scrutiny of progress. Those
accountability arrangements will ensure that we continue to make
progress in a sustainable way. That was always going to need to be an
obligation and a characteristic of the strategy when it was produced.
The hon. Gentleman made a perfectly fair point. The requirement is
highlighted by the announcement of the fiscal responsibility Bill, but
that would always have to have been a part of the strategy.</div>
<a name="09102944000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Bill
allows us to plan to meet both those obligations, so I hope the hon.
Gentleman will accept my reassurances on that point and feel able to
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09102944000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000594"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> What can the Minister tell us about
enforceability? I spoke a lot about it&#151;he is humorous about the
new era of me understating my case, which he and I devoutly wish to see
begin, but perhaps not today. The point about the unenforceability of
this and other statutory targets is not just mine&#151;it may be a
minority point of view in Parliament, but not in the legal community.
The Minister needs to take the issue
seriously.</div><a name="09102944000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
go back to Harriet Townsend, the barrister who said, in the context of
the Climate Change
Bill:</div><a name="09102944000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Notwithstanding
the potential for judicial review, both
the&#148;</div><a name="09102944000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">duties</div><a name="09102944000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
ensure compliance with the five yearly budgets would, in my opinion, be
ultimately unenforceable in the
courts.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the legal view. I know there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing on the
topic during the Climate Change Bill, but could the Minister bring us
up to date with the Government&#146;s legal position? Have the
Government taken counsel&#146;s advice on legal enforceability? That
goes to the heart of my
amendment.</div><a name="09102944000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two questions: mine, about enforceability; and secondly, about how
that enforceability works when we have, potentially, legislation
pointing in different directions, one direction requiring a reduction
in government expenditure and another an increase. Although the
Minister has a capability&#151;nay, a facility&#151;to sound
reasonable while saying things that are indefensible to my mind, while
I have exactly the opposite ability at many times, I would be
interested to hear from him on both those
points.</div><a name="09102944000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000595"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me attempt to tackle that point. The courts can
respond in a variety of ways in relation to judicial review. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned a declaration, which a court can make; a court
could quash an order, require a Government to set aside a particular
policy decision, issue a prohibiting order forbidding an action, or
issue a mandatory order requiring a particular course of action. The
courts have many measures at their disposal if they seek to determine a
judicial review against the Government on either of the Bills under
discussion.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div><a name="09102944000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000596"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I take it from the Minister&#146;s answer that
he is seriously suggesting that a court would use any such powers. The
main focus of the Bill is incomes. I think that Ministers have accepted
and agreed that when we get towards the end of the period, the
long-term issues around improving children&#146;s centres, early
intervention, lack of attainment in families at an early age and so on
go out of the window, at least in terms of meeting a target that is
fixed in time. Does the Minister believe that the courts&#151;or
anyone&#151;could enforce action against Government on the child
poverty target in the early years? That is my first
question.</div><a name="09102944000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the only time that I could conceive of a court starting to use any of
the fairly strong measures that the Minister talked
about&#151;barring or insisting on certain activity by the
Government&#151;would be right at the end. My hon. Friend the Member
for South-West Hertfordshire has tried putting counterfactuals to the
Minister before, with limited success in gleaning a full answer, but if
the legal duty existed now, would the Minister expect a court to insist
that the &#163;4.3 billion or whatever is spent by Government in
order to meet the 2010 target? Does the Minister seriously expect that
sort of thing to happen in future? If he does not, that would suggest
what Jeff Rooker said during consideration of the Climate Change
Bill:</div><a name="09102944000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not just about the punishment in the event of failure; it is about
trying to change institutional behaviour through a change in the
law.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 27
November 2007; Vol. 696, c.
1209.]</div><a name="09102944000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
a rather vague concept, but I have always found Jeff Rooker an honest
and straightforward Minister and I think that he was effectively
saying, as best he could, that the target was not enforceable. He hoped
that, by putting it in statute, it might be taken a bit more seriously
by the civil servants and others than it would otherwise, but it is not
a legally enforceable
target.</div><a name="09102944000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000597"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall be brief because the points I wanted to
make in the clause stand part debate I made with regard to amendment
61. There are two key elements to the pressure placed on Ministers by
the Bill. The expression, &#147;Holding the Minister&#146;s feet to
the fire&#148;, has been used on more than one occasion. Kate Green
of the Child Poverty Action Group, for example, said in evidence to
us:</div><a name="09102944000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Of
more importance to us is that the Bill gives public profile and a
political push to the issue and ensures that there is constant progress
and momentum.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Child
Poverty Public Bill Committee, </i>20 October 2009; c. 34,
Q80.]</div><a name="09102944000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her
focus was on that, although, of course, she acknowledged the
possibility of judicial review. I am nervous that Ministers, in seeking
to achieve a range of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>objectives, are held accountable to Parliament, but decisions may be
made ultimately by the judiciary. There is a difficult tension between
keeping deficits down and wanting to raise benefits to meet child
poverty targets. The Government, including the Financial Secretary, are
wrestling with that dilemma on a daily basis, in preparation for the
pre-Budget
report.</div><a name="09102944000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other areas of tension. Returning to evidence provided by Kate
Green, she raised concerns about a tension between welfare reform and
meeting the targets. That is difficult, as there is cross-party
consensus on the need for welfare reform to do more to end a culture of
dependency. That involves sticks and carrots&#151;the exact
composition of the sticks and carrots is a finely balanced judgment. It
is possible to imagine circumstances in which Ministers take one view
of the right course of action and the judiciary another. I worry about
too many powers being passed on to the judiciary rather than
democratically elected politicians. It is a concern.</div>
<a name="09102944000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps most
significant is the issue that we return to with clause 15: the economic
and fiscal circumstances. It is reasonable for the Government to
include the clause. I know it has received some criticism. In all
honesty, a Government must always act in accordance with economic and
fiscal circumstances. My general criticism of the Government is that
they have not done enough of that over recent years with regard to the
public
finances.</div><a name="09102944000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister almost implied that the constraint on the targets&#151;if
there is, in reality, much of a constraint&#151;would always be
there. Governments always have to act responsibly or should do so, and,
ultimately, we do not object to the
clause.</div><a name="09102944000433"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000598"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Whereas we
do.</div><a name="09102944000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
clause stand part debate allows us to question what might happen if the
clause was not part of the Bill. Presumably, clause 15(1)(a) means that
the Secretary of State might be reckless. The probable Chancellor might
decide to have no regard for economic or fiscal circumstances,
taxation, public spending or public borrowing. The idea that, when
forming policy, a future Chancellor might have no regard for public
spending, taxation or public borrowing is a tad
unlikely.</div><a name="09102944000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000599"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> This one
would.</div><a name="09102944000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000600"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> All right. Let me put it another way: the
proposition that clause 15 would make a blind bit of difference to
whether a future Chancellor had regard for public borrowing or public
spending is unlikely. Assuming that the Financial Secretary anticipates
his colleagues and successors in that role, I am sure that he would not
suggest that they would behave in such a manner. I am not clear about
the restraining impact of subsection (1)(a). In a sense, such a measure
is unnecessary under that subsection and it is inappropriate under
subsection (1)(b), which deals with the child poverty
commission.</div><a name="09102944000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
might say that we are talking only about a bunch of academics, but even
they will presumably have regard for such matters when making a
recommendation about tackling child poverty. We must assume that we
have followed the personal specification under schedule 1 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>and that they are a body of fine people with knowledge of the
formulation, implementation and evaluation of poverty, and experience
of research into child poverty and work with
children. The idea that they just head off to another planet without
regard for the environment in which they work seems implausible, but we
do not want them to self-censor. We want the child poverty commission
to say something a bit uncomfortable occasionally&#151;something that
might require serious public spending or taxation&#151;and it will
then be for Ministers to
decide.</div><a name="09102944000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not want the child poverty commission internalising such matters or
pre-empting the political judgment of priorities&#151;that is not its
job. Its job is not to weigh up the relative merits of spending money
on nuclear weapons or child poverty, but to advise on cost-effective
ways of tackling child poverty. The Government can then judge between
alternative strategies for that or other issues on which they want to
spend money. I cannot see how clause 15 would ever be used. Will
someone take the Secretary of State to court for not being fiscally
responsible in his approach to child poverty? That is pretty
implausible. We have already heard how difficult it is to enforce the
entire Bill, let alone the clause. Will we take action in law against
the child poverty commission for being a bit irresponsible? What is the
clause doing? Why is it in the
Bill?</div><a name="09102944000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
what circumstances could the clause be used? In evidence to this
Committee and, indeed, to the Work and Pensions Committee, the Minister
said that he would go away and think about the matter. I should be
interested to know how that lunch time went. My underlying worry is
that we have a binding target. The right hon. Gentleman assured us that
it is not undermined by clause 15. Perhaps we ought to have a
metaphorical clause 15 in all Bills requiring such things of everyone
and all people. Why do we have the clause in this Bill, when such a
measure could fit into any Bill? That is odd. What is it about the Bill
that makes the Government want to add such a provision to it? Unless we
are given a convincing reason for its inclusion, we cannot agree with
it.</div><a name="09102944000369"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000601"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me start by confirming that clause 15 does not
have an impact on the binding character of the target, which is a point
that the hon. Member for Northavon rightly said that I had made before.
In my view, clause 15 strengthens the Bill. The truth is that we shall
achieve the targets only if we can establish an economically
sustainable way to do so. The hon. Gentleman focused on subsection
(1)(b) and, if we were to remove the clause, it is true that we would
then liberate the commission to produce advice unrestrained by economic
realities&#151;sometimes that can be advised by his party. But what
use would that be? I do not agree with him about this. I think that we
want the commission to be constrained by realities. The hard bit of the
job is determining how we are going to achieve these targets in a way
that is consistent with the realities of what will happen over the next
10 years, and that is precisely what we want the commission to help us
with. I do not think that anyone is interested in well meaning flights
of fancy. What we want from the strategy and from the
commission&#146;s advice is hard-headed measures consistent with
economic reality because those are what can be implemented to eradicate
child
poverty.</div><a name="09102944000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000602"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Will the Minister remind us who appoints these
people? Do not he or his colleagues appoint them, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>and does he really think he will appoint people given to flights of
fancy? Surely these are expert people who live in the real world. Why
do they need a legal duty to do something that they will do
anyway?</div><a name="09102944000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000603"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think it will be very helpful for the commission
to have this clear remit that it is to formulate advice that is
consistent with the financial circumstances over the next 10 years. I
can think of many experts who have given advice on a variety of topics
that does not comply with the clause as it is set out in the Bill. We
want this particular group of experts to give us advice that does
comply. It is a strength of the Bill that that is made explicit so that
everybody is clear what is
required.</div><a name="09102944000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000604"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The Minister has said something significant and I
want to make sure that I understood it correctly. He rightly said that
we need to find a sustainable solution to eradicating child
poverty&#151;we are all with him on that. By that I took him to mean
one that was financially sustainable and did not break the bank. Is he
implying that if we are not quite there in 2018 and 2019 but a
significant increase in tax credits would take us there, yet that would
not be sustainable for the UK economy, it would not be the right thing
to
do?</div><a name="09102944000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000605"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman puts a hypothetical situation to
me. There will be a series of three-year strategies over the next
decade and annual reports against each of them. The hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire quoted what I said on this: I do not think
that when we get to the latter point of the decade what has happened
will take us by surprise. As for whether clause 15 should be in the
Bill, it is undoubtedly a strength of the Bill that it is here. It
gives a clarity of purpose to everybody
involved.</div><a name="09102944000374"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div><a name="09102944000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000606"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have one or two brief questions. First, paragraph
9 gives a power to the Secretary of State to exclude or modify the
absolute low income targets. The Secretary of State can either amend
the percentage specified or the base year with regard to the absolute
low income target, or repeal it altogether. The explanatory notes are
helpful in explaining why the power exists in respect of that one
target and not the others. As the hon. Member for Northavon has
mentioned on more than one occasion, this is the least ambitious of
the four targets. The intention is, presumably, under
paragraph 9(1)(a), for there to be an opportunity to renew
and update the targets in a more ambitious and meaningful way&#151;I
understand that. The alternative approach, in paragraph 9(1)(b), is to
repeal clause 4 altogether, because the target has been met, and is
therefore meaningless, so we can just move on to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>focus on the other three. However, there is nothing in paragraph
9(1)(b), as far as I can see, that says that the repeal applies only in
the event of the target being met. I might be raising an unlikely
hypothetical situation, but if there is no economic growth in the years
ahead and, somehow, the target is not met, I understand that would
still be possible for the Government to repeal the target. Is that
interpretation right? Is there an argument for stating that the power
to repeal should exist only in the event of the target being met in
2021?</div><a name="09102944000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
if I interpret the schedule correctly, if the target has not been met,
the infrastructure that exists under the Bill&#151;the strategy, the
reports and so on&#151;does not apply because it falls, under the
Bill. However, there is an obligation on the Secretary of State to set
out regulations that, by and large, bring them back. I should be
grateful if the Minister told us how much discretion exists in respect
of the nature of the reports, strategies and so on, and whether
paragraph 3, in particular, gives the extent of the discretion that is
available to the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09102944000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
paragraph 2
says:</div><a name="09102944000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the target statement relating to the target year or a renewed target
year indicates that the targets have been met in relation to that
financial year, the Secretary of State must ensure that they are also
met in relation to the financial year following that in which that
target statement is laid before
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="09102944000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Using
our example of 2020, that means that we might anticipate, although we
cannot be certain, that the target statement will be made in the first
quarter of 2022. There is a target for 2020-21 but none for the year
2021-22, and then the target comes back again for 2022-23&#151;that
is the way I read it, but I might have missed something. I am sure that
if I have, the Minister will not have done, and that he will clarify
those
points.</div><a name="09102944000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000607"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Paragraph
9(1)(a) provides the power to make regulations to amend the absolute
income target and the base year. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>Paragraph 9(1)(b) enables clause 4&#151;the absolute measure&#151;to
be repealed instead of a new target and base year being set, reflecting
the fact that there is a slightly different status to the target. The
hon. Member for Northavon has argued that that should not be a target
at all, and I made the case that, in our view, in response to the
consultation responses that we received, it was right to have it.
However, it is conceivable that, in the decade after 2020, a different
view might be taken, which explains the ability provided by the
regulations. Of course, the Bill requires all four of the targets,
including this one, to be hit by
2020.</div><a name="09102944000383"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000608"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Yes, the Bill does require it, but after
2020&#151;this is the purpose of the schedule&#151;it is possible,
as I read the schedule, for the requirement to be withdrawn or
abolished, even if it has not been met. I accept that it is
theoretically unlikely, but it is
possible.</div><a name="09102944000434"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="09102944000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102944000609"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. There is not a
requirement to hit it before that provision is
available.</div><a name="09102944000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of why there is not more detail about strategies and
reports, the provisions are a bit different in schedule 2. We took the
view that it was not appropriate to provide the same level of
regulatory detail for strategies and reports after 2020 because someone
else will have had another look at them by then, one would
imagine.</div><a name="09102944000386"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
