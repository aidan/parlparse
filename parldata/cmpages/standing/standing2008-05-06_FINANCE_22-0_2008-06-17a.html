<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000358"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am delighted to be back in the Chair. I am
sorry that I could not be with you this morning. I was attending a
thanksgiving service for the late right hon. Lord Pym, who had been a
Conservative Government Chief Whip, Foreign Secretary, Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland and Secretary of State for Defence. If you
can have a thanksgiving service that is enjoyable, it was indeed
enjoyable.</div><a name="080617113000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
regret to say I have been advised that somewhat slow progress was made
this morning. I am not looking at either party when I say that, because
clearly debate and discussion is important, but I have a
feeling&#151;I hope&#151;that some progress will be made this
afternoon. We were dealing with clause 154 stand part, and I believe
that the spokesman for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition was on his feet,
and I ask him to rise again and to be succinct in his comments to the
Committee. I call Mr. Philip
Holland.</div><a name="080617113000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000359"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hammond</b> (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con): Hammond.
We have been colleagues for only 11 years, Sir Nicholas. I
think that I can assure you that progress will be made this afternoon,
as you require. I am trying very hard not to take the situation before
the start of the sitting regarding the quorum as being any
reflection on the gravity of the matters we are discussing.</div>
<a name="080617113000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, I was asking the Minister whether the provision was designed
to deal with all extra-statutory concessions&#151;in other words, the
ending of the extra-statutory concession regime&#151;or whether it
was designed to deal only with those extra-statutory concessions that
fall foul of the Wilkinson judgment. No doubt the Minister will explain
precisely the circumstances in which it will be used in due course. I
was making the point that the definition of an existing HMRC concession
under the clause
is</div><a name="080617113000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
statement made by the Commissioners...and having effect at that
time, that they would treat persons as if they were entitled
to...a reduction&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column760" />Column number: 760</div><a name="080617113000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The essence
of the Wilkinson judgment is that some of these statements clearly were
ultra vires, and I am asking whether extra-statutory concessions that
have operated, but have now been demonstrated to have been ultra vires
from the beginning, can be the subject of the powers in this clause to
turn them into statutory concessions. Following that thought process,
why it was not decided to use primary legislation&#151;perhaps a
clause in the Bill&#151;to legislate on the extra-statutory
concessions that are in use, but that are thought perhaps to fall foul
of the Wilkinson judgment, in a way that would be rather more
transparent than this order-making power. Why cannot we just have a
clause in the Bill that lists the various provisions so that we make
proper primary legislation to give effect to them? Could it be that
Ministers fear attempts to amend them, given that the orders will
clearly not be amendable? Will the Minister clarify the process that is
being
used?</div><a name="080617113000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are
there any circumstances in which the fact that an extra-statutory
concession has been unlawful&#151;that it was operated ultra
vires&#151;could give rise to a demand on a taxpayer? I do not claim
to be an expert on tax law, but I have at the back of my mind the case
of a well-known proprietor of a famous grocery store in which the
courts held that an arrangement that the Revenue had made with regard
to the tax payable was unlawful and ordered that the Revenue
essentially negate the arrangement.</div>
<a name="080617113000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the process of identifying extra-statutory concessions as
possibly being without foundation in law until such time as the
processes set out in the clause are used to determine statutory
concessions could give rise to a taxpayer finding the concession
effectively withdrawn retrospectively because it had never been lawful,
with an additional liability thus arising on the taxpayer. If the
Minister is able to confirm that there will be no such circumstances,
that would reassure a great many people who have benefited from
extra-statutory
concessions.</div><a name="080617113000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000360"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): If the Minister is not
able to give that reassurance, perhaps she will indicate that if she
does discover any circumstances of this kind, she will extend a
retrospective amnesty to anybody affected so that they are not required
to come up with a retrospective
payment.</div><a name="080617113000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000361"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I like to push the envelope, but I suspect that
asking Ministers to grant retrospective amnesties might be pushing the
envelope a bit too far. I am sure that everyone on the Committee is
anxious to hear the Minister&#146;s response.</div>
<a name="080617113000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister clarify something about the way in which the clause will be
operated that is not clear from reading the Bill or the explanatory
notes? Is this a one-off provision to deal with the stock of unlawful
ESCs?</div>
<a name="080617113000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000362"></a><b class="B">The
Financial Secretary</b><b class="B"> to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy)</b>
<i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div><a name="080617113000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000363"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister nods, which implies that that is the
case. Can we therefore take it as read that once the backlog is
cleared, there will be no use of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column761" />Column number: 761</div>procedure whereby something is delivered as an extra-statutory
concession and then formalised into a statutory concession through the
processes set out in clause 154? Is this exercise a one-off clearing of
the
backlog?</div><a name="080617113000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister tell us about the consultation process? Presumably there
will be consultation over the ESCs that are proposed to be enshrined in
statute. The clause gives a power to introduce them in a form that is
amended as HMRC thinks fit. This is not simply a question of the
industry and Parliament rubber-stamping existing concessions. There is
clearly an opportunity for HMRC to tweak the concessions that have
operated and to enshrine them in statute in a slightly different form.
I understand that it is intended that there will be consultation with
tax professionals on any proposed orders to be made under this clause.
Will the Minister give a sense of the time scale and the period of
consultation that would be allowed?</div>
<a name="080617113000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will
be some important issues to consider because, almost by definition, an
extra-statutory concession is more flexible than a piece of statute. If
these rules from the Revenue practice manual, as operated without
statutory basis, are to be enshrined in statute, they will have to be
defined, perhaps in a language and in a way that is more formal and
prescriptive than the manual requires. Therefore, when the drafts are
published, there will be issues at the margin about the extent to which
the concession is being extended, or the scope to which it is being
reduced. There will be considerable desire within the profession for an
opportunity to study and comment on them.</div>
<a name="080617113000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has indicated that she will be able to say something about the
number of extra-statutory concessions and the timetable for reviewing
them. That will give the Committee a sense of the operation&#146;s
scale. Will she tell us how many of them are expected to be enacted
into statute through the use of this
clause?</div><a name="080617113000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000364"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the Financial Secretary, I
apologise profusely and personally&#151;yet again&#151;to the hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge for my error in respect of his
surname. I give a commitment that I shall do my best not to make the
mistake again during this Public Bill
Committee.</div><a name="080617113000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000365"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It is a pleasure to be under your chairmanship
this afternoon, Sir Nicholas, and I look forward to scampering through
the clauses with you. You should not apologise too profusely; it keeps
the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge humble if he has to respond
to other names
occasionally.</div><a name="080617113000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of the clause was absolutely right.
A decision of the courts in the Wilkinson case made clear that the
scope of HMRC&#146;s administrative discretion was somewhat narrower
than had previously been supposed. That decision triggered the review
of the extra-statutory concessions that have been a feature of the tax
system for decades. In the course of the review, HMRC has identified
approaching 500 extra-statutory concessions, the vast majority of
which, I am advised, are within discretion, as the law defines them,
and which the Wilkinson court case allowed. They are perfectly okay.
They will continue and do not need the clause we are
discussing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column762" />Column number: 762</div><a name="080617113000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">This clause
enables us, in a relatively short period of time, to come forward with
the remaining extra-statutory concessions that can be brought back
within the law using this procedure, but it is possible that we will
not be able to bring a small number of extra-statutory concessions that
remain on to a statutory footing. We need to consider what we will do
in the event of those concessions being considered to be valuable and
of benefit to the taxpayer and to the
Government.</div><a name="080617113000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000366"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will the Minister tell the Committee the status
regarding current practice for the small number to which she referred?
What is the message to taxpayers who are benefiting from them at the
present
time?</div><a name="080617113000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000367"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I hope that you will allow me, Sir
Nicholas, to ask&#151;forgive me for doing so&#151;for support for
this clause without being drawn too far into the detail because the
review is ongoing. I will want to think very carefully about some of
these concessions and the way in which we respond, particularly
regarding those that appear difficult to fix, in the sense of putting
them on a statutory footing. Some concessions will be widely supported
among the public, and we will need to think about how we respond to the
effect of the court judgment. There are about 20 or so for which that
might be the case, and there are tens of others that we think need to
be brought back on to a statutory basis as a result of this
clause.</div><a name="080617113000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000368"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I understand that a review is in progress, but it
is clearly important for taxpayers to know whether they can rely on an
extra-statutory concession on which they have been advised in the past.
It would have been very easy for the Financial Secretary to say,
&#147;I assure taxpayers that they will be safe; they have nothing to
worry about.&#148; However, she did not say that, so I wonder whether
we should read anything into
that.</div><a name="080617113000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000369"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I was going to come to that point. The
concessions that have already been given will stand. No tax decision
that has already been taken is affected by this, but going forward, we
need to put on a statutory basis those concessions that need to be put
on to a statutory basis, and we will then need to consider what we do
about the others. The normal concessions that HMRC can make&#151;this
has been clarified by the court case&#151;are very small in monetary
terms, but they might be of significance to the individual. For
example, HMRC would normally not be expected to pursue &#163;100 of
tax if gathering the revenue was going to cost &#163;200. It is
perfectly lawful for HMRC to make those sorts of concessions. We will
need to consider how we deal with others that have become the practice
and for which I think there may be public
support.</div><a name="080617113000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000370"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I think that the Minister is telling the
Committee that, regarding those familiar concessions that might fall
foul of the Wilkinson judgment, the message to taxpayers is that they
will not lose out as a result of this obscure process. Nobody is going
to find that they suddenly have a tax bill when they thought that they
had a concession. If the Minister can confirm that, that would be very
helpful, but can she explain to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column763" />Column number: 763</div>me&#151;I am sorry, but I am not a lawyer&#151;how, if a court has
effectively struck down HMRC&#146;s practice and found that unlawful,
HMRC is able to carry on operating these extra statutory concessions in
the meantime, given that I gather that the judgment was made some time
ago? On what basis can that
happen?</div><a name="080617113000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000371"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes several points. First,
there will be no retrospective element regarding the decisions around
Wilkinson and their effect. Secondly, he should never apologise for not
being a lawyer.</div>
<a name="080617113000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, in
response to a serious point that the hon. Gentleman makes, HMRC has
been working since the court case to identify the extra-statutory
concessions and to then analyse which are within the law and which are
ultra vires. That work is ongoing. Although I take the point that the
hon. Gentleman makes, HMRC has taken this opportunity to bring forward
a piece of amending legislation that will allow it not to have to wait
until the next Finance Bill to introduce a change that will help people
who rely on concessions regarding the concessions that can be brought
on to a statutory basis.</div>
<a name="080617113000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said that such a statutory instrument would be unamendable.
We have this discussion about statutory instruments regularly, but I
think that it would be an inefficient and wasteful use of parliamentary
time to enact individual concessions in primary legislation merely to
formalise existing and often long-standing tax treatments. The enabling
power will allow only concessions that are already part of the fabric
of the tax regime to be put on a statutory footing by the Treasury, so
it would not be appropriate for them to be amendable
anyway.</div>
<a name="080617113000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000372"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I think that the Minister&#146;s colleague, the
hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, might have something to
say about the Minister&#146;s comments about lawyers in due
course.</div><a name="080617113000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Minister saying that when the powers in clause 154 are used, the
effect will be to treat the extra-statutory concession as having always
been a statutory arrangement? In other words, is the legal effect of
the clause retrospective? Does it provide legal underpinning to the
terms of the extra-statutory concession? I have to confess that, in
practical terms, I like what the Minister is saying. She is, I think,
telling us that no taxpayer will suffer retrospectively and that no one
will find out that their extra-statutory concession for last year has
been withdrawn because it was never valid. Although I am glad that that
will be the effect, I do not understand the mechanism for achieving
that. Ministers cannot wish away the fact that HMRC has been acting
unlawfully. They either have to make HMRC&#146;s actions
retrospectively lawful, or they have to find another way of
underpinning the
concessions.</div><a name="080617113000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000373"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I absolutely hear what the hon. Gentleman is
saying and, intuitively, I think he is right. However, my advice is
that the court decision does not strike down the concessions. A
concession exists until the legislation takes over but because that
seems so counter-intuitive to me, too, I would like to examine that in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column764" />Column number: 764</div>more detail and write to him with an absolute answer, for the avoidance
of all doubt, about exactly what the legal position is and has been
since the court made its
decision.</div><a name="080617113000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000374"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am somewhat reassured that Ministers are as
confused as we are about exactly what is going on here. I think that we
share an objective. These extra-statutory concessions are useful. They
are a part of the furniture. The most important thing about them is
that they work in practice. I entirely accept her point that the great
majority of them will continue to operate as extra-statutory
concessions. Will she undertake to write to members of the Committee in
due course? This might not be until the review is completed, but we
need to understand which of the concessions are not lawful, which ones
in that group will be dealt with immediately by clause 154, and how the
effective underpinning of their status&#151;their operation over the
period between the judgment and the new legislation coming into
force&#151;will be provided. Which of them are not going to be
enshrined in statute, perhaps because although they are nice to operate
as extra-statutory concessions, they would not be appropriate to
operate as statutory provisions? How are we going to deal with the
situation that arises in that case?</div>
<a name="080617113000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think there are any huge political axes to grind. We are discussing the
administration of the tax system, but I have no idea how many
individuals receive each of these extra-statutory concessions. If any
of the concessions are widely used, leaving aside the question of
retrospectivity, the arrangements and plans for the future of a
significant number of taxpayers could be thrown into doubt. If the
Minister would write to members of the Committee before Report, it
would give us an opportunity to come back to this, should we need to do
so.</div><a name="080617113000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000375"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will, of course, undertake to write before
Report, and although I will not be able to give details, I can
certainly clarify whether HMRC can withdraw an unlawful concession. I
understand that HMRC must give notice before any concession can be
withdrawn.</div>

<a name="080617113000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000376"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): It is a pleasure to see you back
in the Chair after our lunchtime break, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="080617113000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should pause and read this important clause carefully. The
Treasury&#146;s explanatory notes tell us that the clause is intended
to help oil companies to ensure the supply of sulphur-free
diesel&#151;an important fuel in helping to improve vehicle
emissions. When that is combined with ultra low sulphur diesel, the
duty rates paid at the moment, which are in line with those for heavy
oil, are unfair. There should thus be amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column765" />Column number: 765</div>so that combining sulphur-free diesel and ultra low sulphur diesel does
not lead to rates of duty than are higher than they should
be.</div><a name="080617113000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful to put the clause in a wider context. The Department
for Transport brought forward statutory instrument 2007/1608, which
said that oil companies had to supply sulphur-free diesel to garages
that sell more than 3 million litres a year, and ultra low sulphur
diesel to garages selling less than 3 million litres a year, with
effect from 4 December 2007. I understand that this was part of a
broader attempt to help to move the industry towards the UK and
European Union deadline of petrol and diesel at all garages being
sulphur-free by 1 January 2009. However, there is an anomaly regarding
ultra low sulphur diesel and sulphur-free diesel because, for various
reasons, oil companies sometimes have to combine the two fuels. Rather
than continuing to pay a duty in line with that for ultra low sulphur
diesel, or for sulphur-free diesel, duty is charged at the rate for
heavy oil&#151;regular diesel&#151;because the mixed fuel does not
meet either definition of the two diesels.</div>
<a name="080617113000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 155
amends the definition of what constitutes ultra low sulphur diesel by
removing density and distillation requirements for the mixture to
qualify as ultra low sulphur diesel, which means that the correct rate
can be charged, rather than the rate for heavy oil. We do not
necessarily oppose this attempt to correct an apparent unfairness in
the duty rates, but I want to clarify a couple of points.</div>
<a name="080617113000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
clause provides that the provision is treated as having come into force
on 4 September 2007. I want to check that, because statutory instrument
2007/1608 introduced a requirement to supply sulphur-free diesel to
garage forecourts with effect from 4 December 2007, as was confirmed in
a written ministerial statement on 26 July. The key date thus seems to
be 4 December 2007.</div>
<a name="080617113000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I challenge
that, because the background note to the clause in the explanatory
notes
states:</div><a name="080617113000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government introduced a measure requiring oil suppliers to supply
sulphur-free diesel...to garage forecourts from 4
September.&#148;</div>
<a name="080617113000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
ministerial statement said that the requirement would come into force
on 4 December. Will the Minister clear up the confusion about which
date should be included in the clause? Should it be 4 December, which
was when the SI came into force, or should it be 4
September, the date in the Bill? It is not clear why there should be a
three-month difference.</div>
<a name="080617113000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
somewhat retrospective move to allow oil companies to get a rebate for
oils that they have mixed in the past. Will the Minister tell us what
calculations the Treasury has made about the revenue impact of clause
155 and the fact that oil companies will now be able to get a rebate
for those blended fuel mixes for which they have paid at the standard
rate rather than the reduced rate? The latest HMRC statistics show that
about 12 million litres of sulphur-free diesel was released for
consumption in 2006-07. What is the Treasury&#146;s assessment of the
amount of diesel that was blended that would qualify for that
retrospective
rebate?</div><a name="080617113000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand why the Government want to clear up what could be called an
unfairness in the way in which the oils duty has worked for oil
companies, but what about those who buy the fuel? With road tax, they
are hit by retrospective tax rises that they cannot undo or avoid, yet
the Government seem happy to tackle 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column766" />Column number: 766</div>retrospectivity for oil companies. We do not disagree with the measure,
but I take this opportunity to urge the Minister to consider the
unfairness of retrospectivity in other areas of motoring, such as
vehicle excise duty.</div>
<a name="080617113000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
one more brief point. On broader issues, such as on vehicle excise
duty, I am still waiting for answers to parliamentary questions that
were due to be answered by 8 May. That was well over a month ago. I
would appreciate it if the Minister would finally provide me with
answers to those important questions, alongside her response to the
issues that I have raised about the
clause.</div><a name="080617113000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

the more abstruse ones, deals with an issue that we often get

whether the difference in the price of diesel&#151;there is no
difference for unleaded petrol&#151;between Britain and the continent
reflects the standards of sulphur reduction in Britain, or whether
other factors are involved, and whether that has influenced the setting

this wrong, but if the forecourt sells the diesel at a higher price
because it expects to pay duty at a higher level and is therefore
passing that on to the customers, that duty should go to the Treasury
and the company should not get a rebate. I am not entirely sure that
that has happened, but if it has it seems wrong that the Treasury is
giving effectively a profit to the oil
company.</div><a name="080617113000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000379"></a><b class="B">Sir

the Exchequer Secretary responds, she owes us another sentence or so of
explanation. The explanatory note on the clause uses the passive, which
is always used when someone is trying to obscure an issue. It
says:</div><a name="080617113000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government introduced a measure requiring oil suppliers to supply
sulphur-free diesel (SFD) to garage forecourts from 4

and ULSD need to be mixed to guarantee the
supply.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was recognised by whom, and when? We would like to know the chronology,
because a mistake has been made. There has been a failure to realise
the full implications of mixing the two kinds of diesel. I do not fully
understand that note, and I hope that the Exchequer Secretary will be
able to make it
clear.</div><a name="080617113000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000382"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I hope that I can clear up the confusion, which has
grown as the debate has progressed. This is a modest technical issue,
which should not worry people too much. I will explain how it came
about.</div><a name="080617113000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
155 amends the definition of ultra low sulphur diesel with
retrospective effect from 4 September 2007. The hon. Member for Putney
is right about the wider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column767" />Column number: 767</div>issue of the Department for Transport issuing regulations for the
provision of sulphur-free diesel. That is a good thing&#151;let us
get that on the record. Moving from ultra low sulphur to sulphur-free
diesel is of benefit to air quality and lowers emissions. We all ought
to recognise that that is progress. The Department for Transport made
that mandatory from 4 December, and set the duty rate at the same level
as for ultra low sulphur diesel, namely 50.35p per litre.</div>
<a name="080617113000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Lady hinted, there is a higher duty rate for heavy oil of 56.94p per
litre. Due to the distribution mechanisms, which get the different
forms of oil and petrol mixed and then out to distribution centres and
thenceforth on to the forecourts, there was an issue with the
changeover period and with the run-in to sulphur-free diesel supply
becoming mandatory. The problem that it caused was that under existing
legislation, although sulphur-free diesel and ultra low sulphur diesel
have the same duty rate, mixtures of the two did not meet either of the
definitions in place from earlier times, and the law said that an oil
that did not meet those definitions would automatically qualify for the
higher
rate.</div><a name="080617113000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
of the industry suggested that there were practical problems in the
transition from the old duty rate to the new mandatory regime with
sulphur-free diesel and that, as a result of how the pipes and
distribution systems work, if they happened to mix ultra low sulphur
diesel and sulphur-free diesel in order to get supplies to the pumps in
an appropriate way, the resulting oil, which would sometimes contain a
tiny residue of other oils, would not meet either definition. We
therefore created a circumstance for that period. Retrospectivity
applies so that they could gear up to supplying sulphur-free diesel.
Retrospectively, we will not charge them the higher rate if there
happen to be traces of oils from the mixing necessary for their
distribution. It is all perfectly simple, as hon. Friends and
Opposition Members can
see.</div><a name="080617113000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
the industry was moving toward supplying sulphur-free diesel in a
timely fashion for the mandation on 4 December, and in order for
members of the industry to get their distribution mechanisms right, we
gave the industry assurance that we would not charge a higher rate of
duty for three months before, as any inadvertent mixing might put
industry members outwith the definitions then in law. It is a
transitional measure to facilitate getting supplies of sulphur-free
diesel where they needed to be in a timely fashion for the mandation to
come into effect appropriately on 4 December. I see that the hon.
Member for Putney is itching to get to her feet, so I will gladly give
way.</div><a name="080617113000079"></a>

our part arose. It is different from the ministerial statement, and I
think that it is wrong. Can she confirm
that?</div><a name="080617113000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000384"></a>Angela

<div class="Column"><a name="Column768" />Column number: 768</div><a name="080617113000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
about the revenue impact. It is nil. Ultra low sulphur diesel and
sulphur-free diesel are charged at the same rate; it is only when they
were mixed that the rate would have been higher. Mixing would not have
happened if we had not given comfort that in the event of a technical
breach we would not charge the higher rate, but then it would not have
been guaranteed that supplies would be where they were meant to be in
time for the mandation of sulphur-free diesel. It is purely a technical
clause to shift from one system of defining fuel and fuel mixes to a
more regulatory system under which sulphur-free diesel is mandated. It
deals with the transition between the old regime and the new. I hope
that hon. Members will be happy with those
reassurances.</div><a name="080617113000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe is right to mention that fuel duty
on petrol and diesel are the same. Differences in price, as I
understand it, are due to bottlenecks in supply and slightly different
ways of creating petrol and diesel, but I confirm that there is no tax
differential between what the Government collect on petrol and what we
collect on diesel. The price differences have to do purely with
distillation, bottlenecks in supply, shortages of supply in the
industry and so on, and have absolutely nothing to do with tax
rates.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000385"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I read the clause and thought that I understood
it. I then read it again and thought that I did not, so I looked at the
explanatory note, which told me absolutely nothing. To be fair, that is
what most explanatory notes do. They simply repeat what a person who
can read will have discovered from reading the Bill. The clause will
remove section 137(4) from the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979,
a provision that
says:</div><a name="080617113000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purpose of calculating any amount due from or to any person under
the customs and excise Acts by way of duty, drawback, allowance,
repayment or rebate any fraction of a penny in that amount shall be
disregarded.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory note says that that is redundant because the halfpenny
has</div>
<a name="080617113000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ceased to be
legal tender&#148;.</div>
<a name="080617113000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that
that would reinforce the requirement for fractions of a penny to be
disregarded. As I recall, the halfpenny ceased to be legal tender about
20 years ago so it seems rather odd that we are now taking the trouble
to remove a subsection from the 1979
Act.</div><a name="080617113000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
got to thinking about the clause and realised that there is perhaps
more to it than meets the eye. Rounding down to get rid of fractions of
a penny in a total amount is perfectly sensible and we all understand
the reasons for it. However, for amounts per litre, kilo or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column769" />Column number: 769</div>gram of a dutiable payment, which will be multiplied by many thousands
or millions, the case for removing, eliminating or ignoring fractions
of a penny becomes rather less
obvious.</div><a name="080617113000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that we are not introducing a disregard of the
fraction, but removing the provision for the disregard of the fraction.
When there is a fraction of a penny per unit and the person paying may
pay for many thousands or millions of units at a time, there is a
potential revenue implication from this measure. If the Exchequer
Secretary can explain precisely what this is all about and why it is
happening now, perhaps my concerns will be shown to have been
unnecessary, but perhaps
not.</div><a name="080617113000093"></a>

Eagle:</b> I note that you cannot remember, Sir
Nicholas. Perhaps it would have been tidier to pass this measure in
1984. We decided to do it now because we got wind recently that
businesses have been looking to manipulate their duty calculation
methods to reduce their duty liability. Removing the subsection may
increase revenue slightly, although we do not think that it will be by
very much. It ensures equity and consistency. When the measure becomes
law and removes fractions, HMRC will need a common calculation method
to ensure equity and consistency between all those who
pay.</div><a name="080617113000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000390"></a>Mr.

clarify, when she said that when the measure becomes law it will remove
fractions of a penny, I think she meant that it will remove the
disregard of fractions of a penny. It is the other way
around.</div><a name="080617113000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000391"></a>Angela

when one tries to extemporise rather than read boring speeches that
have been written&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Harsh.&#148;] Clearly the issue is the need for equity and
consistency and for there to be no particular advantage, even if it is
of a fraction of a penny, in people arranging their affairs to lessen
their liabilities, albeit slightly. It is simply a tidying-up measure.
We do not expect much revenue. I suspect that it should have been done
20 years ago.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000394"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> She is nodding her head, and the measure makes a
lot more sense. I cannot understand why one would want to disregard a
fraction of a penny when it may be multiplied by many thousands or
millions.</div>
<a name="080617113000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Exchequer Secretary agree that the explanatory note, once again, is
highly misleading? If what she said is the case, the measure has
absolutely nothing to do with the halfpenny ceasing to be legal tender,
as the note says. It is perfectly possible&#151;it is done in
financial transactions every day&#151;to calculate to many decimal
places of a penny. It is worth doing so if one is multiplying by a big
enough number. The explanatory note, which suggests that the abolition
of the halfpenny is behind the measure, is simply not right, if I
understand her explanation. Although there would be a necessity to
disregard the halfpenny from a global duty bill of, say, Diageo plc, of
&#163;28,243,392.285, there is no reason to disregard the fraction of
a penny per unit in calculations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000397"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I remember fondly from my childhood saving
stamps, which is what this measure is about. I do not know whether you
shared that experience, Sir Nicholas. When I was preparing for this
debate last night, it occurred to me that I was destined to be a shadow
Chief Secretary because I can remember eagerly going to the post office
to buy national savings stamps for which I had saved up. If I remember
correctly, we used to get them in various denominations with pictures
of Prince Charles on the ninepenny and Princess Anne on the one and
sixpenny coin. I might be
wrong.</div><a name="080617113000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman

<a name="080617113000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000399"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I feel
it.</div>
<a name="080617113000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">My nostalgia
is because the provision deals with the legacy of the era of savings
stamps. I used to collect my saving stamps. When they had amounted to a
worthwhile sum, which in those days was about &#163;1, I would go
into the post office and pay it into another defunct institution, the
Post Office Savings bank,
RIP.</div><a name="080617113000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apparently,
as national savings stamps and national savings gift certificates have
been withdrawn, a relatively small sum of money&#151;a few million
pounds&#151;remains stranded. I take it&#151;I would be grateful
for ministerial confirmation&#151;that that sum represents money that
was paid over and is represented by stamps that have effectively been
lost or destroyed and will never be redeemed. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column771" />Column number: 771</div>The provisions give the Treasury a new power to make
regulations which would require the Commissioners for the Reduction of
the National Debt to transfer these monies&#151;I think, in total,
about &#163;7 million&#151;to the national loans fund. The
explanatory note says, rather curiously:</div>
<a name="080617113000114"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
tradition of using such funds to help defray the National Debt is no
longer appropriate in today&#146;s financial services
environment.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting that Parliament as a whole is dealing with the issue of
dormant accounts and unclaimed assets in the dormant accounts
legislation, which we still await in this House&#151;the Minister
might be able to give us some news on that. I was moved to wonder, and
I was able to wonder aloud, because I found myself seated next to the
chief executive of National Savings and Investments at a dinner last
week&#151;very convenient&#151;why the unclaimed assets, or dormant
accounts, as they effectively are, in National Savings and Investments
are treated differently from the dormant accounts in the rest of the
banking and building societies sector. As we know, the
Government&#146;s decision is that the assets that are stranded
because accounts have gone dormant, people have lost their records or
they have died without anybody becoming aware of it, and the money that
is in those accounts will be dealt with through a statutory procedure
that the Government are laying down, initially on a voluntary basis,
and will be used for certain specified
causes.</div><a name="080617113000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am curious to know why the Government feel that money that to my mind
is entirely analogous money&#151;money that has been handed over by a
saver and then, for whatever reason, not redeemed&#151;should not be
treated in the same way and be subject to the same regime that the
Government have put in place for other unclaimed residual assets. Can
the Minister answer that and perhaps throw some light on the progress
of the Bill that is currently awaiting its Commons stages, and whether
we are going to get the Bill before the summer recess? I am sure that
members of the Committee, who might have the privilege of serving on
the Public Bill Committee for that Bill&#151;I know my hon. Friend
the Member for Fareham is extremely interested in the
issue&#151;would find that of
interest.</div><a name="080617113000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000400"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have to say, before the Minister replies, that
it may be of interest, but not to this debate. The hon. Gentleman
speaking for Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition is anticipating the Second
Reading debate on another piece of legislation. I hope that the
Minister will take my guidance in dealing with the
matter.</div><a name="080617113000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000401"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> It
being the first time that I have risen this afternoon, may I say what a
pleasure it is to do so under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. May I be
so bold as to speak on behalf of the entire Committee in saying that
perhaps we should pass our thanks to the maintenance department for
fixing the light bulb, which seems to be somewhat quieter than it was
last Thursday, although I notice that one of them has expired, but at
least it has done so silently.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column772" />Column number: 772</div><a name="080617113000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman who speaks for the Opposition rightly described the general
purpose of the clause. It is not so much a policy issue as an
accounting issue, as I shall explain. There is a residual amount of
money of around &#163;7 million from national savings stamps that
have not been redeemed and also gift tokens. The former were first
issued in 1917 and withdrawn in 1976 and gift tokens were introduced in
1947 and withdrawn in 1989. Those were managed by the Commissioners for
the Reduction of the National Debt. The proposal is simply to give us a
power to make regulation to provide for the transfer of funds held by
the commissioners in those two examples to the national loans fund.
There is no economic impact, but it is a sensible policy for a number
of
reasons.</div><a name="080617113000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
the National Audit Office has rightly expressed concerns on the
security and access controls of such out-of-date systems. We wish to
develop a new National Savings and Investments residual account as the
single secure repository for all funds remaining in such closed
products where National Savings and Investments has not been able to
make payment to its customers. We also want through that new product to
make sure that we provide equality of interest rate treatment on all
closed product holdings in line with the Financial Services Authority
guidelines for treating customers fairly, which were not in operation
when the initial products were
developed.</div><a name="080617113000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000402"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I saw that point in the explanatory notes but, as
I recall, national savings stamps did not bear any interest. They were
non-interest bearing instruments, so what does equality of treatment in
terms of interest mean? As I understand it, neither of those two
products was
interest-bearing.</div><a name="080617113000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000403"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> My understanding is that that is correct but,
since those products were issued, National Savings and Investments has
voluntarily adopted the banking code and advertising standards code and
moved from having its own adjudicator to using the Financial Ombudsman
Service to deal with customer complaints. It is working to comply on a
voluntary basis with relevant FSA regulations. It would be more
appropriate to review all those products.</div>
<a name="080617113000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points in general terms. We feel
that it would be better to set up a residual account to look at all
these issues in the light of National Savings and Investments&#146;
correct commitment to look at them alongside the new guidelines
developed in that area.</div>
<a name="080617113000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made points which I am now advised are outside the scope of
this
discussion.</div><a name="080617113000125"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000404"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I take your guidance, Sir Nicholas, that it would
be improper for the Minister to refer to another Bill but what I asked
her was why the Government do not consider it appropriate to treat
these residual stranded assets in National Savings and Investments in
the same way that they are proposing to treat similar assets in banks
and building societies?</div>
<a name="080617113000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry
to press the point but it is not good enough to have Ministers saying
the reason we are doing this is because of equality of treatment with
regard to interest and then when it is pointed out that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column773" />Column number: 773</div>the products in question do not bear interest not to have an explanation
as to why they are proceeding in this way. Surely the code to which the
Minister referred, admirable as I am sure it is, cannot have any
relevance to a product that has no interest payable on
it.</div>
<a name="080617113000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000405"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If I can help the Committee and perhaps give the
Minister a little time to sort out an answer for the hon. Gentleman,
this clause is not about stranded assets. That is my advice and I
believe it is correct. Perhaps the Minister will seek to respond to the
hon. Gentleman as far as the question relates to this
clause.</div><a name="080617113000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000406"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> Thank you, as ever, for your clarification, Sir
Nicholas. It does of course relate to assets held by National Savings
and Investments as a result of the savings schemes which have not been
claimed. We are not discussing what they should be spent on, which will
come under future legislation. It is simply an accounting change. It
moves them from one bit of the Government estate, to use that phrase
broadly, to the national loans fund. It updates, modernises and
consolidates such pots within the national loans fund, as opposed to
their being administered by the Commissioners for the Reduction of
National Debt, which tends to involve portfolio management services. I
hope that that provides clarification. I seem to have caused some
discussion among my advisers regarding the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about the interest rate, so perhaps he will permit me to write to
the Committee at a later
date.</div><a name="080617113000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000407"></a>Mr.

compliment of saying that none of them looks old enough to remember
national saving stamps, so they might not know off hand whether they
bore interest or
not.</div><a name="080617113000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has not addressed the question of what ultimately happens to
the money. I accept that this is an accounting transfer and I had hoped
that she would have felt able to explain what the ultimate treatment
would be. I am advised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham, who
has been closely involved with the other Bill, which we shall not
mention, that national savings are not included within it. If I may say
so, I think the Minister is being a tad disingenuous in suggesting that
this has nothing to do with that issue, because it is still unclear to
us why national savings are treated differently. If it is more
appropriate, I am happy for my hon. Friend to pursue that question when
that other Bill, in due course, comes before the

<a name="080617113000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000408"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> It is perhaps unusual to have something so
controversial so near the chronological end of a Bill of such a size,
although, of course, we still have to deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column774" />Column number: 774</div>with clauses that have been taken out of chronological order. Unless the
Minister gives us some concrete assurances on this issue, we could have
the last vote that we need to press in the chronological sequence of
the Bill&#146;s
text.</div><a name="080617113000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause enables the Treasury to create, by regulation, criminal offences
in relation to the allocation for payment of EU emissions trading
scheme allowances. The background to the measure is that, in August
2006, the UK submitted to the European Commission its national
allocation plan for phase 2 of the EU emissions trading scheme, which
runs from 2008 to 2012. That plan sets out the basis by which
allowances are allocated by the Government to firms participating in
the scheme. The national allocation plan committed the Government to
allocating 93 per cent. of the total available without charge, and to
auctioning 7 per cent. The scheme is expected to continue after 2012
with a third phase, and I understand that the Government would like a
higher level of auctioning in future allocation rounds.</div>
<a name="080617113000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government apparently envisage the need for provisions to create
criminal offences relating to wrongful disclosure of confidential
information in allocations for payment&#151;that is, I assume, the
disclosure of bid information at auctions. One is bound to ask,
&#147;Why now?&#148; We are amending a provision that was passed
only in the Finance Act 2007. What has changed in the meantime to lead
the Government to think that criminal offences are required when they
were not introduced in the 2007 Act or the draft regulations published
under it? On the surface, this might seem like a tidying-up exercise,
and the tucking away of the clause at the end of the Bill tends to
reinforce that view. However, we know that we always have to read the
small print, and we are 100 per cent. with the Government about trying
to ensure that the emissions trading process operates well and that the
allocation mechanism is
effective.</div><a name="080617113000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving
aside the incompetence issue&#151;why the Government are doing this
now when the principal legislation was passed only last year&#151;the
clause actually gives rise to serious concerns of principle. How can it
be acceptable for the Treasury to be given powers to create, by
statutory instrument, a new category of criminal
offence?</div><a name="080617113000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes talk in terms of a quite narrow category of
offence:</div><a name="080617113000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wrongful
disclosure of...information in allocations for
payment.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
that is not reflected in the open-ended power in the clause that we are
being asked to consider. The Financial Secretary circulated a note to
members of the Committee in which she said that the Government
&#147;currently intends&#148; to use this power for an offence of
wrongful disclosure. However, she very pointedly did not rule out using
the power to create other offences. Nothing in the Bill limits the use
of the power to the creation of an offence of wrongful
disclosure.</div>
<a name="080617113000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
limitation on the power to create new offences by statutory instrument
relates to the maximum penalty that could be imposed in respect of such
offences, which is the maximum penalty set out in the European
Communities Act 1972. Incidentally, it would be interesting if the
Minister could tell the Committee what those maximum penalties are. Are
they turnover-related
penalties?</div><a name="080617113000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
does the wording of the clause not reflect the narrow category of
offence that the Government are apparently envisaging? I do not want to
sound too 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column775" />Column number: 775</div>pompous or parliamentarian about this, but it really is not good enough
for the Government to come along with enabling clauses in a Finance
Bill that allow the creation of new criminal offences by statutory
instrument.</div>
<a name="080617113000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much as we
have all appreciated the Financial Secretary&#146;s guidance in the
now significant number of letters and notes to members of the Committee
during our consideration of the Bill, that does not limit in any way
the Government&#146;s ability to use the provision to create new
offences at a later stage. We have, in fact, a catch-all clause, and
there is no excuse for Parliament to sanction granting the Government
such wide new powers to create new classes of criminal
offence.</div><a name="080617113000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not been able to identify any safeguards, and we do need
assurances about the provision&#146;s scope. If the Minister reads
into the record at this stage of the Bill&#146;s progress that these
powers will be used only in respect of offences related to unauthorised
disclosure, we might be satisfied. However, we must have a clear
commitment that these powers will be used in only that way. Perhaps the
Government will be able to tell us that they are confident that they do
not need to use these powers any more widely, in which case I will ask
them to consider whether they could bring forward an amendment on
Report to limit the scope of the powers to only the disclosure of
information. If they do not do that, we will certainly want to do
so.</div><a name="080617113000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I ask a question about the draft regulations, I draw my hon.
Friends&#146; attention to the fact that the clause covers offences
committed by not only companies&#151;those in the marketplace will
mainly be corporate players&#151;but officers of companies or members
of partnerships, including limited liability partnerships. Therefore,
individuals could find themselves on the receiving end of this
provision.</div>
<a name="080617113000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to
admit to being slightly perplexed by the draft regulations that have
been circulated. The Financial Secretary was kind enough to circulate
draft emissions trading scheme regulations for 2008, which I take it
have not been laid&#151;I cannot find any record of them having been
laid. We also have in front of us draft regulations amending those
draft regulations. Why have the Government not simply withdrawn, or not
laid, the initial draft regulations and incorporated into them the
provisions of the second draft regulations? Instead, they have tabled
the second draft regulations, which say:</div>
<a name="080617113000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
Regulations may be cited as the Community Emissions Trading Scheme
(Allocation of Allowances for Payment)
Regulations&#148;</div><a name="080617113000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
they go on to amend the first draft
regulations.</div><a name="080617113000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know of a precedent for presenting a statutory instrument, even
in draft form, that amends an existing draft. Surely it would be more
sensible&#151;I will be very happy if the Minister is able to say
that she will do this&#151;to take both drafts away so that before
the principal regulations are laid before the House, the provisions of
the amending draft regulations are incorporated so that we have to deal
with a single measure. Otherwise, as I understand it, the first
substantive draft will be laid before the House and go through all the
processes to become regulations, and immediately thereafter the
Government will have to lay the second draft regulations to amend the
first regulations. If it would help the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column776" />Column number: 776</div>Minister, I can probably find something else to say for a few
moments&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am trying to help

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000409"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Since I have served on the Joint Committee on
Statutory Instruments, I have never seen such a procedure. Such a
measure would normally be withdrawn, so I think that we do need
clarification on that
point.</div><a name="080617113000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000410"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> My hon. Friend reinforces my point. I have been a
Member for only 11 years but I have never seen such a procedure. I was
completely startled by it, so I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
clarification.</div><a name="080617113000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000411"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge implied
that this was somehow a hidden clause. It is in the miscellaneous part
of the Bill simply because there is not a large amount of the Finance
Bill taken up with emissions trading at the moment, so it fitted in the
miscellaneous section. Miscellaneous does not always mean not
important. I suspect that the clause is towards the end of the Bill
partly because of the novelty of the area that we are in. Finance Bills
have been going on for years and have taken on particular forms, but
emissions trading has not been going on for years. It is a new and
developing area of Government policy both domestically and at EU
level&#151;and, soon, internationally. Given that emissions trading
and the issues surrounding it, particularly when it comes to raising
revenue, are relatively novel arrivals on the scene, I suspect that
hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will have to get used to
the evolution of this particular area of activity, because it is set to
grow in importance in the future. Part of the issue with which we are
dealing is the novelty of the circumstances that we are in. We are
trying to design regulations and legislation for a trading system that
is in the middle of developing and of being negotiated, so there has to
be a certain amount of flexibility as the process develops.</div>
<a name="080617113000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">This clause
will amend the legislative framework for EU ETS auctions with regard to
the creation of criminal offences for the wrongful disclosure of
confidential information relating to bids. The Government will create
the offence through secondary legislation. As the hon. Gentleman
rightly said, draft regulations were sent to Committee members to
assist today&#146;s
debate.</div><a name="080617113000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="080617113000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EU ETS was established with a strong lead from the UK, and it is the
world&#146;s most significant international emissions trading scheme.
It is an important step towards establishing a price for carbon, with a
view to ensuring that negative externalities are reflected in
investment and consumption decisions. As the hon. Gentleman pointed
out, the UK&#146;s national allocation plan for phase 2 of the EU ETS
set out the Government&#146;s intention to auction 7 per cent. of UK
emissions allowances. As set out in the UK Government&#146;s vision
for emissions trading, published on 30 October 2006, greater use of
auctioning will help to strengthen the long-term integrity and
efficiency of the EU ETS. It is essential to ensure that the auctions
of EU emissions trading scheme allowances are robust and support the
integrity of the scheme and the carbon market. It is essential to avoid
windfall profits for power generators, which tend to make windfall
profits if they do not have to pay for emissions. That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column777" />Column number: 777</div>partly because we are trying to put in place a scheme in circumstances
in which power generation has been going on before carbon trading or
carbon prices were important. Those circumstances may not be ideal, but
that is another novel part of what we have to
do.</div><a name="080617113000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right that it is unusual to introduce criminal
offences in this way, but it is not unprecedented. There are precedents
for introducing criminal offences in the Finance Bill and in secondary
legislation. The Finance Bill precedent is schedule 22 to the Finance
Act 2000, which introduced such criminal offences with respect to the
tonnage
tax.</div><a name="080617113000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000412"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am not sure whether the hon. Lady is saying
that the Finance Act 2000 introduced criminal offences or the power to
make criminal offences by statutory instrument. Will she clarify the
position?</div><a name="080617113000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000413"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b><b class="B"> </b>The 2000 Act introduced the power to make
criminal offences in secondary legislation, and that is the precedent
for which the hon. Gentleman asked. That is not a usual thing to do,
but it is not unprecedented in Finance Bills. There are precedents for
introducing criminal offences by secondary legislation, which the hon.
Gentleman should take into account, including section 47 of the
Transport Act 2000 and section 468 of the Companies Act 2006. There are
also precedents for introducing criminal offences for inappropriate
disclosure of information, which is what we are dealing with, such as
section 206 of the Water Industry Act 1991 and section 393 of the
Communications Act 2003. A more recent precedent that more of us will
remember is section 39 of the Statistics and Registration Service Act
2007. There are therefore precedents for the measure, which is unusual,
but it is not unheard
of.</div><a name="080617113000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000414"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful to the Exchequer Secretary for those
examples. Do any of them apply to EU-wide provisions? What discussions
have we had with our European colleagues to ensure that the penalties
for disclosure are the same across the
EU?</div><a name="080617113000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000415"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> My understanding is that that is why the penalties
for disclosure quote the EU legislation, which the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out in his comments on the clause. As
for the size of the penalties, I understand that the maximum allowed at
the moment is a &#163;5,000 fine, so we are not talking about huge
amounts of
money.</div><a name="080617113000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want, however, to make the case for introducing criminal offences for
the inappropriate disclosure of information. The auctioning of
emissions and the robust nature of the carbon price will rely on
confidentiality in respect of information in bids, especially if agents
are used. The auctions are designed to allow the use of agents and
intermediaries, and it is important, if the carbon price is not to be
compromised or destabilised by the inappropriate disclosure of
information, to introduce criminal offences, which act as effective
deterrents to destabilising
behaviour.</div><a name="080617113000159"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000416"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I do not disagree, but the Minister could have
reassured the Committee hugely and avoided this debate if the clause
had referred narrowly to the creation by statutory instrument of
criminal offences related to the disclosure of confidential
information. The purpose would then have been clear and narrowly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column778" />Column number: 778</div>defined. Whatever she tells us today, I have not yet heard a clear
statement from the Government Dispatch Box that the legislation will
not be used to create offences other than those relating to disclosure
of confidential
information.</div><a name="080617113000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000417"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is important to say that the auctioning
of emissions allowances is novel, and that the framework needs to be
flexible to allow the Government to learn from experience. I am not in
a position to say that the measure will not be extended into other
areas, but the issue about which we are most concerned is the
inappropriate disclosure of information. Given that the situation is
evolving, it is important not to cut off attempts to put flexibility
into the Bill so that we can evolve structures as our understanding of
how the markets work and what would destabilise them evolves.</div>
<a name="080617113000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will clearly not do outrageous or unreasonable things, and
the law requires that measures must be reasonable. The hon. Gentleman
should take some comfort from that. At this stage in a fast-moving
situation, I am reluctant to close down the Government&#146;s options
so that we have to keep coming back to primary legislation. Things move
quickly, and measures will be subject, too, to multilateral
negotiations at the EU and international levels.</div>
<a name="080617113000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody has
auctioned carbon or carbon permits before in that manner, and we are
developing our approach and policy as we go along. We think that it is
important that the carbon market should be robust and liquid, and that
it should not be subject to the risk of being laid low by the behaviour
of people wishing to profit from the inappropriate disclosure of
confidential information. That might well have other detrimental
effects from a wider public policy
view.</div><a name="080617113000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that we are in a rather odd situation with the statutory
instruments&#151;the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was
right to point that out. The main regulations for auctioning permits
were laid on 3 June. They set a flexible framework to accommodate a
number of different auction designs, because we had not made final
policy commitments to a design. However, we have set a deadline for the
first UK Government auction by the end of the year, so we want to
signal how we will proceed to those who are ready and willing to
involve themselves in the first auction of permits some time this year.
At the moment, the main regulations for auctioning, which were laid on
3 June, deliberately set a flexible framework to accommodate a number
of different auction designs.</div>
<a name="080617113000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000418"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. I have to say that my search&#151;I should say my
researcher&#146;s search&#151;this morning did not turn up the fact
that they had been laid, and the copy that has been circulated is a
draft copy without a statutory instrument number. Has it occurred to
the Minister that people&#146;s willingness to participate in the
process might be affected by the knowledge that another statutory
instrument will be introduced that will create criminal offences that
could apply to them
personally?</div><a name="080617113000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000419"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I expect that they might be put off engaging in the
auction if they intended to leak inappropriate and commercially
confidential information. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 779</div>However, most of the people whom I have met to discuss the design of
auctions and approaches to them do not intend to do that. I believe
that those who want to become involved in the auctions, at least the
vast majority of them, do not intend to do so by cheating. I have not
heard it said that it would put them off. Emissions trading is novel.
The Government must be able to respond to the experiences of those
people and of the market. Any new offences created by the
regulation&#151;there may not be any&#151;would be considered by
Parliament. We would not just be writing them in Her Majesty&#146;s
Treasury.</div>
<a name="080617113000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000420"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister says that there may not be any new
offences, but a draft has been circulated. Unless the Government manage
to lose their majority in the statutory instrument Committee that
considers the matter, she surely is not signalling that it is not their
intention to proceed along the lines of that
draft.</div><a name="080617113000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000421"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> No&#151;the hon. Gentleman may not be a lawyer,
but he is taking me very literally.</div>
<a name="080617113000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman spoke earlier about further extensions, and I tried to
reassure him. The clause seeks, through secondary legislation, to make
it a criminal offence inappropriately to disclose information that
might destabilise the carbon market or compromise an auction unfairly,
which may also lead to profit being acquired in a way that no one in
Committee would approve. That is the behaviour that we are trying to
prevent. The Government clearly intend to use regulations to make it a
criminal offence to compromise an auction by the inappropriate release
of confidential information. I hope that that is clear.</div>
<a name="080617113000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is worried about widening the range of criminal offences. We
may not wish to widen them, but given the novel nature of the process,
and the fact that it is a new market in an area of which we have little
experience, we have finally to decide on the form that the auction
should take. By definition, it is in the public interest for us to be
as flexible as possible and not to close our options too early, and we
have a legislative system that does not easily allow us to do so.
Parliament would have to consider any further extensions. I suspect
that it will not have to do so, but I hope that I have reassured the
hon. Gentleman about our intentions.</div>
<a name="080617113000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000422"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clearing up the
issue over the two draft regulations. I shall go back and check why it
was not possible this morning to establish that the first set of
regulations had been laid.</div>
<a name="080617113000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
argues for flexibility. I am sure that Henry VIII would have argued for
flexibility, and the Government, particularly on Treasury matters, have
quite a lot of legislative flexibility. The Finance Bill has high
priority, and it takes precedence in the legislative timetable. The
longest that a Government could ever wait to cast legislation on the
subject is one year. No other Department can be as confident. I am
afraid that I take a rather old-fashioned view, despite the fact that I
accept at face value the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s clear assertion
she is concerned about disclosure. The clause 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column780" />Column number: 780</div>allows the creation of offences in any area. I remain firmly of the view
that the creation of criminal offences is the stuff of primary
legislation. Notwithstanding the relatively limited number of examples
that she gave, all but one of which were enacted by this Government, we
should not cede to the Government the power to create new criminal
offences by statutory instrument, certainly not when they are
ill-defined. If it was simply a question of offences on disclosure, and
if the Government had given us a clear indication of what they were
doing, the situation might be different. However, the Exchequer
Secretary has been unable to give us the reassurance that we seek, so I
will press to a Division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000451"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Good afternoon, Sir
Nicholas&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Indeed, the room
is emptying. I thought that the Conservative spokesman was going to
resign his seat as a matter of principle on the last clause, but we had
to content ourselves with a mere Division.</div>
<a name="080617113000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 is to exempt students from the
Government&#146;s new definition of residents. It may assist the
Committee if I explain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 781</div>how the amendments seek to achieve that. The Russell group, which
consists of about 25 of the leading universities in the United Kingdom,
has provided me with background information, which the Committee may
find useful. It explains the scale of overseas students&#146;
contribution to higher education in this country. In 2006-07, there
were 239,210 non-EU students studying in the United
Kingdom&#151;almost 250,000&#151;and 112,260 EU students.
International students&#146; fees amount to &#163;1.5 billion a
year, which is a sizeable amount of money. About 15 per
cent. of students at Russell group universities are from overseas, but
some universities have a much higher proportion. The London School of
Economics derives one third of its total income from overseas
students&#146;
fees.</div><a name="080617113000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2005-06, the most recent year for which numbers are available, there
were 31,477 overseas academics teaching at UK universities. Higher
education in this country is extremely diverse. We operate in an
international marketplace and many of our universities have partnership
arrangements with universities in countries such as China and Malaysia.
We cannot divorce the issue of students from that wider international
set of considerations.</div>
<a name="080617113000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000452"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Pound</b> (Ealing, North) (Lab): It will come as a
considerable surprise, not just to the Committee but to anybody who
knows me, to learn that I am a graduate of the London School of
Economics. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but the amendment
does not refer to an individual who is enrolled in a Russell group
higher education institution; it refers to &#147;a higher education
institution&#148;. We must bear in mind the vast number of highly
suspect bucket shops, which exist the length and breadth of this land,
that call themselves higher education institutions, frequently to allow
people to avoid immigration regulations. Would the hon. Gentleman
consider tightening the wording to the elitist definition that he and
the Liberal Democrats have used, or would he spread the measure far and
wide?</div><a name="080617113000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000453"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I think that I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
I am very pleased to say that I attended a Russell group university as
an undergraduate. I shall only observe that every hon. Member becomes
rather less snobby in this regard when a new institution is proposed
for their constituency. I would not wish the definition to be drawn too
narrowly. The figures that I gave were relevant to the UK higher
education sector as a whole&#151;they were merely provided to me by a
representative of the Russell group.</div>
<a name="080617113000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 47 is a minor amendment and would insert new subsection (1C ) into
the clause, with intention of expressly excluding foreign students
enrolled in UK higher education institutions from liability for the
183-day test for residency. There is some HMRC guidance on the matter,
but it is not
legislation.</div>
<a name="080617113000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000454"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): I am
sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. How much potential
might there be for people trying to avoid taxation by signing up to
additional courses? Let us take the example of bankers in London who
decide to sign up to an evening course, which might be at an institute
of higher education and might be linked to their jobs and justifiable
to their employers, but who would then, seemingly, be exempt from
taxation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column782" />Column number: 782</div><a name="080617113000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000455"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am genuinely grateful for that contribution. My
honest answer is that there probably is scope for abuse and the
Government would need to consider how they framed the legislation
carefully to try and prevent it. If the Exchequer Secretary were to get
to her feet and suggest that the intentions behind my amendments were
honourable and that she agreed with them but that the Government needed
to produce more watertight versions, I would regard that as
considerable
progress.</div><a name="080617113000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say that because the current proposal is for a seven-year threshold
before the &#163;30,000 levy kicks in for people who are
non-domiciled and working in this country. Longer courses such as
medicine, engineering and other vocational courses may in themselves
last five or six years. For example, people who come here to study
medicine&#151;that is increasingly common&#151;do a five-year
course and are then fully qualified doctors. There are then shortages
in the national health service in the area in which they have
specialised, they apply for a job and make an important contribution to
the well-being of our citizens. However, they already have five of the
seven years on the clock. That is a serious disincentive to continue to
serve people in the national health service for more than a year or
two, before they choose to go home or to another
country.</div><a name="080617113000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about a fluid marketplace and somebody with such skills and
qualifications may be able to find alternative employment in another
country. They have already demonstrated a willingness to travel by
being in the UK in the first place. There is a danger that that
person&#146;s skills will be lost to our country and there will be no
mutual benefit. There is also a perhaps even greater danger, which is
that the potential student sitting in their country of origin and
considering where to do their higher education course, would look at
Britain and consider the incentive to study here as less strong than it
was, because they will fall foul of this test if they choose to work
here after gaining their qualification, and as a result be much poorer.
The purpose of amendments Nos. 47 and 48 is to address that serious
point.</div><a name="080617113000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wirral, South and I were part of an extremely
informative delegation to China about three weeks ago. We visited a
joint university venture with the university of Liverpool, and had a
meeting with a representative of the university of Nottingham which has
three campuses, one in Nottingham, one in Malaysia and one in China.
That is indicative of the desire of higher education institutions in
the United Kingdom to operate on a global stage, and to attract the
best-qualified students and potential students from across the board,
particularly in the disciplines that I mentioned such as science and
engineering. We do not want to put that international leadership and
the reputation that British universities enjoy at
risk.</div><a name="080617113000217"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000457"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I have already conceded that I did not anticipate
that the Committee would support my amendment. I do not think that the
Government have supported a single non-Government amendment yet.
Actually, I think that there was one. However, I was keen to make the
points and it would be to the good if the Government chose to accept
the amendment. If the Government concede the thrust of the argument, I
would regard it as significant
progress.</div><a name="080617113000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000458"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting case. It
seems that there is a good chance that that sort of overseas student,
especially if they go back to their country of origin or any other
country, could earn more than &#163;2,000 during that year. They
would therefore be caught under these regulations, in my
understanding.</div><a name="080617113000317"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000459"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Mine, too. We will get on to a greater
deliberation of these matters, I anticipate, under schedule 7.
However, this is important, because we are talking about &#163;1.5
billion of income to British universities per year. There are large
numbers of British universities now that would not function in their
current, recognisable form without that. Indeed, it is an
under-appreciated fact among domestic students that a lot of the
activities of British universities are effectively subsidised by the
fees of overseas students. We do not wish to put that revenue at risk,
and that is the fear I am touching upon.</div>
<a name="080617113000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I conclude, it is relevant to, but not directly encapsulated in the
amendment, that I received a representation from the City of London. I
will just quote two sentences from its letter to
me:</div><a name="080617113000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
it is not dealt with in your amendment, it is apparent from the Bill as
currently drafted that a non-domiciled child who turns 18 by the end of
the tax year, 5th April, and has then been resident for at least 7 of
the past 9 years, will be required to pay the charge in full on the
same basis as any other adult non-domicile. Thus a sixth-former who
turns 18 before 5 April of his or her final year at school could
attract the
charge.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be very interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s response to
that point.</div>
<a name="080617113000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
the specific point that there is a big market in higher education for
attracting overseas students to this country, and of course they make a
big contribution by enriching our institutions in ways beyond the
merely financial. However, there is also, particularly with relation to
independent schools, an important market in attracting students from
elsewhere&#151;or more specifically their parents&#151;because of
the high reputation that British independent schools enjoy in many
parts of the globe. That too is an important feature of their income,
so we would not wish to jeopardise that
either.</div><a name="080617113000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000460"></a><b class="B">Ben
Chapman</b> (Wirral, South) (Lab): Has the hon. Gentleman been
able to put any figures to the suggestion that students may not come or
may not stay in the United Kingdom? These students are often paying
their own way, and are not on scholarships. They often have wealthy
parents and make not just a contribution to the university, but a
considerable contribution to the UK economy, both locally and more
widely.</div><a name="080617113000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000461"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I have not made an estimate of the potential
losses. It would be hard to do so, because people come from so many
different parts of the world, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column784" />Column number: 784</div>for different reasons and motivations. I just observe that they are
trying to make rational decisions about their prospects, both
educationally and economically, and that these matters are one factor
that they surely take into account before embarking on an expensive
course on the other side of the world. I do not doubt for one moment
that there would be a damaging impact, although I do not know on what
scale.</div><a name="080617113000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000462"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points. I remember when I was on the former Trade and Industry
Committee, there was an inquiry and we were very concerned about the
fact that other countries were more successful than us at getting
students and that we were declining in relative terms. The detail of
this proposal does not matter too much, but, if it gets around that
students who go to the United Kingdom will be hit heavily for tax, they
will not come, will
they?</div><a name="080617113000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000463"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That is precisely my fear. I am generalising,
inevitably, but students coming to this country take into account a
range of factors. There are some British educational
institutions&#151;most notably Oxford and Cambridge
universities&#151;that enjoy a worldwide reputation for excellence.
Being in a country where the main language spoken is English is no
doubt attractive to many people, so there are also factors beyond the
immediate control of the Government. No doubt, one of the calculations
in the minds of the potential students is a financial one. That is
quite right, because they pay hefty fees to attend British universities
and one would expect them to make such a
calculation.</div><a name="080617113000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="080617113000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000464"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The hon. Gentleman will be
aware that, some years ago, the Fresh Talent initiative in Scotland
allowed graduate students from overseas to stay in work for two years,
something which has now been undertaken in the whole of the UK. Do
measures such as this risk undermining the potential of those
initiatives to grow the population and keep skilled people who have
been educated here? Does he agree that instead of using the word
&#147;enrolled&#148;, his amendment should have specified being
engaged in full-time education, as his new clause 5 did, and also in
part-time education up to a minimum number of hours? I am sympathetic
to the argument but not sure that the wording is as tight as it might
have
been.</div><a name="080617113000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000465"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for that intervention because I am
willing to concede that my skills do not lie entirely in the area of
drafting Parliamentary amendments. Others can conclude where they do
lie. I hope that this has been a useful debate for the Committee. It
would be helpful to have the Minister&#146;s response to the
amendments about the status of students in higher education. It would
also help if she could respond to the point raised with me by
Mr. Double from the City of London about whether the clock
starts ticking on overseas residents who are in school-level education
but turn 18 in the last year of their sixth form before 5 April and
whether that entire period they have spent in school&#151;not just
the last few weeks before they do their A-levels&#151;counts towards
the regulations that the Government are bringing in. If so, that would
obviously have a very damaging impact on school-level institutions that
attract overseas students.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000466"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the Opposition spokesman, may I
say to the Committee that I understand from the usual channels that
they would like to adjourn consideration at 7 o&#146;clock. There is,
of course, a vote at 7 o&#146;clock. I can only express the hope that
those who are speaking can so order their comments that the Government
Whip can rise in order to move that further consideration be now
adjourned, otherwise it will be necessary to come back after the
Division at 7 o&#146;clock. If it has been agreed through the usual
channels that the Committee wishes to adjourn, I would ask Members to
note what must be
done.</div><a name="080617113000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000467"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): May I say what a pleasure it
is to serve under your chairmanship at this late hour of this
afternoon&#146;s proceedings, Sir Nicholas?</div>
<a name="080617113000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lest any
Member doubt the fact that the hon. Member for Ealing, North is a
graduate of the LSE, let me assure them that in my first year there, he
was the general secretary of the students union. One of us appears to
have aged better than the other but I remember him fondly from those
days. I also assure the Committee that nothing has changed in the
20-plus years since we were at the
LSE.</div><a name="080617113000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not going to go over points made by the hon. Member for Taunton
about the contribution of the higher education sector to the UK
economy. It plays a significant role and makes a major contribution in
subsidising the costs of UK students. We should acknowledge
that.</div>
<a name="080617113000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue in connection with students in full-time higher education has
been raised by a number of people in the City of London. I am not sure
whether it has been raised by the corporation itself, but it has been
raised by other bodies in the City. It was also debated in the House of
Lords Economic Affairs Sub-Committee on the Finance Bill. Ian
Menzies-Conacher said in his evidence to the
Sub-Committee:</div><a name="080617113000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
simple thing is we would like to see time spent in full time education
simply disregarded in terms of calculating the seven years. Our problem
is that we would like to recruit non-residents&#151;Chinese,
Indians&#151;for obvious reasons...by the time they have been
educated in a UK university with an MBA they are starting to approach
the end of the seven years before we have even got them on
board.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
same point was made to me not only by the British Bankers Association
but by the London Investment Banking Association. It is one of the
strengths of London and the financial services sector that they draw on
a pool of talent, some of which comes from UK universities in the form
of non-doms who could be deemed to have been resident for the duration
of their course. If they have already spent three years on a degree and
a couple of years on a master&#146;s and qualified under the rules
that we discussed in schedule 7, they may be approaching the seven-year
point at which they will have to decide whether to be taxed on an
arising basis or to enjoy the remittance basis and pay the
&#163;30,000. That is an interesting argument, but there are some
problems with it. We need to understand why that group deserves
exemption when other groups might not. If it is because of their
economic contribution, there may be cases to be argued for other
groups, such as international bankers. Should they be
exempted?</div><a name="080617113000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000468"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Full-time students on the five-year course that
the hon. Gentleman described would not be earning money during that
time, apart from pocket money, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 786</div>possibly, on the side. That is an important consideration that would not
apply to the other example.</div>
<a name="080617113000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000469"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It depends. We need to be careful. I will be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response, because the issue
raises questions about who would qualify. They may well have
remittances from overseas that would start that seven-year clock
ticking, but my point is that if we exempt students on the basis of
their future economic contribution, should we exempt international
bankers as well? I do not think that it is anyone&#146;s intention to
do so.</div>
<a name="080617113000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it is an
exemption for study, why restrict it to higher education? I know from
my own experience that it takes a minimum of three years to qualify as
a chartered accountant. Only after someone has qualified can they
maximise their potential benefit to the firm employing them. Should
their seven years start when they qualify? What about lawyers? I think
that it takes five years to qualify as a lawyer. I am not a lawyer
myself but a chartered accountant, so I cannot say with the same degree
of certainty, but becoming a lawyer involves a law degree, a year of
law school and a year in articles. At what point should the seven years
start? If we are going to consider exemptions, we need to be clear what
grounds they are based on. I do not think that it is clear at the
moment.</div>
<a name="080617113000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I point out
to the hon. Member for Taunton, who has accepted that draftmanship is
not his reason for being in Parliament, that even his two amendments
that we are discussing have different wordings, which would have an
impact. Amendment No. 47
says:</div><a name="080617113000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(1) does not apply to an individual who is enrolled in a higher
education institution in the United
Kingdom.&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Far
be it from me to suggest how people might take advantage of tax rules,
but I can imagine all non-dom London employees of Goldman Sachs
suddenly enrolling in higher education institutions.</div>
<a name="080617113000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even his
amendment No. 48, which
says</div><a name="080617113000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;was
enrolled in full-time higher education&#148;</div>
<a name="080617113000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">does not address the
issue of engagement and being on the course. I recognise the arguments
that have been made for the exemption for students in higher education,
but I am not sure how we could tighten the wording to reduce misuse. It
is quite a challenge to get that right. This issue has been raised not
just by the Russell group, but by the financial services sector. All
will be listening carefully to the Financial Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="080617113000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="080617113000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000470"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It has already been suggested that the amendments
might be described as loosely worded. They are technically deficient,
largely for the reasons described by the hon. Member for Fareham. They
are also absolutely unnecessary. The day-counting mechanism in clause
22 applies only to determining whether somebody who is not a UK
resident should be treated as resident for tax purposes. It does not
arise for students because the vast majority of higher education
students live in the UK full time during their course. They
are therefore tax resident from the moment they arrive. The
day-counting process is simply irrelevant to their circumstances.
They will be completely unaffected by the changes in clause
22.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column787" />Column number: 787</div><a name="080617113000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
remainder, it is not clear that there is a material issue to be dealt
with. Everybody remains exempt from the &#163;30,000 charge while
they are under 18. A first degree lasting three or four years will not
be enough to trigger the new seven-years-out-of-10 test that controls
the application of the &#163;30,000 remittance basis charge. We
accept that it is right to exempt children, but the counting starts
from the moment of arrival of a non-domicile who comes to be resident
in the UK. The hon. Member for Taunton is right in the description that
the City raised with him that a child who arrives at the age of 5 will
become liable for the charge on turning 18 if they opt to use the
remittance basis. That goes to the nub of the
debate.</div><a name="080617113000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was political agreement across the House that the remittance basis
needed to be reformed. There were clear differences about how we should
do that. I believe that we have brought forward a set of changes that
make necessary improvements to the regime to close loopholes that were
widely regarded as being abused to a high degree. At the same time, we
have not imposed a charge immediately on someone&#146;s arrival,
which is what the party of the hon. Member for Fareham proposed. That
was clearly
anti-competitive.</div><a name="080617113000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a person turning 18 decided to use the remittance basis, it would be
because they had access to offshore funds totalling in excess of
&#163;1.6 million. Such people may be doing a Saturday job, but it
would not be in the same context that my children would be working on a
Saturday. My children would be doing so because I had insisted that
they go out and earn their own keep to a certain extent. It is wrong to
paint the picture that there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of
students coming to the UK who may be affected by this measure. That is
not the case. It is also important to remember that under many double
taxation agreements, money brought into the UK to support
somebody&#146;s studies is not taxable. The only students who would
be opting for the remittance basis would be those who had been in the
UK for a long time and had considerable offshore income that they can
afford to leave outside the
UK.</div><a name="080617113000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is pointless reiterating this point. I have explained broadly why I
think that the amendments are completely unnecessary. I will give way
because I wish to make one or two points before I
finish.</div><a name="080617113000250"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000471"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Financial Secretary referred to the exemptions
that appear under double tax treaties where funds are brought into the
country for somebody to live on. Is she saying that where there is a
conflict between a double tax treaty and the rules around residence and
domicile, the double tax treaty will override the rules on residence
and
domicile?</div><a name="080617113000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000472"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It will depend on the terms of the
double-taxation treaty and on the circumstances of the individual, but
I anticipate there will be few occasions when there will be conflicts
of this nature. I did want to respond to the point that the hon.
Members for Fareham and for Taunton both raised about the fears that
some big employers in the City had about recruiting and retaining some
of the excellent students who come from abroad to train here and may in
the course of their studies come close to the seven years. It would be
wrong 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column788" />Column number: 788</div>to start making exemptions in that case, just as it would be virtually
impossible to start making exemptions for the banker described by the
hon. Member for Fareham, or an industrialist who may have been here for
some time, involved in one of our big multinational corporations. To
make that sort of exemption is quite wrong. If we have what we are now
providing&#151;a fair system that is far less complicated than it
used to be, but none the less addresses the concerns that were being
raised among citizens of the UK who did not have access to the
remittance basis about the fairness of the loopholes that were
undermining the system&#151;then we have something that will work. It
is clearer&#151;I am not saying that it is the clearest piece of
legislation ever, but it is much clearer than it
was.</div><a name="080617113000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000473"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Can the Minister answer the question that her hon.
Friend the Member for Wirral, South put to me, which is whether any
estimate has been made of the financial impact on the British higher
education sector of the proposals being brought forward by the
Government?</div><a name="080617113000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000474"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I have not asked for any specific piece of work
to do that, but I am confident that the impact will be very small. If
the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South
wish, I can certainly inquire further, but I believe the numbers of
students affected will be very small. The Russell Group, or any other
institution of higher education, ought not to be concerned about the
implications of this
clause.</div><a name="080617113000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000475"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The Minister is absolutely right in terms of those
individuals who have a minimum of &#163;1.6 million to be
parked overseas, but thinking about the sort of student who may be
funding themselves through university, who may have a modest remittance
coming in, more than the &#163;2,000 threshold, they would then lose
all their UK tax allowance for a very small remittance coming in from
overseas to help them with their university fees perhaps. Is there not
a real issue for people working their own way through university with a
small remittance coming from overseas, perhaps from family, to help
them pay their fees, that they would then be hit by this additional
taxation because their allowances would go, which they need to work
their way through their
studies?</div><a name="080617113000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000476"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I think I can reassure the hon. Gentleman.
Individuals have to make choices and a resident non-domicile does not
have to use the remittance basis. They can choose not to do so, in
which case they are treated as any other taxpayer in the UK. Therefore,
if they were in full-time education, their income would be considered
as that of any other student in the UK would be considered. As I have
said, we do not have double-taxation agreements with every country in
the world, but we have one of the largest, if not the largest, numbers
of double-taxation agreements around the world, so the vast majority of
students who come to the UK to study would be protected by the terms of
their double-taxation treaty agreements.</div>
<a name="080617113000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
hon. Member for Dundee, East will accept that I do not believe there is
a cause for concern here. The only reason for opting to use the
remittance basis and having to consider paying the charge is if one has

<div class="Column"><a name="Column789" />Column number: 789</div>offshore funds of &#163;80,000 or more. With anything less than that,
in the circumstances he has described, one would simply consider
oneself to be here as any other taxpaying resident in the UK for tax
purposes.</div><a name="080617113000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000477"></a>Mr.

thought that was a useful discussion, and I hope the Minister will take
the opportunity to keep the issue under review and ensure that there is
not a damaging impact on the higher education sector within the United

across the Committee that we adjourn our deliberations at 7
o&#146;clock. Whoever is on their feet&#151;Minister or shadow

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000481"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, for your guidance on
timing. I will endeavour to finish before 7 o&#146;clock, hopefully
at a point that does not cause the Committee any inconvenience in terms
of other Members
speaking.</div><a name="080617113000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
heart of the amendment is to probe the Government&#146;s thinking on
where they might be in terms of considering a statutory residence test.
It is worth bearing in mind that while clause 22 may give the
appearance of being a statutory test, it certainly is not. We have a
situation where a taxpayer will know with certainty that, if they spend
more than 183 days in the country in one year, or more than 91 days per
year over four years, they will be residents. What they cannot be
certain of is whether, if they spent fewer days, they would not for
some reason be treated as resident. Unfortunately, it is not as cut and
dried as that.</div>
<a name="080617113000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in a
case law system, and case law has built up around these issues. I had a
quick peek at &#147;Halsbury&#146;s Laws of England&#148; in
preparation for this debate. One of the cases&#151;I think it was
Reid <i class="I">v</i>. Inland Revenue Commissioners, in 1926&#151;established
that even if one sells one&#146;s house and furniture and lives in
hotels in the UK, as long as one spends time in the UK annually, one
could be deemed a resident. In this case, the period of time was three
to four months, the bank account was in London and the personal effects
were here. The fact that one does not have a property here does not
necessarily mean that one is not resident. There is an example in which
someone stayed in a hotel, but was deemed to be resident. There are all
sorts of rules around this matter which make it quite
complex.</div><a name="080617113000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080617113000482"></a><b class="B">Emily
Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): I am
surprised to hear that the hon. Gentleman is so shocked that people can
be resident without owning property. A very large number of my
constituents live in Islington without owning their
flats.</div><a name="080617113000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000483"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The point I was making was that actually the rules
are not clear, and that the fact that one may not have a home in the UK
does not mean to say that one is not resident in the UK if one comes to
visit. In some circumstances, an individual might have a home in the UK
but not be deemed resident in the UK, despite visiting frequently. If
someone has an abode here, they might still be in a situation where
they are not deemed resident. I have to give way to the Minister. I do
not want to take up too much time. I am conscious of the
hour.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column791" />Column number: 791</div><a name="080617113000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="080617113000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000484"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It may be helpful to the hon. Gentleman if I tell
him that I am not unsympathetic to the case being made for a statutory
residence test. However, there is no consensus at the moment from those
groups lobbying for such a test as to what a test would look like. I
have asked for work to be done to see whether one can be
developed.</div>
<a name="080617113000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000485"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I knew that the Minister was sympathetic to the
idea before I started. I understand that she has been engaged in
discussions with advisers. I want to say why I believe that there is a
strong case for a residence test, because it is important that people
understand some of the issues. I shall want to raise other points on
clause stand part.</div>
<a name="080617113000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Guidance
produced by the Inland Revenue in IR20, which is quite a thick
document,
states:</div><a name="080617113000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
booklet sets out the main factors that are taken into account, but we
can only make a decision based on your residence status on the facts in
your particular
case.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some uncertainty about how the rules apply. The 91-day rule has its
complications. Although it is meant to have a four-year duration, those
who have been in the country for an average of 91 days during the
previous four years are treated as being resident from the fifth
year.</div>
<a name="080617113000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
booklet also states
that</div><a name="080617113000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;you
are treated as resident from 6 April of the first year if it is clear
when you first come to the UK that you intend making such visits and
you subsequently actually carry out your
intention.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Intention
is a key part of this. It is not only about whether people are resident
here, it is also about what they intend to do. On that subject, there
is an interaction between the clause and schedule 7.</div>
<a name="080617113000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Residence is
clearly an important concept, given that it drives whether or not one
is liable to pay the &#163;30,000 charge. There is much uncertainty,
and people feel that it undermines the UK&#146;s competitiveness as a
place to do business.</div>
<a name="080617113000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK is
one of the few major countries without a statutory residence rule.
Although the consultation document on residence points out that the UK
has been relatively generous about the number of days that people can
stay in the UK without being resident, that generosity is undermined by
the fact that the rule itself is non-statutory. As a consequence,
people will want to avoid inadvertently becoming resident and thus
might well spend fewer days in the UK. They will want to ensure that
they are well within the rules and cannot be deemed to be treated as
being resident here.</div>
<a name="080617113000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
it is important to consider the matter, and I am grateful that the
Minister gave us an assurance in her intervention. I was generous in
the amendment in giving the Government until 31 December 2008 to
collate the report, as it will enable the consultation to be done
properly. There are different models for statutory residence tests.
Both Ireland and the United States have drawn up their own tests. The
hon. Member for Taunton&#146;s amendment to new clause 5 is based on
the US test, but there are others.</div>
<a name="080617113000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the Minister has considered whether the new test should be
retrospective, or whether the Government would consider having simple
transitional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column792" />Column number: 792</div>reliefs. The US test requires going back three years in calculating
whether one has spent more than 183 days in the country. If the test
was introduced now, would it apply over the past three tax years, or
would it come fully into effect in three years&#146; time? Those are
the types of issues to which the Minister has alluded, but they are
difficult to resolve.</div>
<a name="080617113000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
talk at length about the case, given that the Minister has indicated
her desire to consider it. However, I wish to raise some points on
clause stand part. First, IR20 allows a disregard on the number of days
spent in the UK if the individual or a family member falls ill during a
visit that requires individuals to extend their stay in the UK. Will
that concession apply following the introduction of these changes? I
suspect that that might fall into the category of extra-statutory
concessions, a subject that was debated earlier today. It would help if
the Minister were to assure us on that.</div>
<a name="080617113000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish also
to speak about the applicability of the changes. The changes in the
clause affect residents of narrowly defined areas by amending section
831 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which deals with the foreign income of
individuals resident in the UK for a temporary purpose. Is it the
intention that in the absence of statutory residence rules these
changes will apply to all aspects of IR20? If so, when will a revised
version of IR20 be
ready?</div><a name="080617113000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
I want to discuss the in-transit rule in the clause. Such rules were
introduced because the Government decided that the day of departure and
the day of arrival could no longer be excluded from the day-counting
rules because of changes in international travel. They changed the rule
so that when an individual was in the UK at the end of the day, that
day was counted towards residence. That meant that people in transit
would be covered by the rules. An international traveller spending the
night at Heathrow before catching his flight the next morning to New
York would find that day counting towards his days in the
UK.</div><a name="080617113000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have responded to the outcry generated by that rule with
proposed new subsection (1B)(b), which states that if somebody is in
transit, the day does not count towards their residence test
if</div><a name="080617113000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
individual does not engage in activities that are to a substantial
extent unrelated to the individual&#146;s passage through the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="080617113000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Helpfully,
paragraph 17 of the explanatory notes on the clause tries to address
what &#147;substantial extent&#148; means. Somebody who is in
transit through the UK and attends a business meeting in Canary Wharf
does engage in activities that
are</div><a name="080617113000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
a substantial extent
unrelated&#148;</div><a name="080617113000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
his passage through the UK. However, somebody who unexpectedly bumps
into a colleague in the foyer of an airport hotel, has a drink with him
and talks about business does not engage in such activities. The casual
encounter is okay, but the formal meeting is not. I wonder whether we
will see an increase in casual encounters in airport hotels as a
consequence of this
measure.</div><a name="080617113000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
more extensive guidance on this measure might help. I gather that
spending most of the day seeing one&#146;s grandchildren who live
near Gatwick while en route between Guernsey and New Zealand will not
meet the test, but having a meal at an airport hotel with one&#146;s
son will meet it. I do not know whether that applies to any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column793" />Column number: 793</div>members of the Committee, but it is apparently an important distinction.
I am not quite sure what happens if one&#146;s grandchildren also
come to eat at the airport hotel. I suppose it depends how long the
meal lasts and how good the service is as to whether it passes the
test.</div><a name="080617113000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concession is well intentioned and it is the right way to go, but I am
not sure how straightforward it is to implement. Doubtless, case law
will develop along these lines. We have received one representation
saying that the examples in the explanatory notes do not refer to the
modern form of business in which people may communicate by computer
over things like Skype, video conferencing and so on. If one
participated in a video conference from a hotel in Heathrow while
awaiting a flight to New York, would that be a formal meeting? That
might sound rather
pedantic.</div><a name="080617113000286"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080617113000487"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Having looked at &#147;Halsbury&#146;s Laws of
England&#148;, pedantry might come into play in future debates on
this
issue.</div><a name="080617113000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I go back to the issue of whether tax gains or losses will be attached
to introducing the statutory residence test. As I understand it, the
Treasury has said that the test in clause 22 will lead to an increase
in revenue of about &#163;50 million, with 17,000 being treated as
residents and 7,000 people changing their behaviour to avoid being
treated as residents. Will the Financial Secretary elaborate on the
basis of those calculations? How does the Treasury determine the
behavioural changes that the clause will bring about? How does it know
that 17,000 people will be caught, when perhaps if they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column794" />Column number: 794</div>well advised they will not be? In the debate on statutory
residence&#151;the Minister has indicated her interest in it&#151;I
would like to think that spurious calculations of losses and gains got
in the way of producing a rule in the best interests of the economy as
a whole.</div>
<a name="080617113000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that there is a strong case for a statutory residence regime, but agree
with the Financial Secretary, based on her earlier remarks, that more
needs to be done to establish a set of clear, certain rules that will
reduce the costs of compliance on both the taxpayer and HMRC. Taxpayers
spend a lot of money on advice to determine whether they fall within
the scope of the rules. If we can move away from that to a much more
certain and clear system, it will strengthen Britain&#146;s
reputation as a place to do business. The best way to crystallise the
Treasury&#146;s thinking on the matter is to require it to
lay a report before Parliament by 31 December
2008.</div>
