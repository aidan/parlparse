</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that, before the Committee adjourned, after speaking for 40 minutes, Mr. Letwin was completing his introduction to the schedule, as amended, stand part debate.

<H4><center>Schedule 30</center></H4>
<H4><center>Double taxation relief</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the schedule, as amended, be the Thirtieth schedule to the Bill.

<P>
Question again proposed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Thank you, Dr. Clark. You were right that I was completing my introduction before we adjourned. The main text of my speech is now to follow. I was answering my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) who said that, if the provisions under paragraph 8 allowed for double taxation purposes against profit were to be governed exclusively by provisions that were mandatory under local law, there would be a problem in relation to those countries. He was abundantly right. I shall cite an example. A privatised utility or telephone company in a less developed country would typically have large unpaid invoices that it had issued to the local Government. In such a classical case, the auditors would wish the company to provide for the unpaid invoices, perhaps because there could be little assurance that the Government would decide eventually to make good the deficiency. It is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine the company successfully pursuing the Government in court. The regulatory consequences alone might be sufficient to deter it from doing so.

<P>
Yet it is almost unimaginable that the Government in question should legislate to force one of their utilities or telephone companies to provide against their potential refusal or inability to meet their own telephone or utility bills. I know of no example in which such legislation has even been discussed, let alone enacted. In such a case, were a multinational corporation to headquarter itself in the United Kingdom in future or were one of the existing multinationals in the UK to buy an overseas subsidiary of that type in a less developed country, it would be unable for the purposes of double tax relief in the United Kingdom to include reference to the provisions that it had made against the local Government's unpaid telephone or utility bills because that would not have been mandatorily provided.

<P>
As a result, the declared VAT for UK double tax relief purposes of the subsidiary in question would be higher than it would otherwise be-and given the order of magnitude, it may be 50 per cent. higher and, in many cases, 70 per cent. higher. The proportion of the VAT represented by the dividends remitted to the UK by that subsidiary would diminish, as would the proportion of the underlying tax attributable to the profits that could be used as a credit against UK tax attached to the dividend, so the tax bill of the UK-headquartered multinational would rise.

<P>
That may sound abstruse, but not when combined with paragraph 6, whatever becomes of paragraph 10 and the provisions on controlled foreign companies in schedule 31. The combination provides a compelling case for multinational corporations thinking of establishing headquarters or intermediate headquarters in the UK, which would be of enormous importance to our economy, to consider moving elsewhere. I cannot see the justification for providing that disincentive in the case of paragraph 8.

<P>
I understand that, in cases such as that of the CFC legislation, a genuine mischief is being dealt with, albeit hamfistedly. At least I can see the logic of that, but I cannot see why one would want to make the ruling in paragraph 8 applicable. There is a clear way available to Ministers to solve the potential problem of a UK multinational subsidiary consciously over-providing and hence enabling itself to credit an excess of attributable underlying tax when seeking to relieve its UK tax bill. The obvious route is for the level of provisions to be counted towards the calculation of the profit only if it has been set in accordance with international accounting standards. Further guidance can be given, which suggests that the Revenue would want it established that the auditors had signed the level of provisions off as prudent and reasonable. Indeed, it could satisfy itself on that by demanding that the auditors be affiliated to one of the international auditing firms. That is a ready method in accounting terms.

<P>
There is no need to invoke mandatory regulations about provisions and reserves, which by and large do not exist. To do so would be a needless disincentive to companies to headquarter in this country. I think that a technical error has been made, but I do not know why. It desperately needs tidying. My point sounds small and abstruse, but cumulatively it is the beginning of the end of the UK as a place for headquartering.

<P>
I shall add one more point before I end my diatribe on paragraph 8, and it applies to everything that I want to go on to say about paragraph 10 and schedule 31. I urge the Paymaster General and her colleagues to attend to the fact that the judgments about the location of a headquarters are narrow. In the case of major multinationals, the decisions are made by lawyers, accountants and others concerned with quality of life and executive recruitment, after intensive scrutiny. They are multi-faceted decisions that are inevitably difficult to make.

<P>
The choice between Moscow and London is easy. No one dreams of putting a headquarters in Moscow, but the choice between Amsterdam and London is difficult. They are comparable cities with comparable access to highly skilled and educated labour and management. They have comparable networks of double tax treaties, comparable tax arrangements and clearly comparable access to the European Union and its markets. Notwithstanding the fact that Dutch is the language of Holland and English is the language of England, the work forces have comparable abilities to speak English, the universal language of business. In Holland, there is a straightforward exemption system on double tax relief, so no such problems arise. Therefore, the choice to move to London rather than to the Netherlands is extremely finely balanced. Paragraphs 6 and 8, the unamended paragraph 10 and the CFC legislation and mistakes in schedule 31 will tilt that balance remorselessly away from the United Kingdom. That is an economic disaster in the making.

<P>
Once it starts happening, there will be a vicious circle. One of the reasons why companies come here is that others are here, and it is because those companies are here that accountancy firms, lawyers, corporate services, telecommunications and other forms of support are in place. All the infrastructure required for a headquarters is here. If companies start not locating here, that support will gradually dwindle.

<P>
I need not exaggerate for effect. The skills base in the United Kingdom would slowly and steadily whittle down as the most talented professionals moved to places with headquarters, because the most talented professionals do not want to work for second, third or fourth-layer companies. They want to work at the top, where the most interesting and important financial and commercial decisions are made. Such apparently erudite and obscure little changes will gradually erode the entire base of the City of London, and with that, much else will flow.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): While the hon. Gentleman is on that point, perhaps he could tell the Committee more about the other people who would be affected-not just the lawyers, the accountants, the bankers and so on, but the people who provide the ancillary services that headquarters require, from janitors to sandwich-makers. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we must consider not only the large multinationals that represent faceless corporatism, but the small people too?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. We must consider more people than those that I mentioned. A wide range of people would be affected, because the measure would have second, third, fourth and fifth-round employment effects. When the multinational goes, its cleaners go. When the accounting or law firm diminishes, its cleaners go. Then the people who make the machines for the cleaners lose business, and multiplier effects take place.

<P>
Beyond that, some decisions would be made differently. That is a matter of human psychology. If one's headquarters are in the UK and one must decide where to buy new equipment, one's thoughts naturally turn to the UK first. I do not say that such a consideration is compelling. If the UK cannot compete, multinationals will buy elsewhere, but their first port of call will be local. It is easier for many UK suppliers to market to multinational headquarters in the UK. All those advantages would be gradually lost and could, for example, transfer to Amsterdam.

<P>
The long-term employment effects are incalculable, but large. Of course, they will not hit the Government in the next two years. They will not hit the country in the next five or 10 years, but they will make a huge difference over 20, 30 or 40 years. Only looking back will people be able to say, ``Alas if only that change had not been made! It was the villain of the piece. It did not matter much itself, but it started a snowball effect.'' That is what we are worried about. I hope that the Paymaster General, after her experiences and those of other Ministers on paragraph 10, which I shall shortly reach, will realise that we are raising an issue that we and British industry are serious about.

<P>
Before I come to paragraph 10, I will make two relatively minor points about other parts of the schedule. The discretion that paragraph 17 gives the Inland Revenue to decide whether royalties are at arm's length is too wide. A table or method for objectively assessing arm's-length royalty prices must be devised. Otherwise, some significant but needless disputes will arise.

<P>
Paragraph 19 on line 20 of page 516 is a mere amusement on my part. The Paymaster General and her officials may have noticed that sub-paragraph 6 should be relabelled as sub-paragraph 9. I make that observation merely for the sake of good order.

<P>
Having spent more time than I had intended to on previous paragraphs, I come to the critical matter of paragraph 10. I am tempted to rehearse the whole sorry history of how we got to the present position, but I shall resist, partly because I do not want to bore hon. Members even more than I have done already, but also because I know that with your eagle eye, Dr. Clark, you will have noticed that I made many of the relative points-the Paymaster General may say too many of them-when we discussed the underlying clause on the Floor of the House.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Before moving on to the present situation, I should just like to say that the points that my right hon. Friend made this morning deserve to be taken seriously. It is human to err. We all do it. No blame attaches to the Government for having made an egregious mistake in paragraph 10, but it does if, having recognised the error, the Government do not make it plain that the needless, vindictive and false attack on one of Britain's most distinguished accountants has been shown to be false. The Government should make it abundantly plain that he and others who raised the issue performed a signal national service. Assertions were made at column 121 on 27 March that could not have been made except under the cloak of parliamentary privilege. The Chief Secretary or the Paymaster General, as his representative, should withdraw them unreservedly.

<P>
The character of the mistake that was made in relation to paragraph 10 is similar to that of the various other mistakes to which I have referred. It was overwhelmingly the most important subject and it is good that the Government have recognised that there is an error. But paragraph 10, as it was, together with all the other things that I have mentioned, had a cumulative effect. I hope that the change, if there is to be a substantive change to paragraph 10, will not make the Government think that they do not need to pay attention to all the other items that tend to diminish people's appetite for investment in the UK as a headquarters location.

<P>
With that preface, let me dwell on where I think we are at present. It will be most interesting to hear the Paymaster General's comments. It is an odd state of affairs because, unlike the many instances that we discussed this morning, we do not have before us a set of amendments that specify what is to be done to remedy the disastrous error in paragraph 10 which, if left unchanged, would prevent UK-headquartered multinationals from averaging out the tax rates of their overseas subsidiaries to claim the optimal tax relief under UK tax.

<P>
We do not have the amendments. We simply have a rather long press release from the Treasury. I will do it the honour of assuming that it has been carefully drafted. The explanation for the points that I am about to raise may turn out to be that it was not, but I doubt that. In the circumstances, with the Confederation of British Industry jumping up and down on its pogo stick, and most of British industry in revolt, I would have expected someone to have attended closely to the wording of this palimpsest. I propose to engage in a little exegesis of it, which is much needed, as it is all we have to go on.

<P>
The relevant paragraphs of the press release, which lie towards the end of the first page and at the top of the second, go, with an unconscious irony, under the title ``Details''-which are exactly what we do not have. They start with a statement that the following four points are the changes that the Government want to introduce. The first point that the Government want to change is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>dividends paid by CFCs to satisfy an acceptable distribution policy, where none of the other CFC exemptions (including the motive test) are met, will not be able to be mixed with any other dividends.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reference is to paragraph 6(2) of part II of schedule 25 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, on page 953 of that Act, which, rightly, exempts bona fide trading subsidiaries from the CFC imputation rules. I assume that that is the motive test being referred to in that paragraph of the press release. If it is, that is the first step towards a genuine solution to the problem. So far, so good.

<P>
I assume that the Government want to exempt from the prohibition on mixing subsidiaries that are not Bermuda cash boxes or the like but genuine trading companies. It is entirely appropriate that the motive test should apply, and we have no complaints with the paragraph, although we shall want to see how it is incorporated into amendments.

<P>
The next paragraph is one of the minor masterpieces in the extraordinary document that is the press release: It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>underlying tax in relation to foreign dividends paid up through overseas subsidiaries will be capped at 30 per cent., as in the Bill currently.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the Government do not acknowledge that a change is to be made. Things are to be as in the Bill, which was right all along. ``Yah-boo sucks; you've spent a lot of time, all you guys out there in industry, complaining, but we were right, and we are going to keep things exactly as they were.'' I assume that that was included to enable someone to refer back and say, ``We haven't really admitted that we got anything wrong.''

<P>
Mercifully, the next two paragraphs flatly deny that the second paragraph, to which I just referred, is true. They describe two respects in which underlying tax on foreign dividends will not be capped at 30 per cent. That is their precise purpose. I highlight those points because in a moment I shall discuss a more serious problem relating to the gap between reality and presentation in the press release.

<P>
Let us examine the two paragraphs in which the cap at 30 per cent. is to be breached in order to solve the problem that would otherwise have been introduced by paragraph 10 of schedule 30. The problem was that paragraph 10 specified that, in the case of two subsidiaries, one of which had a 10 per cent. tax rate and one of which had a 50 per cent. tax rate, it would be possible to claim only 30 per cent. tax credit for the one that had a 50 per cent. tax rate and 10 per cent. for the one that had a 10 per cent. tax rate, instead of being able to add the two together and claim the full 30 per cent. against UK tax. As a result, a UK headquartered multinational would pay a great deal more tax than it paid under the mixing system.

<P>
The third paragraph purports to resolve that problem. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>underlying tax above the cap will<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-and this is the single most important phrase in the press release-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>within certain limits<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-it would have been better to have written ``within uncertain limits'', because the limits are precisely what we have not been told, but nevertheless-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be able to be credited against UK tax payable on dividends other than dividends paid by CFCs as mentioned above<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-that is, those that fail the motive test-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and dividends where the underlying tax has already been capped.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The problem lies in the phrase ``within certain limits''. If the Paymaster General can tell us today or can present to the House on Report a wide definition of the certain limits, all will broadly be well, and mixing as we have always known it, possibly in an onshore form, to which we have never had the slightest objection-we agree that onshore is a more respectable version-will remain with us. If, however, certain limits are to be narrowly drawn, no significant change will have been introduced under paragraph 10. I shall now explain the position to those members of the Committee who are not as familiar with it as the Paymaster General must be by now. The issue is whether a company headquartered in the United Kingdom is allowed to average out tax rates between two foreign subsidiaries, one of which pays 10 per cent. tax, while the other pays 50 or 60 per cent. tax, or whether the averaging will apply only to those companies that pay between 25 and 35 per cent. tax.

<P>
The difference is hugely material. A huge number of multinationals is likely to have or to want to develop subsidiaries in countries with tax rates below 25 per cent. or above 35 per cent. If there were a range permitted for averaging only between 25 and 35 per cent., the effect in deterring multinationals from coming here would be broadly the same as that of the provisions in the paragraph. If, on the contrary, the limits range from 10 per cent. to 60 per cent.-one rumour is that that might be the chosen set of figures-everything that is legitimate is likely to be captured. There will be a minor nuisance in relation to tax-free jurisdictions.

<P>
There is a theoretical argument that there is no reason for the lower limit in the first place. I am dimly aware that the Paymaster General probably wants a lower limit because she feels that it is part of her crusade in the harmful tax competition group to do something about the nasty ways of Luxembourg. I do not share remotely her enthusiasm for such action, but I know that it is a preoccupation of hers. If that is how the Government feel about it, I suspect that British industry could heroically live with a 10 per cent. to 60 per cent. arrangement. If that is what we will be offered on Report, the main problem of parity will have been addressed. If the limit is tight, almost nothing will have been achieved.

<P>
The fourth sub-paragraph in the press release states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>similar relief will be allowed for some foreign tax above 30 per cent. paid on dividends received by UK companies directly from foreign subsidiaries (onshore pooling).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I must admit that a good deal of thought and attention to the two sub-paragraphs to which I have referred most recently left me unclear about the meaning of that part of the press release. The Paymaster General may be able to elucidate that. All that I can imagine is that it relates to the withholding tax on dividends, whereas the previous sub-paragraph refers to the underlying tax.

<P>
If that is the case, it is odd that onshore pooling is described in relation to the fourth sub-paragraph, but not in relation to the third sub-paragraph. If the amendments go for onshore pooling as a method-of which we approve-I would have expected them to cover both the underlying tax and the withholding tax. That needs clarification but, to give a generous interpretation of the two sub-paragraphs, if both the withholding tax and the underlying tax will be dealt with on the basis of a relatively wide band of mixable, poolable tax rates via onshore pooling, we have the rudiments of a successful solution to the problem.

<P>
We are anxious to hear about the character of the amendments that will be tabled on Report but, before I leave such a vexed issue, I draw the Committee's attention to what is undoubtedly the most remarkable, although by no means the most important, bit of the press release. Alas, it tells us a lot about the progress of this series of errors and tergiversations. The paragraph lies just above the misleading subtitle ``details'', so we must regard it as a general paragraph. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Given the scale of the avoidance that has come to light since the Budget, the impact of the overall package described above-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that includes all the changes to paragraph 10 and the others-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will be broadly similar to the estimates provided in the FSBR.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is genuinely breathtaking. The paragraph invites us to believe that, before they introduced the Bill, the Government calculated, if I remember the figure correctly, that the fiscal advantage to be derived from the measures in the Bill, including paragraph 10, was £300 million. Many people-including me, although I merely followed the lead of others who are more expert-pointed out that the figure was almost certainly wrong as a first round approximation. If people paid up or did not respond by leaving the UK or not coming here, the extra tax gained would be a multiple of £300 million-pershaps even £3,000 million.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government maintain that they have transformed their understanding of what is happening in the tax planning industry against a background of what would implicitly have been a much larger fiscal advantage if paragrpah 10, as it had been drafted, had been implemented, and had there been no response from the industry. By sheer coincidence, under the new proposals-the character of which we do not know, as we do not know the limits-the same figure that appeared in the ``Financial Statement and Budget Report'' for the old proposals will apply. Two elements boggle the imagination-one is that the Treasury have been able to calculate the fiscal effects of a measure the detail of which it has not decided. Therefore, without knowing what limits are going to be set, and without knowing how many of the companies involved will or will not be able to mix or to what extent, the Treasury has found a computer or a genius who can calculate the fiscal effect of the measure. On that basis, I assume that the Treasury can tell us the entire fiscal effect of the next Budget. If one does not have to know what the measures are to know their fiscal effects, one can presumably get the same brilliant person who invented this set of figures to invent the other set.

<P>
It is of course impossible to determine the fiscal effects of the measure until one knows what the measure is. Only two explanations therefore exist for the paragraph. First, after someone has carefully and conscientiously written a set of words to which I alluded earlier, a spin doctor has been set the task of trying to find a way of rescuing the Chancellor's figures. He has found a way that is, unfortunately, incoherent and implausible, and should be withdrawn. Alternatively, and much worse, the paragraph will be made true regardless of the policy effect. The Government will choose limits for its revised version of paragraph 10 that will, according to the Government's genuine best guess, produce the same number that appeared originally in the FSBR. That would be an absurd way to make public policy, but at least it would make the paragraph true. One way or the other, the Government stand convicted.

<P>
I raise the point-which is a debating point, unlike the others, which are on serious matters-because it shows what has happened. Once the Government had made the mistake-which, I repeat, we, or anyone else, could have made-they should have said, ``We got it wrong, we will take it away, produce a new draft, talk to industry about it, and introduce it at a later stage in the next Finance Bill in a proper form. We will then work out what, if anything, the fiscal effect will be.'' However, the Government are not doing that. They are still trying, or half trying, to pretend that nothing has changed, that they did not get anything wrong, and that, going back to the earlier point, they can still claim that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>underlying tax in relation to foreign dividends paid up through overseas subsidiaries will be capped at 30 per cent., as<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Bill currently states-which it will not-and maintain that the amounts to be raised will be the same as in the ``Financial Statement and Budget Report'', from which they will not be apart. It is an extraordinary coincidence or a distortion of policy.

<P>
That is needless, and it is not grown up. It is spin over substance, and the wrong way in which to take such action.

<P>
The problem arose because people were trying to be too clever in the first place, and they are now trying to be too clever about dealing with the effects of that, which multiplies the sin. It would be far better if we could get rid of all this and try to solve the underlying problem in a conscientious way. Whatever the details of paragraph 10 after the amendments have been introduced on Report, I hope that the Paymaster General can tell us that a sufficiently wide band will be provided for averaging, onshore and offshore, to ensure that this country remains, in respect of the underlying tax and the withholding tax on dividends, as attractive a location for multinational headquarters in terms of double tax relief as others in which either the exemption principle or the onshore pooling principle apply.

<P>
Although the episode has been a sorry one and we shall continue to make political capital out of it as the Opposition, the truth is that we- the industry, the Government and those of us who have opposed the measure from the start-will collectively have made a signal contribution to the preservation of our economy. It would be much furthered if the other deficiencies of schedule 30, to which I have alluded at too great length, were also remedied.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey: The hon. Member for West Dorset </B>(Mr. Letwin) has said much that I wanted to say. I apologise to the Committee for being absent this morning, but I was on parliamentary business with the Treasury Select Committee. I made efforts to find out what was said, and I do not believe that the Government helped us on the subject of the amendments. That is why the hon. Gentleman has done doubly well in examining the schedule.

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Dawn Primarolo): I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman tried to find out about our discussions this morning. He will acknowledge that we agreed to deal with the technical amendments this morning, which were Government amendments in response to the comments made by business. Paragraph 10, which is on mixing companies, was excepted because it would have required a substantial debate on schedule stand part. I agreed to wait to make the Government's response, for the sake of continuity of debate. I did not seek to keep the Committee in the dark this morning; the Committee agreed to proceed that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I certainly do not suggest that the Paymaster General was keeping us in the dark on what we are about to debate. I referred to the fact that we did not have the detailed amendments to the Government's proposals on onshore pooling, which will replace the main thrust. I hope that she will acknowledge that. We understand from reading the papers that we shall have to wait until Report. That is an issue of great substance. It relates to many of the points made by the hon. Member for West Dorset.

<P>
Businesses observing our proceedings must be amazed that we can go ahead in such a way as to leave them with no certainty for planning. We know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer likes to go under the soubriquet of the Iron Chancellor, but he is more like the Duke of York marching his horses to the top of hill and then having to march them down again. We are at present in stage two of the march down the hill. Amendments were tabled in the Committee of the whole House. At that time, many of us said that we did not believe that it would be the final word on the matter-and we have already been proved right by the press release. That amounts to the current second stage and we shall no doubt reach the third stage on Report when we shall witness the final part of the climbdown.

<P>
It is clear that the Government do not intend to provide us with any details about the amendments. However, they could provide people in businesses who watch or read about our proceedings with a little greater certainty about what is going to happen in the coming weeks. Businesses want to know when the amendments will be tabled. Obviously, they will be tabled on Report, but when will that be? We do not know the date of Report stage because we are not yet out of Committee stage. Can the Government provide guidance on the likely date of tabling the amendments before Report? Businesses will want to examine them in detail.

<P>
I hope that the Government will consult businesses at the pre-drafting stage. Once the amendments have been tabled, the wider business community will want to comment on them. We need to know not only the date of Report stage and when the amendments will be tabled but some idea of the period between those two dates. Will the Paymaster General give an assurance that the period between the tabling and the debating of the amendments will be long enough for genuine and full discussion to take place? It is vital that businesses are given that chance.

<P>
It is also vital for Opposition Members to have enough time for proper debate. Opposition Members have had several weeks to examine the clauses-and for the later clauses, one or two months-and to take advice. That will not apply to the complex amendments that the Government will have to table before Report. In order to mitigate some of the damage caused by uncertainty and chopping and changing, the Government should make amends by giving us a clear timetable on how the process will develop.

<P>
Although I have already made a brief comment to this effect, the Government must give some assurances on consultation during those periods. One process that has broken down during this sorry saga is consultation. We debated that at length in the Committee of the whole House, so I shall not go over the detail, but the Government made pledges elsewhere that they would go through proper consultation processes. When they do not consult, the Government commit mistakes. I hope that they will learn that lesson for the period between now and Report.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset spoke about headquartering and the effect on multinationals of the decision to headquarter in the UK. The hon. Gentleman is right. We have read many articles in the press by various chief executives who argue that multinationals may decide not to locate in the UK. The hon. Gentlemen and I spoke about the damaging effect of that.

<P>
I hope that the Government will realise that this country has to survive outside its near trading bloc with a separate currency-an issue debated in the Treasury Select Committee this morning. We all know about the severe string put on large businesses and industries located in this country. They already have to fight with an arm tied behind their back on currencies. Now the tax regime is being changed, which will make it even more difficult for them to compete. The hon. Gentleman did a good job of analysing all the different factors that a multinational would consider in deciding where to locate. He said, rightly, that those decisions are often taken on marginal issues. However, if this issue makes four or five companies decide not to locate in the UK, that could have extremely damaging consequences. We are talking mainly about large companies, which bring a great deal of wealth with them when they locate in a country.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Of course, business and the Opposition parties will be pleased if the Government do a full U-turn. It is fair to say that Liberal Democrats would be prepared unequivocally to welcome that U-turn, especially if it is made with the openness and consultation that we have not seen up to now. When the U-turn is made, the Government should not believe that the episode is therefore over. I hope that they will learn lessons as a result about the severity of what they have done.

<P>
First, the trust between the Government and large businesses in Britain has been damaged. The Government did a great job before taking office and in their first year or two in turning round the views of many people in British industry about their operation of economic policy. All sides of the political spectrum welcomed that development, because it is good for the long-term health of Great Britain plc to know that all the mainstream parties are pro-business.

<P>
However, this measure, and the way in which the Government have gone about it, has begun to undermine that trust. I do not welcome that. You might be surprised to hear that, Dr. Clark. Clearly, it would be great to have another stick with which to beat the Government, but I do not want that stick, because it is not in the long-term interests of UK plc that one of the major parties is not trusted by business. Therefore, I hope that the Government will not just do a U-turn and think that that is the end of the matter. I hope that they will make special efforts to rebuild trust. I make that point seriously.

<P>
Secondly, if the Government manage the U-turn and there is a move from mixer companies offshore to pooling onshore-as seems likely-that is not a cost-free move. Many companies that currently operate mixer arrangements offshore will have to pay significant one-off costs. The Paymaster General shakes her head, but that is what people are saying. They must be right, because those companies must have accounting systems, officers and legal entities registered abroad. Those arrangements are not free; they cost money. The Paymaster General may dispute the size of those costs. She may wish to make out that the costs are trivial. However, I would dispute that. We have been hearing from various commentators that companies will have to carry the burden of those costs, when they eventually are told what the arrangements will be. Therefore, there is a cost in the Government's mistake and the episode that we have experienced.

<P>
Finally, there will be another cost, unless the Government do a complete U-turn. With regard to mixer companies, the hon. Member for West Dorset said that in the rephrasing some of the original aspects of the schedule might have been kept, which will create costs. If the band of rates at which relief is received is narrowly drawn, the cost will be even higher. That is the concern that we want to rise. If the Government do not get it right now and do not do a full volte face, significant costs may be levelled at British industry. That is what the debate has been about. The Government must do a full U-turn, not a half-turn, and ensure that British industry is not saddled through the whim of some political adviser in the Treasury.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I shall not attempt to replicate the matchless way in which my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset laid out the case against the Government proposals. He had clearly grasped all the technical complexities. I wish to support his and others' calls for an entirely fresh, slow consideration of the matter. The Government have conducted a series of belated retreats from their initial proposals, some of which we are invited to consider today and others on Report. The entire subject should be wrapped up and re-presented at a later date so that the issue can be considered in the round, the outside interests are given a further chance to comment on the Government's recent proposals.

<P>
The indisputable fact is that this has been an inglorious episode in the history of the Treasury and a textbook example of how not to deal with the taxpaying public and the business sector in particular. On Budget day the tone was different-it was one of confidence. However, it was immediately spotted that the Budget press releases were disingenuous, to put it delicately. For instance, the one about double taxation relief said that the proposed changes in the Budget followed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a review of double taxation relief that started two years ago and has involved extensive consultation with business.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is true that the Government consulted extensively about the matter of double taxation relief, but they did not consult about the proposals unveiled on Budget day. That point was well made by the Chartered Institute of Taxation in its submission, when it said that the proposals
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>do not reflect the prior consultation. In particular, throughout the two years of consultation, we were led to understand that the three systems being considered were mixers, onshore pooling or an exemption system. At no time was it suggested that mixers might be abolished without replacement.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The proposals do not arise out of or flow from the consultations, but follow them only in the sense that night follows day.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend has reminded me that, when I inaugurated an Adjournment debate on the subject that he is describing, the Economic Secretary was sent in to bat. No doubt the Paymaster General felt that it would be too embarrassing to spout such stuff.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was away.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry-the hon. Lady was elsewhere. The Economic Secretary was sent in to bat.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> She was excellent, too.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Oh, indeed. She read out a speech that was one of the most amazing that I have heard. She essentially said that, if one took out a magnifying glass and looked at the words, one could find clues to the very proposals that later emerged. Thus, by implication, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry and all the rest were too stupid to read the document. I was merely another idiot who had been woefully misled. If only I, and all those other people who were too stupid to read the report, had attended to the precise words and read them the right way up, with the right magnifying glasses. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) will not desist from continuing in his noble endeavours to ram that home, because it was a shabby episode.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The episode has discredited the procedure of consultation. Many professional and experienced people laboured long and hard to help the Government tackle the difficult, complex issue of double taxation relief. Frankly, they were being misled. The consultations were taking place on a different basis. If the Government really want a business-friendly reputation and to work in partnership with the business sector, which is their favourite phrase, they must take it into their confidence and not assume that the sole task of anyone in business is to avoid or evade tax.

<P>
The truth is that mixer companies are widely used for purposes unconnected with tax avoidance. Perhaps that was not understood in the Treasury at the time. However, it is now and there is a growing realisation that its initial sums were wrong. I shall not repeat my earlier points about how Mr. Wyman was treated. Clearly, he has now been vindicated. He is certainly owed an explanation and an apology. The entire accountancy profession came in behind him and queried the assertion in the Budget press releases that the double taxation rules would cost firms only £100 million a year.

<P>
The senior tax partner at Ernst and Young said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As a result, UK companies will pay more tax abroad and less profit will be repatriated to the UK, leaving less for the Chancellor to tax.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That opened up an intriguing possibility that perhaps what the Treasury were doing was making an estimate based on the assumption that the proposal would be highly damaging and would drive business away. That is the only explanation that we arrived at. It achieved further currency when, in Business News of 23 March, a spokesman for the Revenue lamely said that the difference between the authoritative estimates supplied by the accountancy profession and the original Government estimates could be explained by taking into account ``behavioural changes''. Those are other words for the damage caused by the proposals. If multinational companies thinking of locating into the United Kingdom do not do so, if companies that are based here migrate to other jurisdictions or if companies paying dividends in this country decide to pay them out of UK earnings for which they have to borrow money in the United Kingdom, thus depressing their profits and their corporation tax yield, one can perhaps justify the lower Government figures.

<P>
However, do the Government really intend to encourage multinational companies that are based here not to remit profits to the United Kingdom, but to keep them in other countries? Surely they are worried about the current deficit, which is only made tolerable by the fact that huge remittances flow into this country from abroad. That the very damage that was created validated the figures in some way could be the clue for which we were searching. We have no way in which to judge that, however, because we have never seen any justification for or heard any explanation of the figures.

<P>
The Paymaster General claimed earlier today that the only objection to the proposals came from tax planners and companies engaged in tax planning. That is a bit rich.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's assertion is incorrect. I did not say that only tax planners had complained about schedule 30. When he checks the record, he will see that he was incorrect. We all know that several sectors have complained.
<P>

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That issue arose from a debate that we had this morning, in which I referred to Hansard. The Chief Secretary was asked who welcomed the proposals, and he said that they were generally welcomed, but the only group who welcomed them that he could come up with were Labour Back Benchers. We are all anxious to know who welcomed the proposals and who opposed them.

<P>
The clear implication is that because the purpose of the proposals is to deal with abuses, the only people who have an interest in seeing the present regime continue are those who avoid tax to an unacceptable degree. Even if that is only an implication, it is a bit rich from a Government who now request companies to engage in tax planning abroad. Paragraph 6 of schedule 30 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amount of credit for foreign tax which  is to be allowed  shall not exceed the credit which would be allowed had all reasonable steps been taken  to minimise the amount of tax payable in that territory.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So British companies are being not only encouraged, but required, to try to avoid tax abroad. Yet in this country, the same companies are castigated for doing what the Bill asks them to do abroad. The Government have not got into an Alice in Wonderland situation.

<P>
The criticisms came thick and fast. In its Budget submission, the CBI
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>suggests that the Government withdraws the relevant provisions from the Bill so that they can be taken to separate consultation free from the timetable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Garnier, the chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, one of the companies concerned, criticised the proposals. He should know, as the head of a multinational company engaged in a merger who is carefully considering the advantages of remaining here or being tempted abroad. The world is full of other countries that are daily making a pitch for such international investment.

<P>
So it was that the Financial Times, a Labour-supporting paper-[Laughter] Well, it may not be, but I think that there is still one Labour-supporting paper in the country. The paper may have gone off the Government now, but from a standpoint of general support for some items in the Budget, its leader on 2 May said that the double taxation proposals would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make Britain a less attractive location for multinationals the government has created a climate of uncertainty. Despite talk of consultation and consensus, this is not the first time that it has rushed through a tax change which has significant implications  The Treasury has thus far dug in its heels  This is a mistake. The implementation of this proposal should at least be deferred until the full implications are understood.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
At that point, the Government compounded their ignorance with a high degree of arrogance and refused to budge. However, the wheels were beginning to come off the chariot. The initial bravado was giving way to the realisation that the Government had taken on something that they did not understand, and that their critics knew a great deal more about the issue than they did.

<P>
On 3 May, the Government issued a press release in which they said that they were deferring the start of the proposals from July until 31 March 2001, giving them another nine months to try to get it right. They could not resist ending the press release by asserting, without giving any evidence, that their proposals would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enhance the attractiveness of the UK as a location for holding companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement is so comically at variance with the facts that one wondered who was drafting those press releases and under whose instruction.

<P>
A further climbdown now faces the Committee. We spent some time this morning discussing it. According to press reports, which are not always accurate, the pressure for the climbdown comes not from No. 11 Downing street, but from No. 10. It is bad enough for a Prime Minister to be handbagged by the Womens Institute, but to be simultaneously attacked by the massed ranks of British business is to be in serious trouble. All the waffly, windy rhetoric about partnership and being pro-business disintegrates when one persists with a set of proposals that are beyond dispute damaging to Britain as an international centre.

<P>
These are tricky and complex matters. The taxation of international companies and international cash flows is a matter of considerable complexity, but the Government should have thought about that already. They consulted for two years on this and then picked the wrong solution, which did not form part of that consultation. All that the Government can come up with now is to say that their estimates for the revenue that they will recover are still the same, because, although they have gone off some of the original proposals, they have discovered a whole lot more avoidance. Why did they not tackle that avoidance rather than blundering ahead with an ill-considered and blunt instrument that has fallen apart in their hands?

<P>
I end with an appeal that is intended in a constructive spirit. The Government should stand back from this for a little bit longer and talk to the people concerned. They should try to establish the facts and then come forward with a package of proposals that a Committee of the whole House, or the House itself, can consider in good time. I have no more faith in this long and complicated press release that the Government have put out, than I did in the original proposals. They got it wrong then and they may have got it wrong again. All that we know is that if they have got it wrong, they are the last people to admit it. That is an extremely bad atmosphere in which to legislate for the health of the British economy and for all those who seek to do business in this country.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I should perhaps begin by declaring an interest, given the Paymaster General's admonitions this morning, although I am not sure that I have any.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Just in jest, I should point out that as the hon. Gentleman has so many interests, it is always safer for him to declare one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is precisely my view. May I also express some sympathy for the Paymaster General who, in her heart, knows that this is a tricky patch to defend? She seems to have been dropped in it by her Treasury advisers. I know what my attitude towards them would be if I were in her position.

<P>
When we first discovered the foolish initial proposals hidden in the odd throwaway line about reforming double taxation in the Budget speech, our first line of attack, which in retrospect was perhaps not the right one, was, ``Aha, here is yet another stealth tax-indeed a mother of a stealth tax''. There is little doubt about that, given that all the leading accounting firms have calculated that, if nothing else happened, the yield could be £2 billion to £3 billion, notwithstanding the Government's figures. However, that is not the real attack. If the proposals were not changed, no doubt within five years the effect on tax revenues would be severely negative, as a result not so much of companies reorganising their affairs but of the secondary and tertiary loss of tax revenues as multinationals move overseas, new multinationals fail to come to this country and old multinationals gradually reduce in size and importance.

<P>
When I sat back, I thought to myself, ``If I were the commercial enemy of this country, and I wished to undermine the improvement in the state of our economy over the past 15-odd years, the two things that I would go for, which are inter-related, are the tremendous recovery of the City of London in its international earning capacity, and, closely related to that, the location of multinationals in this country.'' My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) alluded to most of the benefits thereof, but I want to wax a little more lyrical.

<P>
The City and multinationals interact, in that if a multinational is headquartered here, UK accountants, lawyers and investment banks receive enormous fees for organising its international activities. The benefit is the associated knock-on employment. How does this country now pay for its imports? The extent to which invisibles have become almost the major export of this country has become apparent in the past decade.

<P>
Without the international earners of the City of London and multinationals being located here, our economy would not be very viable. I cannot believe that the proposals were designed simply to weaken sterling, which some might, cynically, have said. The crucial attack on the proposals is that they are traitorous and undermine the basis of the prosperity of this nation. I find it extraordinary that a Government could tolerate their advisers suggesting such proposals. My sympathies are with the Paymaster General for having to apologise for the proposals.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): The hon. Gentleman has just said that the proposals are traitorous and the fault of bad advisers. Is he suggesting that advisers in the Treasury are committing treason?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Would I ever say any such thing? The key attack on proposals that are so self-evidently against the economic interests of every citizen in this nation and are most extraordinary is a bigger attack than the mother of all stealth taxes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend read the report on the issue in the Financial Times, which reported one of the many business leaders involved in the Treasury as saying of Treasury officials:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>They seem not to have grasped that we live in a global economic environment, and that companies can choose where they base themselves.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Indeed they can choose, and, as anyone who is an Schumpeterian economist, as everyone should be nowadays, will know, large multinationals roll over. The giants of yesterday are gone, and the giants of tomorrow are on their way up. The argument that many of today's multinationals were locked in by capital gains tax liabilities is bogus, because it is the multinationals of tomorrow that are crucial. If the UK were to shift dramatically from being the second most attractive location, after Holland, to being the least attractive location of all the developed economies, no new businesses would come here.

<P>
I want to broaden the point slightly. I have always felt that the Paymaster General paid little more than lip service to all this stuff about unfair tax competition, but it is crucial that this country remains competitive in its tax regime for multinationals and the regulatory environment for the City of London.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As I argued previously, the Wilson Labour Government introduced the measures that made London tax-attractive, enabled the eurodollar market to take off and London to recover its role of the late 19th century. Without that, it would still be what it was in 1970-a feeble and overblown financial capital too big for its domestic economy and having lost its international role. It has all come back over the past 30 years, but it is a delicate flower and multinationals can move to other centres if they want to do business elsewhere and the rules are more attractive.

<P>
May I step back a little because my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset also raised important issues about paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8, as well as the big issue of paragraph 10? I hope that the Government will take heed of two points. First, the nature of long-term investment overseas means that proposals that amount to retrospective taxation or a changing of the rules for a 10-year investment are highly questionable. Secondly, the most effective way for this country to help developing nations is through the capital investment of British multinationals-setting up operations in those economies and meeting crucial infrastructure needs. There should be some tax incentives to do so in developing economies. I regard that as a positive approach and a better way than others of using taxpayers' money to help the developing world. Let us not forget the issues raised so lucidly by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells in relation to schedule 30, as well as the main and crucial issue.

<P>
I hope that, although it is unreasonable to think that the Government could, before Report, churn out the changes about which the press were told over the weekend, the Paymaster General will explain to the Committee in everyday language how the Government intend to make the changes. Will they bring up pooling on shore, as we understand from reading the newspapers?

<P>
Will the Government explain their intentions on controlled foreign companies? It is worth recalling that without CFCs, there would have been no Vodafone acquisition of Mannesmann. It is desirable and in the British interest if predominantly British-owned companies are able to compete on a global scale in acquiring businesses whose funds have been built up in part through CFCs. It would be a pity if the Government ended up seeing sense on most of the big issues, but not on some of the ancillary items.

<P>
The point has already been made that the Government have shot themselves in the foot-vis-a-vis businesses, it is not a shot but a cannon through the foot. The erstwhile sitting-at-the-court-of-Saint-Blair CBI is now threatening to use this attack on multinationals to destroy Labour's business credentials at the next general election. The CBI has not said that it will stop doing so even if it gets what it wants in this respect. It is extraordinary that within such a short space of time, the cosy relationship with big business, built up assiduously over three or four years, should have been blown out of the water so dramatically by these proposals. Many of our major successful companies-British Petroleum, Vodafone, Glaxo Wellcome, Zeneca Agrochemicals, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Rio Tinto Zinc are all the types of company that are hit and which, moreover, have the ability to move elsewhere.

<P>
I conclude by asking the Paymaster General, rather than wasting time covering up for the mistakes, please to let us know in simple, clear language how the Government propose to resolve the problems and to say what we can expect on Report when all the technicalities are discussed. I hope that the Government have learned several lessons from the episode, not least the dangers of being blinded by what seem to be brilliant ideas, but not thinking through their real knock-on effects on every citizen in the country. If such measures were enacted, the present posture of the British economy, which depends on services and invisibles, would be undermined.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I apologise for not being in Committee at the beginning of our proceedings. I was detained in a hearing of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, along the Corridor. I was sorry to miss the end of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, which I was listening to attentively this morning.

<P>
We should be fair to the Paymaster General and to Treasury officials and recognise that such matters are highly complex. I have no interest to declare on this occasion, but I worked for 12 years for an international American bank and we used to wrestle long into the night with many of the concepts that we are discussing. I assure the Minister that we did do so not in the context of tax avoidance but in the context of tax fairness.

<P>
Missing from the Government's statements is their philosophy about international taxation. Where is their global view of how we can deal with the fact that whatever we consider is the right rate of taxation-Parliament has decided that that is just more than 30 per cent.-the view in other parts of the world of what is a fair rate of tax varies from between 0 and 10 per cent. to 50 per cent. or more?

<P>
We have taken the view historically that we should allow companies that are based in this country to play the good tax regimes against the bad tax regimes. We are even-handed and interested in British companies ending up with a rate of tax of about 30 per cent. If one country decides to charge 40 per cent. and another country decides to charge 20 per cent., and an equal amount of revenue comes from each country in dividends for a British company, we allow them to equalise the two. If anyone loses tax in that circumstance, it is arguably the country that charges at 20 per cent. One might pause to ask why it preserves the 20 per cent. tax rate, because lower tax rates tend to attract more business, generate a bigger tax base and improve prosperity.

<P>
The Government will, with schedule 30, damage the tax base and drive out business with the result that, however much they consider that they are creating a level playing field, far fewer players will be on it. The inconsistency of their approach can be gauged from paragraph 48 in the explanatory notes, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this way, a company will not be able to obtain a greater amount of credit relief by adopting one structure rather than another.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In the debate on the tonnage tax, Ministers took delight in explaining how the Government were creating alternative structures for shipping companies to choose between. Everyone wants to give the greatest tax advantage to such companies. It seems that the Government think that it is all right for a shipping company to pick and choose what tax regime would give it the best deal, but a multinational company in any other sphere would be committing a heinous crime against the precepts that govern the Government if it did so and it would be struck down. Such companies will be struck down so hard that many companies intend to leave these shores altogether-or were proposing to do so until we saw the first signs of a massive Government U-turn in the past few days.

<P>
However, these are complex subjects. As mere members of the Committee without the Paymaster General's back-up staff, expertise and benefits of consultation to hand, we have to make a judgment. In our debates, we must take a lot on trust. We must judge whether the Government have good intentions, whether they can see their way through and, above all, whether they have done their homework. They have a far greater capacity to do homework than we have. Schedule 30 also alarms me, not only because of the gross inconsistency with the schedule on the shipping industry, but because of the evidence that we have accumulated that the Government have not done their homework.

<P>
I quoted a Financial Times article from 19 June to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. Its headline included the words ``Companies Executives Disappointed by Officials''. That sums up the attitude of British business to the Treasury at the moment. It feels disappointed that the wider ramifications of the Government's proposals have simply not been thought through. The article states that one business man
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>bemoaned the Treasury's pious attitude. ``I have had Calvinistic lectures from Treasury officials,'' he said.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I do not believe that we should personalise the debate, but there are evidently special advisers in the Treasury who carry great weight with the Chancellor. There is a feeling in the business community that that weight has been disproportionate to their expertise and experience. The Treasury personalised the debate by attacking those who criticised its original proposals by calling them ``tax avoidance advisers''. We have remarked that it attacked a certain senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers in a disgraceful way, and totally misinformed the House about him. That suggests that it is on shaky ground.

<P>
The latest evidence comes from our debate this morning and the rush of amendments to the schedule. I especially refer to those to the paragraphs dealing with the insurance industry. I asked the Paymaster General to clarify whether the insurance industry wanted the amendments and new provisions to be passed, and she assured us that it did. When I relayed that comment to the Association of British Insurers, it said that that was a slightly imaginative presentation. I said that the hon. Lady had assured us there there were no revenue implications to approving the group of amendments, and it replied that that interpretation was a cunning answer, because £150 million was at stake over the amendments to which we agreed this morning. We were assured that nothing was at stake on the basis that, if the matter went to court, the Treasury and Inland Revenue would be confident that they would win the case.

<P>
I specifically asked the Paymaster General whether we were dealing with a case of spelling out good practice, and whether general commissioners or the court might decide the case if we did not do so. I was given clearly to understand that we were not pre-empting any decision by a court of law. I now discover that that is precisely what we were asked to do this morning. That was not explained to us, and we were beguiled into believing otherwise. It was no doubt unintentional, but we were definitely misled by the Paymaster General's statements. In the light of that, what confidence do we have that the Government and the Treasury have a clue what they are doing in drafting schedule 30?

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I can draw only on the expertise of those who have written to us. I have had several communications from the CBI. One on the matter of fairness and equity makes a point about the first three paragraphs of the schedule, which are to do with tax sparing. The Revenue's recent policy has been to reduce tax-sparing relief on the basis that companies could be afforded the benefits of mixer companies, as way of mitigating the effects of losing the sparing relief. I understand that a further contradiction in the Government's approach is that the first three paragraphs of the schedule cut down further on the ability of companies to enjoy tax-sparing, at the same time as taking away the mixer relief on which, up to now, the Revenue consistently said that they could continue to rely. That was why the sparing rules were being changed. It is a muddle created by the Treasury team, and a gross inconsistency. It seems that it is nothing more than a crude grab for taxation from companies, on the principle that they will not be able to move fast enough.

<P>
In the past few days, the Treasury has woken up to the fact that companies not only can but will move fast enough to avoid such grossly unfair new rules. Companies that might have come to this country are being driven away by the new attitude that emanates from the Government time and again.

<P>
On paragraph 6, I have little to add to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. They pointed out that is grossly inconsistent to ask companies to do everything that they can to pay tax in this country, even to their disadvantage, but to become active tax avoiders elsewhere. On the wider issue of retrospection, the London chamber of commerce pointed out that a company that submitted its returns before the cut-off date would not be subject to the rules in paragraph 6, whereas a company that submitted its returns for the same accounting period after the cut-off date would be subject to the new test in paragraph 6, if it had done everything possible to reduce its tax liability in the country to which its return related. Therefore, another gross inequity would apply in relation to two companies that trade in the same foreign country, are both based in this country and perhaps make the same profit. The one that fulfils the return requirements before the cut-off date is taxed on one basis, whereas the other is taxed on a completely new basis, which, as has been shown, is in many ways totally arbitrary. The Paymaster General must deal with that matter when she replies to this long and necessary debate.

<P>
Paragraph 8 raises the issue of depreciation. When the Paymaster General deals with that paragraph, will she clarify what provision exists for companies to adopt policies of accelerated depreciation? We have heard of low or no depreciation being allowed on the basis of when assets are bought and sold. How will accelerated depreciation be taken account of in paragraph 8? I refer to accelerated depreciation of not only fixed assets but other assets and, for example, bad debt provisions.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells dealt at length with the flaws and difficulties of paragraph 10. The Opposition continue to be deeply alarmed that, despite the Treasury's latest press release, people in business are wholly unconvinced that it understands the scale of the problem that has been created. The director general of the CBI was quoted in the Financial Times on 17 June. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Business cannot say that it welcomes this-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Government's new press release and U-turn-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>because we do not know the details  The only thing we can welcome is that the Treasury has acknowledged that a mistake was made, and that it is going to put it right.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some experts estimate that companies could still be stuck with an annual tax bill that is £1 billion higher. That is totally at variance with the Treasury estimate that the cost would be merely £300 million a year.

<P>
Moving fast through the schedule, I also want to comment on the points relating to royalties in paragraph 17. As I understand it, the problem may be that companies are being asked to be as harsh as possible on themselves. Under the new regime of self-assessment, it is no longer a case of the Inland Revenue officer knocking on the door and saying, ``We've looked at the amount you're charging in royalties to this connected company in another jurisdiction and we think your charging policy is wrong. You'll have to justify it.'' The company must do that job. It must knock on its own door and examine every royalty agreement. Even when the company feels that it has a fair deal, there is the risk that the Treasury and the Inland Revenue will take a different view. If the court finds that the company's calculation of its royalty charges is, despite its best intentions, wrong, any amount of tax due will be doubled under the new self-assessment provisions.

<P>
The issue goes wider than royalties. Mr. Allan Taylor, the transfer pricing partner at the accountancy firm KPMG, has highlighted the fact that there would be a Revenue fine in such cases, even though the company had, with the best of intentions, gone through all its royalty arrangements to try to ensure that it has made the right charges for royalties at the right time. Mr. Taylor says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It's not always obvious. We're not just talking about goods, but services too, and you have problem areas with Intellectual Property Rights and royalties.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The article in The Times of 15 June concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amount of money involved in the process will mean it could certainly rival the problems emerging from the abolition of double taxation relief.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That paragraph about royalties highlights yet another great elephant trap that the Government have succeeded in constructing for multinational companies in this country.

<P>
We need a clear statement from the Paymaster General, if not now, in the near future, that sets out what the Government believe in when it comes to multinational companies. Do they recognise that by creating a hostile taxation environment, they are doubling the damage being done to business in this country by the hostile new regulations that affect working practices: the working time directive, the social chapter and the minimum wage. All those measures have accumulated to create an environment that is hostile to business. With the rules in the Bill, the Government are making it difficult for companies to be based in this country, even if they operate overseas.

<P>
Conservative Governments had created one of the most competitive environments in Europe and almost anywhere else in the developed world for business to operate. In the past few years, the present Government seem consciously to have been trying to unpick all that effort and its hard-won rewards. Their attidute to schedule 30 so far gives us no confidence that they have learnt lessons from their mistakes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Jack (Fylde) rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the right hon. Member for Fylde, I should point out for the convenience of the Committee that we are expecting votes, so I shall suspend the Committee at 7 o'clock for a quarter of an hour if there is one Division and for half an hour if there are two Divisions. So that hon. Members may reflect on the goals of the Bill, we shall break for dinner from 8 until 
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am most grateful for those important housekeeping announcements. I, too, am sorry that I was not present earlier to hear all that was said. But I deliberately waited to make a contribution on this part of the Bill until I had tuned in to the lines of argument being advanced by my right hon. and hon. Friends.

<P>
The proposal in its original form, and the climbdown that the Government have been forced to make, raise important issues. As they say from the pulpit on a Sunday, I should like to take as my text the Chancellor's Mansion House speech, which was an interesting precursor to a more detailed examination of the contents of the schedule. The Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In today's global economy, no nation can secure the sustainable investment it needs unless its economy is built on the rock of stability.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Treasury almost taunted business people with the consultation about double taxation relief, giving them the impression that they would welcome the measures. Indeed, there are some measures in the schedule, such as carry back and carry forward, that were welcomed. However, after business people had been lulled into a false sense of security and felt that there was some stability in the measures, they were hit by these proposals. It transpired that they were ill thought out, as can be seen from an examination of some of the language used in the Treasury press release to announce them.

<P>
The Chancellor went on to tell his audience about the objective of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>openness, accountability and transparency to keep markets and the public properly informed and to ensure that objectives and institutions are not only credible but seen to be credible.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are dealing with the complete reverse of that: an incredible policy that to business people seemed to have been generated with a low degree of ``openness, accountability and transparency''. It was opaque, because they did not understand why they were being hit.

<P>
One of the things that has distressed those legitimate, proper business people whom I have consulted-the people whom the Chancellor praised in his speech-is that they have been painted by the schedule as nothing more than a bunch of cheap tax avoiders, which they are not. Their objective and their responsibility to their shareholders is to maximise value and to do the best for those who own their companies. They are duty bound to minimise the expenses to their businesses, one of which is the bill called tax. Tax is an expense of operation and only occurs if one makes a taxable profit, although it may be collected for a reason. In the context of international arrangements, companies are similarly obliged to maximise returns. The concept of tax mixing was a legitimate mechanism to help those companies to minimise the bill called tax and maximise their returns to their investors.

<P>
The Government's approach worries me because they do not seem to have fully appreciated that strong United Kingdom balance sheets are good for the British economy as well as for our international investment effort. Unamended, the schedule was a threat to that objective. Yet the Chancellor, in his Mansion House speech, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have some of the greatest companies, some world class sectors, some global champions, many represented here this evening, in whom we do and should take pride, and once again we have record levels of inward investment in our country.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Those self-same people to whom he referred-the Vodafones of this world-are the ones who rebelled at the original proposals. It seems odd to propose a schedule that attacks the businesses of the same people whom he stands up and praises in front of a large business audience after a good dinner. That shows an inconsistency in attitude towards business.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am listening carefully to the right hon. Gentleman. He has just referred to the complaints that Vodafone made. Its complaints were against the CFC proposal, not the mixing proposals, which we are not currently considering. I shall be more than happy to debate the CFC stuff with him when we get to that schedule, as I know that he has extensive experience of tightening up those regulations.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Indeed, but we could cite other companies if the Paymaster General objects to Vodafone. My right hon. and hon. Friends have listed others, but let us refresh her memory: BP Amoco, Glaxo Wellcome, Astra Zeneca, HSBC and so on are listed in a letter to the Financial Times on 16 June. Vodafone's name happened to be in there. I am glad that the hon. Lady has gone into Vodafone's tax details with such care that she can put aside taxpayer confidentiality and tell us that in her judgment Vodafone is not affected by this. Its name was closely associated with this measure; I do not want to stray unnecessarily into the next area, but the two are inextricably linked, as we shall see.

<P>
Towards the end of the Chancellor's Mansion House speech, there is a gem of a sentence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we are determined to build on our lower corporate tax rates and the interest relief we give on investment overseas and make Britain an increasingly attractive environment for multinational companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that not just wonderful? Those who understand how companies have responded to earlier changes in the corporate tax structure in this country will know that that sentence is like a red rag to a bull. The Chancellor tells corporate enterprises that seek to invest in the United Kingdom, ``Come here and we will relieve you of the interest payments that you make in investing in the UK'', but when British companies affected by schedule 30 sought to use debt and equity mechanisms and incurred interest charges abroad, they suddenly found that they would not be treated fairly under these proposals. There appears to be some schizophrenia in the way in which the Chancellor wanted to treat British companies who wanted to invest abroad and ultimately bring moneys back to the United Kingdom and international companies who wanted to invest in the UK.

<P>
The final quote that I wish to make from the Mansion House speech is this:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We know that the extent of competition at home is the key to competitiveness abroad. We know that open not closed economies are the driving force in productivity growth.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That expression has been mentioned many times in our discussions so far. If one is to have an open approach to international investment, one must accept that companies will use mechanisms to try to minimise their tax bill and maximise their investment returns. In a way, that is a proper thing to do.

<P>
Companies operate in many different tax regimes and they seek to manoeuvre their assets in such a way as to give good returns to their shareholders. They do that because the world is a very competitive place. Having talked to companies that have been involved in the use of mixer companies, one understands clearly that they need to use this type of mechanism to minimise their ultimate tax bill and maximise their investment return because they are in competition with people who use similar mechanisms. If they do not do that, they will be competitively disadvantaged. That is the message from legitimate British business.

<P>
In his Mansion House speech, the Chancellor used the language that I have quoted-I have deliberately tried not to be too selective in the quotes that I have put on the record-so one wonders what motive was behind the proposal. As far as we know, it has sparked the outrage of much of British business. It achieves the opposite result to that which the Chancellor spells out.

<P>
When we examine how we reached the current position, we can imagine how the story must have gone. The changes to the advance corporation tax regime increased United Kingdom companies' tax bills. Those bills also increased as a result of other corporation tax changes. Finance directors therefore examined ways of mitigating that circumstance. In the context of mixer companies, they found ways of mitigating some of the effects of the tax increases that the Government imposed on British business, through changes in investment strategies, overseas equity placements, exchanges of debt for equity and other legitimate manipulations of company capital structures.

<P>
I suspect that when it became apparent to the Inland Revenue that such mechanisms were being deployed, it was concerned about the UK's tax base. When politically motivated people in the Treasury became interested in that for the wrong reasons, conversations must have taken place. If such events as I have described occurred, it is only because the Government caused them to occur by raising the tax burden on UK business. That shows a lack of appreciation for the fact that action on one aspect of corporate taxation brings a reaction in another.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford and other hon. Friends asked for a further delay because the Government have not yet made it known why they think that people need mixer companies. Why do we have to debate schedule 30? Why do people try to avoid paying their just desserts in UK tax, as the Treasury sees it? Does that say something about the tax regime that business faces in the UK? I think that it does. I will not debate that at length, but it is important that before the Treasury ultimately takes action, it should be more open and thereby build confidence. The Chancellor said that in his Mansion House speech. The Treasury should let us in on the secret of why it thinks that people use such mechanisms. It comes down to what is good or bad.

<P>
I notice in the press release to which right hon. and hon. Members have referred that the Government talk about indentifying genuine business activity in their revised proposals. When we debated the operation of companies controlled by up to five trustees last week, we asked for a motive test to distinguish genuine and non-genuine business activity. We were told that that could not be done. Now, in paragraph 21 of the Treasury's press release, we discover that it can be done. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Additional tax will only be payable where UK tax avoidance is a main motive for the existence of a CFC or for the transactions of a CFC. Multinationals that are not involved in UK tax avoidance will have no additional tax to pay.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is remarkable how, in a few short days and to suit the convenience of their cause, the Government have managed to identify in the context of these proposals something that they were unable to identify last week. That is a further example of their lack of attention to detail.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford, at the conclusion of his sage remarks, queried whether the Government had thought things through carefully, as many of my hon. Friends did. I would be the first to sympathise with the Paymaster General, as the Treasury is sometimes wrong in its drafting of Finance Bills. I was on the receiving end of justifiable criticism when legislation on the gilt repo market was introduced. I had to put on sackcloth and ashes and admit that the attempt to run a consultation exercise in parallel with the passage of a Finance Bill illustrated what could go wrong and appeared to be a sure-fire route to disaster. The Paymaster General will remember her undoubted glee in putting the boot, knife, knee and anything else that she could into the groin-

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Never.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Perhaps I shall accept that. We had those proverbial problems to cope with because a piece of legislation had been drafted too quickly without consultation with practitioners. Had it not been for their advice, that legislation would not have been improved. As the Paymaster General will no doubt attest, she had to return to make further adjustments on the subject, because it was complex and involved practicalities and details. Those are precisely the characteristics involved in the proposals.

<P>
What intrigues me is the Government's language in its climbdown. Paragraph 4 of the press release on the matter contains a sentence of a specific measure, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, that would work inappropriately with some existing agreements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is tentative, with no full description of what is meant by ``inappropriately''. It goes on with some more Delphic phrasing. Paragraph 10 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Inland Revenue will consult people who have asked for this relaxation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who are these people? I would love to know. Paragraph 13 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It was suggested in representations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that much was suggested; I think that the words, ``You have got it wrong,'' were broadcast at the Government as full multi-media stereophonic messages through megaphones. One could go on.

<P>
The words may be to save face but, as my right hon. and hon. Friends have suggested, they do not fill us with confidence at this juncture that the proposals have been properly thought through in the full context of the Government's attitude towards corporate taxation in this country.

<P>
I sympathise with the Paymaster General because what I will say will replicate my earlier points on tax avoidance. We all know that, on some of the arrangements that perhaps motivated moves on the schedule, there were attempts to use overseas tax mechanisms to avoid the payment of legitimate tax by people who were not really involved in proper business activities. All the companies that have protested to me are legitimate, and some are the creme de la creme of British business. Some have loudly cried, ``Offside,'' as others may this evening. It is right that the Committee, in acting as a referee, should attempt to stop play and allow both sides to consider the position carefully. In a rush to try to craft new legislation, we may irreparably damage the prospects of some of the best international business companies in our country.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This has been a long and extensive schedule stand part debate, and I should like to respond to hon. Gentlemen's points.

<P>
Opposition Members may be familiar with a joint statement by the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the British Chamber of Commerce and the British Bankers Association, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Professional men experienced in the field of taxation cannot recall any proposal in the past which was so universally and powerfully condemned  by the whole of British industry and commerce. The Government should think again before it is too late.-[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 14 June 1984; c. 1118.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That appeared in Hansard in June 1984 and the statement was directed to the then Conservative Government on the eve of Committee debates on changes to CFC legislation. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs waxed lyrical about the City. It falls within his 12 years. The Government's task is to separate from all the protests any true issues of substance.

<P>
I, as a Treasury Minister, have met some of the companies referred to in Committee and the Chancellor or his officials have met others. It is difficult to marry up what they say in private with the collective quotes that are projected back to us through various newspapers. We were in opposition for a long time and I know that Oppositions often fan the flames of every little point, narrowing down the debate in order to advance their particular interests. I make no complaint about that because we did so for a long time.

<P>
I want to start with the review of double taxation relief and the argument that the changes will drive companies abroad and discourage others from coming here. I disagree with that proposition because we need to evaluate it in the round, not just with respect to concerns about mixer companies. The Bill's provisions on double taxation contain much that companies and businesses asked for and will increase UK competitiveness. Provisions already exist to stop relief for foreign tax being lost when overseas companies merge. Businesses told us that that was the single most important item that they wanted in the Bill and that it would be enormously beneficial to companies acquiring business overseas.

<P>
For the first time ever in the United Kingdom, provisions will be made for unrelieved foreign tax to carry backwards and forwards for use in another year. Again, businesses have long asked for that to be a feature of the UK's double taxation relief system, especially for help with timing problems when the same profits are taxed overseas and in the UK during different periods. Double taxation relief is only one consideration-and Opposition Members will be aware of it-that companies take into account when deciding where to set up their business.

<P>
The Budget contains a range of measures to enhance UK competitiveness, including, for instance, extension of the group relief rules; abolition of stamp duty on sales of intellectual property; abolition of withholding tax on international bonds; consultation on introducing tax relief for the costs of purchasing good will-for which businesses have been asking and lobbying for a long time-and consultation on the introduction of rollover relief on disposals of substantial shareholding by companies.


<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) quoted my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's Mansion House speech, which my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who was present-alas, I could not attend-said was extremely well received. Those are precisely the matters to which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor pointed. Moreover, those proposals are being implemented against a background of business-friendly measures that we introduced in previous Budgets and that have made the UK an excellent place in which and from which to do business. Those measures include the abolition of advance corporation tax and major reductions in corporation tax rates. We now have the lowest corporation tax ever and the lowest among industrialised countries.

<P>
I shall respond to the point that the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) made, but he needs to square with his comments how a low-tax regime can still experience the difficulties that we are experiencing with some elements of double taxation relief. People who invest in United Kingdom companies, including UK companies that have business overseas, will benefit from the low UK tax rate and the absence of withholding tax.

<P>
There are other, wider, economic, commercial, legal and cultural reasons why the UK is an excellent place in which and from which do do business, including the fact that we have the largest network of tax treaties of any country in the world. Although hon. Members want to debate hotly the question of mixer companies, I am sure that no member of the Committee would talk Britain down and fail to recognise the extensive changes being made in several areas that together make the UK highly competitive internationally and a desirable place in which to do business.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I speak as, possibly, one of the few members of the Committee who has worked in the management of a foreign multinational company. When I raised the question of investment in Britain under the previous Government, it was suggested that the primary criterion involved was not tax, wages or the social charter but the level of business-friendliness, including good education and transport, which was felt to be sorely missing under the previous Government. Does my hon. Friend agree that our tax policy is part of an overall package that we offer overseas companies and should not be seen in a mechanistic way that suggests that every company simply considers the tax rate and says, ``Right, we'll move over there.''

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sure that Opposition Members will not be surprised to hear me say that that is exactly the point that I am making about the wider issues involved, for both business and companies locating here.

<P>
I turn first to matching credit for tax spared. I appreciate that the hon. Member for West Dorset was careful in advancing many of his points and in asking for clarification and explanation of how we were proceeding. I shall do my best to respond in that vein, as it is a helpful and conducive way for the Committee to proceed.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me to comment on matching credit. It was first granted in double taxation treaties in the 1960s. The policy of this and the previous Government had been to renegotiate existing treaties to remove such provisions that have served their original purpose. Matching credit positions are included in new tax treaties only in carefully selected cases in which the overall balance of the treaty is satisfactory and the subject is strictly limited. I set out that policy on 29 October 1997 in the First Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, during a debate on treaties with Malaysia, Singapore, the Falkland Islands and Lesotho. Apparently, it repeats almost word for word the policy of the previous Conservative Government-there go my credentials-which was outlined by the right hon. Member for Fylde in the same Standing Committee on 12 November 1996, during a debate on new treaties with China and Korea. This is a long-heralded approach.

<P>
I point out to the hon. Member for West Dorset that the OECD published a report in 1998 entitled ``Tax sparing: a reconsideration'', which detected a change in the attitude towards tax sparing amongst countries, and showed that tax sparing was vulnerable to taxpayer abuse. It may no longer be an appropriate tool to promote economic development.


<P>
Clearly, allowing relief for tax that no one has paid is out of the ordinary, even for a Conservative Government. It is done only in very particular circumstances-under the express terms of a double taxation agreement. Moreover, a developmental element has to underlie the country's tax sparing measures. The provision will usually feature only in our agreements with developing countries. We agree to give relief to encourage UK companies to invest in developing countries. The double taxation agreement envisages that the UK will give tax relief that no one has paid only if a UK company invests directly in developing countries.


<P>
So far so good; but now we reach the heart of the review of the double taxation relief arrangements. Some people might think that companies that received relief for tax that they had not paid would already consider themselves to be well treated by the tax system. Unfortunately, for some companies that is not enough. They said, ``Look, the tax that we have not paid exceeds the amount of tax that we would have been charged in the UK anyway. Let's find a scheme that will let us set some of the tax that we have not paid against UK tax that is payable on other income that we have not paid any tax on, either.'' Having not paid tax and been given relief, they wanted to find a way to increase the benefit. They do not invest directly in the developing country-they get one of their subsidiaries, which may be in a tax haven, to do so. They still expect relief for tax that they have not paid although a UK company gets a dividend from a tax haven company.

<P>
It is worth going through that again to emphasise the situation to those who are not familiar with international tax planning-they may find this matter surprising. A company that has not paid any tax on a particular source of income can seek to use the special relief to reduce the tax that would be due on unrelated other income. It does so by investing in a developing country not from the UK but from somewhere else entirely-it uses an intermediary company.

<P>
The Government think that that is not playing ball. We do not think that that was the intention behind the arrangements. A provision in the schedule will curb some aspects of the arrangement. The provisions limit the relief for tax spared to income that is paid directly to the UK from a company sparing tax. That is, after all, what the present and previous Governments signed up to in the double taxation agreements. The Revenue has for some time been advising companies that the legitimacy of such schemes was unclear and that the issue was under review, so we have decided to act.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
While I am quoting different people who agree or disagree with us, I should say that one question that I have been asked is why companies were not warned of the change. Companies were well aware for many years that the matter was under review, as the Chartered Institute of Taxation acknowledged in a letter to the Revenue on 19 April.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I listened with great interest to the Paymaster General's explanation of this wrinkle in the tax system. So that we can get it into perspective, can she say what proportion of the £300 million that the Treasury now estimates will be garnered as a result of the schedule relates to this tax-sparing issue?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am afraid that I do not have the precise figure, but the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues asked whether tax-sparing measures were reasonable, and whether they would undercut assistance to developing countries. The response in the representations made during the consultation period was entirely proportionate and uncontentious, and explicitly represented this and the previous Government's policy in this regard.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am a little concerned that the Paymaster General seems to have no idea of what the fiscal impact of the tax-sparing changes will be. While some international companies may have taken grossly unfair advantage of the measure, it may have given others an incentive to invest in developing countries. It is disconcerting that she has no idea what proportion of the £300 million will be as a result of the change, or what the potential impact will be on investment in developing countries, which we clearly want to develop and become more prosperous. If she cannot enlighten us tonight, will she give us an assurance that she will be able to do so before too long?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Is he saying that he wants the present tax-sparing arrangements to continue, which were of no support or help to the developing country but led to additional relief being claimed? Did he not hear me say that the present and previous Governments, under expressed conditions, have continued to allow these arrangements or that it was not a contentious issue with business during our consultation on these elements of the double taxation relief?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not giving way to the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps he will let me finish my point. He is quick to bob up and down. [
Interruption.] With respect, if he had been present for more of our discussions on the Bill, he would have seen that all the Ministers have given way when hon. Members have raised queries. His specific point on the proportion of the £300 million for the double taxation relief relates to a much broader issue. As he does not have the figure, does he want to see these measures continued?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am confused about how to deal with the Paymaster General. She asks me a series of questions yet object when I try to answer them.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have not finished asking them-that is why.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I listened carefully to everything that the Paymaster General said. I have said that before. I have no problem-I do not think that anybody else has either-with closing abuses of the international tax system. We are all concerned about them. Nevertheless, when doing so, it is customary to inform the Committee what the fiscal effect will be of the proposed changes, so that we can adduce from that the importance in money terms of what the Paymaster General is spending a great deal of time explaining to us as a proportion of the total in the schedule, which we have debated at some length.

<P>
I am also interested to know what the amount is, because it might have an impact on developing countries. I am not saying that it is one for one, but it would be helpful for those countries to know, in drawing up their plans, what the Government think the impact of the change will be.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I noticed that the hon. Gentleman did not want to answer my questions about whether he thought that the arrangements to use the tax sparing for other reasons should be allowed to continue.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I did.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> But I would say to the hon. Gentleman-

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way on that point? I urge her to listen more carefully to what is said in the Committee.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. He is ever helpful.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the impact on future investment in developing countries. There is no reason why such investment should not be made directly from the UK, as our double taxation treaties envisage and allow. Therefore, there would be no impact on investment if it came direct from the UK. I presume that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we should not allow such creative use of the double taxation treaties for unconnected purposes.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset-

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that the Paymaster General will accept that Hansard will show that I specifically stated that we see the reason for closing this to future investment. The question relates to retrospectivity. She said, helpfully, that companies had been warned, and I accept that, from the date on which they were warned that it would be reasonable to make a change. When were they first explicitly warned that such changes might come about, and does she accept that it would be reasonable not to apply the provision to investments made before that date?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked when companies were warned that this was not how we expected the arrangements to be used. It is no use looking at these notes: they are blank. That reminds me of a famous story that was told once by a Minister who was answering questions. The paper that came from the box said, ``Well, I don't know. You can get on with it.'' Just to show that our Treasury officials are completely impartial, I could not possibly comment. I have never had such a note. [
Interruption.] Yes, there is plenty of time.

<P>
The warnings have existed for more than three years. We can see how the arrangements that I have described would legitimately have been of benefit to the developing country or would have come within the letter and spirit of the arrangements provided for in the double taxation arrangments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I believe that the Paymaster General's last remark is wrong. I repeat that I understand the reason for doing it in the future. I can well accept that if warning was clearly given three years ago-I am grateful to her for mentioning the time period-investments from then should be, so to speak, retrospectively disqualified. That is to say that they should be disqualified in the future, but in relation to investments made three years ago or beyond.

<P>
As for investments made before that, it is clear that, according to the letter of the law, such an arrangement was not improper-nor was a warning given that it was. Had it been improper, it would have been made so by statute and, had the measure been in statute, there would be no need for the provision. It is surely the case that such people were engaged in legitimate tax planning, however contrary to the spirit of the arrangement. They would have calculated their internal rate of return on that basis and it would be wrong for the Government retrospectively to clobber those people. I urge the Paymaster General to reconsider whether she ought not to be applying the provision to companies in that position.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I note what the hon. Gentleman said, but I am not persuaded to allow those who are using the arrangement to be grandfathered, so that they continue to do so. We cannot possibly agree to that, given the type of arrangements that are being made, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree is not how they were supposed to be made. Investment directly from the UK will not be affected by the arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I have a genuine inquiry. Many infrastructure projects in developing economies involve consortiums, which usually have to put themselves together with intermediate companies. Am I wrong or right in believing that, when a consortium is involved, it can still qualify for tax sparing or will it be bowled out of the water on the issue that the Treasury is trying to stop?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We must establish that the investment is a direct investment from the UK and that it is legitimately within the arrangements made under that particular double taxation agreement. Therefore, it is a matter of direct investment and control from the UK. We are preventing the offshore company from doing something different to achieve reliefs without it being legitimate for it to achieve such reliefs.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to paragraph 6 on the minimisation of foreign tax. I was intrigued-indeed, captivated-by his suggestion that the wicked Government were forcing those poor companies to employ tax planners when they were not doing it anyway. He implied that somehow we were shifting the onus and pressure on companies to minimise their tax. The hon. Gentleman and several other Opposition Members suggested that that was a charter to encourage companies to avoid tax in other countries.

<P>
We want to take reasonable steps to minimise the amount of tax that is payable. The provision is another case of setting out in statute what has generally been understood to be the practice. We know from previous provisions that companies are clear in their minds that they want set out in statute what is generally understood practice and then sometimes on a second, third or fourth bite at it, may like to tinker to see whether they can obtain further improvement. I described such a position earlier as getting a mile and then starving for a few more inches.

<P>
The rules amount to credit being given in the UK for no more foreign tax than the taxpayer is required to pay.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>7.17 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was referring to paragraph 6, which is about the minimisation of foreign tax. The only alternative rule would be that the United Kingdom should give up its tax even if the foreign tax were not properly due. Some taxpayers may not be concerned-unlike the Governments involved-about where they pay their taxes. If they are to suffer tax, they may be content to leave it with whichever authority gets its demand in first. They will not bother to seek repayment of foreign tax if, in the end, they will have to pay the equivalent sum to the UK. The measures are intended to ensure that the right tax is paid in the right place, not to allow people to squeeze any more tax relief out of the system.

<P>
Similarly, there would be little incentive for taxpayers to ensure that they received all the reliefs that the foreign tax system provided, it if made no difference to their overall tax bill. As spokesman from both sides have said, the trouble with such a situation is that the rest of UK taxpayers would have to make up the difference for taxpayers who cannot be bothered to put in claims to their just entitlement from other countries. Therefore, we are talking not about pursuing people through tax systems but about ensuring that they have their just entitlement in the countries concerned. The position is even worse when the relief in the other country is available because the United Kingdom, under the previous as well as the current Government, painstakingly persuaded the country to agree to a double taxation agreement. What would be the point of negotiating 100 agreements if we allowed taxpayers not to bother to claim the reliefs to which they are entitled in the expectation that other taxpayers will pick up the tab in the United Kingdom? If taxpayers did not receive credit for the foreign tax in the United Kingdom, they would naturally do what they could to ensure that they received all their entitlements and paid the correct amount of tax elsewhere. The provision is concerned not with more tax or less tax in foreign jurisdictions, but with access to the reliefs that have been negotiated through double taxation treaties.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about reasonable steps. Subsection (3) of the new section refers to what a taxpayer might reasonably be expected to have done if he had not been able to obtain credit for the tax in the United Kingdom. In such cases, the taxpayer might have tried to keep his foreign tax bill down, having regard to the amount of time, effort and expense involved in discussing his case with the foreign tax authorities on the one hand and the amount of the expected reduction on the other. Taxpayers will have to bear the provision in mind when they claim relief for foreign tax on their self-assessment returns.

<P>
The Revenue will issue guidance on how the paragraph will apply. That will be published in a tax bulletin and will include material in the double taxation relief manual. The Revenue has already stated in a paper published on Budget day that examples of situations in which the provision would apply include acceptance of an estimated tax assessment in another country that is likely to be excessive, not claiming an allowance or relief that is generally known to be available, or when a country's domestic law or the relevant tax treaty provides an alternative basis of taxation and one does not choose the basis that would produce the lowest tax burden.

<P>
Examples of situations in which the provision would not apply include not claiming a relief, the availability of which is uncertain, when disproportionate expenditure would have to be incurred in researching the other country's laws to pursue the claim-that covers the points made by the hon. Gentleman-claiming that a loss incurred in another country should be carried forwards and not backwards or vice versa, and the case of underlying tax paid by a subsidiary company when the United Kingdom company, which claims the relief for that tax, is not in a position to influence the amount of tax paid. The Revenue has stated that it would be happy to consider similar situations in which it is thought that the provision should not apply. We are trying to ensure that companies have access to the reliefs that we have negotiated on their behalf, but some situations will need further consideration.

<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford asked about the start date in paragraph 6. The start date for any provision affects different companies at different times. The start date in paragraph 6 will help companies to complete their self-assessment tax returns by the earliest possible date, but the Revenue has asked businesses and accountancy firms whether any companies have fallen on the wrong side of the start date. So far, we have received no response to that and no suggestion that any companies have been affected. We have done our best to find out whether any problems arise from the arbitrary nature of the start date and how they can be dealt with, and none has been presented to us. If any subsequently are, for instance following scrutiny of today's debate, we shall consider them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> What the Paymaster General has said is helpful. The guidance may qualify the words ``all reasonable steps'' in such a way as to remove the problems to which I was alluding. Will she reassure us on this matter by undertaking to distribute draft copies of the guidance to members of the Committee, when it is available, so that we or others can make representations if we do not consider that it fully handles the point?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I see no problem with that request. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman exactly when that will be, but I am happy to do that. It would be unreasonable not to.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Clearly, the start date could be by reference to the accounting period and not to the time when the claim for a tax credit was entered. I raise the matter because it was raised by the London chambers of commerce, which believe that, if they are not consulted by the Treasury, there will be a problem. Once the Bill completes its Committee stage and goes to Report, it may be too late to do anything about it. Companies may be treated differently for the same accounting period in the past, unless sub-paragraph (2) is carefully worded.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those points. In the Government's defence, this part of the double taxation relief was not challenged in respect of whether it was properly consulted on. We refute the arguments on consultation. I shall not go through them again, but I note the hon. Gentleman's points.

<P>
I want to refer briefly to paragraph 8 before I turn finally to paragraph 10, which I think is the paragraph that causes greatest concern to the Committee, as it will to hon. Members on the Floor of the House.

<P>
The provision again meets the request from business to introduce a statutory framework for measuring the amount of foreign tax that should be attributed to a dividend paid by a foreign company to a UK company. The rules set out in paragraph 8 reflect the present system, which the majority of claimants would accept, and put it into a statutory framework. Companies have rightly taken the opportunity provided by the Revenue's review of double taxation to have the system put on a sound statutory footing. That was a particular priority in view of the introduction of self-assessment for companies.

<P>
The system has always relied on identifying a pool of profits that the foreign company has available for distribution. If it pays all those profits as a dividend to the UK, the UK company will be able to claim relief for all the foreign tax paid on those profits. If say, only half the profits are paid as a dividend, only half the foreign tax will be available for relief. [
Interruption.] I am sorry, Dr. Clark, I have been somewhat distracted, so that was a little disjointed.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If you are distracted, Ms Primarolo, we shall leave this conversation until we have the break at 8 o'clock. You were quite right to make that comment.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sorry, Dr. Clark. I do not mean to be precious or difficult with the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs-I like him very much and feel that I have got to know him-although it must be time for him to go and have a cigarette. Breaks from the Committee are of great value to the hon. Gentleman. He is probably the only hon. Member I know who can smoke two cigarettes at the same time-one in his mouth and one in his ear, but perhaps I should not give away any our private secrets. It has already been a long day and I apologise, Dr. Clark, if my concentration is drifting slightly. I shall return to the points that the hon. Gentleman raised.

<P>
Many foreign subsidiary companies distribute all their profits in one go, and have few problems in calculating and obtaining relief for the tax that they have paid. Others distribute their profits in a more piecemeal fashion, and over several years, and the calculations can become complex. That is why the Revenue has for many years had a specialist unit, the sole function of which is to deal with those claims. Similarly, most of the claimant companies have their own in-house specialists, with whom we have been in negotiations and discussions in relation to this part of the schedule. The number of companies claiming this type of relief is around 1,000. It is seen by companies and the Revenue as a highly specialist subject. There is frequent contact between companies and the Revenue, and many companies ask the Revenue to agree or comment on their computation before submitting a formal claim, which it is happy to do.

<P>
<H5>7.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Difficulty can arise when a group does not wish to bring all the available profits to the UK, but nevertheless seeks to get credit for all the foreign tax paid on those profits. They may claim that the directors of the company have decided that, say, half the profits cannot be distributed. The provisions make it clear that such discretionary allocation of profits will not alter the amount of relief that is due in the UK. We will not allow companies to write their own tax bills.

<P>
There is no evidence that those who are involved in the specialist field have any problems. The Revenue specialists are, as before, communicating directly with their specialist counterparts in business, and are, as before, solving any difficulties that arise. I assure Committee members that deep discussions and exchanges of information take place in relation to these matters.

<P>
The Revenue have reported an upsurge in first-time callers from professional firms asking to be talked through the whole system-which is quite a challenge. It is not surprising if those people do not immediately obtain a full understanding of a subject that they had not previously encountered, and for some the discussions are proving a little more lengthy. Those who are truly affected by the provision and those who are responsible for the claims are in contact, and we have not been told of any problems. Naturally, the Government will keep the whole schedule under review. As I have tried to make clear, we intend to ensure that companies retain in statutory provisions the arrangements that previously existed, and that they are happy with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Paymaster General undertake that if representatives of leading accounting firms-with whom I have discussed the provisions and the way in which they are treated-come to see her or her officials to make representations about the matter, she will table an amendment to deal with the problem?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I shall not give that undertaking, Many accountancy firms that might wish to do that would never have had to put in a direct claim themselves. We are doing much better than that by negotiating directly with specialists in companies that make such claims to ensure that everything is as they require in terms of putting the arrangements on a statutory footing. We listen carefully to what they say, and so far they have not raised any such concerns. I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that I take those who are involved in running those sections in companies more seriously than accountancy firms that want to make representations so that they can advise their clients accordingly. If concerns can be demonstrated, I am always willing to consider them, but I am not prepared to give a blanket undertaking at this stage.

<P>
The last point on paragraph 8 was made by the hon. Member for Guildford, and concerned the treatment of accelerated depreciation. Accelerated depreciation will reduce relevant profits in the same way as normal depreciation, if it is in accordance with accountancy principles. It is only excessive provision that will not reduce relevant profits at the discretion of the directors, so the treatment that the hon. Gentleman seeks is clarified in that regard.

<P>
Paragraph 10 has been the focus of considerable discussion. It has been discussed with the Treasury and the Inland Revenue, and on the Floor of the House, and there has been speculation and so-called reports of people's views in various daily newspapers. There are two strands to the changes to double taxation relief in respect of mixer companies. The first is an issue of principle, and I shall explain the Government's view. Why should the UK Government give to companies that invest overseas through a Dutch or Luxembourg holding company a tax incentive that is not given to those that invest overseas direct from the UK? Much play has been made that this is about multinationalism, but there are multinationals that invest directly from the UK without using mixer companies. Some-not all-Opposition Members are peddling an illusion about what a mixer company is and what it does.

<P>
The second principle is the practical need to change double taxation laws to prevent this year's controlled foreign company changes from proving ineffective. Those are the two points that we are pursuing in respect of mixer companies.

<P>
The point that Opposition Members continue to make-I have dealt with the issue of competitiveness to the Government's satisfaction, if not to theirs-is that the changes will prove unfair to large multinationals that earn substantial profits and thereby pay more than their fair share of UK tax. However, the changes will bring about greater fairness between smaller and larger multinationals. As I said, not all multinationals have mixer companies. Those that do, which tend to be the larger ones, have an unfair advantage over those that do not.

<P>
The companies that will be affected most will be those that have used the old rules to mix in the most extreme ways to avoid UK tax on low-tax foreign profits. The changes will ensure that the acceptable distribution policy test in controlled foreign company legislation operates more fairly. Indeed, in the debate on clause 102 on the Floor of the House, the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) acknowledged that the use of mixers to avoid the effects of controlled foreign company legislation was a genuine abuse. I should add that he went on to disagree with the Government's provision in respect of mixer companies.

<P>
The other thread of the Opposition's argument is that the UK will become uncompetitive compared to the US or the Netherlands. The Opposition have done a lot of cherry-picking. In an effort to explain that our system is not right, they said that the US does this and the Netherlands does that, but it is wrong to cherry-pick from different double taxation relief systems that have been set up by different countries for different reasons as part of different overall tax systems. The changes to double taxation relief must be considered together with other elements of those countries' tax systems, such as whether they tax capital gains made by companies when they sell their subsidiaries and whether they give tax relief for investment on loans that are taken out to fund overseas investment. Although the changes made to the double taxation relief system in respect of mixer companies tighten the rules in relation to such businesses, it is clear that the UK will remain competitive in the international arena when the bigger picture is taken into account.

<P>
For example, the Netherlands restricts companies' ability to obtain a tax deduction for interest on loans that are used to fund overseas investments. Business has repeatedly told us that it does not want that bit of the Dutch system. What a surprise. In the United States, relief for interest is restricted, capital gains are taxable and double taxation relief is extremely complicated. The hon. Member for West Dorset pointed that out when these matters were considered in a Committee of the whole House. Business has repeatedly told us that it does not want that bit of the United States legislation. In the UK, we will consult on allowing capital gains on the sale of subsidiaries to be rolled over, and extremely generous tax relief is given on interest payable on loans that are used to fund overseas investment. If the fact that we have one of the lower tax rates and a much bigger network of double taxation treaties than any of our competitors is added in, it is clear that the UK is an excellent place to do business. The changes that the Government seek to make in respect of mixer companies are intended to prevent the mixing of excessively high and low tax rates that are achieved by avoidance mechanisms, in order to lower the level of tax that are due to the UK.

<P>
A huge amount of consultation occurred before the changes were made and was subsequently conducted on the offshore mixer issue. The Government have taken a number of decisions. The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about the announcement that was made on 16 June. The Government are proceeding with Budget proposals to close loopholes in controlled foreign company rules, which will bring the UK rules more into line with the practice of other countries. Double taxation relief rules for CFCs are being tightened in order to remove all scope for avoidance of CFC rules through mixing. In essence, it will not be possible to mix any dividend from any of our CFCs that fail the CFC motive test with other highly taxed dividends. Some residual mixing was possible under the Budget proposals. Although companies make press releases with one voice, they often express different views in discussions with the Treasury, which, no doubt, reflect their different circumstances. We do not write personal tax rules for companies, although some have given a great deal of support to the tightening of the CFC proposals.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to register the fact that we do not have a problem with that particular matter. It is perfectly reasonable to prohibit the mixing of dividends from CFCs that fail the motive test and we have no difficulties with the Treasury on that.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's clarification. I did not mean to imply that he was against CFC legislation and I apologise if I did so.

<P>
The Government are proceeding with the Budget proposal to cap double taxation relief on dividends at 30 per cent. That will ensure that there will be no UK tax benefit from mixing in an offshore holding company. The Government will allow for some of the capped foreign tax in the offshore mixer to be credited against UK tax on other dividends, subject to restrictions to confine the relief to non-abusive-non-avoidance-situations. It will not be possible to set any capped foreign income against UK tax on CFC dividends from CFCs that fail the motive test or UK tax on dividends if the foreign tax has been capped. Relief will be subject to an up-cap to ensure that it is not given in cases of high overseas tax rates, such as those that are artificially achieved in avoidance schemes.

<P>
<H5>7.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about the percentage rate that will set the upper limit for tax over 30 per cent. I am sorry to disappoint him, but I shall introduce details on Report. It will be significantly above 30 per cent., but we need to do more analysis before deciding on the right figure. The Government are introducing onshore mixing in non-abusive situations. In essence, tax over 30 per cent. on dividends from subsidiaries that are directly held in the UK will be credited against UK tax on other dividends. Again, it will not be possible to set any excess foreign tax against UK tax on controlled foreign company dividends that have failed the motive test or UK tax on dividends if the foreign tax has been capped. The relief will be subject to the upper cap so that we do not give relief in cases of very high overseas tax rates that have been artificially developed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Paymaster General mentioned motive tests. Will she answer my question on why a motive test could not have been devised to achieve a similar purpose in clause 93?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We rejected a motive test in our discussion on clause 93 because we had made a clear decision to deal with avoidance. If the right hon. Gentleman casts his mind back to that debate, he will recall that we decided to deal with schemes that were designed to avoid tax. It was a complex issue. If I remember correctly, the right hon. Gentleman gave a specific example of a company for which he wanted a motive test. We saw no way of developing a test that would work and achieve our objectives.

<P>
With regard to schedule 30, we are using the existing CFC motive test that goes back to 1984. It is not a completely new test; we merely lifted it from other legislation. He must have come across it when he was Financial Secretary.

<P>
There will be no UK tax benefit from mixing foreign dividends in an offshore company as opposed to receiving the dividend directly into the UK. That was always our intention. The incentive in the double taxation relief rules to hold foreign shareholdings in an offshore company will go. That will remove a major tax distortion and compliance cost issue. For the first time, the UK will allow onshore mixing. That answers
the industry's concerns about international competitiveness and mixing.

<P>
A few specific points were made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. On the first bullet point, the controlled foreign company dividends referred to are those paid because the CFC has failed all the exemptions, including the exempt activity and the motive tests-that is, whether the motive was to avoid UK tax. The hon. Gentleman asked about the fourth bullet point and about tax paid at the level of the immediate overseas subsidiary, which can be both withholding tax and underlying tax. The third bullet point is about the same sorts of taxes paid lower down a chain of companies rather than by the immediate subsidiary. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked me about the upper limit, which I have now dealt with.

<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Guildford made two comments about the schedule. First, he asked about insurance companies. Respondents to the double taxation review said that they wanted clear rules. In fact, the Revenue believes that the new rules on expenses are more generous than the current law. The revenue yield is based on the view that the Revenue's interpretation of any current law will be upheld by the courts.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Ah!

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Of course that would be the case. How could it be done otherwise? The new law does not pre-empt a court decision. It is prospective only from 2001.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned what the insurance companies said during the lunch break. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman asks the ABI to substantiate that. It is difficult for Ministers, when things are said to the Revenue and discussions and negotiations are taken on in good faith, if people then seek to disclaim what was said. It makes it sound as though Ministers are misleading the Committee, which is certainly not the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We are under time pressure. We shall have an opportunity to discuss the position of insurance companies under clause 106. I assure the Paymaster General that not only did I have that conversation at lunch time, but it was reflected in the statement sent by fax to me and other members of the Committee only a day ago.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I certainly do not impugn the hon. Gentleman for misleading the Committee; I am expressing my own surprise and slight irritation that something of that nature should have been said. I am sure that the matter can be cleared up; the hon. Gentleman is right that it can be raised elsewhere.

<P>
The final point raised by the hon. Gentleman was about self-assessment royalty payments. Section 808B is an aid to the interpretation of certain special relationship provisions in the royalty articles of some double taxation treaties. It denies relief under a treaty where the amount of royalties paid between parties who have a special relationship is greater than the amount that would have been paid at arm's length. As for self-assessment, if a company can show that it has made a genuine effort to establish an arm's length price but it has simply got it wrong, no penalty would fall on it. That is the general, light-touch practice that the Inland Revenue operates in a number of areas-if not in all areas.

<P>
I hope that I have dealt with what were rightly said to be complex points. I know that we shall discuss the matter again on the Floor on the House on Report. I urge my hon. Friends to support the Government on the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am conscious of the need not unnecessarily to prolong the time that officials have to spend here who will not be needed when we reconvene. I want therefore to be extremely brief. First, the Paymaster General has done remarkably well under extremely difficult circumstances. Secondly, she has unfortunately not done nearly well enough-although that is not her fault. The problem has not yet been solved. We shall come back to it on Report, when we shall discover whether the whole thing is smoke and mirrors or whether a solution exists. However, although the hon. Lady made some headway on paragraph 6, we still have a problem with paragraph 8.

<P>
I do not suppose that the Government would want the schedule to stand part of the Bill as it stands, so I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it. I wonder whether we shall be able to vote for it on Report.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 404, in page 518, leave out lines 32 and 33.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 405 to 413.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I know that right hon. and hon. Members are interested in something else that is happening today. I am sure that someone will ensure that we are kept informed of the progress of tonight's game.

<P>
Schedule 31 revises the meaning of ``control'' in the anti-avoidance rules concerning controlled foreign companies. In particular, the scheme aims to prevent companies from avoiding the controlled foreign company rules through the use of international joint ventures. The amendments will ensure that the extension of the rules to cover such joint ventures does not go further than intended. They limit the extension to cases in which the United Kingdom participant in the joint venture is able to exercise significant influence over it. They also ensure that the rule in schedule 31 that attributes to a person the interests, rights and powers of another person does not similarly go further than intended. No attribution can be made from a United Kingdom resident to a non-resident, nor from one joint venture partner to another simply because they are partners.

<P>
The amendments also include consequential changes to bring the controlled foreign company exemption for holding companies into line with the new rules for joint ventures.

<P>
Under existing law, a company is regarded as being a controlled foreign company only if it is controlled from the United Kingdom, which usually means when more than 50 per cent. of the shares are held in the United Kingdom. However, the ways in which companies are structured and organised are becoming increasingly complicated. Control is sometimes exercised other than simply by share capital, and joint ventures are becoming increasingly common.

<P>
Schedule 31, therefore, updates the control test broadly in line with the rules introduced in 1998 for transfer pricing. In particular, joint ventures in which a United Kingdom company has at least a 40 per cent. stake and a foreign company has at least a 40 per cent. stake will come within the controlled foreign company rules. Schedule 31 refers to the new rules as the 40 per cent. test. Companies with a 40 per cent. stake will normally be able to exercise significant influence over a joint venture. Forty per cent. is also the level in the similar test for transfer pricing.

<P>
The Government recognise that a company's 40 per cent. stake may not always enable sufficient influence to be exercised over the joint venture from the United Kindom for it to be appropriate to apply the CFC rules-for example, when one foreign partner holds the remaining 60 per cent. In recognition of that, the amendment limits the meaning of control as it affects joint ventures. It ensures that the 40 per cent. test will be satisfied only if the foreign person holding at least 40 per cent. of the interest rights and powers does not hold more than 55 per cent. of such interest rights and powers.

<P>
The amendment also ensures that the interest rights and powers of a UK person cannot be attributed to a non-resident or from one joint venture partner to another simply because they are partners.

<P>
The amendments bring the CFC rules on intermediate holding companies into line with changes made to the meaning of control. Such holding companies are generally exempt from controlled fund company rules where 90 per cent. of their income is derived from dividends paid to them by their subsidiaries. If a joint venture is held through an intermediate holding company, the joint venture company might not be a subsiduary of the holding company. That situation existed before the changes that we have made to the meaning of control.

<P>
The Inland Revenue has normally granted clearance under the motive test where the only reason why holding company exemption failed was because some dividends came from companies in which the holding had held a substantial interest but which were not, technically, its subsidiaries. The changes made by schedule 31 will affect only a small proportion of companies to which motive test clearance has previously been given. We had intended that the same practice should continue. Companies told us, however, that they would prefer that we amended the holding company test. The amendments meet that preference by ensuring that any dividends paid to the holding company by a joint venture company brought within the CFC rules by schedule 31 will be deemed to be dividends received by a subsidiary or the holding company. The practice of granting clearance under the motive test where the holding company exemption has failed because some dividends came from companies in which the holding company has a substantial interest but which are not technically subsidiaries will continue for companies not affected by the changes in schedule 31.

<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee and encourage my hon. Friends to vote for them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If members of the Committee are content, I want to move fairly smartly on to the stand part debate because the main problems affect the schedule rather than the amendments.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must announce that the ayes were 2 and the noes were 3 and that the noes have it. I am very sorry to have to announce that result.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> If that means what I think it means, I am sure that the Committee will be united in the view that it is a pity. I do not judge the nation's validity by its football results, but I know that it is important to many people.

<P>
Amendment No. 408 deals with, I believe, the contents of paragraph 26 of the press release, which, roughly speaking, the Paymaster General repeated in her speech. We understand the aims expressed in the paragraph-that where a UK company holds 40 per cent. or more of the subsidiary but an overseas company holds 55 per cent. or more, control is manifestly not being exercised unambiguously and therefore the 40 per cent. test should not be regarded as having been satisfied. We understand that intention and applaud it. We cannot, however, see how amendment No. 408 achieves that effect. I say that in a genuine spirit of inquiry-I am open to being persuaded that the amendment achieves exactly that result. If so, that is splendid.

<P>
Amendment No. 408 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 40 per cent. test in this subsection is satisfied in the case of one of two persons who, taken together, control a company if that one of them has interests, rights and powers representing-

<P>
(a) at least 40 per cent., but

<P>
(b) not more than 55 per cent.,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of the holdings, rights and powers in respect of which the pair of them fall to be taken as controlling the company.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I admit that I am so unclear in my mind on how the amendment could achieve the effect to which the Paymaster General referred, in relation to paragraph 26, that I genuinely wonder whether it is the right amendment. Perhaps another amendment in the long list is meant to have that effect. I could not see which one it was, and, more worryingly, nor could our advisers. I hoped that, as the Paymaster General continued, blinding light would be cast, and I would suddenly understand which amendment captured the effect. Will the Paymaster General tell the Committee which amendment is relevant? We could then discuss whether it achieves such an effect, and, if it does, move on to the stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Amendment No. 408 is the correct amendment. It refers to the non-resident person. The figure of 40 per cent. but not more than 55 per cent. provides the test for control of the company. I am assured by parliamentary counsel-I took the cautionary action of having them present in the Committee-that it achieves exactly the intended effect. The hon. Gentleman is not doubting what we want to achieve but querying whether the amendment achieves it. I would be happy for him to write to me, which will allow me to seek further clarification from parliamentary counsel. As I am not a parliamentary draftsman, I cannot help the hon. Gentleman further.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is a brave man who challenges parliamentary counsel in relation to drafting. I do not want to chance my arm on that. The amendment may have the intended effect. If so, there must be some way in which it could be made more conspicuous to the amateur. I shall therefore take up the Paymaster General's offer and write to her. That will at least ensure clarification on the record so that, as time moves on, those who are not endowed with the advice of parliamentary counsel will be able to understand the matter.

<P>
On that assurance, we have no objection to the amendments. We want to proceed to the stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am not sure to which specific amendment my point relates. Effectively, it relates to all of them and to proposed new subsection (2), which sets out the rule for finding business profits and losses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain to Her Majesty's Household) On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I am a little confused about what we have just agreed. You called the ayes and the noes and Mr. Flight rose to speak. Is he in order, making a point of order or voting with the noes?</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I believe that Mr. Allen is correct. I called the ayes and turned to the noes; you, Mr. Flight, rose on the noes and I allowed you to speak, but I was wrong to do that. The hon. Gentleman might like to comment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I think that I was jumping the gun-I intended to speak on clause stand part.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> So the ayes have it. Mr. Allen, I am most grateful to you. It is so pleasing when there is a genuine point of order, because few of them are heard. They come only from the most erudite and silent of people.

<P>
Question proposed: That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> One of the amendments might address the issue that I would like to raise. Proposed new subsection (2) sets out the rule for finding the business profits and losses. The industry is concerned about the situation in which a UK company or branch has several branches where local currency elections must be made. The new rules allow each branch to compute its taxable profits in local currency. They are then aggregated to calculate the UK tax for the company as a whole. Under the Bill as drafted, when a company has a loss brought forward, it must be converted back into the local currency and apportioned to the branches. However, there is no obvious method of apportioning the loss, especially when there have been movements between currencies. The industry takes the view that it would be most sensible for the loss to remain in sterling. It may be that we have misunderstood the Government's amendments and that that is what they would achieve. I have been left to understand that they are sympathetic to that potential approach to the problem.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that I know where I am. I am not sure that I shall do justice to my response, for which I apologise in advance. If I do not find my place in my notes, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. I have been a little distracted.

<P>
Clause 104 provides for the new improved system for taking companies that use foreign currency in preparing their accounts. In response to representations made to the Government, it has been refined further to cater for additional circumstances and to ensure that the rules reflect the accounting practices as closely as possible.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about separate branches, the answer to which is that there is no problem. Losses will be apportioned on the basis of accounts. I hope sincerely that I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's question. If I have not, I shall check the record and write to him about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I think that the principle of the accounts is satisfactory, but accounts may have different period ends and exchange rates may move. I shall write to the Minister about the issue, but it is not controversial.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Rather than go back over our discussions of the amendment, which deal with the hon. Gentleman's point, I shall be delighted to correspond with him on the subject and will ensure that other members of the Committee are informed in the usual way of what I said.

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. Before I miss another opportunity to do so, I want to ask the Chair to recommend to Madam Speaker that particular indulgence be shown on Report to amendments to schedule 31. Had it not been for my oversight, we would have sought to debate schedule stand part. The proper method for so doing would be to table an amendment on Report to trigger such a debate.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Letwin, the Chair will do precisely as you request. I was proceeding through the Bill, forgetting that you asked to speak to the schedule. Had I recalled that you had done so, I would have paused and given you an opportunity to speak. I do hope that you accept that in no way did I attempt to curtail your speech, but the ultimate responsibility for not rising lies with members of the Committee, not with the Chair.
