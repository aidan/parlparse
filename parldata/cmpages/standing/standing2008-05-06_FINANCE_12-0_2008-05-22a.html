<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000421"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> Before
our break, I was explaining the impact of the court&#146;s decision
in December 1986 and how that decision came as a surprise, not to say a
shock, to the Inland Revenue, to other tax authorities around the world
and to most tax advisers. The problem was not confined to the UK-Jersey
tax treaty. Parliament acted at the next available
opportunity&#151;in the 1987 Finance Bill&#151;to make it clear
that the UK&#146;s treaties did not give, and never had given, tax
exemption to a UK member&#146;s share of a foreign
partnership&#146;s income. During the debate on the 1987 Bill, there
was an exchange between the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury,
now Lord Lamont of Lerwick, and my party&#146;s spokesman, Tony
Blair. If I may quote more widely from the Committee&#146;s debate
than did the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr.
Gauke)&#151;it is always good to make what was said clearer and not
to draw on too narrow a quotation&#151;the then Financial Secretary
said:</div> <a name="08052281000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
hon. Member for Sedgefield has made some good and telling
points&#151;he always does in Committee.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052281000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tony Blair then
said:</div><a name="08052281000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
believe that the right hon. Gentleman has put as good a case as
possible in defence of the retrospection within this
clause&#148;,</div><a name="08052281000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">although he
doubted whether the same argument would stand in other examples. The
then Financial Secretary observed that although the provisions had
caused him &#147;considerable concern&#148;, he had concluded that
the clause should apply with retrospective effect. He noted that that
did not involve the</div><a name="08052281000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;type
of retrospection on which the House has normally looked with
disfavour&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div><a name="08052281000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">as all that it did was

understanding of the law to what it was before a decision of the High
Court.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 15 July 1987; Vol. 119,
c. 1180-87.]</div>
<a name="08052281000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052281000422"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): Will the Minister
tell the Committee how many years back that retrospection
went?</div>
<a name="08052281000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000423"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will seek to answer that later, but the
retrospection was extensive.</div>
<a name="08052281000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">UK individuals and companies
have been artificially routeing their income through offshore trusts
and partnerships and claiming that one of the UK&#146;s many double
taxation treaties exempts them from tax. That is in wilful
contravention of the purpose of the treaty and the 1987 legislation. A
fundamental purpose of the clause is to put it beyond doubt that a
wholly artificial avoidance scheme designed to frustrate legislation
passed by Parliament in 1987 to prevent such avoidance does not work,
and never has. Some taxpayers were awaiting the outcome of litigation
in the expectation that it would clarify their affairs. The legislative
change in the clause will result in the necessary certainty, not
litigation, thus enabling tax returns to be finalised.</div>
<a name="08052281000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
descriptive terms have flowed in the discussions that I have had about
this avoidance scheme, one of which is &#147;an egregious
case&#148;. In such a case, the Government consider that the law
already defeats the scheme and that it is clear to all concerned that
the scheme is in defiance of Parliament&#146;s intent. Used in such a
context, retrospection preserves the expectation that tax will be
applied fairly and consistently. That will build confidence and trust
in the law. Nobody could seriously think that the clause is unfair to
the people who will be affected by it. Users of the scheme have
deliberately tried to frustrate the will of Parliament, and they will
have been aware that Parliament had closed down similar schemes 20
years ago with retrospective effect. My understanding is that that
retrospectivity was unlimited, in effect, until the end of the second
world war.</div>
<a name="08052281000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
might not be aware of the scale of the risk to the Exchequer as a
result of this avoidance scheme. HMRC is aware of more than 2,000
scheme users, and it involves tax of &#163;50 million a year&#151;a
not insubstantial sum. Given the increasing numbers using the scheme,
the rapidly growing amount of tax at risk and the wilful attempt to
circumvent the clear purpose of the legislation and of the UK&#146;s
tax treaties, we consider it appropriate to legislate to provide
retrospective clarification and to put the matter beyond doubt. HMRC
has learned that the large number of taxpayers who have been using the
scheme has suddenly started to grow; I shall explain why in a
moment.</div>
<a name="08052281000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052281000424"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I
acknowledge that the number seems suddenly to have increased, but will
the Financial Secretary clarify when HMRC first became aware that such
schemes were being
created?</div><a name="08052281000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000425"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will do that in a moment, if the hon. Gentleman
will allow me.</div><a name="08052281000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scheme is similar to the Padmore scheme except that UK taxpayers set up
offshore trusts as well as partnerships. The trusts are for their own
benefit, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>the trustees become members of the partnership. UK taxpayers agree to
work for the partnership, so that once a scheme is set up, their UK
income thereafter becomes payable to the partnership and, through the
trust, it is paid straight back to them in the UK. They assert that
such an arrangement circumvents the 1987 legislation so that the income
is tax-free. HMRC does not believe that the scheme works, but we have
taken into account its scale and the wilful attempt to flout the law
that retrospectively clarified how tax treaties work. The Government
have developed our approach on the detail of the legislation
on anti-avoidance rules generally to ensure that they are effective and
properly targeted. Business welcomes that approach, and it has led to
better legislation.</div>
<a name="08052281000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me respond to the point
raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall. In 2004, the then
Paymaster General gave a warning in relation to a particular abuse. Her
statement gave no reassurance about use of retrospection on other
matters, and certainly did nothing to suggest that the Government would
act differently in relation to treaty abuse than they did in
1987.</div> <a name="08052281000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
do not accept that the clause changes the meaning of the law. The law
already applies to partnership profits, and we interpret that as
including profits enjoyed through a trust. The measure clarifies rather
than amplifies the scope of the 1987 legislation and puts beyond doubt
what most people understand it to mean. We recognise and acknowledge
the difficulties inherent in such legislation. Although the clause is
strictly retrospective, as was the case in 1987, it does not change
what is generally understood to be the meaning of the law but merely
clarifies it.</div> <a name="08052281000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Gosport is not in his seat at the moment, but I should
put it on record that HMRC guidance merely noted that some tax planners
suggested that circumventions were possible. HMRC did not accept that
view of the law, and it does not accept it now. It did not see evidence
that such schemes were being used until 2001. However, their use has
increased sharply in the past year, which is why we are acting now. The
discourager regime provides HMRC with early information on tax
avoidance. In many cases, it will respond to the information by
challenging the avoidance in the courts. In some cases, it will be
appropriate for the Government to legislate to prevent future use of a
scheme or new variants on it. In rare cases, such as those we see
today, it will be appropriate for us to act retrospectively to ensure
that abusive schemes are closed down by legislation rather than
litigation. There are no cases of litigation at the
moment.</div>
<a name="08052281000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052281000426"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): We
all accept that Parliament&#146;s desire should hold sway, but the
issue is surely one of clarification. The correct place to clarify the
law is in the courts&#151;it should not be done merely by ministerial
assertion or Treasury diktat. That is the Conservative objection to the
measure. Clarification must come through the proper legal
process.</div>
<a name="08052281000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000427"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I will clearly have a
disagreement on that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div><a name="08052281000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject to an exception relating
to judicial decisions made before 17 March 1987, the legislation
applied retrospectively. Therefore, the provision did not apply to
Mr. Padmore or to a few other taxpayers. In relation to the
scheme, some taxpayers were awaiting the outcome of litigation in the
expectation that it would clarify their own tax affairs, but no
litigation has ever commenced. The change in legislation provided by
the clause will provide the necessary certainty instead of litigation
and enable tax returns to be
finalised.</div><a name="08052281000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000428"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister says that in the opinion of HMRC, the
clause merely clarifies the existing law, and that there has been no
litigation. That is presumably because HMRC has not pursued litigation.
If HMRC is so confident that the measure merely clarifies the
law&#151;I am not making a case one way or the other&#151;why is it
not bringing litigation against the users of the
scheme?</div><a name="08052281000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000429"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Because the opportunity arises to deal with the
matter through legislation and to make it clear that, as HMRC already
believes, the scheme does not work. The change that we are making has
already had an impact on the number of notifications of the scheme. As
I said, there is a risk to the Exchequer on the scale of millions of
pounds.</div>
<a name="08052281000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052281000430"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I have been listening
to the debate and I am not quite sure why the measure must be
retrospective to save money for the Exchequer. If the Bill is enacted
and taken forward, will that not save money? I must have missed
something.</div><a name="08052281000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000431"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> As I understand it, a number of people are
proposing to use the scheme and some tax advisers will recommend the
use of it unless we act to make it clear that the scheme does not work.
The legislation will end the doubt about
that.</div><a name="08052281000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000433"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I hope I get this right. It is because HMRC has
not consistently made the case throughout the time period that the
scheme does not work, that it is a deliberate and wilful avoidance
scheme that flouts the 1987 legislation, and that it would be
challenged.</div>
<a name="08052281000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052281000434"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hammond</b> (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con): The
Minister has said that HMRC regards the scheme as a wilful flouting of
the law, but apparently it has never brought a case. When she answers
the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough about why
it cannot simply be a prospective proposal, can she say how much back
tax&#151;disputed tax&#151;rides on the retrospectivity aspect of
the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000435"></a>Jane

<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div><a name="08052281000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not right to say that HMRC
turned a blind eye to the scheme, did nothing and waited until
legislation became necessary. HMRC&#146;s early challenges around the
scheme&#151;although not litigation&#151;did meet with some
success. It strongly believes that this is an exceptional circumstance
and that none of the scheme users could have been in any doubt that
they were deliberately flouting the clear intention of the 1987

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000437"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Looking back, the sum is
around &#163;200 million. As I have said repeatedly, in HMRC&#146;s
view, someone not would have used the scheme without knowing exactly
what they were doing. Early scheme users did concede to HMRC arguments
and the usual preliminary steps were taken towards litigation. However,
the growing use of the scheme had begun seriously to threaten revenues,
which led to unacceptable uncertainty. This was thought to be by far
the most appropriate way of dealing with it. It was signalled well in
advance that such a step would be taken.</div>

step. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall says that that is not the
case, but I have seen only one or two representations, and I was not
aware of that concern being widespread. I was about to speak about the
Rees rules, but I happily give
way.</div><a name="08052281000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000438"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall read again what some public bodies have
said. The Chartered Institute of Taxation says, &#147;extreme and
unjustified&#148;. The Law Society says, &#147;wrong in
principle&#148;. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales says,</div> <a name="08052281000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
sends out a very damaging signal about the stability of the UK tax
system&#148;.</div> <a name="08052281000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the HMRC and
Treasury open day for the Finance Bill, a long list of representations
were made by those bodies and others, including KPMG and the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. All were expressing great
concern, not about closing the loophole but about the retrospective
element.</div>
<a name="08052281000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000439"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will reassure myself that my understanding is
accurate. I shall consider the point made by the hon. Gentleman,
because I want to be absolutely sure. However, given what I understand
of the scheme, such representations are surprising to me. When we
change the law to combat clearly abusive avoidance arrangements, we may
exceptionally&#151;very exceptionally&#151;do so with retrospective
effect.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div><a name="08052281000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000440"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I have not studied the subject like my hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, but does the Minister
accept that there is a difference between a court making it clear that
the HMRC interpretation is correct and that the taxpayer interpretation
is incorrect and the Government then moving to legislate
retrospectively, effectively in order to implement the court&#146;s
decision and what she is doing now? The Minister is merely asserting
that the taxpayer is wrong and that HMRC is right without being
prepared to let the courts test that view.</div>
<a name="08052281000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000441"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We regularly legislate in Parliament, and the
legislation is often tested in court. If Parliament&#146;s view of
the law is found to be unjustified by a court and if Parliament
believes that its view should carry, it is perfectly proper for the
Government to revisit the
matter&#151;</div><a name="08052281000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000442"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> That is what we are saying, but after the court
hearing.</div>
<a name="08052281000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000443"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> In 1987, a court judged the law to be deficient.
As I said, the judgment was a complete surprise to everyone in the
field; there was thought to be universal acceptance that the
legislation was right. It was based on long-used double taxation treaty
legislation. As one would expect, the court&#146;s decision required
a study of what had gone wrong and of where the law was deficient. I am
happy and content, given the advice that I have received, that the
decision I am asking the Committee to make today is right.</div>
<a name="08052281000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not going to dwell on the
point, but it is a point worth making. We are engaged in discussions
about a taxpayers charter, and have invited representations. The
Chartered Institute of Taxation submitted suggestions of what such a
charter might do. Section 13 includes this statement:</div>
<a name="08052281000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where we change tax law
to combat clearly abusive avoidance arrangements, we may exceptionally
do so with retrospective
effect.&#148;</div><a name="08052281000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not asking
the Committee to do something absolutely outlandish and outwith the
expectation of the industry, although I accept the point made by the
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about the number of
representations that he has seen and will seek to reassure myself about
the advice that I have had.</div>
<a name="08052281000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000444"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I confess that I was unimpressed by the
Minister&#146;s answer to the earlier intervention by my hon. Friend
the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. A set mechanism is in place. In
so far as the scheme can be challenged in the courts, she is absolutely
right to say that the Government have an opportunity to come back and
make new law to close any loopholes, but she is arguing that there is
no loophole that the Government recognise. Does she not see our
perspective? We fear that down that road&#151;although, admittedly, a
fair way down it&#151;lies
tyranny.</div><a name="08052281000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000445"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> No. The hon. Gentleman will remember that the
court decision led to the legislative decision in 1987, which related
to the abuse of partnerships and the arrangements concerning them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>We now see the scheme developing in a way that HMRC believes strongly
will not work. I ask the Committee to agree to clause 55 because the
Government are absolutely clear that the view taken by Parliament in
1987 was the right view. Even though it was taken by a different party,
we stand by that decision. I believe that we can pass the clause with a
clear conscience.</div><a name="08052281000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Rees rules do not govern all possible situations in which the
Government might introduce retrospective legislation; they apply where
the Government seek to close down a scheme with immediate effect. There
are a few exceptional cases, such as this one, where closure with
immediate effect would not be adequate to counteract the avoidance in
question.</div>
<a name="08052281000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tax avoidance
is unfair to the great majority of taxpayers who pay their fair share.
We discussed the nature of avoidance earlier. I can understand that
people want to reduce their liability, but where a scheme is in clear
and deliberate breach of the law, Parliament has a duty to act to
protect the Exchequer. None of the scheme&#146;s users was entitled
to artificially avoid paying their fair share of tax at the expense of
others. They ought to have been aware of the likely consequences of
their wilful attempt to flout the law. The 1987 decision to tackle
treaty abuse with retrospective effect was a clear signal. I hope that
the amendments will not be pressed to a vote. If they are, I hope that
my hon. Friends will resist them and that clause 55 will join the rest
of the
Bill.</div><a name="08052281000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000446"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I do not think that the Minister has reassured
Conservative Members at all. There is an essential contradiction in
what she said. She said that HMRC is confident that the clause merely
reasserts existing law, that it is not a change in law and that the
schemes are in clear breach of the law, yet she suggests that some
&#163;200 million in back tax is at risk. If the law is as she
says&#151;I have no reason to doubt it&#151;that sum is not at
risk, because all that is required is for HMRC to litigate. It prompts
the question why HMRC will not litigate. Why is it not prepared to take
the matter to
court?</div><a name="08052281000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It relates to
the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and
Westminster. The Government are saying, essentially, that they will
pass new law if they think that the law is in some way flawed or there
is an alternative interpretation of it that they do not like. Rather
than allowing the courts to interpret that law, they will rewrite it
retrospectively so that it says what they wanted it to say in the first
place. Such an approach gives individuals and businesses no reassurance
that the law is what they think it is, as it is written down and what
has been passed by Parliament. The impression is that it is something
that can be changed if not at a whim, at the discretion of the
Government
retrospectively.</div><a name="08052281000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000447"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree, that for the purpose
of clarifying the law and sending out signals about it to the business
community, the Government should have legislated to correct any
confusion or doubt in the law as soon as they became aware of it? The
Minister implied that the reason behind the need to move now is that
the use of the avoidance technique has suddenly increased
significantly. She should take on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>board the lesson that the way to avoid being in such an embarrassing
situation is to legislate as soon as a defect is spotted. Everyone will
then have a clear picture of what is going
on.</div>
<a name="08052281000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000448"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend takes me to my second point.
However, I must say first that certainty in the taxation system is
important. We have a well-developed legal system that should work on
the basis of laws being interpreted on the grounds of what they say,
not what the Government want them to say&#151;even if that is not
what they said at the
time.</div><a name="08052281000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000449"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman asking us to believe that
his party, and to some degree the party of the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall, believe that aggressive tax-avoidance schemes such
as that under discussion, which are widely seen as abusive, should be
allowed to continue during litigation at risk to the Exchequer, and
that there should be no circumstances in which he would do what his
party did in government, which was to legislate and to apply it
retrospectively?</div><a name="08052281000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000450"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> A Government should pursue and litigate on the
basis of the existing law. When they identify an abuse, they should
issue a warning and announce that they will change the law at the first
opportunity, and then do so. That takes me to the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. The Minister said that
HMRC was first aware of the schemes in 2001, but they were not pursued
widely because the warnings given by HMRC proved to be sufficient. None
the less, there was an awareness at that time by HMRC of some ambiguity
in the wording of the 1987
legislation.</div><a name="08052281000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
the fact that the schemes were not being pursued, why were such
measures not introduced under the Finance Act 2001 or subsequent Acts?
There has been plenty of them. Given that there were two Finance Acts
in 2005, there have probably been about eight. The matter causes great
concern, and the Government&#146;s approach should be to pursue it
rigorously and to litigate if there is some doubt about the law. In the
meantime, warnings should be given and legislation should be made. The
Government have not done that. They have sat on the matter, have come
back subsequently some years later and taken action when the scheme
started to develop, having been aware of the ambiguity under the 1987
legislation.</div><a name="08052281000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Member for South Derbyshire, I must say that, if
the Government fail to make the measure retrospective, it is an
admission that the previous legislation was defective. Indeed, I am
more inclined to interpret the proposal to make it retrospective as an
admission that the 1987 Act does not do what the Government said it
does. That is not based on a legal analysis but, if they were so
confident that the 1987 legislation prohibits the behaviour that we are
talking about, why on earth have they not litigated on the
matter?</div><a name="08052281000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons I am more convinced than ever that the retrospective
nature of the clause is unacceptable. Should the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall wish to press his amendment to a vote, we will
support
him.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000451"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> We are somewhat in danger of this aspect moving
from retrospection to repetition. At the end of the day, I am not
certain, although there has been much repetition, whether it has made
any great difference. To begin with, we talked about reasonable
expectation. I am a fairly reasonable chap, and I know that the
Minister is a reasonable Minister. I thought that there was a
reasonable expectation that the Government might accept the powerful
arguments&#151;made not only by Opposition Members, but by a
huge number of interested bodies&#151;about the central
concern.</div><a name="08052281000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all agree
that we want to stop the tax avoidance. There is not much disagreement
on that at all. The central concern is how the Government have decided
to achieve that&#151;first, not to go through the court situation, to
clarify and confirm their thinking anyway, but then the wide nature of
the wording in subsection (4). It cannot be beyond the experience,
knowledge, skill and such of those who draft legislation to draft a
subsection to bring about a tighter situation, clearly concerned with
the tax avoidance that the Government wish to close down and clarify
straightaway. The current wording is so wide&#151;that is our concern
and that of many
others.</div><a name="08052281000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some time ago
now, we talked about whether the measure would be subject to human
rights legislation. The Minister said that it would be fair,
proportionate and in the public interest. It is difficult to think that
undertaking such wide application of the subsection is fair or
proportionate&#151;it might well be in the public interest, in terms
of the money derived for the Revenue, but one out of three is probably
not good enough. No reference has been made to the whole principle of
the method, although I understand that the taxpayers charter will refer
to retrospection. As the Treasury Committee pointed out some time ago,
it would be extremely helpful to have a real paper, so that we
understand the principles of any potential future retrospection in any
such legislation, so that we can see clearly how such retrospection
might be applied and so that we do not have such wide drafting as we
have in the
subsection.</div><a name="08052281000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy
to indicate that we would support a clause, subsection or some other
drafting that narrowly defined the retrospection to this particular tax
avoidance scheme, so that there can be no doubt whatsoever that it
applies only to that, which is what the Minister has said on a number
of occasions. That is what we would be happy to support. I hoped that,
even at this late stage, that might be the sort of thing that would be
forthcoming, together perhaps with a draft paper on the principles of
retrospection. In the absence of that, I feel that we have no option
but to press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="08052281000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

on loss relief for non-active
traders</div><a name="08052281000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000474"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in
page 274, line 22, at end insert &#145;,
and</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) the trade is carried on with the
intention of generating a loss for tax avoidance
purposes.&#146;.</div><a name="08052281000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that all hon. Members are delighted at the spurt of progress
that we have just enjoyed and which I now intend to stop dead in its
tracks. The schedule deals with restrictions on trade loss relief for
individuals. That was not mentioned in the Budget speech, but was
buried away in Budget note 63. It is effectively retrospective, not in
quite the way that we have discussed in relation to previous clauses,
but in the sense that it will impact on the treatment of decisions made
before the measure was known
about.</div><a name="08052281000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
significant step is being taken. The provision is being introduced
under the guise of an anti-avoidance measure, so the Government, using
their own principles, avoided extensive consultation on it. It removes
what is in effect the oldest form of encouragement for enterprise in
the tax code. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us the
scale of the mischief&#151;I use the word again&#151;that we are
addressing. I understand that in conversation senior officials at HMRC
indicated that HMRC has no idea of the extent of any
&#147;avoidance&#148; through the use of sideways loss relief by
individuals, no idea whether it is costing the Exchequer money, and
thus no idea of what the relief is worth. That makes this look like a
fishing expedition. We on these Benches are concerned that the
Government are proposing legislation that will impact on not just the
incentive to take business risks, but on individuals&#146; ability to
take on risk, and that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>they are doing so without any clear idea of the loss to the
Exchequer&#151;if they believe that there will be a loss&#151;or of
how much they will gain from the
measures.</div><a name="08052281000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
current legislation, an individual who carries on a trade can offset
losses arising in that trade against other income and gains. That is
known as sideways loss relief. There is a provision, in section 66 of
the Income Taxes Act 2007 in its most recent incarnation, which denies
any such relief if the trade is not operated on a commercial basis.
That is a perfectly reasonable restriction to impose and it ought to be
sufficient to ensure that the measure cannot be used for the purposes
of artificial
avoidance.</div><a name="08052281000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
fundamental issue is at stake here; individuals are taxed overall on
their total income&#151;certainly within any of the particular silos
by which income is taxed. The Government are effectively seeking to
introduce a sort of mini-scheduler approach within trading income, so
that an individual is taxed separately on their income from different
trades. That would have a significant effect. We are all aware that the
Finance Act 2007 introduced provisions restricting the ability of
partners in a partnership who were not actively engaged in the business
of that partnership to obtain sideways loss relief. That was introduced
to prevent artificial constructions that allowed individuals to take
advantage of the losses generated in
partnerships.</div><a name="08052281000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
21 provides for similar restrictions to be applied where an individual
carries on a sole trade in a so-called &#147;non-active
capacity&#148;. That raises different issues. Under the measure,
where the trader is defined as a &#147;non-active trader&#148;, the
amount of sideways loss relief is limited to &#163;25,000 annually,
unless the trade relates to film expenditure, in which case there will
be no such restriction. Amendment No. 136 inserts a motive test into
that through a provision that means section 74A will apply only if the
trade has been carried on with the intention of generating a loss for
tax avoidance purposes.</div>
<a name="08052281000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my humble opinion, my
amendment is redundant&#151;that may sound like a slightly strange
thing to say&#151;because section 66 of the Income Taxes Act 2007
already requires business be carried on for a commercial purpose, that
is, for the purpose of making a profit. The amendment has been tabled
to draw attention to that problem and to probe the Minister on the
extent of the catchment of the clause by highlighting how a motive test
would narrow it
down.</div><a name="08052281000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">What problems do
we see in relation to the provision? According to schedule 21, an
individual is thought to devote sufficient time to a trade for him to
be considered an active participant, if
he</div><a name="08052281000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;spends an average of
at least 10 hours a week personally engaged in activities of the trade
and those activities are carried on...on a commercial basis,
and...with a view to the realisation of
profits&#148;.</div><a name="08052281000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="08052281000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
10-hour rule is an arbitrary and unsatisfactory way of defining an
individual&#146;s contribution to a business. It does not begin to
address many of the real world situations in which people find
themselves. It will also create a bureaucratic nightmare, which is the
antithesis of the entrepreneurial spirit that the Government say they
want to foster. Imagine an enthusiastic entrepreneur engaged in
starting up a part-time business. When he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>gets home from his hard day&#146;s work in employment and goes out to
his garage, where he is in the process of creating the next Hewlett
Packard, he will presumably need to clock on and record on his time
sheet the hours he is committing to that new venture in order to
produce records to satisfy HMRC that he is committed to that enterprise
for more than the requisite 10 hours a week averaged over the tax
year.</div>
<a name="08052281000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we really
want to foster a culture of entrepreneurship in this country, not only
is that requirement patently absurd and unenforceable, but even the
thought that entrepreneurs should be encouraged to think in that way
about the hours that they put in to developing start-up businesses is
depressing. There are many wholly commercial reasons why an individual
might not spend 10 hours a week personally engaged in a trade. Having
taken the risk of establishing a business and built it up by the sweat
of his own labour, an individual might be in a position to employ
others to run it while he is engaged on the next venture, and I would
have thought that the Government would want to encourage such serial
entrepreneurship. The hard-working entrepreneur who, having built up a
restaurant, small guest house, pub or hotel business, wants to move on
and devote his time and energy to building up another venture will fall
foul of these rules unless he goes back and spends 10 hours
a week pulling pints at the bar in order to qualify under the tests
that the Government are imposing.</div>
<a name="08052281000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
individuals start up businesses while still in employment&#151;a
point to which I have already alluded. That is a sensible way of
probing the viability of a new business venture without sacrificing the
security of a regular income. Many people work full time or part time
for an employer while conducting a part-time business, and sometimes
more than one. Indeed, I remember meeting a constituent of mine shortly
after I was elected who was employed in the catering department in the
House of Commons&#151;I can tell this story because he no longer
works here&#151;and who very enterprisingly was conducting a business
as well, manufacturing and distributing hand-cooked vegetable chips,
and very delicious they were too. He eventually left the employment of
the House of Commons and has, I am sure, prospered elsewhere. That is
not an unusual case. Hon. Members will know of many people who have
tested the water with a new business project while retaining the
security of their existing employment.</div>
<a name="08052281000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some businesses are seasonal,
such as furnished lettings, and there are also smallholding
agricultural businesses, which people might not be able to turn into a
viable full-time occupation. That is less part of the culture of this
country than it is of some of our European neighbours, where part-time
agriculture is a common business occupation. We believe that there
could be a serious impact on start-ups and on the fostering of
entrepreneurship, especially in the wake of the Government&#146;s
decision to abolish taper relief and the negative signals that that
sent to those engaged in establishing new business
enterprises.</div><a name="08052281000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
afraid that it gets worse because new section 74A(6) provides that if
an individual has received sideways loss relief in his capacity as a
partner in a partnership, that amount has to be deducted from the cap
that this measure proposes. That would be a further reduction in the
capacity to absorb losses across the boundaries of different
trades.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div><a name="08052281000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a number of other points
to make on schedule 21. As I have gone this far, it might be better for
me to complete my remarks, unless you indicate otherwise Mr.
Hood. The Minister could then respond to the amendment and to the more
general remarks, rather than have a separate debate on the
schedule.</div><a name="08052281000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000475"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have no objection to the hon. Gentleman
discussing other parts of the schedule, but we will not then
have a separate debate on the
schedule.</div><a name="08052281000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000476"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> That was exactly my thinking, Mr.
Hood. It is precisely because I fear that I may already have strayed
into some of the more general points that I suggested that I carry
on.</div><a name="08052281000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government say that these measures are aimed at tackling contrived
arrangements. We have no problem with that, but the legislation is very
widely drafted. It is our contention that it will also catch some
wholly commercial arrangements. A normal, industrious trader who seeks
to establish a new business, or businesses, could be inadvertently
caught in this trap. New section 74B(3) and (4) provides that no relief
will be available where loss arises as a result of relevant tax
avoidance arrangements. That is fine, but the relevant tax avoidance
arrangements are widely defined. When claiming sideways loss relief,
will an individual have to prove that he had no expectation at the
outset that such a loss could be relieved? In other words, it appears
that one can benefit from sideways loss relief only if one is not aware
that one could benefit from it. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that
point.</div><a name="08052281000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could somebody
be caught by these provisions as the result of a negative decision? I
return to my earlier example of somebody who has established a business
that is running quite successfully. He has employees who are running it
for him and he wishes to devote his attention to his next business
venture. He is a classic serial entrepreneur. Could HMRC treat his
failure to incorporate that first business as an act that was seeking
to exploit the possibility of the use of sideways loss
relief?</div><a name="08052281000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
uncharted territory. It has always been understood that people with an
established line of business that is generating profits can, with the
security of that profit income, invest in a new business activity or
trade, and that any losses in that new trade can be offset against
their income from the existing trade. By definition, one might think
that asking them not to devote their full energy to the new trade, and
to take a chunk of their working time and attention and continue to
focus it on existing trade, to satisfy HMRC&#146;s requirements in
the test that is introduced by the legislation, would make the chance
of incurring a loss in the early years of the new trade rather
greater, because of the reduced attention and focus given to
it.</div> <a name="08052281000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Budget day
news release dealt with the purpose of the provisions, and said that
the</div><a name="08052281000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government made
clear that avoiding tax through the use of sideways loss relief is
unacceptable.&#148;</div><a name="08052281000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the provisions mean that genuine traders may not be able to claim
statutory relief, which could lead to individuals being taxed on more
than 100 per cent. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>of the net result of the profits and losses on all their business
activities, where losses and profits cannot be offset.</div>
<a name="08052281000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">A particular case that could
arise is one in which someone who was setting up a new business was
taking advantage of the annual capital allowance to invest in it but,
because that new business had no profits, they would seek to offset the
value of the capital allowance against the existing profit stream from
their established business or businesses. That will now no longer be
allowed beyond the &#163;25,000 limit. In discussions on the matter,
it has been suggested that investment in plant and equipment up to the
annual investment allowance could be exempt when calculating the loss
for the purposes of applying the cap. Otherwise there is a danger of
hindering investment in plant and equipment in the new
business.</div><a name="08052281000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister could give the Committee some examples of the contrived
arrangements that, presumably, she fears, so that we can distinguish
them from the normal trading arrangements that we fear will be caught
by the wide scope of the legislation, with all the damage that that
will do. The effect of paragraph 6 of schedule 21 is to make the
provisions retrospective. If a loss arises in a basis period ending
after 12 March 2008, that loss will be time-apportioned between the
periods before and after that date, and the proportion deemed to arise
after 12 March will be subject to the loss restriction, even though the
loss may have arisen before 12 March.</div>
<a name="08052281000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to return to the
definition of a non-active capacity. In the modern world, where many
businesses of all descriptions are pushing the boundaries and frontiers
in technology and the way in which business is done, simply to use a
test of the number of hours of direct personal involvement is
simplistic. An individual might have specialist knowledge, for example,
or some unique reputational value to the business that would mean that
his presence&#151;even his name on its letterhead&#151;had a
significant impact on its prospects. Someone might be absolutely
essential to the functioning of the business, yet might not spend, or
need to spend, 10 hours a week conducting that business. He might be
the proprietor of the formula that the business is allowed to use
without charge, for example. I urge the Minister to consider again
whether the simple 10-hour test is really the message that the
Government want to send about how they value individuals&#146; input
into a business. We can anticipate, I think, the fact that the same
argument will arise in relation to income shifting. Is it simply about
how much time somebody commits to the business, or about the unique
qualities and characteristics that they bring to
it?</div><a name="08052281000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, if
there is abuse through artificial arrangements, we would support a
targeted attack on that abuse, but that must not become an attack on
risk taking, entrepreneurship, or start-up or spare-time businesses.
The Opposition are deeply concerned that the Government are removing a
fundamental part of the support system, particularly for new
businesses, but also for serial entrepreneurs, which is absolutely not
the direction in which the UK tax system should move, nor&#151;this
is perhaps more significant&#151;the direction signalled in
Government rhetoric.</div>

pm</div><a name="08052281000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
appears to be saying in the proposals that individuals should not take
risks; that, if they have an income from an established business or
employment, they should not risk any of it. If they do take risks, that
will be entirely at their own risk, and they will be taxed on the gross
income from those other sources, rather than on the net income at the
end of the process after taking into account losses incurred through
investments made in genuine commercial ventures. I would differentiate
between genuine commercial ventures and contrived arrangements. The
Opposition believe that section 66 of the Income Tax Act 2007 already
provides sufficient protection against contrived arrangements where
HMRC can show that a business has been established for reasons other
than generating a profit and running a commercial
enterprise.</div><a name="08052281000132"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000477"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Regrettably, the presumption behind the sideways
loss-relief provisions proposed in schedule 21 seems to be that
individuals are trying to take HMRC for a ride. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly pointed out in his extensive
contribution, the Opposition do not wish to allow contrived schemes to
go through, and it is quite right that they be stopped. However, the
Government perhaps fail to understand simply how haphazard and lacking
in calculation many new business ventures are. As he pointed out, in a
world in which more and more people are entering consultancy work,
running their own, and expanding, businesses, forming different
partnerships and, therefore, receiving different income streams to help
kick off those businesses, there is a real worry that a particularly
eagle-eyed HMRC inspector could make such business expansion, which we
all recognise to be in the interest of UK plc, ever more
difficult.</div>
<a name="08052281000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
many such businesses are not contrived, but some individuals develop
their businesses haphazardly. As my hon. Friend said, a business might
start in someone&#146;s garage and take up just a couple of hours at
the weekend but, as the excitement and buzz of the new idea grow, so
the business might take up ever more time and costs&#151;both
absolute and opportunity costs. It would be wrong if people setting up
such businesses, many of which are in the service sector, are unable to
utilise some of the sideways loss-relief provisions for business
ventures that are already up and running. It is feared that the
Government do not recognise how much change there is in the world of
work. Individuals are no longer simply employees or self-employed.
There is now much more of a mix, and people are willing to develop new
ideas. Just as it would be wrong to encourage contrived schemes to
avoid paying tax, we should, as far as we can, encourage provision for
those individuals who are willing to take risks to be properly rewarded
within the context of the tax
scheme.</div><a name="08052281000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
136 makes it clear that out-and-out contrivances are not right. Neither
the Treasury nor the Opposition would support them. The amendment
states that the trade should not be carried on</div>
<a name="08052281000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with the intention of generating
a loss for tax avoidance purposes.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052281000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I fear that the authorities
believe that everything involved in setting up new businesses is far
more regimented and organised than it probably is. We should do nothing
to discourage that entrepreneurial spirit.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000478"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> HMRC has received evidence through the disclosure
regime and other means that there is up to &#163;1 billion of
avoidance activity through this scheme. The measure follows action
taken against partnership avoidance last year, and the scored yield
reflects this: the projected revenue that we are protecting is
&#163;245 million, &#163;80 million and &#163;50 million in the
next three successive years.</div>
<a name="08052281000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052281000479"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): The Minister said that there
was &#163;1 billion-worth of avoidance activity in this area, yet the
figures for the next three years come to less than half of that sum.
Can she reconcile the two
statements?</div><a name="08052281000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000480"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My advice is that that is the clear activity in
this scheme, which is why the UK Film Council was very concerned to
make sure that robust action was taken. I will provide a specific
answer to the point made by the hon. Gentleman in a moment. It is
important for the Committee to understand that this is not an
unexpected response from the Government. Deloitte, in its full Budget
commentary,
said:</div><a name="08052281000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
change was expected and shows how HMRC has benefited from the
information received under the disclosure regime.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052281000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is working, and the UK Film
Council
states:</div><a name="08052281000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have made clear over and over again that the Government will take
action against tax avoidance schemes and that&#146;s what
they&#146;ve done today.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052281000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000481"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am not quite sure why the Minister is quoting
the UK Film Council, as they are the only people who are exempt from
the impact of the Bill. I made it clear that we would support measures
to deal with contrived avoidance arrangements. I asked her to give
examples of this scheme that allow a contrived arrangement that can be
distinguished from the ordinary, commercial activity to which my hon.
Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and I referred.
She talked about &#163;1 billion, so there must be quite a lot of it.
I should be grateful if she could explain how it
works.</div><a name="08052281000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000482"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If the hon. Gentleman allows me to develop my
argument, I will explain exactly how I arrived at my view that this is
the right action to take. The hon. Gentlemen has made a reasonable
argument and asked a reasonable series of questions&#151;questions
which I, too, ask when I decide whether an avoidance scheme of this
nature should be tackled in this way.</div>
<a name="08052281000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was quoting the UK Film
Council, and I will address directly the point that the hon. Gentleman
made about it in a moment. The council said that it had made it clear
that action would be taken. It went on to
say:</div><a name="08052281000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The only
specific tax relief for the production of films is the film tax relief,
which has been structured to help filmmakers. Everything else has a
large health warning attached to
it.&#148;</div><a name="08052281000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was its quote on the day. The provision concerns only losses that arise
from the old film tax reliefs for films completed before 31 December
2006, or for films in production on 1 January 2007, which are subject
to the transitional rules. We had a pre-existing commitment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>to those films. The restrictions will apply to film losses generally,
except those covered by the transitional arrangements.</div>
<a name="08052281000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman seems to
think that the measure is retrospective. Neither the operation of the
purpose test nor the annual limit is retrospective. The purpose test
applies to arrangements made on or after Budget day&#151;12 March
2008. The annual limit applies to a loss with a basis period ending on
or after 12 March. This targeted and proportionate anti-avoidance
measure is designed to prevent aggressive avoidance. However, I have
acknowledged that there is some justice in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument that it is possible&#151;I have been concerned about
this&#151;that the measure will have an impact on a small number of
non-avoiding, sole-trader businesses. I shall say more about that in a
minute.</div><a name="08052281000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000483"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I am interested to hear more. Given that there is
allegedly a &#163;1 billion problem, will the Financial Secretary
give specific examples of the contrived schemes that are getting away
with it, but which will be caught under schedule 21? I would like an
idea of the type of contrivances that she has in
mind.</div><a name="08052281000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000484"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I am advised that we do not identify individual
schemes. The schemes that we are discussing are used by wealthy
individuals to access large losses that they set against other income
or gains. Large up-front losses are generated by exploiting the capital
allowances rules and special tax reliefs and generally accepted
accounting practices that provide accelerated deductions for
expenditure. The individuals concerned use the losses to reduce their
tax liability. I can give the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster examples of the features that are regarded as completely
unacceptable.</div><a name="08052281000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000485"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The Financial Secretary mentioned &#147;wealthy
individuals&#148; who are creating very large losses for the purposes
of offsetting in the way that she described. Can we take that as an
assurance from her that people such as small entrepreneurs setting up
their own consultancy business while in full-time employment to see
whether an idea will run will not be caught under schedule 21? That is
the reassurance that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge and I
seek.</div><a name="08052281000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000486"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will come to that in a moment, but first I
would like to deal with one or two other points. However, I hope that I
will be able to give the hon. Gentlemen that
assurance.</div><a name="08052281000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Examples of
other unacceptable features include: inflating the loss relief by the
use of loans so that the relief exceeds the money contributed by the
individual; and the buying of an asset by an overseas intermediary in a
tax haven at a price far in excess of historical costs. There are other
examples. On this issue, there is probably no difference between us.
The debate relates to the proper concern about whether innocents would
be affected by the measure, and I hope to offer some reassurance on
that issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div><a name="08052281000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed measure will still
allow non-active sole traders to set up to &#163;25,000 of losses
sideways, with any unrelieved losses going forward against future
profits. When genuine businesses make losses in the initial years, that
will be on the expectation of profit in future years, the tax on which
can be reduced by carrying forward the remainder of the losses not
covered by the &#163;25,000 limit. That concern was raised by the
Chartered Institute of Taxation. This measure does not prevent losses
from being set against profits from the same trade. An individual will
not, therefore, be taxed on more than 100 per cent. of their net
profits after losses from the same trade over the life of the
trade.</div><a name="08052281000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000487"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The point made was that an individual could find
that they were being taxed effectively on 100 per cent. of their income
in a given year. The Financial Secretary rightly says that losses can
be carried forward for use in the same trade, but that does not reflect
the reality of somebody struggling to start up a business. It is of no
help telling someone in that situation that he cannot pay the gas bill
this year, but that he should not worry, because he can offset his
losses against his massive profits in three years&#146; time. That
shows once again that the Government do not understand the problems
facing small businesses and
entrepreneurs.</div><a name="08052281000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="08052281000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000488"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I am assured that that will not be the impact. As
always, I listen to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s arguments because his
work is thorough. I have already accepted that there is some concern,
and I have looked at that carefully. However, there will not be many
individuals who carry on that kind of business on their own account in
a non-active capacity&#151;I will say more about the 10 hours in a
moment&#151;who make losses substantially in excess of &#163;25,000
and have other income significantly above that figure against which
sideways loss relief could be claimed. They will still be able to claim
genuine losses of up to &#163;25,000 against their other income and
gains, and where losses are not immediately relievable they are not
lost but can be set against income from the business for other years. I
hear that the hon. Gentleman says that that is not realistic, but we
have to balance the benefit of preserving unlimited relief for a small
number of genuine non-active traders against the cost of the
exploitation of the relief, which is a
problem.</div><a name="08052281000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000489"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will the Financial Secretary give
way?</div><a name="08052281000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000490"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If I could just demonstrate the reality of that,
the revenue figures that I quoted earlier are for this year&#146;s
measure. The &#163;1 billion refers to the total sideways loss relief
avoidance being closed down both this year and last
year.</div><a name="08052281000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000491"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000492"></a>Jane

say.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div><a name="08052281000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000493"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Perhaps it is easier if we deal with the issues
as they come up, and as the Financial Secretary responds to them. She
said that we have to balance the risk of damaging genuine sole traders
and entrepreneurs against the risk to the revenue of abuse of the
process. I say that we do not have to make that trade-off. We can
target the legislation by introducing a motive test. None of us had
suggested that people abusing the film tax credit scheme to siphon off
hundreds of millions of pounds should not be dealt with, but she asks
us to believe that it is beyond the Government&#146;s capability to
target the measure on contrived arrangements involving film tax credit
claims. She could do that if she put her mind to it, and avoid
overspill of the measure affecting entrepreneurs and start-up
businesses in a way that she says she does not intend, and about which
we have grave
concerns.</div><a name="08052281000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000494"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will come to the question of a motive test. I
fear that we will not agree, although I had
hoped&#151;</div><a name="08052281000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000495"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am interested in the Financial Secretary&#146;s
argument about the &#163;25,000 relief. That is an interesting
starting point, but why is it so
low?</div><a name="08052281000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000496"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> In looking to take anti-avoidance measures for
this scheme, I was advised that on balance that was the best level at
which to pitch the relief. We were satisfied that the &#163;25,000
limit struck the right balance. It must prevent avoidance activity, but
allow most individuals to remain unaffected. We will keep the amount
under review. We are dealing with a particularly aggressive form of
avoidance, where promoters have consistently adapted their schemes to
challenge the intention of existing legislation. We had to deal with
that last year when we looked at partnerships. Reliance on a motive
test, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge suggests, would be
impractical and would give rise to unacceptable cost and risk. I will
say more in a
moment.</div><a name="08052281000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one or
two more comments on the 10-hour rule. Many people involved in the
avoidance schemes have no active involvement with the business. The
10-hour rule strikes a fair balance between allowing genuine
part-timers to carry on without any effect, while ensuring that tax
avoiders are not successful. The 10-hour rule has applied in the case
of previous restrictions on partnership losses since 2004. It has
proved an effective and practical test and I have no reason to believe
that what the hon. Gentleman suggests would prove to be true.</div>
<a name="08052281000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose test, which we
propose, refers to arrangements made for the purpose of obtaining a
reduction in tax. Whether there are avoidance arrangements is a factual
matter. There will be many instances where the focus of the loss maker
was not tax avoidance and relief will be due. Past experience of the
abuse of sideways loss relief has made it abundantly clear that
avoiders will take all possible steps to disguise the avoidance as
commercial, and that a motive test will not deter them.</div>
<a name="08052281000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wondered how the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would work, as on
my understanding it is not technically correct. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>Trade loss relief is not available unless the trade is commercial. If a
trade is carried on with the intention of making a loss, it would not
be commercial and trading losses would not be allowable. The test would
make the annual limit restriction redundant as there would be no losses
to restrict if the trade was not commercial. That is an incredibly
logical argument against the amendment.</div>
<a name="08052281000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need a mechanism that will
deter promoters from instigating such schemes and individuals from
entering into them. The annual limit provides that extra deterrent by
making it uneconomic to challenge the intention of the legislation. The
proposed amendment would make the annual limit apply only when a trade
is carried on with the intention of generating a loss for tax-avoidance
purposes. Where that is the case, there is no need for an annual limit
as losses would not be allowed because the trade is not commercial. It
would not provide the necessary deterrent and it would give rise to
unacceptable levels of cost and risk in enforcing the application of
the motive and purpose tests.</div>
<a name="08052281000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am convinced that the right
combination is a purpose test and the annual limit of &#163;25,000
provided for in the clause. I have a slim hope that the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge will accept my response to his argument and
that he will agree to withdraw the amendment. If not, I shall ask my
hon. Friends to oppose it and support the
schedule.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000497"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> This is an important debate and the Committee
stage is designed for exactly this purpose. At one level, what the
Financial Secretary says is entirely reassuring. She tells the
Committee that the measure is designed only to deal with artificial
schemes being marketed to high-net-worth individuals using film tax
credits. Our concerns relate entirely and exclusively to the impact of
such measures on people who are not involved in any way in such
schemes.</div> <a name="08052281000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could
stand here, think that I have misunderstood the whole thing and accept
the Financial Secretary&#146;s reassurances at face value. The
problem is that all the outside bodies who have drawn attention to the
problems and the risks implicit in schedule 21, have not understood it
in the way that she has presented it. Let me ask the Financial
Secretary a specific question. At the beginning of her remarks she said
that this related to the abuse of film tax credits only. That is why
she mentioned the UK Film Council. In the schedule, there is no
reference to the provision applying only to arrangements that involve
the use of film tax credits. If it said that in the schedule, this
debate would not have taken place and none of the concerns would have
arisen. However, it does not say anything about film tax credits,
except that authorised film funding arrangements are excluded from the
scope of the provisions. Were she able to confirm for the record that
in practice only arrangements involving film tax credits will be caught
by the provisions, even if that means telling the Committee that the
Revenue will use its discretion so that those who are not involved with
film tax credits are not caught by the legislation, I would feel quite
satisfied. I do not know whether my hon. Friends would agree.</div>
<a name="08052281000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary also mentioned in the course of her last remarks that the
Government were proposing a purpose test. She implied that their
purpose test was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>superior to my motive test and that therefore the amendment was
unnecessary. I can see the purpose test in relation to the disallowance
of relief altogether under new section 74B, but my understanding is
that there is no purpose test in new section 74A&#151;if there is one
and she can draw my attention to it, I stand to be corrected. It is
precisely because new section 74A does not appear to be limited by an
effective purpose test that we have sought to reinforce the existing
provisions of section 66 of the Income Tax Act 2007 with the
introduction of the motive test in amendment No. 136.</div>
<a name="08052281000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are genuinely seeking after
the truth. It may be that the schedule will not impact the serial
entrepreneur who has never been anywhere near a film or any film
funding arrangement, has never purchased an avoidance or tax-planning
scheme from a firm of accountants and is simply someone who
has established a small business and gone on to establish another and
another; or, to take a different example, a highly paid investment
banker in the City who, instead of consuming all his income on
expensive champagne, decides to use some of it to start a business.
That business might not trade successfully in its first year and might
incur losses of &#163;50,000, &#163;60,000 or &#163;100,000,
which that individual might be reassured can be set against his
six-figure income from his employment. It is those sorts of cases that
we seek to protect and if the Minister can assure us in those terms we
will be satisfied, but I have not heard such an assurance yet. I will
be grateful if she can provide that assurance in the fullness of time,
but if she cannot we shall have to press the amendment to a Division
and resist the inclusion of the schedule, precisely because of our
concerns about the unintended consequences of the
measure.</div>
<a name="08052281000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000498"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I do not know whether I am supposed to ask leave
of the Committee to take a second chance. Although it will not help to
reconcile the differences, it will be helpful to the Committee if I
clarify that the measure that we are debating applies to trades
generally, except to old film reliefs and Lloyd&#146;s. I do not know
whether that offers the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks.
The purpose test that he said he was looking for is in new section 74B.
I undertake to study carefully the representations that he has made
this afternoon and test them against the advice that I have had, but I
cannot give him any further assurances at the
moment.</div>
<a name="08052281000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000499"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> To deal with the purpose test first, as I said, I
see it in new section 74B, but that deals with the disallowance of any
relief at all. It does not disapply the cap where mischievous purpose
is not
present.</div><a name="08052281000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div> <a name="08052281000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is our
concern: even where there is no relevant tax avoidance arrangement, the
&#163;25,000 cap will still apply. Despite the Minister&#146;s
statement that the measures will apply only to the abuse of film tax
credits, the Government have created a juggernaut. She says that
&#163;1 billion in tax is at risk from the abuse of film tax credits,
but the measures are not tailored  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>tightly to deal with film tax credits. Perhaps they could include a
reference to the use of film tax credits. I do not see why not, as the
film tax credit scheme is a specific scheme and, as far as I am aware,
no similar arrangements could be substituted by those trying to develop
avoidance schemes.</div><a name="08052281000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have created a juggernaut to deal with the problem as they
perceive it, and the Minister appears supremely unconcerned that along
the way it will run down innocent entrepreneurs who are struggling or
planning to start up businesses and seeking reassurance that if they
make a loss, they will at least be able to offset it against profits
from other businesses or earnings from employment. The &#163;25,000
limit, although it will provide some reassurance to those operating at
the bottom end on a small scale, will not really help where any
larger-scale business operation is involved, particularly where capital
investment is being made and amounts up to the new annual allowance
might thus be available in the first years of a new business, in
addition to any trading losses, to offset against other income
streams.</div> <a name="08052281000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister cannot offer us any further assurance, I must ask my hon.
Friends to vote in favour of the amendment and against the schedule as
it stands. If anything, her remarks have heightened my concerns. It is
clear that there is a purpose that will drive HMRC in applying the
measures&#151;trying to shut down abuse of the film tax credit is a
perfectly legitimate purpose&#151;but it is equally clear that the
Government have not succeeded in making their intervention a targeted
one. There will be collateral damage, and we must make a stand to
protect those who would suffer from
it.</div><a name="08052281000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put,

<a name="08052281000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000538"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Briefly, the clause will amend the wording of a
provision that was introduced only in the Income Tax Act 2007. The
situation is becoming ludicrous. The Government thought that the
definition in that Act was right, but now they are introducing the
additional provisions that we have just discussed in schedule 21. They
have a different definition, and wish to go back and change the
definition that they introduced last year. Why can they not think ahead
so that we do not constantly have to revise legislation that we have
recently passed? More specifically, what caused the Financial Secretary
to decide that the new definition in schedule 21 should be applied in
the 2007 Act rather than import the 2007 definition into schedule 21?
Why have they decided that they got the development of the definition
in the 2007 Act wrong?</div>
<a name="08052281000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000539"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> To a degree, this is a continuation of the
previous debate. The change that we are discussing ensures that the
measures that we were forced to put in place last year to tackle the
continued misuse of sideways loss relief for tax avoidance purposes are
consistent in this Finance Bill and the last for partners and sole
traders. The clause aligns the definition of non-active partner for the
purposes of restrictions on sideways loss relief with the new
definition of non-active capacity for individuals other than partners.
As we discussed in the last debate, the existing 10-hour rule requires
an individual to spend an average of at least 10 hours a week
personally engaged in activities carried on for the purposes of the
trade. I have said that that has proved to be effective and a
practicable test, but increasingly, avoiders are undertaking activities
with no commercial value and claiming that they are for the purposes of
the trade.</div><a name="08052281000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
that we need to keep amending the definition is that avoiders continue
to push the boundaries of the definitions and to find ways around them.
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asks why we should import
one definition instead of the other. We are making this change so that
we can use the definition that we believe is effective and will work.
We believe that it will deter attempts to circumvent the rules. I hope
that clause 58 will be supported and will be put on the statute
book.</div><a name="08052281000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

income being delivered in a form that is non-taxable. The schedule will
cover schemes relating to disguised interest where arrangements are
entered into to avoid tax on returns that are economically equivalent
to interest. It will cover the factoring of rents under a lease of
plant and machinery, which makes rental receipts not subject to
taxation.</div><a name="08052281000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="08052281000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government originally proposed in a consultation document of December
2007 that broadly drafted principles-based legislation would be
introduced from 1 April 2008 to counter avoidance relating
to disguised interest and sales of income streams&#151;that is to say
the factoring of leasing income. That consultation prompted a
widespread concern among practitioners that the proposals were very
broad and were likely to be drafted in a way that would create high
degrees of uncertainty for taxpayers and once again give HMRC excessive
discretion to interpret the law as it sees fit. Recognising that they
cannot afford to inflict any more damage on the UK&#146;s reputation
as a stable and predictable place to do business, the Government have
bowed to pressure from the professional bodies and deferred the
introduction of the new disguised interest rules until 2009. I hope
that the time between now and then will be used for proper consultation
in an attempt to ensure some certainty about the measures when they are
introduced. Unless the Minister tells us otherwise, the Committee must
operate on the presumption that the measures will have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>a life of one year only and that we must expect alternative,
principle-based arrangements to be introduced under the Finance Bill
2009 amending what will become the Finance Act 2008.</div>
<a name="08052281000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendments Nos. 137
and 138. Paragraph 3 of schedule 22 will insert proposed new section 1A
into paragraph 1 of schedule 9 to the Finance Act 1996, and
is designed to counter certain arrangements, particularly those
involving cross-border financing debt transactions, whereby payments
corresponding economically to interest are treated as distributions and
therefore fall outside the scope of the UK tax system. The proposed new
section applies where amounts would otherwise constitute</div>
<a name="08052281000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a distribution in respect of a
loan relationship&#148;.</div><a name="08052281000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the provisions, such avoidance techniques will be countered by a
one-sided tax charge. The relevant amount paid by a UK resident company
is treated as a non-deductible distribution for its tax computation
purposes, but a UK resident recipient company will find that the
payment is treated as taxable. However, overseas resident company are
not be affected in the same way, which is the situation that the
legislation is designed to counter. As I understand it, however, where
a payment is received by a UK resident company, there will be a
lop-sided, asymmetrical tax
treatment.</div><a name="08052281000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed new section is very broad in its potential application, in
part because the arrangements to which it can apply are defined by
reference to the broad definition of tax
advantage&#151;</div><a name="08052281000239"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000547"></a>The

thank him for keeping the Committee quorate. That is certainly
something that the Government should keep their eyes on. Had it not
been for his good grace, the Committee would have been
inquorate.</div><a name="08052281000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000548"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> During my 11 years in this place, people have
resorted to various techniques to shut me up, but I do not remember
anyone ever seeking to make a Committee inquorate to do so. I am
grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough, but
unfortunately he might have established a
precedent.</div><a name="08052281000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was saying that the application of the proposed new section is very
broad. The arrangements to which it can apply are defined by reference
to the definition of tax advantage in section 840ZA of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988, whereas the target of this Bill is, or
should be, arrangements where a tax advantage is derived from the
treatment of the relevant amount as a distribution, rather than as
interest on a loan relationship. I have some sympathy with
HMRC&#146;s approach. I suspect that that approach underlay our
disagreement over schedule 21. I understand that people charged with
undoing tax avoidance opportunities tend to prefer broader legislation,
which will be one step ahead of the avoidance industry. However, the
danger with that is that we get broadly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>drafted legislation, which may have unintended consequences
specifically. More generally, that plays to what I am afraid is
becoming an important theme: the UK is no longer a clear, certain place
to do business, with a tax code that is easily understandable and
applied consistently. As the UK tax code has got longer and more
complex&#151;it has doubled in length under the Government&#151;it
has become more and more difficult for people to predict how they will
be treated. Uncertainty is a cost of business: uncertainty about the
application of the tax code is as much a cost to be factored in to an
investment decision as an extra tax. The complexity of the tax system
has the negative impact for the economy of additional tax, without the
positive aspect for the Exchequer of an additional tax. It is the worst
of all worlds, moving us one stage further down the road of
international
uncompetitiveness.</div><a name="08052281000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendments is to limit the new provision to its intended
target. Amendment No. 138 specifically narrows the definition of
&#147;tax advantage&#148; to one arising from the
&#147;amount&#148; being &#147;treated as a distribution&#148;.
It also seeks to ensure that the tax treatment is symmetrical in cases
where the new rules could apply to transactions between UK resident
companies. Amendment No. 137 includes reference to
&#147;credits&#148; as well as &#147;debits&#148;, so that we
ensure that there is symmetrical treatment. When a debit is taken out
of calculation for the purposes of the tax computation of the paying
company, then the corresponding credit is also taken out of the
computation for the purposes of calculating the tax liability of the
recipient
company.</div><a name="08052281000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments go some way towards refocusing the clause on its original
intention. I stress to the Minister that we are not seeking to change
the intended impact of the provisions&#151;this is not a wrecking
amendment. It is intended to give her an opportunity to reassure the
Committee that the focus of the intended clampdown is narrow and is not
intended to create an asymmetric treatment where the payment is made
between two UK companies. Frankly, it might help her to bring some
political clout to bear, ensuring that the understandable official
preference for wider drafting is not allowed to prevail, but rather
political common sense and the Government&#146;s own political
agenda. While the Government seek to close down tax avoidance, they are
also seeking to maintain the competitiveness of British business and,
by implication, the clarity and certainty of our tax code&#151;that
agenda prevails over the official convenience agenda, which HMRC quite
understandably will always
push.</div><a name="08052281000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000549"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Work on principles-based legislation is ongoing
for the Finance Bill 2009 and will, as the hon. Gentleman suggests,
replace possibly much of the detailed legislation. I hope that I can
reassure him that this legislation only applies where there is a tax
avoidance motive. If there is no such motive, the legislation does not
apply. The principles-based legislation on which we are consulting
seeks a simpler approach to countering tax avoidance.</div>
<a name="08052281000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s regular attack on the length of the tax code, I will
say that the tax law rewrite group has been involved in a major piece
of work. I have debated that with officials within the Department since
taking up the post, and it has become clear to me that using simpler
language and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>breaking up the density of tax law to make it easier to understand and
more accessible has led to greater length, but also to the benefit of
clarity.</div>
<a name="08052281000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC has been
notified of a number of schemes that involve companies designing
securities so that they are treated as paying distributions rather than
interest. The amounts paid are equal to the returns that would be paid
on an investment at interest but are claimed to be non-taxable because
of the distributions rules. The debtor company will generally be party
to an arrangement that allows it to obtain a tax deduction for the
amount treated as a distribution, or it is unconcerned about whether it
obtains such a deduction because it has losses and does not pay tax. On
Budget day, we announced that we were countering those schemes by
removing the tax-exempt status of distributions from loans where the
distributions arise in consequence of or in connection with any
arrangements that have as one of their main purposes the production of
a tax advantage for any
person.</div><a name="08052281000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot accept the amendments proposed. If amendment No. 137 were
accepted, companies would be allowed to obtain deductions for payments
that are currently non-deductible because they are classified as
distributions when paid in connection with tax-avoidance arrangements.
That would provide companies with a fiscal incentive to facilitate
tax-avoidance, based upon their entering into arrangements that are
designed to allow another company to avoid corporation tax. Amendment
No. 138 would confine the effect of the changes to one form of
tax-avoidance where the tax advantage arises from treating interest as
a distribution. In practice, it is highly likely that the tax advantage
would arise from treating the interest as a distribution, but there is
no reason to restrict the rule to such cases. For instance, if the tax
advantage arose from some other aspect of the arrangement, such as a
tax distribution being sought for a drop in the value of the loan
relationship caused by the payment of the distribution, there is no
reason for the new rule not to apply. Companies not actively engaging
in tax-avoidance have nothing to fear from the changes.</div>
<a name="08052281000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">After that short debate, I hope
that I have been able to reassure the hon. Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge and that he will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="08052281000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000550"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am not sure that I quite follow the penultimate
paragraph of the Minister&#146;s speech, but I will look at it in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>. Once again, she made a perfectly reasonable case, but I
think that I, too, made a perfectly reasonable case. Members of the
official Opposition are not saying that we want to protect artificial
arrangements that give rise to artificial tax savings. She has
acknowledged that it is likely that the abuse that she wants to target
arises from the treatment of an amount as a distribution, but our sole
concern is that by drafting the legislation widely and being unwilling
to confine herself to a narrow definition, she is running the risk of
collateral damage, and that is a recurrent theme.</div>
<a name="08052281000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all agree about the 99.5 per
cent., but on the one hand, we disagree on whether we should say,
&#147;Keep it narrow and run the risk that next year you will have to
put something else in place if someone somehow gets into the last half
per cent. and levers it open.&#148; On the other hand, she is saying
&#147;Well, I don&#146;t really care if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>there is some collateral damage and a few people we didn&#146;t intend
to be caught by the measure are unfairly caught by it, because we have
a bigger job to do in shutting down a tax avoidance
scheme.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052281000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="08052281000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
difference in approach that reflects how one views the relationship
between the citizen and the state. If we are of the view that it is
important to maintain the balance and not allow the state always to
take the over-mighty approach, we should err on the side of caution and
apply anti-avoidance legislation that is properly targeted at the
abuses that are occurring. We know, because the Minister has told us,
that if other abuses open up, she has powers to intervene rapidly and,
if necessary, retrospectively to the date of an announcement, to expand
the scope of anti-avoidance legislation. However, such a generalised
approach that does not target specific mischief runs the risk of
causing collateral
damage.</div><a name="08052281000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that we will return to this theme. I shall not detain the
Committee by pressing the amendments, but I hope that the right hon.
Lady will consider the general theme&#151;I know that she thinks
about such things&#151;and challenge her own officials on whether the
measures are necessary. My hon. Friends and I have not dreamed up
politically motivated points; by and large, they reflect points that
have been raised in discussion, particularly with the professional
bodies, which see the potential for unintended consequences.</div>
<a name="08052281000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister thinks back to
our discussions today, she will recall that on at least one
occasion&#151;in the Finance Act 2007&#151;she had to introduce
legislation to correct unintended consequences and ensure that
the taxpayer was not disadvantaged vis- -vis the
Government&#146;s intentions. I give her notice that we will come
back to the matter later in the Bill&#146;s progress, but I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000551"></a>The

Government amendment No.
128.</div><a name="08052281000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000552"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister is making a good attempt at
progress, but I am afraid that she will have to work for her
ministerial salary.</div><a name="08052281000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we have been discussing tax law rewrites and making things nice and
plain, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to Government amendment
No. 128. Proposed new paragraph (2D) of schedule 9 to the Finance Act
1996
says:</div><a name="08052281000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
paragraph does not apply
where&#151;</div><a name="08052281000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the
transferor company is party to arrangements...in circumstances in
which this paragraph would not apply&#148;.</div>
<a name="08052281000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the paragraph will not apply in
circumstances in which it will not apply. To me, that does not sound
like the kind of plain English of which the tax law rewrite project
would approve. I cannot understand what the words at the end of new
paragraph (2D)(a) mean when read in conjunction with the words at the
opening of paragraph (2D).</div>
<a name="08052281000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall leave
the Minister to ponder that for a moment. The changes introduced by the
amendments are, as I understand it, designed to block tax planning
where financial assets are sold without the market value of the
proceeds being taxed and, effectively, without their being recognised.
Of course we support measures to deal with any non-commercial,
non-arm&#146;s-length transaction that gives rise to a tax advantage.
However, the wording of new paragraph 11B, which is inserted by
amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>No. 127 into schedule 9 of the Finance Act 1996, could apply more widely
than the right hon. Lady thinks&#151;we go back to our familiar
theme&#151;and could catch normal commercial transactions where a
loan is exchanged for shares in a company, for example because of a
debt for equity swap. This is not an artificial transaction. This could
be a transaction where, because of the financial condition of the
borrower, the provider of the loan has no alternative but to exchange
the debt for equity. Companies holding such loans would be taxed if
they had a relevant avoidance intention, defined as the intention not
to be taxed on the loan interest receivable.</div>
<a name="08052281000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
any debt for equity swap will result in an instrument giving rise to
taxable income&#151;the loan&#151;being replaced with an instrument
that is taxed on a capital gains basis&#151;the shares&#151;there
is a concern that this provision will catch normal transactions.
&#147;Normal&#148; is perhaps not the right term, as a debt for
equity swap is fairly unusual, but it is a perfectly legitimate
commercial transaction. Moreover, given the present conditions in the
credit market, we might expect to see more forced debt equity swaps in
the near future.</div>
<a name="08052281000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is therefore a concern
that a normal commercial transaction which replaces a loan with shares
could easily be argued to have a purpose of avoiding tax on the loan
income. When one swaps interest-bearing debt for equity, one surrenders
the opportunity, albeit theoretical, of receiving interest on the loan.
I should be pleased to hear the Minister&#146;s specific answer to
those questions. Can she reassure the Committee that this unintended
consequence will not
arise?</div><a name="08052281000265"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000553"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I have said before in Committee, in that
well-known Liverpool phrase, &#147;God loves a tryer&#148;, and I
did seek to try it on. Amendments Nos. 127 and 128 address two
interchangeable avoidance schemes. It is estimated that unless both
schemes are closed, the loss of tax will be &#163;200 million per
annum. The two schemes have been disclosed to HMRC under disclosure
rules. The rules for taxing companies on their loans and derivatives
are accounts based, with the result that profits are generally
chargeable to tax only if the profits are recognised in the accounts in
accordance with generally accepted accounting
practice.</div><a name="08052281000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">One scheme
that has been disclosed allows companies to sell their loans and
derivatives without triggering recognition of any accounting profit.
Amendment No. 127 prevents a scheme from working where a loan or
derivative is sold in return for shares. Then for tax purposes the full
market value of the shares will have to be brought into account as the
sale proceeds. But to ensure that this does not apply in inappropriate
circumstances, the amendment can operate only where the disposal is
made with the object of reducing the profits to be brought into
account.</div><a name="08052281000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about transfer. I am grateful
to him for drawing my attention to paragraph 3B. There is an
explanation but, frankly, it is quite complicated and it is probably
better if I write to the Committee about that. I shall deal with the
second scheme which has been disclosed to HMRC. It also aims to allow
companies to realise profits without attracting a tax charge. As the
hon. Gentleman will know, the rules for taxing companies&#146; loans
and derivatives have group continuity divisions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div><a name="08052281000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the newly notified scheme,
companies with derivative contracts or loans with a market value in
excess of their historic cost and their accounts carrying value sell
the contracts or loans at full value to a partnership of which the
other members are fellow group companies. That gives rise to an
accounting profit to the transferor, but it is claimed that that profit
is not taxable because the group neutrality rules apply. Subsequently,
another company joins the partnership in return for making a
contribution to the capital of the partnership equal in value to the
asset transferred to that partnership. The new partner then becomes
entitled to virtually all of the partnership&#146;s profits,
including any rights in respect of the asset. That means that, in
substance, the asset has been sold to the new partner, but it is
claimed that no tax charge arises.</div>
<a name="08052281000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendment No. 128
prevents that scheme from working. The group neutrality rules will not
apply where the transfer of an asset to which those rules would
otherwise apply is made as part of an arrangement that aims ultimately
to transfer the asset outside the group. Again, to ensure
that that does not happen in inappropriate circumstances, the amendment
can operate only where the disposal is designed to avoid
tax.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000554"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am sorry to break the Minister&#146;s flow,
but I would like to take her back to the first part of what she said.
The Minister sought to reassure the Committee that the provisions would
apply only where the activity is designed to reduce or eliminate
taxable interest. I am seeking confirmation that that could not be
deemed to have arisen because of a debt/equity swap and that a
debt/equity swap per se would not be treated as a transaction designed
to eliminate what would otherwise be taxable interest
payments.</div><a name="08052281000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000555"></a>Jane

that I get this right. I will study <i class="I">Ha</i><i class="I">nsard</i><i class="I"> </i>and
read both what he and I have said to ensure that I have been clear. In
a standard debt/equity swap there is no intention of reducing taxable
profits&#151;although that might be an effect, it is not the
intention. Therefore, the legislation would not
apply.</div>
<a name="08052281000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000556"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> So, if I hold a loan note from company X that
entitles me to receive &#163;10,000 a year interest, which will be
taxable in my hands, and I agree to swap it for equity in company X,
which may or may not give rise to dividends, but certainly will not
give rise to taxable interest payments, then that will not be regarded
as an act taken to avoid tax on that interest stream. If that is what
the Minister is saying, I think that that satisfies the concerns
raised.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000557"></a>Jane

area, but that is my understanding of the arrangements. I have already
explained Government amendment No. 127. Government amendment No. 128
will prevent the second scheme from working. I hear the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the unintended consequences of some of
this work. I am following this carefully and I hear the theme that he
is developing as we go through the Bill. I am satisfied that the
anti-avoidance action is necessary. As I have said, the schemes that
Government amendments Nos. 127 and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>128 deal with are interchangeable. Unless both schemes are closed, the
loss of tax is estimated at &#163;200 million per annum. Therefore, I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000560"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The main object of the provisions is to prevent
the rules in the Finance Act 1996 under which certain shares are
treated as debt from being manipulated deliberately to create
artificial debits by reference to a fall in the fair value of the
relevant shares. The Bill deals with the issue by denying the holder of
such shares any debits under the loan relationship rules. That is fair
enough. We have no dispute with the purpose of the provision, only with
the fact that it is too
broad.</div><a name="08052281000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all debits
are denied, a holder may, for example, be taxed on a fair value
increase representing an interest accrual, but will be unable
subsequently to claim relief if the return becomes unrealisable because
the underlying debt is impaired. He will, in effect, have been taxed on
the accrual of the interest when it was expected that it would be paid,
but be unable to obtain an unwinding of the tax effect if that debt
becomes impaired and it is apparent that he will not receive the
payment.</div><a name="08052281000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 139, 140 and 141 would address the issue by allowing debits when
credits have previously been brought into account. It is a restrictive
set of circumstances, but something that seems entirely equitable. It
would provide appropriate protection for the Exchequer by limiting the
debits that are available in respect of such shares to amounts that are
equal in aggregate to the amount of credit previously brought into
account under the loan relationship rules. Our amendments would limit
the scope of the changes so that they are more appropriately targeted.
They would reflect circumstances when in a loan relationship debits
would be allowed. When that would be the case in a loan relationship
and the matter at issue was the fair value of shares, such measures
would ensure that the debit was allowed to reflect the unwinding of a
position that had previously given rise to an increase in value that
causes a credit.</div><a name="08052281000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister accepts that the amendments are intended to deal
with circumstances in which the schedule would be unfair to the
taxpayer. I am interested to hear her
comments.</div>
<a name="08052281000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000561"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We announced on Budget day that we intended to
introduce a package of measures to amend existing legislation known as
the shares as debt rules. One of the changes was that, when the shares
as debt rules apply, no losses may be brought into account in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>respect of any share to which the rules apply. That was in response to a
number of schemes notified to HMC that were designed to create
artificial losses through the use of intra-group, depreciatory
transactions.</div><a name="08052281000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the amendments might be of a probing nature, but they
would qualify the rule preventing relief for losses by providing that
debits should still be allowed to the extent that they do not exceed
profits that have previously been taxed in respect of the share in
question. If a profit of, say, 10 is taxed in year 1, the amendment
would mean that the company could claim relief for a debit of up to 10
in year 2. Shares as debt rules would apply only if the shares
increased in value in the same way as interest, so debits will not
arise in normal
cases.</div><a name="08052281000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000562"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I think that I understand what the Financial
Secretary is saying. I do not suggest that the debit be allowed where
the underlying value of shares has fallen. In the example that I
quoted, the fall in value was due to the impairment of the
receivability of the accrued interest: an accrual of interest gives
rise to a tax charge, but it then becomes apparent that the debt
represented by that accrued interest has been impaired and will not be
paid, and the value of the shares falls accordingly. That should be
allowed as a debit on the other side of the
calculation.</div><a name="08052281000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000563"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I hope that what the hon. Gentleman says is
right.</div><a name="08052281000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000564"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Does the Financial Secretary mean that she hopes
that I am
wrong?</div><a name="08052281000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000565"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Yes; the hour is growing
late.</div><a name="08052281000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">We fear that the
amendments would allow avoidance to continue. It is important to bear
it in mind that the action that we are taking arises from a number of
schemes that have been notified to us. I do not believe that what the
hon. Gentleman fears will happen. The shares as debt rules apply only
to contrived arrangements. It is the purpose of the arrangements that
will be tested. Companies that had been taxed under the shares as debt
rules in previous years could enter into a depreciatory transaction in
a later year that generated artificial losses equal to past profits.
Those losses could be set against other profits, with the result that
any tax paid in respect of earlier years could effectively be paid back
in a later year. If the amendments were accepted, there would continue
to be loss of tax estimated at up to &#163;100 million per year. I
therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his
amendments.</div><a name="08052281000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000566"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I hear what the Financial Secretary is saying. It
was not the intention to create a further avoidance opportunity, and in
the example that she just read out, the assumption was that the tax
paid in an earlier period would be offset against a loss arising from
another cause in a later period. Perhaps my amendment was not drafted
narrowly enough. I sought to deal with the case where there had been an
impairment of the value of the accrued income in the share transaction.
Would the Financial Secretary be prepared to pursue that by
correspondence? If what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>she says is right, our amendment is too widely drafted. In that case I
would like to consider whether there was a narrower drafting that would
address the concern that has been raised with me. That concern is the
possible unfairness where something that effectively has not been
received is taxed on an accrual basis and it then becomes apparent that
it will not be received, not because of an artificial transaction but
because of a genuine impairment. We must ensure that there is no
asymmetry in the tax treatment of a genuine transaction. Even if it
were right to tax the original accrued increase in value as part of the
anti-avoidance regime, we must ensure that we do not maintain that tax
treatment where it turns out that there was no increase in value
because the accrual was
impaired.</div><a name="08052281000292"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000571"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Since the publication of the Bill on 29 March,
HMRC has listened to representations that in some cases the legislation
might have unintended results. Government amendments Nos. 129 to 131
will therefore ensure that the legislation works as intended. In
particular, it will not result in double taxation or double relief
because the amendments clarify which companies have to bring profits
and losses into account, disapply the legislation where companies have
already been charged a tax in respect of the amounts that are
equivalent to interest and omit a redundant reference to another
provision. Amendment No. 143 would repeal a redundant
reference.</div><a name="08052281000299"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000573"></a>Jane

and is therefore unnecessary. I hope that the Committee will agree and
that we can make swift work of this

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000574"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the
situation. She is basically saying that after publishing the Bill, the
Government have listened to concerns about an anomaly in the shares as
debt rules that were introduced in 2005. They have come forward with a
means of correcting that. We should be clear that this has become a
pressing issue because of the change in the definition of
&#147;commercial rate of interest&#148; introduced in the Bill,
which will make the anomaly more widely felt than it was previously.
This is therefore a necessary measure and not just a tidying-up
exercise.</div><a name="08052281000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must raise
one point with the Financial Secretary. For some odd reason, the
correction is effective only from 16 May 2008. Companies that are
caught by the widened definition of &#147;commercial rate of
interest&#148; and subsequently rescued by the amendment will
therefore be within the shares as debt rules from 12 March
2008 and come out again on 16 May 2008. That will lead to some
anomalous and arguably unfair results. My understanding is that such
companies will be taxed not only on the income accruing between
12 March and 16 May, but on a deemed capital gain on 12
March. That seems to be a bizarre and, frankly, unnecessary problem
that could easily be resolved by the Government aligning the two dates.
It does not matter whether they are aligned on 12 March or
16 May, but it seems utterly bizarre to have the two dates,
which produce this odd little bit of income that will be
caught in what is effectively a double
taxation.</div><a name="08052281000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 143, the Government clearly spotted the error before or at the same
time as we were alerted to it. Government amendment No. 131 will take
care of the problem and we are happy to support
it.</div><a name="08052281000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000575"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The Government amendments were drafted in
response to representations from business, as I have said. However,
business has not been able to provide any examples of where these
unintended consequences have arisen. We decided to table the amendments
to eliminate even the remotest possibility of double charges arising.
Retrospection is not an option in this case, even if we wanted to
introduce it. There could be losers if retrospection were used. HMRC
does not accept that the review of interest makes a difference. I think
that this group is fairly straightforward and that it should be given a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000576"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I wish to raise a few matters that we have not
yet covered in these debates, and I make no apology for delivering them
as a series of
points.</div><a name="08052281000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern is
that the proposed amendments to sections 91A and 91B introduced by
paragraph 4, which prevent debits from being brought into account,
create a risk of double taxation when shares such as fixed-rate
preference shares are treated by those sections as loan relationships
and are taxed on the basis of notional fair value accounting. For
example, market fluctuations in interest rates could result in fair
value losses on shares in some periods and gains in others. The
disallowance of debits representing fair value losses could lead to
double taxation to the extent that there were credits representing
equal and opposite gains in other periods.</div>
<a name="08052281000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Net debits are more likely to
arise in intra-group preference share arrangements, as those are often
long-term arrangements. A helpful suggestion might be to introduce
something similar to the provision that I am told exists in paragraph
23 of schedule 26 of the Finance Act 2002&#151;the Financial
Secretary will be familiar with it&#151;which effectively taxed only
the cumulative net credits arising from exchange rate fluctuations.
Obviously in this case we are not talking about exchange rate
fluctuations, we are talking about interest rate fluctuations.
Similarly, if shares are denominated in foreign currency, the fair
value will fluctuate with the exchange rate movements. The disallowance
of debits representing fair value losses would, on my understanding,
lead to double taxation to the extent that there were credits
representing equal and opposite gains in other periods. I would be
grateful if the Financial Secretary could address that point and, if
she has some reassurances, let the Committee know what they
are.</div> <a name="08052281000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is concern
about proposed section 91D (2), which is introduced by paragraph 11 of
schedule 22. It extends the definition of redeemable shares to any
share where</div><a name="08052281000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is
reasonable to assume that the investing company will or might become
entitled to qualifying redemption amounts.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052281000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">When that is coupled with the proposed
repeal of the definition of the commercial rate of interest in sections
103(3)(a) and (b) of the Finance Act 1996, introduced by paragraph 15,
virtually any preference shareholding could be argued as being within
the scope of section 91D and therefore taxable as a loan relationship
unless proven to have been acquired for a purpose other than tax
avoidance.</div> <a name="08052281000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one
wishes to support tax avoidance, but that places a lot more pressure on
the motive test than we have under the current rules. Almost any
preference share may be caught, unless the taxpayer can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>confident that there is no aspect of its history that HMRC could
characterise as &#147;avoidance&#148; of any sort. It seems to give
excessive discretion to HMRC and a corresponding lack of certainty to
the taxpayer. In the absence of any change to the legislation, HMRC
will either have to apply the rule universally, or it will have to
untax many companies by non-statutory discretion, meaning more
complexity and more uncertainty for business. We believe that
legislation that goes over the top and relies on a non-statutory
discretion by HMRC is, quite frankly, bad legislation.</div>
<a name="08052281000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third concern is that there
is no holdover relief for shares coming into section 91A or 91B for the
first time. The schedule will extend the scope of sections 91A and 91G
of the Finance Act 1996 and shares newly brought within their scope are
treated under the terms of section 91G as having been disposed of and
reacquired on 12 March 2008 at fair value, but there is no provision
for holdover of any chargeable gain, or indeed, allowable loss that is
crystallised by the deemed disposal. That is in contrast to shares held
at the time that sections 91A and 91B were first introduced in 2005.
The gradual extension of the rules to catch what are known as
sidestepping transactions, which we have seen in the last few
amendments to the section 91B regime, has generally been so closely
defined that disguised interest-type transactions only were caught and
consequently, the resulting capital gains were not significant or at
least were uncontroversial. By contrast, the current proposals are so
wide in scope that they will catch many shareholdings where the
shareholding has been in place for a long period and the shareholder
has had no reason to believe that the section 91B regime might be
extended to include them because there was no intention to create
disguised interest. Consequently, there is much more scope for an
unfair capital gain to arise and in some cases the resulting tax
liability could do material financial harm to a
company.</div>
<a name="08052281000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two other points to
make. The effect of the amendment to section 91C(6), which is
introduced at paragraph 9(3) of the schedule, is to bring within the
scope of section 91B shares that would be caught but for the fact that
the assets of the company were changed to prevent the shares
appreciating in an interest-like way. Once the shares are within the
scope of section 91B as a result of the amendment, they are taxed
without regard to the effect of the changes to the value of the assets
so the interest-like return only is caught. However, the transitional
provision does not disregard the return-varying assets, so the section
91G capital gain or loss at the time the company comes into section 91B
would be increased or decreased by the fair-value movement on the
introduced assets. In a typical case, the interest-like appreciation
may be avoided by transferring a derivative contract into the company
that issued the shares&#151;I hope the Minister is following this.
Gains and losses on the derivative would be taxed under the derivative
contracts rules, quite obviously, but under section 91G, the cumulative
gain or loss would also be taken into account in computing the
chargeable gain or loss arising on 12 March 2008. The point of all this
is that the gain or loss at the time of its coming within the scope of
section 91B would be double-taxed; once under these arrangements, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>once under the derivative contracts rules. Those are areas of concern,
and I would be grateful if the Minister addressed them.</div>
<a name="08052281000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to raise an issue that
the Chartered Institute of Taxation has raised. In addition to the
types of arrangements that have been notified under the anti-avoidance
notification provisions, the use of bonus issue debentures occurs in a
private equity context where a creditor&#146;s ranking in the debt
waterfall is upgraded from preferred equity to subordinated debt. There
is some doubt&#151;this is an important point that the Minister can
answer with a yes or no if advice comes to her in due
course&#151;about the applicability of section 209 of the Income Tax
Act 1988, and therefore, whether section 212 of ICTA 1988 will apply in
those circumstances. Many advisers take the view that section 212 is
not applicable, and it would be helpful if the Minister confirmed that
if the payer of the interest is paying additional tax because of the
non-deductibility of the interest, the fact that the payee is not
paying tax on the interest will mean that a main purpose of such
arrangements will not be regarded as securing a tax advantage for the
purpose of proposed new sub-paragraph (1A) of schedule 9 to the Finance
Act 1996. The hope is that the Minister&#146;s officials might have
been made aware of that concern following a representation that they
have received and that the Minister might therefore be able to confirm
in simple language whether those bonus issue debentures are
caught.</div><a name="08052281000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000577"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Here goes. The hon. Gentleman asked me to answer
yes or no on ICTA 1988, and I say, yes&#151;a qualified
yes&#151;provided that tax paid by the company paying the interest is
equal to, or more than, the tax saved by the company that receives it.
He asked about transitional provisions regarding varying assets. HMRC
considers that that is a theoretical issue only: no one has been able
to find any example of it happening. HMRC guidance makes it clear that
the payment of dividends does not give rise to fair-value losses, since
the dividend is part of the fair-value return. Nor are any exchanged
losses likely to reduce the overall return below nil. That means that
it is unlikely that there could be debits.</div>
<a name="08052281000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked about
redeemable shares, and he was concerned about what would be caught.
There are a number of circumstances in which it is not reasonable to
assume that the holder would be entitled to such amounts. For instance,
if the subsidiary shares are held as part of the group&#146;s core
activities, it is not reasonable to assume that the investing company
would sell those shares. There might also be regulatory reasons why it
is not possible for certain shares held within a group to be sold off.
The tax avoidance test provides protection for the taxpayer.</div>
<a name="08052281000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can reassure the hon. Gentleman that HMRC will give case-by-case advice
in accordance with its existing code of practice. It will advise
companies on the application of the law to a particular transaction if
the full facts and circumstances are set out. We have seen no evidence
of any legitimate business transactions that rely on the upfront
payment of interest. The announcement of this action in the 2007
pre-Budget report was accompanied by consultation with business, during
which no evidence of such structures was received. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>He is right that there will be no hold-over relief. The absence of
hold-over provision is not new, however, and was a feature of rules
when they were first introduced in 2005. Although schedule 22 is large
and complex, it deals with a number of aggressive avoidance schemes.
Numerous financial product disclosures received under the regime
introduced in the Finance Act 2004 show that the avoidance industry
continues to be active. The tax at risk runs to hundreds of millions of
pounds, so we believe that it is right to act in the interests of the
public services and those taxpayers who comply with their
obligations.</div> <a name="08052281000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might
have missed one, two or possibly more of the detailed questions that
the hon. Gentleman asked, but I undertake to write to him if that is
the case, and I hope that we can see schedule 22 through to
legislation.</div><a name="08052281000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052281000580"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is a pleasure, Mr. Hood, to serve
under your chairmanship for the first time. There are a number of
issues that I could have raised in the debate on the previous set of
amendments, but I thought that I would focus on clause 61. It is worth
bearing in mind the fact that a consultation on the control of foreign
companies regime is being carried out at the moment. That is relevant
to the clause, because one representative body questioned why changes
needed to be made, given that significant reforms are expected in the
2009 Finance Bill. I am sure that the Minister will highlight some
mischief that she and the Government wish to
stop.</div><a name="08052281000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consultation
has moved away from looking at the status of individual entities to
focus much more on income streams from things like finance payments,
royalties and so on, and that focus seems to be creeping into the
clause. There is a shift in definition from the emphasis on control of
a company to some of the income that arises. The Law Society, in its
comments on the clause, points out that subsection (3) discusses the
concept of persons possessing, or entitled to acquire,</div>
<a name="08052281000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the whole of the
income&#148;</div> <a name="08052281000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">of a company.
The explanatory notes state
that</div><a name="08052281000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person controls a
CFC if they hold a majority of the rights to the CFC&#146;s income or
assets&#148;.</div><a name="08052281000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
usual definition of control that applies is set out in section 416 of
the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, and focuses on
someone&#146;s ability to exercise, or be entitled to acquire, direct
or indirect control over the company&#146;s affairs. There appears to
be a shift away from control, as we would normally see it, as being
about the exercise and the power to intervene in the way that a company
is run, to the economic rights that come from the income flows and who
benefits from them. Would the Minister comment on what appears to be a
shift in approach and almost a prelude to some of the things that were
floated in the consultation paper? I suspect that the perception is
that there is a bit of
rowing-back.</div><a name="08052281000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister define income for the purposes of subsection (3)? Is it
distributable profits? If so, why has that not been emphasised in the
Bill, and which generally accepted accounting practice applies? If it
is not, what is it? Is it the gross income of a company, or is it some
definition of chargeable profits? It would be helpful to have some
clarification. Given that control appears to depend on who has the
majority of the share of income, it would be useful to understand when
the test of control applies. If, for example, there are fixed-rate
preference shares, the income would accrue evenly over the year. If the
company&#146;s profits accrued unevenly and all arose in the second
half of the year due to seasonal trade, it would appear that during the
first part of the year, the holders of fixed rate preference shares
would control the company because they are entitled to the majority of
its income if the definition is about profits. In the second half of
the year, those holders would lose
control.</div><a name="08052281000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
alternative scenario is that if the profits of the company were low in
one year, the preference shareholders would control the company,
because they have the right to the majority of the income, but in a
more profitable year, they would lose control of the company. There
does not appear to be much certainty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>in this situation about where control is, because of the lack of
definition regarding income. What would happen if someone owned 60 per
cent. of the economic rights, but somebody else controlled 60 per cent.
of the voting rights? How would income be appropriated between the two
holders?</div><a name="08052281000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
couple of other points to make. The first refers to a previous group of
amendments, but the issue flows through this clause. Proposed new
subsection (7) refers to income being
allocated</div><a name="08052281000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on a just and
reasonable
basis&#148;,</div><a name="08052281000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">particularly
where</div><a name="08052281000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is more than
one settlor or
beneficiary&#148;.</div><a name="08052281000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
&#147;just and reasonable&#148; is not an objective measure and
could create uncertainty. The explanatory notes speak of guidance being
produced to assist taxpayers. It would be helpful to know what that
guidance will consist of, and whether there is a clearer rule that
could be reflected in the Bill, rather than through guidance. Such a
rule must not lead to opportunities for mischief at a later stage.
Proposed new paragraph (ab) in subsection (2)(a) will create two new
accounting periods: one that ends on 11 March 2008 and one that starts
on 12 March 2008. If a dividend is received between 12 and 31 March,
will it be accounted for on a receipts basis or can some of it be
allocated to a prior period? Without that allocation, it will be
possible for a company to fail the exempt test for the first
period.</div> <a name="08052281000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
want to raise the implications for the acceptable distribution policy.
As I understand it, dividends paid under the acceptable distribution
policy can be paid up to 18 months after the year end to which they
relate. If a dividend was paid between 12 and 31 March 2008, it could
be in respect of an accounting period ending on 30 September 2006. One
of the issues is whether the changes under the clause will require
people to go back and revisit the level of dividend and tax paid at
that point.</div><a name="08052281000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
perhaps worth explaining a bit about the acceptable distribution
policy. To be exempt under controlled foreign companies legislation, a
company has to distribute 90 per cent. of its profits by dividend.
Under the changes, we think that the definition of income could expand
so that 90 per cent. will be a percentage of a larger figure, which
will require a larger dividend to be paid and therefore incur a larger
tax bill. Because of the way in which the changes will interact with
the acceptable distribution policy, it is not entirely clear whether
people will have to reconsider the amount of dividend that they are
paid. Of course, they determine that dividend on the basis of profits
incurred before the legislation is introduced. There is therefore a
sense of retrospectivity creeping in, because businesses that thought
that they knew what their tax liabilities were will have them
reassessed as a consequence of the clause. I could carry on discussing
the wider issues around controlled foreign companies legislation and
some of the problems that the Government have with it, but I am sure
that the Committee would welcome the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="08052281000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
consideration adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">[Mr.
