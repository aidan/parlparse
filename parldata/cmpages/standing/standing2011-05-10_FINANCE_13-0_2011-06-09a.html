                  </span> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr
Gale. May I say, in passing, congratulations today on your 28th year in
the House of Commons? [<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span>
“Hear, hear!”] I confess that I would have joined you in
entering the House on that day had it not been for the 19,000-vote
majority that Alastair Goodlad got in Eddisbury at the time, but
c’est la vie—these things
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have a quick question about the clause. It makes changes to the
provisions relating to the VAT treatment of samples of goods given away
by businesses. I notice that in the tax information and impact note,
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs invited claims from affected
businesses prior to implementation of this provision, which will come
into effect on Royal Assent. Will the Minister say how many businesses
have expressed an interest to date, since the establishment of this
potential measure on 30 September 2010, following the decision on the
EMI
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">

                     <span class="hs_CLMember">The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000240">&#160;</a>
                     </span>
                  </strong> It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr Gale. The
clause gives effect to a recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the
European Union, which extended the VAT relief available to businesses
that give away samples for marketing purposes. The changes made by the
clause will remove the restriction that limits the relief to the first
sample, so that the second or subsequent sample of identical or not
significantly different goods will also be VAT free. The clause will
also remove the reference in UK law to the “gift” of a
sample, to differentiate between samples and “business
gifts”, which are also relieved from VAT, subject to a monthly
limit.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
change will be welcomed by businesses that promote their products
through the provision of a number of samples to particular individuals
or businesses. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 500<a class="bkMark" name="Column500">&#160;</a>
                  </div>It is estimated that the revenue cost of the change is in the region of
£10 million for back claims and £5 million per annum
going
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Delyn asked about the business response and
representations that we have received. I am not in a position to
provide an answer to him, but I will happily write to him and the rest
of the Committee in due course to provide details. The measure extends
the relief already available to business and will assist those for
which giving samples is a key marketing
tool.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000023">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I have a couple of questions about the clause,
which I hope are relatively straightforward. First, there has been
speculation about whether the United Kingdom Government would need a
derogation under article 395 of directive 2006/112/EC before the clause
could be introduced. I would welcome the Minister’s comments on
whether he believes that such a derogation is
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition, the Minister will be aware that there has been some
discussion between that august body that has been very helpful to the
Committee, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
and HMRC on the implementation of the clause. Although there has been
helpful discussion, and HMRC’s and the Minister’s policy
intentions for the clause have been under discussion, it may help the
Committee if he places on record his response to the concerns of the
ICAEW. It still believes that the clause is very widely drafted and may
impact far more widely than he and HMRC
intend.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
ICAEW raised that concern in response to the draft Finance Bill clauses
published in December, and HMRC has set out what the policy intentions
are. However, it might be helpful if the Minister responded so that we
have clarity outside private correspondence and discussions about the
intention in the clause and the concerns raised by the institute, which
is particularly anxious about the requirement for two suppliers to be
connected, even if they are not aware of each other’s
existence.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is no requirement on HMRC to demonstrate that there has been a tax
advantage or artificial value-shifting. Its examples in a briefing to
hon. Members indicate that it believes that the following, for example,
could be caught by the clause: a newspaper promotional coupon offering
a 10% reduction on a restaurant meal; someone hiring electrical
equipment from one supplier, who decides to purchase from another
independent retailer a book on how to use it; someone having their car
serviced, who decides to buy a servicing manual to check that the job
has been done properly; a tutor giving a reading list to a group of
fee-paying students, who then buy the books from various independent
booksellers—the booksellers would not necessarily know that the
purchase was linked to an exempt supply of education.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000030">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that all those matters can be easily tied down. The Minister
knows that case law often considers what is said in Committee, and in
the interest of clarity, we should not accept the clause until he has
had an opportunity to cover those points and to put the record
straight.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000031">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The clause acts to close a VAT avoidance scheme.
The changes that it makes will remove zero rating from the supply of
printed matter when it is supplied in connection with services and in
circumstances in which the printed matter would not have been
zero-rated if both had been supplied by a single supplier. At present,
the arrangements are confined mainly to a small number of large
businesses, but we believe that there is scope for abuse in any
circumstance in which printed material qualifying for the zero rate is
supplied with a differently rated service. That is why we are acting
now. The clause will have an impact only on businesses that are engaged
in that sort of artificial tax planning, and will not affect those who
are making legitimately separate supplies to their customers. It is
estimated that this counter-avoidance measure will yield £40
million in 2011-12, rising to £60 million a year by
2015-16.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall deal with the points that the right hon. Gentleman rightly
raised. He asked whether the measure requires a derogation to be agreed
by the EU Commission. It does not. It simply ensures that the boundary
of the UK zero rate for printed matter is maintained by restricting the
scope and circumstances in which, but for supply splitting, it would
not apply anyway. Under the terms of the principal VAT directive, the
UK has the right to maintain and restrict the scope of its domestic
zero rates without reference to the EU
Commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the point raised by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants and others that the measure goes further than
necessary. We believe that it has much more limited application than
some of the respondents fear. It will apply only when a supply of
printed matter by one person is so closely connected with the supply of
services by another that the two supplies would properly have been
considered to be a single supply for VAT purposes if they had been made
by the same
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause will have an impact only on businesses that have entered into
arrangements that artificially split what would otherwise have been a
single supply into two separate supplies. It will not have any impact
on businesses that are commercially or economically independent of each
other and making supplies that, from the customer’s point of
view, are separate. Therefore, we do not believe that the measure will
catch unwitting or innocent
transactions.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
words “connected with” in note (2) in the clause are
given a specific meaning, which is set out in note (3). In particular,
the clause will have no effect unless the supply of printed matter is
so closely linked to a supply of services that the two supplies would
have been treated as a single supply of services if they had been made
by a single
supplier.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
the rules on what constitutes a single supply can be difficult in some
cases, the underlying principle, which has been repeatedly endorsed by
the courts, is simple. Two supplies will be treated as a single supply
for tax purposes only if they are so closely linked that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 502<a class="bkMark" name="Column502">&#160;</a>
                  </div>they form objectively a single economic supply that it would be
artificial to split. By definition, an unwitting or innocent
transaction will not be so closely linked to a supply of services by
someone else, but together they constitute a single economic supply
that it would be artificial to split. To be clear, the clause supports
the Government’s aim of making the tax system fairer and
prevents the use of an avoidance scheme that is unfair to customers and
a cost to the Exchequer. I therefore urge that the clause stand part of
the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000037">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The clause will create a new refund scheme to
enable academies to recover VAT incurred on goods and services used in
the provision of free education. As Members will know, academies are
schools in England that enter into academy arrangements under section 1
of the Academies Act 2010, or enter into an agreement with the
Secretary of State under section 482 of the Education Act
1996.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have no
objection in principle to the clause. As I understand it, it will
ensure that a similar situation is put in place to that in schools
under local authority control, which have their non-business VAT
refunded. However, I have a couple of questions on which I hope the
Minister can put my mind at ease.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First, I
would like to look at the position of VAT and Europe. My hon. Friend
the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker) has passed me an e-mail from one
of his constituents, who had contacted him as a former schools Minister
to raise the issue. The constituent had raised the issue with the
European Commission and, on 14 April, received the following
response:<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
have analysed the published proposal for legislation to exempt
academies from VAT. Following that analysis we have substantial doubts
whether that legislation is consistent with the provisions of the VAT
Directive; these doubts relate in particular to the combination of a
supply of exempt services with a right to deduct input VAT and to the
principle of equal fiscal treatment. With your agreement, we would
therefore treat your file as a complaint which we would register with
the responsible service for monitoring the correct application of EU
tax law and which will engage the appropriate procedures for making
sure that these provisions are applied
properly.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister reassure me and my hon. Friend by responding to the
substance of that claim—that the proposals in the clause have
created some concern with the Commission? Will he place on record his
view of that potential dichotomy between the Commission view and UK
Government policy, which I know is a matter close to his
heart?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000044">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the Treasury proposal allows for such VAT to be dealt with in a similar
way to that of local authority schools. Academies get a VAT grant to
compensate for the fact that, unlike local authority schools, they are
eligible to pay VAT, which I understand is around £250,000 per
school. I would welcome the Minister’s clarification, but I
understand that the grant 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 503<a class="bkMark" name="Column503">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is given by the Department for Education to compensate for the situation
that he is trying to deal with in the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
that is the case, it raises two questions. First, what will happen to
the grant to compensate for VAT paid given to academies by the
Department? Will that continue? If the proposal is enacted, there could
be a question of double counting, with academies getting the grant, as
they currently do, and then receiving the
relief.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Logic
says that the grant could ultimately be withdrawn. There are about
200-plus academies that could be receiving the grant. That number could
rise to 400-plus, all of which could receive the grant. Therefore, this
should be a revenue-neutral move if the Minister is withdrawing the
grant. What will happen to the money that is being saved? Will it be
removed from the Department for Education’s budget for future
years?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000047">&#160;</a>

raising an interesting point about how academies benefit from some of
the financial arrangements. Does he agree that if this clause goes
through, about £250,000 will need to go back to local authority
schools otherwise they will be further disadvantaged by some of the
other arrangements that have been made for

                  </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that
point. If the information is correct—I would genuinely welcome
some clarification on that—and there is a £250,000 grant
from the Department for Education for schools that become academies to
compensate for the VAT, and if clause 75 effectively neutralises that
VAT, it means that £250,000 per school times the number of
academies now and in future has been factored into the overall
education budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister is neutralising the VAT issue, does the Treasury intend to
repatriate that portion of the budget for another purpose or will it
use it to pay for the VAT position in the clause? Will the Department
for Education maintain the £250,000 per school times however
many academies there are now and in future to ensure that the money
stays within the overall education budget?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000050">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In essence,
my hon. Friend the Member for Sefton Central is asking whether the
spending review headline figures for the schools budget will be altered
in any way as a result of the VAT changes in the clause, given that the
VAT grant was paid by the Department for Education to schools which
became academies or which are to become
academies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Has
the Treasury calculated how much extra VAT it will receive in 2010-11,
2011-12 and beyond? Moreover, has the Treasury included the loss of
income from existing academies in future scoring for VAT? Has the EU
given any indication that there might be a problem with this exemption,
as seen in the e-mail from the constituent of my hon. Friend the Member
for Gedling? What is the net effect on schools funding overall? If the
EU objects, is there a plan B for this particular issue and where are
we on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
the principle of the clause is fine, the Minister needs to reflect on
and provide satisfactory answers to a couple of questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000053">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Clause 75 creates a new refund scheme to enable
academies to recover the VAT incurred on goods and services used in the
provision of free education. For these purposes, academies are schools
in England that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 504<a class="bkMark" name="Column504">&#160;</a>
                  </div>enter into academy arrangements with the Secretary of State for
Education under the Academies Act 2010 or the Education Act 1996. VAT
can ordinarily be recovered from HMRC only on expenditure relating to
taxable business activities. The provision of free education is a
non-business activity, so VAT incurred on related expenditure cannot
usually be reclaimed. An exception to this rule is that schools under
local authority control, which of course provide free education, can
claim the VAT paid on their expenditure through the refund scheme for
local authorities in section 33 of the VAT Act 1994. Academies cannot
access the scheme because they are not under local authority control,
consequently, the changes that the clause makes enable academies in
England to recover VAT incurred in their provision of free
education.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to be clear that the measure is not about giving academies
additional funding of any kind or a funding advantage over local
authority schools. Instead, it is simply the most efficient and
sustainable means of ensuring that academies are funded in a manner
consistent with how local authority schools are funded. If we did not
introduce such a refund scheme, academies would be at a significant
disadvantage compared with local authority schools, because they would
have to pay VAT out of a funding allocation that was never designed to
cover such
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000054">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> There is a wider point about charities and VAT to
which I suspect we will return in detail this afternoon.
Voluntary-aided schools that fall outside the scheme are not in the
same position as local authority schools that become academies, and are
not disadvantaged by the clause. The new refund scheme does not in any
way discriminate against them. Voluntary-aided schools have always had
the VAT element of their revenue costs refunded via the local
authority, but they remain responsible in law for their own buildings
and land, therefore they have never had the VAT element of their
capital costs refunded. However, the Department for Education adds an
allowance for irrecoverable VAT on eligible capital funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As far as
academies are concerned, we obviously did not want unfairness in the
system, and the only other way around the problem of academies having
to pay VAT out of a funding allocation that was never designed to cover
such costs would have been to design a whole new means of allocating
funding to academies, meaning that we financed academy schools in one
way and local authority schools in another. I suspect that that would
in itself cause some controversy and be unlikely to be fair to one
group or the other.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman asked some sensible questions that I shall attempt to
address. His first point was about whether the refund scheme was
compatible with EU VAT 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 505<a class="bkMark" name="Column505">&#160;</a>
                  </div>law. This is a public expenditure measure, and as such falls within the
competence of the Government as opposed to the EU, but it is wholly
compatible with EU law. The European Commission has accepted VAT refund
mechanisms, such as this one, provided that they do not affect the EU
budget or distort competition with business, and the provision does
neither. The important point is that we intend to refund academy

Friend the Minister knows, there is a distinction in the treatment of
further education colleges’ VAT. In my constituency, the college
of West Anglia is grappling with the fiasco of the previous
Government’s decision on the capital expenditure of FE
colleges—the consequences have created particular challenges for
its budget. Will he instruct his officials to look at the impact of VAT
on further education colleges? Over the coming years, given the
convergence of funding planned for 16-18 education and for academies
and FE colleges, what work can be done to help vis-à-vis
VAT?</p>

                  </strong> I appreciate my hon. Friend’s expressing
those concerns affecting his constituents. It is worth pointing out
that further education colleges have always been funded differently
from schools. They have never been able to receive VAT refunds against
expenditure on their non-business activities. That restriction is
already included in their budget planning, and this measure does not
affect that, meaning that those institutions are no better or worse
off. I appreciate that that is not the point he was making, but he has
put it on the record. As I say, the budget planning for FE colleges is
always done on the assumption that VAT on expenditure is not
refundable.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000060">&#160;</a>

deficit which we needed to close. I could also make the point that FE

the substantially greater increase in employers’ national

is, we have had to take steps to reduce the deficit. I know that that

that point, I must respond to the question of the right hon. Member for
Delyn about how to ensure no double counting—that academies are
not paid twice for the VAT, through the refund scheme and through the
current VAT grant. The current VAT grant is paid to academies through
the Young People’s Learning Agency, to replace the VAT that is
currently irrecoverable. That will continue until 31 August. However,
since academies will be able to reclaim VAT under the refund scheme
from 1 April, the YPLA will require that portion of the grant to be
repaid to them in the next academic year. The YPLA will write to
academies to confirm the funding position for next
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000065">&#160;</a>

agreed at the spending review. No additional funding was given to the

               <p class="tabbed">My

states:<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The

               </p>
               <p>The Minister has
settled at £15, which he has estimated will bring in an
additional £10 million of income, backpayable annually, to the
Treasury. That relates to VAT-free imports from outside the EU,
including the Channel Islands, and £10 million will be brought
in with the £15 exemption, but the Minister could set
a £9 exemption, which is the de minimis figure, and
potentially raise additional income at a time of stringent spending
cuts. Even though it is a small amount of money, why have we settled on
£15? We could raise a small—I accept that—but
additional, amount of money by setting the exemption at
£9.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000073">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
am not one for increasing VAT generally, and we have had many
discussions about this, but the measure appears to ensure that we keep
resources and purchases in the EU. It is, therefore, a protectionist
measure in one way. I accept that it perhaps goes against the
Minister’s free-market approach, but what is the justification
for the £15 exemption when he could have chosen £9 and
raised a little bit more income as a
result?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000074">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The clause, as we have heard, makes changes to the
operation of low-value consignment relief, with a view to protecting
Exchequer revenues and helping UK SMEs compete on a more level playing
field with businesses based outside the
EU.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
rapid growth of internet shopping has created conditions in which the
relief can be exploited for a purpose for which it was never intended.
Instead of the relief benefiting small, long-standing indigenous
businesses outside the EU, the primary beneficiaries of the relief are
now large, often UK companies. Those companies seek to market their
products to UK consumers as VAT-free by moving their logistics centres
to non-EU jurisdictions, particularly the Channel Islands, or by using
local mail facilitators based outside the EU to process their UK
orders.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A range of
low-value goods are now being supplied to UK consumers VAT-free in
large quantities from outside the EU. The CD and DVD markets have been
at the forefront of that trend, with most CDs and DVDs ordered online
now being supplied VAT-free from the Channel Islands. However, we are
also seeing significant quantities of beauty products, greetings cards,
health supplements and printer cartridge ink, among other goods, being
imported VAT-free in growing
quantities.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a consequence, the cost to the Exchequer of the relief has increased by
50% over the past five years, from £85 million in 2005 to
£130 million in 2010. It is worth pointing out that it is a
long-standing issue, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 508<a class="bkMark" name="Column508">&#160;</a>
                  </div>those of us who have served on Finance Bill Committees in recent years
will remember previous debates on the matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These costs
will rise further as a result of the increase in the standard rate of
VAT to 20% in January 2011, even without a further increase in
underlying volumes. That trend has also had an adverse effect on UK
SMEs who argue, quite understandably, that they are unable to compete
with large companies that are operating VAT free in the Channel Islands
and elsewhere. Since we announced that the operation of low-value
consignment relief was being reviewed last July, I have received a
significant number of representations from such businesses,
particularly in the music industry, to address the issue. I have a
great deal of sympathy for the points that those companies made. The
Government recognise that there is a very difficult balance to be
struck between delivering fairness in the tax system and ensuring that
any new arrangements can be enforced effectively and efficiently, at a
time when we are looking for savings in the cost of public
administration. We will not, however, tolerate exploitation of the
relief for a purpose, and on a scale, for which it was never
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are
therefore pursuing a twin-track strategy to stop such exploitation.
First, clause 76 amends the Value Added Tax (Imported Goods) Relief
Order 1984 to reduce the threshold to £15 from 1 November this
year, which is expected to raise £10 million for the Exchequer
in 2012-13, rising to £15 million in 2015-16. Secondly, we are
exploring options with the European Commission to limit the scope of
the relief to prevent its exploitation, including the possibility of
seeking a derogation from the usual EU rules on low-value consignment
relief. We will return to the issue of the appropriate level of the
threshold in Budget 2012, if discussions with the European Commission
do not produce a workable solution to the problem of exploitation of
the relief, with a view to reducing the limit further.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I recognise
the point made by the right hon. Gentleman. Some would have liked us to
go further today by reducing the threshold to £9, which is the
lowest level available under EU law, or even by withdrawing the relief
from mail order goods altogether. The previous Government did not take
action in that area, and I considered the options carefully when
reviewing our policy on relief for low-value consignments. I believe
that exploring a more targeted approach to tackling exploitation of the
relief with the European Commission is the best way forward,
potentially allowing a better balance to be struck between the cost of
enforcement of new rules by the Government and Royal Mail, and tackling
the adverse impact of low-value consignment relief of the Exchequer and
UK SMEs.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are committed to ensuring fairness in the tax system. We are
determined to tackle the exploitation of low-value consignment relief,
and the clause represents the first step towards achieving that
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000082">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful for that explanation. However, in
passing, I note that this Government and the Minister have increased
VAT to 20% on a range of goods across the board, which is hitting
people on lowest incomes hardest. They have an opportunity, under EU
law, to adopt a lower threshold to address the VAT relief, where people
are paying no VAT on importing goods 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 509<a class="bkMark" name="Column509">&#160;</a>
                  </div>into the EU, but the Government have chosen a figure of £15 as
the de minimis requirement, rather than £9, which they could
have chosen. They raised £10 million by reducing the figure from
£18 to £15. That is a small amount of money, but further
money still could have been raised by reducing it to £9, as
allowed by the EU.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will support the threshold of £15, and I did not table an
amendment for the figure of £9. I cannot understand, however,
why the Minister will not maximise the level of income by making a
level playing field, so that we do not undermine British manufacturers
who are producing goods such as CDs in this country by allowing the
import of VAT-free goods made outside the EU at a lower cost. That
strikes me as completely unfair, and I cannot see the logic of the
Minister’s decision not to use the lower figure. However, those
points are made in passing and no amendment has been tabled, so we will
accept the figure that the Minister has
produced.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000084">&#160;</a>

intervenes. He has used the word “derogation” a number of
times today. I find it amusing that he seeks derogations for this, that
and the other, for clause 76, and for everything else. However, when my
hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East talked about a derogation for
VAT on fuel, we were told, “It can’t be done. It’s
impossible to do so.” It seems that derogations can happen when
the Minister wants them, but when he does not, he does not wish to
pursue them. In the spirit of co-operation on this matter, however, I
will give way to the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000086">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> If the right hon. Gentleman really wants to return
to the Opposition’s farcical policy on a VAT derogation on fuel,
let him do so. The previous Government did nothing on this. The right
hon. Gentleman might want to ask former Ministers why, but if we simply
lower the limit to £9, we impose a significant additional
administrative burden in relation to packages that come into the UK.
There is likely to be a behavioural response which means that packages
will still be below that £9 limit. The more effective
approach is to take a first step by reducing the limit to £15.
We think that that gets the balance right. Essentially, the desire to
go to the EU to explore what opportunities lie in a better targeted
low-value consignment relief system for the UK is a sensible approach.
After years in which nothing happened, this Government are doing
something about
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000087">&#160;</a>

The amendment asks for a proper impact assessment to be undertaken
before enacting this part of the Bill because there are two areas of
significant concern about the clause and the associated schedule.
First, the penalty to manufacturing industry is disproportionate.
Secondly, the proposals fail to deliver a green tax that has the
support of environmentalists. For the Government to unite the
representatives of manufacturing industry with Greenpeace and WWF in
opposition to these proposals is a real achievement.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000097">&#160;</a>

too often sit outside our shores as they weigh up options. The carbon
floor price represents a serious threat to our competitiveness. We are
in danger of exporting UK jobs to countries like Ukraine and Russia,
boosting global warming rather than reducing it. We need an energy

the sustained downturn in demand for long products as the prime reason
for the restructuring in the UK, but he added that the other reason was
the regulatory outlook. He made the following

we build low-carbon energy sources, improve energy efficiency, drive

produced in the UK, rather than steel imported from China, Russia,
Ukraine and other steel-producing countries that do not face the same

carbon floor price will cost Tata Steel’s UK operations
£20 million in the first three years, and it is estimated that
it will cost £20 million a year by 2020. So the carbon floor
price is likely to damage not only international competitiveness but
the ability to compete within the single market. The net cost of the
carbon floor price for the UK steel industry as a whole is estimated to
be £13 million in 2013, £21 million in 2014 and

is about creating a fair, level playing field, which is the argument

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that I am now moving on to the
green arguments against the proposals. The green lobby’s view is
that the proposals for carbon floor pricing give an unacceptable
windfall to the existing nuclear generators by creating an uplift in
the marginal price of power with no additional cost. Let me make it
clear that nuclear power almost certainly will be needed, as part of
the mix of sources, to create the secure energy supply that the UK
requires. This is not an anti-nuclear argument; it is an anti-windfall
argument when there is no return on that windfall. Indeed, in a written
answer to a parliamentary question, the Economic Secretary acknowledged
that the carbon price support clause will put up consumer energy bills
and deliver windfall profits of £50 million a year from 2013 to
2030 for existing nuclear reactor operators. Greenpeace has calculated
that the figure exceeds £1.3 billion by
2020.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The proposals
are, therefore, a bad deal for bill payers. Almost £1 billion
will be given to the nuclear industry for doing absolutely nothing new.
It will not add to energy output or to Britain’s energy
security. There will be no requirement for companies to invest the
windfall in national priorities such as energy efficiency programmes or
meeting our renewable energy targets. It will simply add to the profits
of certain companies, which last year made a combined profit of more
than £3 billion while their CEOs recouped annual compensation of
up to £2 million. Such bill increases are likely to
compound fuel poverty and risk public hostility to the idea of green
taxes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The £1
billion windfall will come directly from the pockets of bill payers. As
taxpayers do not have a choice about paying electricity bills and the
rule change is being introduced by the Chancellor, this is effectively
a tax and it clearly amounts to a subsidy for nuclear power. The Energy
and Climate Change Committee investigated the issue recently, and MPs
were concerned that Government proposals would effectively provide
subsidies to nuclear generators through a carbon price floor that could
hand them windfall profits. The coalition agreement committed to there
being no new public subsidies for nuclear
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000112">&#160;</a>

Government’s position on carbon floor pricing is bizarre. The
Chancellor is constantly saying that UK manufacturing is returning, but
in this policy he is unilaterally undermining it to the extent that
650,000 jobs in chemicals and steel are potentially at risk.
It is not just companies such as Tata that are making the manufacturing
argument. As my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe said, companies
such as INEOS and, on Teesside, Lucite, SABIC, GrowHow and
other  chemical firms are terrified by the carbon floor pricing

about the manufacturing future for Britain. In terms of climate change,
are those products that are manufactured here produced in a far greener
way already and can they be made even greener? If this policy is
implemented, how will it affect British manufacturing and climate
change across the globe? From talking to colleagues in this Committee
Room and outside, I know that there are many reservations about how
this policy will be implemented across the country and how it will
affect our competitiveness. For example, given that the chemical
industry makes up more than 30% of UK exports at the moment and is the

               <p class="tabbed">I speak in
favour of my hon. Friend’s amendment. I will be supporting it
and I hope that Government Front Benchers and Committee members will
realise the logic of a pause in relation to this policy. When we had an
Adjournment debate on the UK steel industry and we asked how the
consultation process on this policy was implemented, it was clear from
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills Minister that BIS
had absolutely no involvement in that consultation process. The
Department of Energy and Climate Change had a tokenistic involvement in
the process, but this policy is Treasury-led. It is not business-led or
environment-led; it is purely about getting tax in. If that is the
case, the Government will destroy a UK manufacturing sector that at
this time could be fantastically developed. Particularly in the
Teesside conurbation, projects are waiting in the wings and people want
to invest. All they want is certainty from this
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have gone through the battles for Teesside cast products and fought for
two-and-a-half years to get a new buyer in Sahaviriya Steel Industries
for that site. The beam mill has gone down, as well as other jobs in
Hartlepool and down the road in Scunthorpe—all areas that I know
very well—so I find it incredibly frustrating that a Government
who keep preaching about manufacturing intend to implement this policy.
I hope that everyone in this room realises that the amendment contains
a common-sense
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000123">&#160;</a>

recognise that strong challenges face our society in trying to reduce
carbon emissions and support our economic recovery, and a good evidence
base for making policy is key to much of that. Many of us are deeply
concerned about the importance of reducing our dependency on particular
forms of energy while ensuring that we meet the needs of our economy,
and we recognise that there may be better ways to cut the cake. That is
the point addressed by the amendment. If we are putting money, by
default, into particular forms of energy production through carbon
floor pricing, we need to know what we are doing and understand whether
we are getting best value for money—again, I speak with my
public accounts hat on.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000125">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I am also
concerned about what we can do to fast-track the development of
renewable energy sources in our country. There is much debate about
whether we have the capacity to generate more electricity through
renewable energy sources, including wind and solar power, and I am also
interested in microgeneration. One point about this proposal, and the
subsidy that it will generate for the nuclear industry, relates to
whether some of that money could be used to support the development of
renewable industries. That would allow us to have a greater energy mix
that relies on a wider range of sources and encourages the development
of renewable energy. We would all like to see such a development, and
there is no disagreement across the House that the more we do to
support processes such as microgeneration, the better.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Above all,
the review asks for better evidence on which to base our policies and
move forward, so that we have more confidence in supporting our
manufacturing industries and make the best use of our support for
renewable energy and our energy mix as a country. I hope that the
Government will take the amendment in that spirit and look closely at
the proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000129">&#160;</a>

                  </span> The crucial point about the
amendment is that it calls for an assessment of the implications of
this measure. As we have seen with many other things that the
Government have done, not only in the Finance Bill but in other
Departments, the crux of the matter is that the policy has not been
fully thought through and its impact on different sectors may be
slightly contradictory. As the hon. Member for Bristol West suggested
in his intervention, the impact of the measure on energy-intensive
industries and its environmental impact may not necessarily square.
That is why it is so important to make a thorough assessment and for
the Government to be clear about the objectives of the carbon floor
price mechanism. Labour Members do not oppose the principle behind the
mechanism; in Government, we were fully committed to carbon reduction
and we passed the world’s first climate change Act.

                  </div>There are, however, several serious problems with the way the Government
have chosen to implement the policy, and I have a number of questions
for the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
first concern is the impact on ordinary consumers of energy and their
household bills. I have cited a number of times the quote from the
director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies about the Government
giving with one hand, and taking away with many other hands. This
measure is yet another example of that and of the Government hitting
ordinary people where it hurts most. Energy prices are already rising
fast. The cost of energy has been a problem for many years, and fuel
poverty is certainly a concern for many of my colleagues. The OECD
estimates that consumer energy prices in the first quarter of the year
were 9.3% higher than the year before, compared to general consumer
inflation of 4.1%. This week, ScottishPower announced that the cost of
electricity would increase by 10%. Along with the 19% increase in the
price of gas, it means that bills will rise by £170 a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000131">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The
hon. Lady is right to flag up the cost of living, part of which is the
cost of energy. I presume that she has read the tax impact information
note, which clearly states that moving to more low-carbon energy
generation in the long term will result in lower fuel
bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000132">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The Minister hits the nail on the head by saying
that it will be in the long term. I was about to challenge her on that.
In the longer term, it is obviously desirable to reduce energy bills,
but the question is what impact the changes will have in the short
term. People are already being hit by rises in fuel prices, yet the
Government have cut the winter fuel payment by £50 for people
over the age of 60 and by £100 for those over 80, despite saying
in their Budget of June 2010 that they were committed to protecting key
benefits for older people, including the winter fuel payment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000133">&#160;</a>

               <p>We are concerned that
there will be increased fuel poverty and even more pressure on squeezed
family incomes. What assessment did the Government make of the impact
of the schedule on consumers, including fuel poverty, particularly in
light of the cuts to the winter fuel allowance and fast-rising energy
prices? Rather than speaking of the long term, will the Minister tell
the Committee what impact it will have in the short to medium term? Did
the Government consider the suggestion from groups such as Consumer
Focus that revenues from the carbon price support rate should be
hypothecated and used to help consumers in these difficult
times?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000135">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Our second
concern is the effect that the change will have on manufacturing. We
heard earlier that because the Government have chosen to implement the
mechanism, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 517<a class="bkMark" name="Column517">&#160;</a>
                  </div>energy-intensive industries such as steel, paper, glass, ceramics and
others expect to be particularly hard hit. These sectors directly
employ 225,000 workers and contribute more than £15 billion to
our GDP. Many international industries are worried about the effect
that it will have on their competitiveness abroad. Many of these firms
and industries are large inward investors and, as has been said, they
are vital if we want to develop the high-technology and green sectors
in the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Despite this,
the Government have structured the mechanism in such a way that
energy-intensive industries will bear the brunt of the policy, but that
makes a mockery of their so-called plan for growth, and particularly
their aim to encourage investments and exports as a route to a more
balanced economy and to drive investment in green infrastructure. Even
if the proposals were successful at encouraging investment in
renewables, the measure would have a severe impact on other jobs, and
on investment and exports. What options, if any, did the Government
consider for mitigating the impact of the policy on those industries,
or was it considered a price worth paying?<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, as
was touched on earlier, the Government’s choice of mechanism for
carbon price support would provide a subsidy to the nuclear energy
industry of a reported £50 million a year, yet they explicitly
promised not to subsidise it. The Conservative party manifesto, the
coalition agreement and even the Prime Minister have said that the
nuclear industry should receive no public subsidy, so either the
Government have brought in this nuclear subsidy accidentally or they
are attempting to bring it in by the back
door.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000141">&#160;</a>

whether that is the right thing to do. However, the hon. Lady’s
colleagues prayed in aid NGOs such as Greenpeace and the World Wide
Fund for Nature, which do not want a new generation of nuclear power
stations—it is not only that they do not want a subsidy; they do
not want nuclear power it at all. What is the current position of the
Labour party? Does it want nuclear power to be part of our energy mix
or
not?</p>

               <p class="tabbed">We are talking
about a subsidy, which the Liberal Democrats explicitly ruled
out—a subsidy by stealth for the nuclear industry. The
Conservative Chair of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, the hon.

               <p class="tabbed">The
final issue is the impact on emissions. Will the mechanism really
result in more long-term investment in renewables? More importantly,
will it actually reduce carbon emissions? On the first point, DECC
commissioned the consultants Redpoint to look at the options for energy
reform. They reported in December
that,<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000151">&#160;</a>

whether investors believe the Minister’s

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Committee, however, needs no reminding of what the Government have
done. They raised VAT by 2.5 percentage points after the Prime Minister
repeatedly said that he had no plans to do so. Only weeks after
assuring the oil industry that they would preserve the stability of the
North sea oil regime, they sprang an ill-conceived surprise attack,
which we have discussed in some detail in Committee. They also shocked
the green energy industry in this country by proposing radical
reductions to small-scale feed-in tariffs. I have

renewables cannot happen overnight: some people were lined up for
projects on the basis that the feed-in tariff regime would apply to
them, but it was whisked away from under

the second point, there are serious concerns that, even if the
Government’s proposed rules reduced emissions in the UK, they
would simply increase them elsewhere in Europe. Redpoint, the
consultants commissioned by the Department of Energy and Climate
Change, said in its report, hidden away in a footnote:<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000156">&#160;</a>

the Government believe that a net reduction in carbon emissions will be
a key measure of the success of this scheme? What talks has she had

                  </strong> I want to make some general comments about the
clause, and to refer specifically to the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Scunthorpe. The clause is one of the most important in the
Bill, because of its possible effect on manufacturing, which has been
mentioned, and because of the long-term effect on our climate change
targets in this country. It introduces carbon price support, which will
lead to a proper carbon tax in future. This country will not be the
first to take that step. Such a tax exists in other parts of the
developed world. Sweden has one, and also has a well-developed, high
value-added manufacturing industry, which co-exists with a carbon tax.
Denmark has one. The Netherlands has one. In case I am upsetting my
coalition colleagues by naming too many EU member states, I point out
that British Columbia, in Canada, also has a carbon tax, in an economy
that is hugely based on resource
extraction.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
confirmed three weeks ago that the Government would adhere to the
recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change in the fourth carbon
budget. Of course, carbon budgets were introduced as a result of the
Climate Change Act 2008, which the hon. Member for Bristol East
mentioned. The fourth carbon budget, for the period from 2023 to 2027,
commits us to having a ceiling of 1,950 megatonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent, which means a 50% reduction on the 1990 level of emissions
by 2025. That puts us on course for the 80% reduction by 2050 that the
2008 Act, with cross-party agreement, committed us to
achieving.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
2008, all three parties were committed to the Act. In fact, significant
improvements were made to the Bill, which started in the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Amendments were tabled by my party
and the Conservative party and were supported by non-governmental
organisations. It is very strong legislation, and across the House we
have reason to be proud of it. However, there is no point in having
that legislation and a series of carbon budgets from now until the
mid-2020s if we do not have the fiscal and policy instruments in place
to achieve those demanding carbon reduction
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000164">&#160;</a>

the end of the day, we are all consumers, whether we are consuming the
energy directly in our own homes through our electricity or buying
products that have required a carbon-intensive industry to bring them
into the high street where we can purchase them, so a carbon tax will
fall, indirectly, on all of us as citizens. That is important because
we need to change our own behaviour. However, what we do with the
revenue from a carbon tax—I am ranging a little too far outside
clause 77, so I will not dwell too long on this—is important as
well. I think that taxes should be reduced elsewhere and, in
particular, vulnerable households should be protected from the impact
of increasing
taxes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000168">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Well, yes, I am not happy that increased taxes
fall on individuals that do not reflect their ability to pay those
taxes. As I was saying in response to the intervention by the hon.
Member for Edinburgh South, what we do after introducing a carbon tax
is important as well. There will need to be protection for vulnerable
households to ensure that they are not exposed to taxes in the same way
that I am. I am able to bear an increased carbon tax, but of course I
recognise that many of my constituents may not be able to do so.
Perhaps that could be dealt with through the income tax mechanism,
through the benefits system or through giving a direct rebate to each
citizen from the proceeds of the carbon tax. There are many things that
we can do to ensure that the burden of this taxation falls fairly on
individual households. Many of the other measures that the Government
are introducing, such as the green deal, which is being discussed in a
Committee Room further along this corridor, will help households to
come out of fuel poverty by retrofitting their
houses.<a class="bkMark" name="11060956000170">&#160;</a>
