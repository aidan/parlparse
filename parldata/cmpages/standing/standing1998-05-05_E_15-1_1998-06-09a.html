<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and
<P>
`(c) the further condition set out in sub-paragraph (7) below is satisfied in the case where one or more of those persons is an insurance company.'."--[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 208, in page 256, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) The further condition is satisfied where the potential advantage in 5(1) above is offset in full by any adjustments made by the profits of the disadvantaged person on the making of the claim by virtue of paragraph 6(2) below".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Before we stopped for lunch, I was explaining that life insurance companies have expressed alarm at being caught by the schedule. That was unexpected and happened without consultation. We tabled the amendments to reflect that concern. One or two are technically defective and others have misprints. In that way, we are following the example set by the Government who have tabled defective clauses and schedules--indeed, I have just heard that schedule 18 has nine mistakes, which I assume will be corrected by Government amendments. It is not surprising that practitioners outside the House are beginning to say that this is the worst drafted Bill with which they have had to deal.
<P>
As the insurance companies have discussed their concerns with the Inland Revenue, the purpose behind the amendments must be clear to the Treasury. It is obvious that we are trying to simplify the operation of the schedule, which deals with transfer pricing, by disapplying it in cases where there is no overall loss to the Revenue and the adjustments cancel each other out. For example, many insurance companies use a separate service company in their group. That company, which employs staff, recharges costs to the main operating company. Some people may see that as suspicious. Indeed, Labour Members, who are suspicious of business matters that they do not understand, may think that a separate service company has something to do with tax avoidance. That is not the case.
<P>
Separate service companies are often used for reasons of efficiency. It is usually good business practice to centralise services and then recharge to members of the group. That is good for policyholders and shareholders alike. However, what is perhaps more relevant is that the Insurance Companies Act 1982 does not permit an insurance company to do anything other than provide insurance. The main insurance company cannot provide services to other members of its group, such as a bank or a unit trust manager. The main company fits in with the Government's regulatory requirements by providing services through a separate member of the group.
<P>
What catches the eye of those interested in transfer pricing is that service charges do not include a mark-up. The service company could run at a loss or a modest profit, and the insurance company, which is charging for services, could run at an artificial profit. Because the latter incurs a lower effective rate of corporation tax, the overall tax charge on the group could be thought to be lower than intended by Parliament.
<P>
The amendment would provide that when the adjustments required under the legislation have no overall effect, they should be disapplied. In the example that I gave, if the profits of the service company were to be increased by requiring a mark-up on its charged-out services and the insurance company's profits were correspondingly reduced, and if the marginal rate of corporation tax in both cases was the same, the increase in one company would cancel the reduction in the other and the Exchequer would be no better and no worse off. The whole paperchase, compliance costs and administrative burden could be avoided if the amendment were accepted and the requirements in the schedule were disapplied. That would be a modest step towards recognising that the provision is a new and unwelcome burden on insurance companies. If the Exchequer will be no worse and no better off, I see no reason why the Government should not accept the amendment this afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> As I suggested to Mrs. Dunwoody, who was in your position this morning, Mr. Butterfill, it might be for the convenience of the Committee as this is an important substantive clause if I read some general background information which will be of interest to the amendment before us and other proposed amendments to the schedule. I shall then deal specifically with the matters raised by the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory).
<P>
Clause 106 and the schedule modernise the United Kingdom's pricing legislation. The Government have two key policy objectives in this area: to bring the transfer pricing regime within self-assessment and to align the UK rules more closely with the internationally agreed formulation of the arm's length principle in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model tax convention. The clause and its supporting schedule will achieve both aims.
[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
<P>
The clause represents the fruits of a lengthy consultation process which began under the previous Government. A round of informal consultations was held early in 1996 and following that, further work was done to address concerns identified by taxpayers and representative bodies. That led to the publication in October last year of a consultative document, together with draft clauses. The Revenue then entered into a formal phase of consultations, in the course of which they met with large numbers of taxpayers, tax practitioners and representative bodies. The provision now before the Committee reflects the outcome of those consultations and a number of important changes have been made to respond to concerns raised. I am pleased to report that the Government's willingness to consult on these important proposals was widely welcomed, and the Revenue also found the consultative process very useful.
<P>
The new rules will apply for chargeable periods ending on or after the appointed day for corporation tax self-assessment, which we have already announced will be 1 July 1999.
<P>
The existing transfer pricing legislation--section 770 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988--was enacted in 1951. Since then, international trade and commerce have become much more extensive, sophisticated and dynamic. The time has come when we need new transfer pricing legislation which takes these developments into account and will stand us in good stead well into the next century.
<P>
The term "transfer pricing" describes the process by which associated persons, principally members of multinational groups of companies, transfer goods, services, finance and intangible assets between one another. There is broad international agreement that, for tax purposes, such transactions should be evaluated in accordance with the arm's length standard. In other words, the profits or losses that are reported in tax returns should be those that would have accrued to the taxpayer had the terms of transactions with associates been the same as those that would have been agreed if the party had been unconnected and dealing independently with one another.
<P>
One of the Government's principal objectives is to modernise the UK's domestic transfer pricing rules. Under current legislation, the basic pricing rule is formulated in a narrowly transactional manner, which has become outmoded and which is increasingly unable to cope with the complexities of modern international business. The new rule is aligned as closely as possible with the internationally accepted formulation of the arm's length principle, which is contained in article 9 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model and which is therefore fully in tune with international best practice. It is encouraging that that approach received widespread support in consultations, following publication of the draft clauses last October. However, I am aware that concerns have been expressed about the language that was used to achieve that objective, and I want to deal with those concerns.
<P>
We appreciate that taxpayers and tax professionals are familiar with the wording of article 9, and that they would have preferred to see it "copied out" into UK law. However, we took the view--on the basis of the advice that we received--that a rule incorporated into UK legislation in the same terms as article 9 of the OECD model might be misunderstood and interpreted more narrowly than was intended. There seemed to us to be a risk that the courts could construe such a proposal as being narrower than article 9 under the OECD model. To meet that difficulty, the basic pricing rule has been drafted in broad terms, although its effect is intended to be the same as that of article 9 under the OECD model.
<P>
As a counterbalance to the broad formulation of paragraph (1), paragraph (2) requires that paragraph (1) be construed consistently with the OECD model, which effectively limits the scope of paragraph (1). It cannot be interpreted as being wider than article (9).
<P>
In bringing forward those proposals, the Government have adopted a balanced approach, in which an element of deregulation is accompanied by measures that will help to encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their obligations. In that regard, the Government are conscious of the potential costs of complying with the new regime. In framing our proposals, we have sought to keep the burden on taxpayers to the minimum that is necessary to secure a fair and effective regime.
<P>
Several measures are directed towards that end. First, the integration of transfer pricing within self-assessment means that taxpayers will no longer have to consider a separate set of management rules for transfer pricing. Secondly, the Government have decided to dispense with specific information powers for transfer pricing and to rely on the general powers that are provided by the Taxes Management Act 1970. Thirdly, the Government have decided not to impose a requirement on taxpayers to disclose information about transfer pricing in a tax return. That contrasts with what happens in some other major industrialised countries, which impose wide-ranging tax return requirements in that regard. Fourthly, the widening of the exemption from the legislation for transactions between two UK taxpayers means that many taxpayers will be unaffected by the new rules. Fifthly, the Revenue will provide guidance on the kinds of records that taxpayers will be expected to keep to meet their record-keeping obligations relating to transfer pricing.
<P>
As a matter of principle, we consider it to be fair and reasonable that taxpayers should be required to keep adequate records to support and justify their returns and self-assessments if called on to do so. That is reflected in the record-keeping requirements that are laid on taxpayers in relation to self-assessment.
<P>
Broadly, the record-keeping requirements for transfer pricing purposes will be based on the general rules that are provided for self-assessment. The nature of transfer pricing may, in certain circumstances, require taxpayers to keep particular kinds of records. In essence, that means documenting intra-group pricing methodology and the reasons for believing that that produces results that are compatible with the arm's length principle. The Government are satisfied that business will not be over-burdened. The Revenue will not adopt a prescriptive approach in that regard, and it will provide guidance on the broad principles that will be applied.

<P>
The Revenue believes that there will be no significant additional costs to taxpayers who already comply with the arm's length standard. Significant tax revenues are at stake. The proposal will help to protect the Exchequer and to maintain fairness in the tax system. Taxpayers who have hitherto not taken the trouble to observe the arm's length principle for tax purposes or who have deliberately manipulated prices should not expect to be shielded from the impact of additional costs to improve compliance standards. The new transfer pricing regime is consistent with the Government's objective of making the tax system as fair and effective as possible. We want to encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily, and we believe that the vast majority seek to comply. No compliance regime can be effective, however, without a system of penalties to deter and, where necessary, penalise non-compliance.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One side effect of the existing direction mechanism is that penalties cannot be charged in transfer pricing cases. With the integration of transfer pricing into self-assessment, however, the general penalty provisions will apply to transfer pricing as they do to other taxation issues.
<P>
In consultations, taxpayers have expressed some concerns, which I also want to address. No automatic or no-fault penalties will be exercised for transfer pricing irregularities. Penalties will be employed only where a loss of tax has arisen from the submission of an incorrect return, statement or declaration attributable to fraud or neglect. Moreover, the onus will be on the Revenue to demonstrate that there has been such fraud or neglect. If a taxpayer has made an honest and reasonable attempt to address further transfer pricing issues, and can demonstrate what action has been taken, penalties will not arise even though a judgment may be required.
<P>
Equally, the Government and the Revenue accept that transfer pricing is not an exact science--as the right hon. Member for Wells said--and in most circumstances there will be an acceptable range of outcomes. If the provision made between the parties falls within the acceptable range, there will be no question of penalties. In theory, the maximum penalty is 100 per cent. of the tax loss to the Crown, but the board of the Inland Revenue has discretion to mitigate penalties and routinely does so. In mitigating penalties, the board considers the extent to which the taxpayer has disclosed any irregularities, the degree of cooperation afforded by the taxpayer and the size and gravity of any offence.
<P>
The Revenue will publish guidance on how the penalty provisions will be applied in transfer pricing cases, and the imposition of such penalties will be supervised by the Revenue's head office to ensure that the rules are applied fairly and consistently.
<P>
I hope that you will agree, Mr. Butterfill, that that is a useful account for the record. It will form the backdrop to our discussion of the various groups of amendments. The right hon. Member for Wells moved his amendment in the most reasonable terms. I should like to address certain points that he raised.
<P>
On the question of consultation, we consulted with the Association of British Insurers as soon as we became aware of certain problems--they will be dealt with under the third group of amendments. Although there was not enough time to fully discuss all aspects, I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we were aware of the problems and the Revenue was anxious to consult with the ABI and other representative bodies on them. There was no intention not to consult, although some matters came to attention later than they should have done in such a lengthy period of consultation.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred specifically to the question of life insurance companies having to observe certain regulatory constraints. I want to give him a formal assurance again that the Government recognise that the special regulatory constraints to which life insurance business is subject can dictate the way in which a group's activities are structured and the pricing of intra-group transactions. In such circumstances, the Inland Revenue is prepared to accept that recharging cost is likely to be a normal commercial practice and will not seek to adjust the company's tax liabilities on the basis that normal management services provided by another company should be appraised at more than cost. That is a specific assurance on the point that he raised about a management company dealing with a life insurance company and providing services across the board.
<P>
Excluding UK-based companies from the provisions of the transfer pricing arrangements--major deregulation and simplification has already occurred--leaves two areas in which life insurance companies can benefit in a way that would not be extended by the proposed legislation and that would amount to avoidance. They are included in the legislation for two reasons. The first relates to the treatment of a management, insurance or services company and an insurance business. The second concerns the system that allows them to spread management charges forward over seven years for any acquisition. It could be open to them, inadvertently or deliberately, to make the whole of those charges relievable for tax in year one instead of over the seven years.
<P>
For both those reasons, we have decided to include life insurance companies in the legislation. The problem addressed by amendments Nos. 203 and 208 does not arise where there is no net tax difference between the two companies in the example given by the right hon. Gentleman. It would be rare for that to occur in life insurance companies. The obligation on one company to levy a charge on another to rectify the situation would involve a small additional compliance cost. The right hon. Gentleman's amendments, which are technically deficient, would impose an additional conditional burden on the industry. A net tax-neutral arrangement between two companies, where the tax arising in one is totally offset by tax relief in the other, would be so unusual that we see no need for the amendments. If that were to occur, the compliance cost would be so small that the matter does not need to be addressed.
[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
<P>
I am pleased to say that more recent discussions with the ABI and other representatives bodies have led us to look more favourably on other amendments. I look forward to hearing the Opposition's self-satisfaction when we reach them. I hope that my response has been sufficient.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Paymaster General is a changed man. This morning he brushed aside any inquiries about the clauses with which he was charged. We have now received a detailed general exposition of everything that lies behind this clause and we heard of his willingness to consider the merits of the next group of amendments.
<P>
The Paymaster General outlined at length some of the general principles behind the schedule. I and at least one of my hon. Friends will want to discuss those in detail when we reach the stand part debate. However, I shall concentrate on his response to amendments Nos. 203 and 208. He suggested, with that sleight of hand to which we have become accustomed, that there was consultation but that it was a bit late in the day. The plain fact is that no proper consultation took place with the insurers before the Bill was published. The right hon. Gentleman will concede that once it was published, it came as a considerable shock to the insurance industry. We are glad to have it on the record that the Treasury accepts that the regulatory constraints on that industry condition the way in which it does business.
<P>
I want to deal with the principle of the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. It was not clear whether the Paymaster General met all his concerns. Is there no need to apply the rules unless there is a substantive loss to the Exchequer? In other words, is he saying that where the net effect of the transaction is nil or likely to be nil, the rules will not be applied?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The rules will be applied. Opposition Members are trying to determine when they will apply or disapply. No one is able to predict with a degree of certainty the outcome of a transaction. We will not know at the time of a transaction whether the net effect of the tax in the two trading entities will be neutral or not. If Conservative Members reflect for a moment, they will see that to be the case and understand why we cannot accept the amendment on those terms. We do not think that that will happen in many instances, but where it does, there will be an additional compliance burden, such that one company will levy a charge on the other to let it out. In addition, the amendment is totally technically deficient, although it does raise a substantive point, on which we shall table an amendment in due course.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 204, in page 256, line 15, leave out from "arising" to "include".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 205, in page 256, line 17, after "(a)" insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the profits arising from the relevant activities in respect of which the insurance company is within the change to corporation tax do not include".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the profits arising from the relevant activities in respect of which the insurance company is within the change to corporation tax do not include".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 207, in page 256, line 22, after "companies" insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) the actual provision can be shown to follow normal commercial practice and the purpose of the actual provision is not the avoidance of tax".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 209, in page 256, line 30, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) Where the advantaged person is an insurance company sub-paragraph 6(b) should read as if for `paragraph 5(3) above' there was substituted `paragraph 5(3)(a) above'".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Although the Paymaster General did dilate a little on the more general provisions of the schedule in his response to earlier amendments, I would ask you to allow a wider debate later, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Of course it is my present intention to allow a stand part debate, but that will depend on the discipline of the Committee in confining remarks fairly narrowly to the amendments under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall show extreme discipline by speaking briefly and concisely to the amendments in this group. Although the language of the schedule and the amendments is opaque, a matter to which we shall return, the intention behind the group of amendments is simple: to relieve companies of the burden imposed by the schedule, if it is clear that their structure and pricing arrangements do not have tax avoidance motives.
<P>
The essential amendment is amendment No. 207, which would ensure that the rules would not apply provided that the company was following "normal commercial practice" and its purpose was not the avoidance of tax. I am aware of the problem of introducing motive tests into legislation. Nevertheless, I believe that it is worth exploring that approach in view of the fact that, both in this provision and elsewhere in the Bill--and the Government have signalled their intention to go further next year--there is a general drive against tax avoidance. It would be useful to know whether the Government think that motive tests are realistic or workable, especially as, in this case, such a test would relieve a significant section of the British service industry from having onerous and complex rules applied--and all because a perfectly legitimate structure has come under review.
<P>
As I have explained already, for regulatory and business efficiency reasons a structure may appear to avoid tax, even though that is not its motive and there are genuine commercial reasons for it. Indeed, the Paymaster General has just conceded that point. Therefore, I hope that he will look sympathetically on the group of amendments. He gave us some hope by saying that he was minded to accept at least some of our amendments, so perhaps we are in luck.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman may not know where he has struck lucky--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> On amendment No. 209.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is spot on. We are prepared to acknowledge the point raised by amendment No. 209, which is the result of consultation. In due course we would have tabled a similar amendment, and I propose that we should do that on Report.
<P>
I shall take what is a unique opportunity to congratulate the Opposition on being quick off the mark with amendment No. 209. However, that is regrettably little on which to congratulate them. We have a lot of ground still to cover, and purely in the interests of making progress I am trying to create a spirit of good will among Committee members.
<P>
As they stand, the rules allow a consequential adjustment to be claimed as long as both parties are within the charge to UK corporation tax and not entitled to exemption from that tax on the profit arising from the transactions in question. The amendment would change the rules so that a claim may be made so long as the profits are within the charge to corporation tax, irrespective of whether they, or any part thereof, are then subject to exemption.
<P>
An insurance company may have elements of income, such as that arising from pension business, which are exempt from corporation tax. The existence of such exempt income will not of itself prevent a company from claiming a consequential adjustment in respect of its income that is not so exempted. However, an adjustment cannot be claimed where a share of the income from activities that are relevant to a transfer pricing adjustment relates to exempt activities.
<P>
We recognise that there may be circumstances in which an insurance company wishes to make a claim for a consequential adjustment in respect of such partially exempt income. For that reason the Government accept that the amendment is in principle fair, and we will table an amendment to that effect on Report.
<P>
That is the one element that the Government feel is in need of attention. We sympathise with the life insurance industry, which should not be disadvantaged in any way by falling within the too narrow respects of the transfer pricing regime. Such measures are necessary to prevent tax avoidance. I am sure that Committee members are anxious that the process that they in many ways initiated should be continued constructively and effectively. For that reason, the Government cannot accept the other amendments.
<P>
However, we are minded to accept the intention behind amendment No. 209, which has highlighted the genuine possibility that persons might be penalised unnecessarily, albeit unintentionally. We shall therefore table an appropriate amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We have struck a schedule in which the Paymaster General is taking an undue interest. He is being extremely helpful, and we have struck gold on amendment No. 209. Perhaps because he was overwhelmed by that concession, he has not been able to comment directly on the motive test that we sought to introduce through amendment No. 207. It would be helpful if he could say why a motive test is inappropriate.
<P>
It is now understood that the insurance industries concerned are influenced by the regulatory measures by which they have to abide, rather than by a desire to avoid tax. Any concession for service companies does not necessarily apply to others such as fund management subsidiaries which, however innocuous, will now be subject to the same level of scrutiny. Without wishing to tempt his good will too far this evening, perhaps he could explain why a motive test is inappropriate in this case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There are many established parts of taxation law where a motive test works very well. We shall come to one such area--that of controlled foreign companies--in a moment. That is an area where we have improved matters, but without in any way changing the motive test.
<P>
Motive tests are difficult to introduce to tax law. Normally it is better that the legislation stands in its own right, and that the transactions are judged similarly. I am not asking to reverse the position; I ask the hon. Gentleman merely to reflect on it. There must be a positive reason for a motive test if it is to be introduced into tax law. I would normally be responsive to the idea and say, "That is the issue, what is the intention?". In tax law, however, it is far better to deal with the situation as it is, and to reserve the motive test for exceptional cases.
<P>
Unless the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) can point to anything in particular, I see nothing exceptional in tax law terms to make a motive test particularly relevant or attractive. Such a test should be kept for those situations--we shall come to them later in our debate--in which it clearly has a role to play. That is a better way of protecting the integrity and relevance of the test, which has a limited role in tax law.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General is trying to be helpful, but I suspect that future Finance Bills--those in the fairly near future--will return to this matter. We detect a genuine motive--if I may put it that way--to meet the legitimate concerns of the insurance industry. Nevertheless, there are problems with the schedule as drafted, and perhaps the Government will return to this question as part of a more general review. As I shall argue shortly, their approach to the reform of transfer pricing still lacks clarity and, in certain aspects, introduces new obscurities. In the light of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Sixteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I want to make a general point and then return to the text of the schedule.
<P>
My general point is that the Government are right to grasp the issue of transfer pricing, and we accept what was said earlier about the need to update the legislation[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
periodically. However the Government could easily overlook the simple point that the victims of transfer pricing tend to be high-tax countries.
<P>
Multinational companies are frequently tempted to declare profits in countries where they pay less tax. If this country can remain a comparatively low-tax country, however, multinational companies will want to declare their profits here. Conversely, they will not wish to declare their profits in the high-tax, typically continental, countries. The best way to ensure that this country is not disadvantaged by artificial schemes to export profits is for us to remain a low-tax country. The Government--through this Finance Bill and that of last year--are eroding the situation inherited from the previous Government, whereby this country has become a beacon of low taxation in many areas of tax.
<P>
We have debated examples of the Government increasing business taxes many times in this Committee; we describe many of them as stealth taxes because they were not announced in the Budget and do not become completely clear from reading the Bill. The CBI have put a £20 billion price tag on the business tax increase during this Parliament, which shows that we are in danger of going up the international tax league. If that continues, transfer pricing will become a problem, as UK-based multinational companies will seek to declare profits in other jurisfictions. The requirements of the schedule will therefore become doubly necessary for all the wrong reasons.
<P>
My second point is allied to that. We know that the Government have already signed--or at least agreed--a European Union code of conduct to ban unfair tax competition. The Government should not go down that road too enthusiastically, as many continental countries and a lot of people in the European Commission resent the fact that we are a beacon for foreign investment because of our low-tax regime. They regard it as unfair that companies can relocate from the continent to this country; we know that the alternative is relocating out of the European Union altogether, which will result in Europe as a whole losing revenue and employment. Too few people in some other member states understand that, and the code of conduct could be used to undermine the advantages that we built up during the past 18 years.
 <P>
In his characteristic way, the Paymaster General said that the consultation exercise had been a triumph and that everyone welcomed the way in which it proceeded, was frightfully grateful and had no real objections. That is not quite accurate. Many bodies and commentators accept--as I do--the general thrust of the Government's intentions, but they criticise the extremely complex language that is employed. They have especially criticised the fact that the schedule imports into this part of tax legislation the term "provision", which is not itself without ambiguity. It is used in accounting and tax terms in other Acts of Parliament in a different sense. The Government are trying to avoid what could have been the simplest way forward, namely to incorporate lock, stock and barrel the OECD rules on transfer pricing. They are trying to achieve the same end by the shorthand means of using the term "provision", and by relating several paragraphs to it. That has achieved neither clarity nor precision.
<P>
The OECD model rules on that matter are written in fairly plain language. Many of the companies that will have to interpret the Bill are foreign, and it would have been doubly desirable if the legislation to give effect to the new rules had been similarly clear. I do not understand why the Government did not adopt the solution of incorporating into British law the relevant sections of the OECD model tax treaty and the associated guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): Does my right hon. Friend wonder, as I do, why the term "provision" is not defined in the schedule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I hope that the Paymaster General can explain that. Does he anticipate any problems in using that word as shorthand for the phrases that were used in the OECD treaty, which were written in plain language?
<P>
The Law Society observed of the new schedule:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is the type of legislation that is readily understandable only from the point of view of those involved in its drafting--i.e. those who have a preconception of its meaning and who can therefore, we suppose, recognise it as achieving what they wish it to achieve--or those who have had the benefit of lengthy discussions with Inland Revenue officials. This is not a satisfactory way for Parliament to make law."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet again, we have an example of the Committee being asked to pass legislation which even practitioners outside and members of the Law Society find bafflingly difficult to interpret.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In proceedings on previous Finance Bills when the Conservative Government were in office, the Labour party criticised legislation for not being accessible to ordinary taxpayers. We undertook to rewrite the tax schedules in plain English and set up a project to do just that. What has happened to that initiative to rewrite legislation so that ordinary citizens can understand why their money is being taken from them? That undertaking was to rewrite existing tax law, and, at the very least, an opportunity should be taken to write new Finance Bills in plain English. As the Law Society has spotted, that has not happened.
<P>
Although there has been consultation, it has not led to clarity and precision. That is extremely regrettable because problems will be stored up for later. People will have to interpret the legislation and make sense of it. Transfer pricing is a difficult subject and can lead to lengthy and acrimonious disputes between multinational companies, whom we welcome here, and the Inland Revenue. I hope that the Paymaster General will consider seriously the general point of whether tax provisions can be read and understood by outsiders. If not, perhaps he will undertake to ask an outside body to make sense of the schedule for a future Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I want to raise a narrow point relating to paragraph 4 and to who participates in management under the transfer pricing regulations. I refer the Committee to page 255 of the Bill. Paragraph 4(11) of the schedule defines connected persons. Section 839(2) of the Taxes Act 1988 also defines connected persons, and that definition is broadly the same as in paragraph 4(11) of the schedule.
<P>
The two definitions start to deviate on "a relative". Why is the clause so widely drafted as to refer to an "ancestor or lineal descendant"? That raises all sorts of interesting possibilities. If the family trees of members of the Committee and people outside are researched far enough, many would be found to be "related and connected persons". We want to know from the Paymaster General a little more about how far the definition will take us. Some people have better records than others. Does the provision mean that we shall all have to go to Somerset House, become genealogists and research our family trees to see whether we are connected persons? Will the Paymaster General elucidate the matter by telling us why the definition has been changed from the well-established definition in section 839(2) of the Taxes Act 1988 and whether the change is likely to apply to future tax provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): This has been an interesting discussion as we have moved around the clause and the schedule. Important points of principle are involved because the provision touches on public consultation and what the Government mean by public consultation.
<P>
I think that all Opposition Members welcome the spirit in which the Paymaster General showed undue interest in the schedule. I wish, however, that some of his hon. Friends inherited the same spirit. We heard the most extraordinary intervention this morning from the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) who, with an exclamation of disbelief, could not understand why members of the Committee should want to represent outside interests. After this morning's sitting, I talked to the Institute of Directors, the CBI and the Law Society and I told them of the view of the hon. Member for Dudley, North.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): The hon. Gentleman obviously did not hear me correctly. My objection was not so much that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks simply parroted three points made by outside interests, but that he was trying to make out that his views were more original than those of Labour Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> As always, the hon. Gentleman has not held back. At moments like this, his contributions reveal a great deal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It seems odd that we should be lectured on parroting second-hand arguments by a jobbing barrister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The atmosphere is hotting up.
<P>
An important point is being made. Whether we are parroting or paraphrasing, the views of the Law Society, the CBI and the IOD are crucial because they represent a large number of firms, partnerships and individuals. The cheap jibe directed at my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks must be seen as just that. Whether we are parroting or paraphrasing, the points are serious. The Paymaster General is to be admired for recognising that. The hon. Member for Dudley, North would do well to make a contribution to the debate that is based not on a cheap jibe but on substantive information. He might even reflect on what the Law Society and others have said.
<P>
The truth is that public consultation failed because it was not undertaken adequately. There was no true spirit of consultation before the Government introduced the schedule and its relevant clause. The reality is that paragraph 25 of the notes on clauses informs us that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The provisions are the outcome of an extensive consultation process."</ul></font>
<P>
However many of those who were consulted do not believe that the process was adequate or extensive. They do not accept what is in the schedule.
<P>
It is clear that the schedule lacks clarity. It is riddled with confusion from beginning to end. I could give numerous examples of that, but I will not because the Paymaster General has recognised some of the problems. The interpretation of the schedule is ambiguous. Crucially, a number of those people to whom I spoke today made the important point that in terms of compliance--which means getting information from the Inland Revenue--much of the guidance material is still missing.
<P>
Once again, we are being asked to agree to a schedule where half the information is missing. It does not really matter if we do not have the information we will not have to comply with the schedule, but it matters to those firms up and down the country that will have to comply. It is a pretty sorry state when a Government believes that they can introduce a schedule that is at best half baked-- we have heard that criticism of it time and again. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who quoted from the Law Society, said that that was not a satisfactory way for Parliament to make law. The absurdity of the situation is that it will be difficult for people to fill out a tax return correctly.
<P>
The Paymaster General should note the comments of the Law Society, the CBI and others about the definition of the word "provision", to which my right hon. Friend referred. If "provision" means all the terms and conditions that attach to transactions, the proposed new legislation will make it much harder to certify that a tax return is correct. Either the Paymaster General accepts those comments or he does not. Such bodies have told you, Mr. Butterfill, and the Committee that the information is inadequate. The Government are not taking their responsibilities seriously. The schedule and the clauses contain countless examples of poor drafting, of which there has been much criticism today. We may be seeing this afternoon a slight change in the spirit of co-operation in the Committee. The Paymster General would do well not to dismiss the Opposition's comments.
<P>
On clause 63, we warned that the Government's provisions would catch not rock stars, who would postpone their concerts, but charity aid workers. One can postpone a rock concert, but one cannot postpone a famine. Important bodies, organisations and individuals have said that the parameters and definitions are too loose in clause after clause and schedule after schedule. Those bodies, organisations and individuals do not know what the Bill means. When they go to the Inland Revenue for guidance, they discover that the guidance[Mr. Woodward]
either has not been thought through or is not yet available.
<P>
A senior partner in Simmons and Simmons tried to make sense of the schedule, but he said to me that its parameters went so wide that his company was unable to advise its clients how far it would go. In relation to the questions that my right hon. Friend asked, will the Paymaster General confirm that if an inconsistency arises between section 28AA and the OECD, the OECD rules should act as a restraining force? Will he answer yes or no? People want clarification, but they cannot get it from the Inland Revenue or from anyone else. Pehaps the Paymaster General will clarify that simple point, to which no one knows the answer.
<P>
Another worry about the schedule is the impact that it will have on small companies as a consequence of compliance costs. We are supposed in the UK--even under the new Labour Government--to be a country that wants to increase exports. However, the schedule's provisions will make the job of small businesses that want to do that even harder. The way in which the Bill is drafted means that they will have to employ consultants. I would hazard a guess that most Labour Committee members do not have a clue what the schedule means paragraph by paragraph but, frankly, why should they? If the best tax experts and the best lawyers in the land cannot understand it, why on earth should they?
<P>
Why are we considering the schedule this afternoon when so many people are unable to explain it. Many have said to me that it takes us backwards, not forwards. It is a problem for small firms, who will now have to take professional advice in order to complete the self-assessment, and even to discover whether thet are eligible. There are several examples of problems of interpretation. To quote just one, clarification is needed on the relationship between the terms "provision" and "transaction". Another is that people are unclear about the parameters of the word "impose". I could quote many more examples, and hon. Members would not want me to do so, but the substantive point remains; this is unclear legislation, which must be bad legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The schedule would put UK transfer pricing legislation on a par with the OECD model. At the beginning of the debate, the Paymaster General said that he would not want to go further than article 9 of the OECD model treaty. The OECD has long produced model double tax treaties, which act as templates for countries in the OECD. It has also produced transfer pricing guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administrations, which set out guidelines for best practice in interpreting the clauses in those treaties on transfer pricing issues.
<P>
The OECD is to tax what the World Trade Organisation is to international free trade. When trying to stamp out international tax avoidance, the Government should look to the OECD, not to the European Union code of conduct on harmful tax competition, which, in effect, is no more than a cartel to drive up tax rates in Europe at the expense of Europe's international trading position. However, over the years, the OECD has performed a very useful role in trying to stamp out black holes of tax avoidance on the international scene.
<P>
The Inland's Revenue's document, "Mordernisation of the Transfer Pricing Legislation", which is the outcome of consultation, states that the Government are satisfied that the new basic pricing rule achieves its objective of aligning the UK's formulation of the arm's length principle with that contained in the OECD model. It goes on to say that the UK legislation will not go wider than that envisaged by the OECD.
<P>
The word "provision", to which my right hon. and hon. Friends have referred, is a new concept in UK transfer pricing legislation. The old section 770 of ICTA 1988 referred to an arm's length price. The word "provision" covers much more than the price; it takes into account the whole deal. For example, whether the companies in the transactions are thinly capitalised is a factor that will be taken into account in determining whether the interest rate charged by one company to another in a world wide group should be regarded as an arm's length price.
<P>
The Institute of Directors is concerned about the term "provision". It says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If `provision' does mean all the terms and conditions attaching to transactions, the proposed new legislation will make it very much harder than the present legislation to sign a tax return as correct. To be satisfied of the correctness of a return, one would have to consider every aspect of every transaction, not just prices."</ul></font>
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells referred to the Law Society, which is also worried about the phrase. It says that the principal difficulty lies in the use of the word "provision" and in the rather arcane phrase,
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
"provision as between any two persons".</ul></font>
<P>
Its understanding is that it is meant to bring into account the whole transaction or series of transactions, not just the price.
<P>
If the Paymaster General is keen that the legislation should not go wider than set out by the OECD, he should not have included, in paragraph 2 of schedule 16, the word "best" in the phrase,
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
"This schedule shall be construed . . . in such manner as best secures consistency between--"</ul></font>
<P>
It would be far better to remove the word "best" and leave the phrase as "in such manner as secures consistency with the OECD model". To impose a "best" requirement will allow the Inland Revenue to go far beyond what is envisaged by the OECD treaty. I urge the Paymaster General, before returning with his new amendments to the schedule, to consider whether it is right to leave "best" in the phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The very purpose of the word "best" is to ensure that the schedule is read in a way that most closely achieves the OECD principles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B>  That is one interpretation of "best". Another is that it could go beyond the OECD treaty. Outside professionals have told me that they would prefer the word to be removed, to stop the Inland Revenue from interpreting the phrase more widely than necessary. No one objects to putting extensive and thorough transfer pricing legislation on the statute book, but every piece of legislation that we apply to business is another burden, and every year a Finance Bill imposes more and more burdens on business. The time will come when the burden is so great that companies simply cannot cope. That applies especially to medium-sized companies that cannot afford specialist advice to deal with extensive pieces of legislation.
<P>
I urge the Paymaster General to consider whether the phrase will put a larger burden on business that is not strictly necessary to deal with transfer pricing between multinational enterprises based in this country and abroad.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> It is of great importance that we have clear, unambiguous and effective tax legislation to prevent transfer placing. The Government want to bring that legislation more closely in line with the internationally agreed formulation of the arm's length principle in the OECD model tax convention. Advisers and companies are completely at a loss to understand the meaning of some of the paragraphs in schedule 16. At the risk of repeating what has already been said, the right hon. Member for Wells referred to the Law Society's memorandum on the Finance Bill, which inquires into the meaning of "provision", especially when used in paragraph 1 of new schedule 28AA to the Taxes Act 1988 which refers to "provision" as between two parties. It is an unusual phrase in British tax legislation and the legislation is so uncertain that, with the huge amount of money at stake, significant litigation is likely to arise from the ambiguity.
<P>
Paragraph 2(1) of the schedule requires the new schedule to be construed on a basis consistent with article 9 of the OECD model. Article 9 is not a model of clarity, but people are familiar with it and it is infinitely more clear than the wording in the new paragraph. Industry and the professions cannot understand why the Government have amended the wording of the OECD model and replaced the intelligible words--"conditions are made or imposed" with the nebulous phrase in paragraph 1(1),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provision . . . has been made or imposed".
<P>
That adds uncertainty; it is unclear and a recipe for litigation. I hope that the Government will reconsider the drafting because much needs to be done to make it more clear, more precise and more certain.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I share the concerns of my right hon. and hon. Friends on the schedule. I, too, have read the comments of the Law Society and I cannot help noticing that it describes the wording of paragraph 7 of the schedule as impenetrable. Can you rule, Mr. Butterfill, on whether it is in order for the Committee to vote on such a provision when the finest lawyers in the land describe the drafting as impenetrable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not for the Chair to interpret the meaning of clauses. That is a matter for right hon. and hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Indeed, Mr. Butterfill. However, we are told by the finest lawyers in the land that the paragraph is impenetrable and impossible to interpret. I have tried to interpret it. I consulted the Board of Inland Revenue's notes on clauses. I urge any one with an interest in gobbledegook to look at note 15, which attempts to explain paragraph 7. It is six lines of impenetrable English that defies analysis.
<P>
It should be put on record that, when Committee members voted on the schedule, we did not understand what we were voting on. I urge any judge who has to deal with the matter to take that into consideration. It would be healthy for this country's legislative process if judges were to throw out legislation such as schedule 16, which is not written in plain English. As we have heard, a plain English version of the schedule does exist. We would not oppose a plain English approach to the problem of transfer pricing.
<P>
One wonders how big a problem the OECD is for this country. I am grateful to the Library for Research Paper No. 64, dated 4 June. It states that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"contrary to previous estimates ... the UK has improved its position relative to the OECD average since the 1970s and has closed the gap with countries such as Canada, France, Sweden and Switzerland."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whatever the rights or wrongs of the current system, this country has adopted a low-tax approach that has undoubtedly contributed to an improved performance compared with that of other OECD members.
<P>
During the general election campaign, we heard many times how Britain's performance had suffered compared to that of other OECD countries. When one considers how the OECD treaty is implemented in this country, it is clear that Labour Members have lost the mandate to put it into effect. In respect of the OECD, the previous Government clearly did a good job. The Government should listen to our views on the implementation of an OECD-wide proposal. The Paymaster General has already eaten a small slice of humble pie today; he should eat a further slice not only today but in the future.
<P>
We have a problem with the word "provision". In the banking world in which I used to work, the term "provision" covers loans. It is sometimes very difficult to assess the correct price for a loan, especially one between two parties who, because of their capital structure, have no access to international markets such as the bond market.
<P>
Great scope will exist for argument with the Inland Revenue about the word "provision". There will also be uncertainty among those who invest in this country about how that word--if it also means loans, as I believe it must--may affect the manner of their investment.
<P>
There is a further aspect of tax minimisation by international companies. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells noted, it should not be assumed that every attempt by a company to minimise tax works to the detriment of this country. It follows that a company that has an international structure designed to minimise tax paid in another country--which would not be to the detriment of Britain--might wish to organise its investments in this country in a particular way. For example, it might wish to invest through companies that would be deemed under-capitalised under this legislation. Investment that might otherwise come to Britain therefore would not do so, because provisions intended to protect this country's tax base would serve merely to frighten off those companies that sought to shelter their activities from another country's tax base.
[Mr. St. Aubyn]
<P>
Does the Paymaster General think that part of his job is to be an international tax policeman who tries to enforce the tax revenues and the tax receipts of other jurisdictions as well as this one? We need to hear from him about that. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells mentioned the terms of the good behaviour treaty with other members of the EU and the introduction of the OECD treaty. If the Government intend to act in such a role, they will certainly frighten off people who might otherwise be willing to put money into this country where it will generate tax, jobs and wealth.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are many ideas in the wind, such as those that deal with cross-border issues and the withholding of tax in the EU, but to prove that we are good European citizens, we must guard against embracing many of them. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells mentioned the word "continental". It was disturbing that a Labour Member almost went into overdrive. It is clear that the programming technique at Millbank towers is still unsophisticated. We do not have to look at the continental example of high tax and assume that we have to adopt it; we do not have to accept the continental proposals for withholding tax if they do not suit us--they clearly do not suit the City of London--and we do not have to accept a version of an OECD treaty which is written in such an impenetrable way that no one on the Committee really understands it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I wish to ask two questions. The broad ambit of the provision is intended to produce new thin capitalisation rules by the back door. To what extent have consultations on that taken place between practitioners and corporate Britain? There seems little doubt--I should like to hear the Paymaster General's views on this--that we have a regime on thin capitalisation with a shareholder connectedness test of 75 per cent.
<P>
The notes say that there is a control test. In other words, a new thin capitalisation regime will be imposed de facto when the Revenue implements the provision. When the Paymaster General takes advice from officials, I hope that he can tell us whether there is any merit in consolidating in one place a set of rules on thin capitalisation. Many practitioners believe that that would be a good idea. They do not think that it is right and appropriate for new rules to be introduced by the Revenue through the back door and in the schedule. The rules should be consolidated in one place and set out in a coherent fashion without different connectedness tests being applied. That would allow the rules to be clearly scrutinised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would help the Committee to know why the Paymaster General and his officials rejected the request by the professionals that the rules should be codified in one place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a helpful point.
<P>
My second point relates to the phrasing in paragraph 4(11) and (12) which clearly defines how connectedness will be applied, but it merely applies the connectedness test to individuals. What is surprising is that there is no section 839 test of connection as it would apply to corporate bodies. I am at a loss to understand how paragraph 4 will be sensibly interpreted merely by referring to sub-paragraphs (11) and (12), which relate to individuals. There should be a section 839 test of connection as it relates to companies. Will the Paymaster General respond to that specific point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I return to paragraph 5(6), which relates especially to the insurance industry. I want to put two points to the Paymaster General.
<P>
First, I must put it on record that this paragraph came as a complete shock to the industries concerned. I know that the Paymaster General will confirm that no consultation took place before this section of the Bill was published. Did he consider any alternative methods of tackling any perceived mischief on the part of the insurance industry, perhaps under the general anti-avoidance rules?
<P>
Secondly, I want to raise the issue of compliance. The Paymaster General acknowledged the extent of the compliance problem. Indeed, he read out a substantial list of promised measures to minimise the cost of compliance, so a problem clearly exists. I hope that he will accept that for industries that have not been into transfer pricing before, time is remarkably short. If the proposed legislation applies to accounting periods ending on or after 1 July next year, industries such as the insurance industry will have little time to prepare the proper records and documentation that may be required for the comfort that they seek. Will the Paymaster General say whether the compliance guidance, which he offered in his list, is ready or in the process of being issued to the insurance industry or to any other newcomers to such a regime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> There are a lot of points to respond to and we have had, on the whole, a good debate. The issue of why we did not simply incorporate the wording of article 9 of the OECD model is central to that debate. I cannot greatly improve on the reply that I gave in my detailed statement at the beginning. I readily concede that all members of the Committee will have found some difficulty in appreciating the full significance of that statement if not in interpreting it. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks is right to draw attention to the five specific points that I listed to make it easy.
<P>
On the question of copying out article 9 of the OECD model into UK law, we took the view--I shall repeat the precise words that were used--that on the basis of the advice we received, a rule incorporated into UK legislation in the same terms as article 9 of the OECD model might well be misunderstood as narrower than intended. Various nuances exist between continental and British legislation, and between British and American legislation, many of which relate to the letter of the law or the intent of the law. That may have led to our fear that simply adopting article 9 could lead to misunderstanding. I shall qualify that in a moment, as it is an important issue on which Opposition Members sought assurance on several occasions.
<P>
To return to why we did not incorporate the article as it stood, there seemed to be a risk that the courts could construe it as narrower than was intended by the OECD. To meet that difficulty, the basic pricing law has been drafted in broad terms, although its effect is intended to be the same as that of article 9. As a counterbalance to the broad formulation of paragraph 1, paragraph 2 requires that the interpretation of paragraph 1 should be consistent with the OECD model. I shall address the issue of "best" qualification, which was raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), in a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is it not the case that if we had simply copied out article 9, Opposition Members would be jumping up and down saying that we had not taken into account our own traditions of drafting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> My hon. Friend, who is a distinguished professor in these matters--he is a learned member of the profession--is quite right. If the suggestion had emanated from the EU--heaven help us--as opposed to the OECD, we should never have heard the end of the matter.
<P>
Opposition Members should come to a balanced judgment when they have studied the pros and cons of article 9 and the views of the Law Society and other bodies. The important point to reiterate is the fact that the scope of paragraph (1) is effectively limited and qualified by paragraph (2). Paragraph (1) cannot be interpreted in a way that goes wider than the provisions of article 9. That fundamental reassurance should be welcomed on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
I shall try to cover all the points that have been raised. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) made much use of the word "impenetrable", which the Law Society employed in presenting its view. Some might argue that the only impenetrable thing in the Committee is the hon. Gentleman's mind.
<P>
The schedule's drafting was discussed by many Opposition Members. The right hon. Member for Wells was no doubt behind the write-it-in-plain-English initiative for tax laws. I have heard it said--I regret to say that I would not for a moment associate myself with this view--that that initiative was something of a quixotic venture and that the attempt to take that course, laudable though it was, has thrown up many more problems than could have been anticipated.
<P>
Let me hasten to assure the right hon. Gentleman that the initiative is still alive and kicking. He will recall our earlier discussion about this matter. We attempted to involve some of the lawyers and drafting experts who are concerned with the write-it-in-plain-English initiative in drafting parts of the Bill. I point that out to him because he may remember criticising parts of the Bill for being written in the arcane language with which the initiative was meant to dispense. That shows the difficulty of drafting legislation in a way that is intelligible to the layman. The fact that we involved those lawyers in the Bill--I believe that that was a laudable and correct decision--meant that the work on rewriting many other important parts of the tax system has fallen behind. However, we are aware of the situation and we intend to push forward with it as much as we can.
<P>
Many Conservative Members and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), who spoke for the Liberal Democrats made a great deal of the use of the word "provision". If this helps Opposition Members, the equivalent word in the OECD draft is "condition". However, the OECD makes it clear that that word has a much wider meaning than it has in ordinary English law. A choice is obviously involved. The OECD's meaning is much wider than that in ordinary English law. We chose to use the word "provision", which means what the transaction provides. That is not a provision in the narrow accounting term, which was discussed by the right hon. Member for Wells. It simply means what the transaction provides for, which has a plain meaning--indeed, it is plainer than the OECD word--and, in my view, it needs no further definition. We try to define exactly what a word means the first time that it is used, and we cannot do better than that.
<P>
I shall discuss in a moment the points made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds on thin capitalisation. The definition of connected persons is, I am informed, exactly as it appears in section 839(8) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. I hope that that convinces the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown that the difference that he thought was in the Bill is not there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have the schedule here and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds said, it does indeed refer to companies. Perhaps I should be able to, but I cannot quite see how that is included in the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The definition is the same. A major point does not arise with related persons. However, to take up the point raised by the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward), I thought that he was somewhat disparaging of a genuine attempt by the Inland Revenue to engage in consultation. The more legislation I see from the inside--and that includes two major Finance Bills--the more I believe that consultation is vital. It does a disservice to all concerned to disparage it or say that it has not been meaningful, because it has been.

I can think of several things that we have done since the Finance Bill of July last year. A real attempt was made to clarity for the film industry precisely the meaning of what was being attempted, which enabled it to make proposals that found great favour, both with the industry and with the Revenue. So hon. Members should not say that this is the old form of dictation dressed up as consultation because that is not the intention at all.
<P>
I shall quote a few examples, without going into the merits of any of them. The transitional provisions for joint ventures have been considerably modified. The change from section 416 of ICTA 1988 to section 840 of ICTA 1988 on the definition of control has been considerably modified, and we shall deal with those issues later. Dropping the partnership attribution rules in section 839(4) of ICTA was also a result of[Mr. Robinson]
consultation. The redrafting of guidance notes on record keeping is a major point, on which the CBI has briefed both the Opposition and the Government. The undertaking to give guidance on penalties, a matter to which I referred earlier, emerged from a genuine attempt to deal with a difficult area of law by proper consultation.
<P>
I have been asked whether I regard myself as an international tax policeman. I do regard it as the duty of the Inland Revenue to apply the transfer pricing regulations in the proper way to ensure that full revenue accrues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I specifically asked which model would act as the restraining force, and I do not believe that the Paymaster General answered that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I could not hear what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> If any inconsistency arises between schedule 28AA and the OECD model, which would act as the restraining force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a hypothetical issue. It may not be entirely satisfactory, but I can only repeat that we do not intend the schedule to be applied more widely than the OECD model. That is the fundamental issue.
<P>
On the problem of thin capitalisation, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was correct. The principal thin capitalisation rule in section 209(2) remains in force. The rule applies only where there is a 75 per cent. shareholding relationship. These are points that will be dealt with in detail in relation to subsequent provisions, but we have made improvements that have been widely accepted by the industry. The new legislation applies where there is a 50 per cent. shareholding relationship, which is the natural consequence of aligning with the OECD model--a policy aim that has been universally approved.
