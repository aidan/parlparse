<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. John Denham): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
With your permission, Mr. O'Hara, I should like to give details of an amendment that I intend to table at a later stage.
<P>
I am grateful to the Committee for its speedy acceptance last Thursday of the clauses that will introduce the new penalty regime for the Contributions Agency. The package includes the new criminal offence of fraudulent evasion of national insurance contributions, which will be a major weapon in our armoury against employers who wilfully misappropriate contributions instead of paying them to the collector of taxes or the Contributions Agency. A consequence of changing the legislation and decriminalising the majority of misdemeanours is that the Department will lose its current ability to transfer liability for a company's unpaid debt to a negligent director under sections 114 and 115 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, except in the handful of cases where we obtain a conviction for fraudulent evasion.
<P>
The Government are determined to act against the problems caused by phoenix directors and their ilk, who put their companies into liquidation, having failed to hand over their national insurance contributions or those of their employees, but having made a personal financial gain. A new company appears shortly afterwards, often on the same premises, with the same employees doing the same work, and the process then repeats itself. The national insurance fund loses about &#163;150 million a year when companies go into insolvency with national insurance debts. Up to one third of that is due to phoenixism. The end result is that contributions that have been collected from employees' pay have to be credited and benefits paid out on the strength of the contributions that the fund never receives. I am therefore loth not to replace our current ability to act against directors and officers with another in keeping with the new penalty regime. That is what the further amendment will do.
<P>
In brief, when a company fails to pay in full a contributions debt due to the negligent or fraudulent behaviour of any or all of the directors, consideration will be given to transferring the debt to those directors personally. A small, highly trained body of Contributions Agency staff, liaising closely with Inland Revenue officers, will investigate the facts. They will decide whether negligence or fraudulence is involved and, if so, which of the directors are culpable. A decision as to the degree of culpability in each case will be made. The total debt, including any associated penalty, will be apportioned between the culpable directors in proportion to their degree of culpability. As a safeguard, directors will have a full right of appeal against the decision that they have behaved negligently or fraudulently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): I was just wondering what relevance this has to new clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I understood that with your permission, Mr. O'Hara, I was making an announcement of assistance to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful for that, but I have to confess that I too was wondering when the Minister would deal with the burden of new clause 2. However, the Committee will note that he is making a helpful announcement that will lead us in that direction--soon, I hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> As swiftly as possible, Mr. O'Hara. My remarks relate to an amendment that the Government intend to introduce later in the proceedings on the Bill. It is helpful if we inform not only members of the Committee, but also those outside the House, of our intentions.
<P>
As I said, directors will have a full right of appeal against a decision that they have behaved negligently or fraudulently and can challenge whether the apportionment was reasonably exercised.
<P>
I will further reassure the Committee of the limited circumstances in which it is intended that the measure will be used. It is primarily, but not exclusively, aimed at the phoenix-type directors who have deliberately failed to pay NICs and usually PAYE tax and put the company into insolvency, having made a personal financial gain. Involvement in large NICs debts in relation to two or more companies would suggest a greater degree of culpability than in relation to a first company.
<P>
I hope that legitimate businesses will welcome the measure as a signal of Government intent to deal severely with the less scrupulous minority. The penalty regime poses no threat to honest, hard-working business men. There will, of course, be an opportunity for a full discussion of the proposal when the amendment is tabled, but I wanted to give the Committee notice of our intention. I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. O'Hara, in allowing me to make that announcement. I hope that it will help the Committee.
<P>
The Government plan to use new clause 2 to assist in implementing the new policies to bring vouchers and payments into funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes into national insurance liability. Many of those policies can be introduced under existing legislation. The new clause is needed to ensure that employers cannot circumvent the national insurance charge by the simple expedient of making payments to cover more than one employee, in a manner that would frustrate the imposition of the charge.
<P>
To help the Committee to set the clause in context, I shall set out briefly the main details of our new policies and explain how the new clause will contribute to them, and how we plan to use the regulation-making powers that it contains.
<P>
I shall deal first with our proposals for non-cash vouchers. By these we mean in principle a voucher exchangeable for goods or services--for example, a store voucher. Non-cash vouchers are generally subject to tax but not liable for national insurance. The Government believe that that is unfair. It is unfair for low-paid employees who receive vouchers and who therefore do not pay contributions that would help them to earn benefits to support them in periods of unemployment, sickness or old age.

In the worst cases, payment in vouchers rather than cash can mean that people do not pay any contributions at all and so miss out completely on the protection of the contributory benefit system. It is more generally unfair to employees who are paid in cash, who pay more contributions than employees who receive non-cash vouchers. It gives an unfair competitive advantage to employers who pay in vouchers, compared to those who pay in cash.
<P>
The--by now infamous--Great Yarmouth case is a clear example. The manager of a nursing home paid her employees in cash to just below the lower earnings limit and topped up their pay with a substantial amount in vouchers, with the express stated intention of avoiding national insurance.
<P>
The Government want to take action to nip that kind of practice in the bud, and to ensure fairness to employers and employees alike. We propose to bring non-cash vouchers firmly into liability for national insurance. However, we intend to exempt childcare vouchers for the time being, so as not to cut off options in the development of our national childcare strategy.
<P>
Powers to charge national insurance on vouchers already exist in section 3 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which defines earnings for national insurance purposes. Vouchers are currently exempted in regulation 19 of the contributions regulations.
<P>
We will end that exemption from April 1999, and bring non-cash vouchers into contributions liability at the point at which they are supplied to employees. As a general principle we will follow closely the Inland Revenue's practice when dealing with exemptions from the charge and valuation mechanisms, although some differences will be necessary to reflect the nature of the tax and national insurance systems. For example, employers will need to record contributions on a weekly or monthly basis, in line with normal practice for contributions, rather than on an annual basis as for tax. That is essential to ensure that contributions can feed properly into individual's benefit records.
<P>
New clause 2 is needed to deal with circumstances in which a voucher may be provided collectively to a group of employees, or those in which a block of vouchers may be bought by an employer and in which it is necessary to apportion the costs to each employee, who would then receive a voucher. Without the clause it would be possible to circumvent the national insurance charge by providing a single voucher to benefit two or more employees.
<P>
We intend to consult closely with business to ensure that we produce regulations that will provide a sensible balance between the need to provide a robust means of valuing collective vouchers in a way which cannot be circumvented, and our desire to impose the least possible administrative burden. In some cases, employers may be able to use the new PAYE settlement agreements to cover such vouchers and to reduce administration. However, settlement agreements are voluntary mechanisms and cannot necessarily cover all cases. We are sympathetic to the need to keep burdens low for employers, but I must emphasise that if employers choose to pay through this route, they must meet the administrative requirements which go with that payment method. That will include apportioning costs in certain circumstances.
<P>
I shall now deal with our proposals to bring funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes into national insurance. FURBS are retirement benefit schemes that are outside the scope of tax-approved retirement benefit schemes. Typical FURBS consist of an employer securing future benefits through an insurance policy or through the establishment of a separate trust. Insurance-based schemes are common in the case of so-called death benefit schemes, under which insurance policies are written into trust for employees. In practice, trustees apply the employer's contributions towards an insurance policy that provides a lump sum death benefit on the death of the specified person. The most common alternative model involves the employer establishing a trust fund specifically for participating employees and members.
<P>
FURBS started as a way to allow employers to provide a top-up for high earners who have reached the maximum that they can put into their tax approved personal or occupational pension. Employees are taxed on employers' contributions outside tax-approved schemes.
<P>
Some pension providers recommend FURBS as a way for companies to provide pensions whilst circumventing the restrictions required for tax-approved status. One of the attractions of these schemes is their flexibility. They are not necessarily used to provide retirement benefits, but they can be used to pay bonuses with a single payment from the employer passed on to the employee after just a few weeks. We propose to bring the tax and national insurance treatment of these schemes closer together by bringing FURBS fully into national insurance.
<P>
As with vouchers, very little new primary legislation is needed. Since we first announced our proposals to bring all FURBS into earnings, the Contributions Agency has received legal advice that has led it to take a more robust view of the current legislation. The agency this week has announced that most payments into FURBS in fact are caught by existing legislation. It has issued guidance to pension providers, accountants and other professional advisers to explain which schemes are caught.
<P>
Employers with schemes caught under current law will be required to include the payments in earnings for national insurance by April 1998 at the latest. The agency generally will not seek arrears of contributions for the past, as some employers may have found the previous guidance misleading. That would clearly be unfair. However, there is one exception to that for a small group of avoidance schemes that the agency has identified and against which it has always sought to enforce liability. In those schemes the employer has clearly never intended that the scheme should provide retirement benefits--the whole exercise is directed towards paying an annual bonus without paying contributions. The money is paid into the trust and out again within weeks or even days without there being a pension provided. The agency has always taken a firm stand against FURBS that in reality, do not aim to provide genuine pensions, and it will continue to pursue arrears from that type of naked scam.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve Webb (Northavon):</B> I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but I am genuinely confused about what his speech has to do with new clause 2. I was going to ask about the revenue effects of the new clause in terms of enhanced national insurance revenues and of the cost in terms of enhanced entitlement to national insurance benefits. I apologise for my ignorance, but I do not see the relevance of his speech to those subjects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> As I have been endeavouring to explain, new clause 2 would enable us to bring both vouchers and FURBS into the national insurance system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> New clause 2?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Correct. I am tempted to offer to repeat what I have just said, but I am not sure that the Committee would agree to that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister should proceed, and address his remarks to the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> As I was saying, the agency has always taken a firm stand against FURBS that in reality do not aim to provide genuine pensions. We therefore have renewed confidence in our ability to charge contributions on payments into FURBS under existing legislation, but that does not apply to all FURBS. New clause 2 is needed to close off what we think is a loophole in the present legislation.
<P>
FURBS are a particular type of trust. It is possible to construct trust arrangements so that when the payment is made into the trust, it is used to fund the scheme in general rather than the benefits of particular individuals. There is therefore no distinct payment made to or for the benefit of an individual employee and therefore no earnings for national insurance exist. Without new legislation, that is likely to offer employers an avenue for circumventing the charge. It would be a simple matter for employers to construct a FURBS along those lines.
<P>
New clause 2 provides for regulations that would address that scenario by apportioning the payment into the trust to particular employees. The apportionment will be on the basis of the payments that the employer would have to make to secure the benefits that each employee could receive under the trust. That is in line with the way in which such payments are apportioned for income tax.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) asked about the financial implications. In broad terms, it is estimated that revenue from the action on FURBS will amount to &#163;50 million a year. Revenue from the action on vouchers will be about &#163;10 million a year.
<P>
I am grateful for the Committee's indulgence, but it was important to give the context in which new clause 2 is being introduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> Will the Minister confirm that travel to and from work, which has become a taxable benefit, will be excluded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> We have said that we will be exempting child care vouchers from the proposed action while we are developing--and without wishing to close off--options on a national child care strategy. We have also said publicly that the current list of revenue exemptions will be exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister confirm that travel to work is on the list?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Our intention is to bring the treatment of the current list of revenue exemptions into line with the treatment of vouchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister has not answered the question. Does the current list include travel to work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I will write to the hon. Gentleman about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I was grateful to the Minister for the costing figure that he gave. The sum of &#163;50 million to &#163;60 million rang a bell with regard to some other parts of the Bill. I am sure that we will return to that point later.
<P>
The Minister said that bringing these items into national insurance had a revenue effect because they would become subject to NI. I presume that there is a cost effect; the hon. Gentleman said that he wants to bring low-paid people into future benefit entitlement, which will mean higher spending. Can he say whether the costings are gross or net and what the different components of that estimate are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The figures are gross. FURBS are mechanisms used largely by very high earners and are therefore unlikely to have a significant benefit effect. The figures are gross and the nature of the development of the schemes may make it difficult to estimate the benefit effects for people on low income. There are a number of cases in which vouchers are used to avoid paying national insurance. Our concern is to prevent that practice from spreading, as we fear that it would if it were allowed to continue unchallenged.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I was tempted, Mr. O'Hara, to say ``formally'', because apparently, when that happens, measures go through automatically. [Laughter.] I thought that that might work in this instance.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That procedure was followed simply because we have debated those clauses; that is why they were put formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I will take your advice, Mr. O'Hara, and speak briefly on the new clause, although to some extent we debated it when we discussed previous amendments. As this is the final item of business for the Committee, however, it would be a pity to allow it to go entirely without debate.
<P>
It is an important measure. The Government have always said that part of their purpose in amending the benefits system is to ensure not only that people do not get benefits to which they are not entitled--we are all in favour of eliminating fraud from the system as far as possible--but that people get the benefits to which they are entitled. Take-up should be as high as possible, but the Government have frequently admitted that it is not very good--particularly for certain benefits--and said that they want to see the take-up rate improved.
<P>
In trying to improve the take-up of benefits, nothing is more important than good publicity: telling people what they are able to claim for. That will become even more important if the Bill is enacted because of the changes it will make to the way in which benefits that are not claimed on time are backdated. It is vital that we improve the current system.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Bill has given the impression so far that the Government are trying to restrict claimants' rights by restricting the benefits that they can claim, the amount of backdated benefit to which they are due, and the appeals which they can make when they are turned down for those benefits. The Bill goes in one direction only. New clause 8 is an opportunity, which I hope the Govenment will welcome, to redress the balance and to impose responsibilities on the Government which have to date been imposed only on claimants.
<P>
We want to ensure that the Bill at least appears more evenhanded in terms of who has rights and who has responsibilities--so far, it has insisted on increasing the Government's rights and claimants' responsibilities. The new clause would redress the balance in a way that ought to be wholly acceptable to the Government, given their claims about wanting to improve take-up. I hope that they will want to take the measure on board. It would not impose on them any more than they claim they want to have imposed on them. If they refuse to accept the new clause, their reason will probably be that they think they are going to put it into practice anyway. We know, however, from experience that that has not often happened. That is one of the reasons why take-up is a lot lower than it should be.
<P>
To tempt the Government even more than I have already to accept the new clause, it is worth saying that this is their final chance, at least as far as the Committee is concerned, to redeem themselves in the eyes of their Back Benchers who, as has been proved on several occasions, have been annoyed--not to say infuriated--by certain provisions. I hope that they will seize this chance to redeem themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I want to speak briefly. I suspect that the Government may be tempted to accept new clause 8, or certainly the ethos behind it, for the simple reason that it would ensure that people who may be entitled to a benefit are made aware of the fact.
<P>
I should like to put that in the narrow context of the benefits to claimants through the new deal for lone parents. In many ways the Government have already been acting on the general premise behind the new clause by writing to lone parents to let them know about the new scheme. Lone parents have been called in to meet a personal adviser who can help them claim various benefits--for child care and for housing, for example--to help them get back to work. I imagine that the new clause will be attractive to the Government because of what they are already doing under that scheme.
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall make an annual report to Parliament on any steps taken under subsection (1)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, the Government have anticipated that measure with regard to lone parents. They sought to report to Parliament, in a roundabout way, by producing a report after the scheme had been running for only three months.
<P>
I urge the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), if he presses the new clause, to tighten up subsection (2) because we all know of the Government's reporting mechanisms on, for example, the new deal for lone parents. The Secretary of State put out a glowing press release reporting, in effect, to Parliament on the first three months of the scheme. That ended in tears because it was designed to be a soundbite and slightly glossed over the true situation. In those three months, 8,600 benefit claimants were advised in writing of the benefits they could receive from the scheme. Of those, a little more than 2,000 responded; of whom 1,600 had interviews with personal advisers and decided to take up the offer and seek work. Of those, 433 got back into work. Many of those people would, for a variety of reasons, have got back into work anyway.
<P>
The Secretary of State set out in her report to Parliament via the media a soundbite that was rather disingenuous in its interpretation of the figures. In effect, just under 75 per cent. of the people who had been written to did not respond at all. Of those who did, 433 have received jobs. They represent 5 per cent. of the total, which is a much lower proportion than the Secretary of State has been claiming, not only in press releases and at press conferences, but on the Floor of the House at Question Time. If, as I did, one got up early enough and listened to the ``Today'' programme, one heard the horrendous embarrassment of the Secretary of State coming unstuck when she glossed over the accuracy of the figures that she was using. An interview with Mr. Paxman on ``Newsnight'' that night completed one of the Secretary of State's finest days.
<P>
I urge the hon. Member for Newbury to improve the new clause in the light of experience, and to look closely at the drafting and the small print. Although the Government have, in relation to lone parents, been following the advice contained in the new clause, they have been able to use it in a way that I suspect the hon. Gentleman did not intend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> In Committee last week, I said in error that I doubted the Minister's sincerity when he said that the Government would act to foster take-up of benefit. I withdraw that remark. [Interruption.] I did not hear the heckling. I meant to say that I doubt the Government's sincerity regarding fostering the take-up of benefit, which is why we have tabled the new clause.
<P>
I refer the Minister to a remark that he will remember making on 28 October. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Our intention is that, where the same information is relevant to the administration of more than one function of the Department, the customer should be required to provide the information once--and once only.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 October 1997; c. 46.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am pleased that the Minister still holds that view.
<P>
I mentioned earlier in the proceedings a specific example of a pensioner in a council property who hears of a rent rebate, goes to the council and gives it all the details. All that she receives is her basic pension. The council decides that all her rent should be paid. The information that is required to determine her entitlement to housing benefit and income support is precisely the same--the calculation is the same in principle. If we take the Minister at his word, which I never meant to query, a pensioner claiming income support should not be required to produce information again once he has provided it to one arm of the benefits system. The new clause deals precisely with such instances. Under its provisions the Secretary of State would examine the benefits systems, see where a piece of information was first supplied and say, ``That's enough to calculate entitlement to another benefit.'' The pensioner would, therefore, not be required to send the information in twice.
<P>
When I raised the issue previously in Committee, the Minister said that an automatic payment would take responsibility away from the individual and put it on the benefits sytem. His two views are not consistent.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): What column?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I read it a few moments ago and then closed the book.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that that is still his view? Did he ever express it? Does he realise that the two positions that I have outlined are irreconcilable? Which does he stand by?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Clearly, I would need to ensure that the two statements were made in the same context. It seemed as if one had been plucked from a different debate, which may have had different connotations. In principle, however, I can confirm that the Government's intention is to move towards a system in which people supply information which agencies are legally entitled to share--one of the clauses is about that--and in which we have we have enhanced the technology in particular so that different computers can talk to each other. In the context about which the hon. Gentleman was talking, the onus will be on the impractical way in which people currently have to deal with the different parts of the Benefits Agency or with different agencies. I am absolutely clear that we need to move towards a one-stop process to help people consider the range of benefits to which they may be entitled. That is the Government's vision of a modern, active social security system.
<P>
I have said in other debates that there is a responsibility on the individual to make sure that information is supplied when the agencies request it. Once the individual has supplied that information, however, the aim of a modern social security system must be to make the most efficient and co-ordinated use of it.
<P>
I deliberately gave a long reply to enable the hon. Member for Northavon to find the column for which he was looking.

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I hear clearly what the hon. Gentleman says, but he has put remarks about two amendments in different contexts. I shall, however, consider the statements and if there is any confusion about them, I shall write to him.
<P>
On new clause 8, I have made it clear several times that the Government support the sentiments that hon. Members have expressed. It is, however, not necessary to incorporate it in the Bill. The Government are firmly committed--as I am--to taking action along the lines that have been suggested. Under the previous Administration, 1 million pensioners who did not claim their income support entitlement were ignored. The Government will not allow that to continue.
<P>
All pensioners should share fairly in the increasing prosperity of the nation. We have a manifesto commitment to examine the means of delivering more automatic help to the poorest pensioners. We shall honour that commitment as soon as possible.
<P>
We have already commissioned research to determine why pensioners do not claim the income support payments to which they are entitled. That will then inform the work to get them the help that they need and are entitled to receive. I am sure that the Committee will agree that it is important that resources are targeted efficiently on those most in need. The research will help us ensure that we get help to those who need it most in the way that is best for them.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a particular issue with regard to take-up by the poorest pensioners, and we are taking special measures to get help to that group. However, we are also concerned that all those who are entitled to benefits, not just pensioners, should be encouraged to claim them. We have already taken steps to do just that, as I have made clear many times during the debates on the Bill.
<P>
I have also announced a review of all benefit leaflets. The aim is to streamline them and to ensure that they can be focused more effectively on client groups. Individual benefit leaflets can be confusing to customers who are not sure which rules apply to which benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We have all just heard the Minister's comments about encouraging people to take up the benefits to which they are entitled. No one would disagree with that, but the Minister seems conveniently to forget that clause 70 is detrimental to that aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We have debated clause 70 already, and I am sure that you, Mr. O'Hara, would not consider it in order for me to debate the matter again.
<P>
I wish to turn to the requirement for an annual report to Parliament and to the measures to encourage benefit take-up. The Department of Social Security already publishes an annual assessment of the levels of take-up of benefit. In parallel with that, we have told Parliament of the action that we are taking to help poorer pensioners, and we will continue to keep Parliament informed of our progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I understood the Minister to say that at present the Department publishes an annual report on take up of benefits. Does not that report refer principally to income-related benefits? Will the Minister confirm that there is very little information about the take-up of a swathe of other benefits, especially invalidity benefits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I can confirm that the report to which I referred has to do primarily with income-related benefits. However, the Department is reviewing all the reports and information that are provided. I note the hon. Gentleman's comment about disability benefits, which form part of that general review.
<P>
Legislating for a formal report covering action to increase take up would be unnecessarily bureaucratic. We believe that we should concentrate on getting help to those who need it, rather than writing reports on what we have already said that we would do.
<P>
In the light of those commitments, I hope that the new clause will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response, even though it was somewhat unsatisfactory. We welcome the research into why people do not take up benefits, and the steps that will be taken to increase take up, but the social security budget shows that the Government do not expect much greater take up in the future. If they did, social security spending could be expected to rise much faster than the budget provides for. The Government clearly do not expect whatever steps they take to increase take up to be very effective.
<P>
That is unfortunate; it is also why new clause 8 should be included in the Bill, as it would ensure more effective action. We have drafted the new clause to make the Government more accountable for the steps they are expected to take.
<P>
The Minister mentioned that a report on take up already exists. A careful reading of new clause 8 shows that the report that it would require would not be on take up but on Government steps to improve take up--a rather different matter. I fear that, although the Minister may intend to report on the level of take up, he is not very interested in telling us what steps he will take to improve the rate, perhaps because he or his Government do not expect to take all that many steps. That is what worries us about his apparent unwillingness to accept new clause 8. I do not want to press it to a vote and take up more of the Committee's time, but I am disappointed in the Minister's reply and I hope that he will reconsider before the Bill comes back on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Perhaps I may address the Committee before you report the Committee's proceedings to the House.
<P>
It has been an interesting few weeks for the Committee, which has been ably led by you, Mr. O'Hara, and by your fellow Chairman. Mr. Gale. Clearly your classical scholarship had guided you carefully. You have kept us in good order throughout and with good humour, which is always important for Committees of this nature. I thank you and Mr. Gale for that.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friends--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> For what?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> They have used their knowledge and expertise to guide me throughout the Committee, not always in the full blaze of publicity. Over the weeks, they have given quiet, effective and studious support and I thank them for that. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) for the efficient way in which he organised the Committee's sittings. He also helped to ensure that the words of wisdom from my Back Benchers went through the effective channels, though not always as publicly as they may have wished.
<P>
I give particular thanks to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) for his commitment and hard work during the Bill's passage, particularly with regard to national insurance and the social fund. We heard only this morning evidence of his deep knowledge of national insurance, which is good news for the Government's future. He has done a tremendous job and I thank him for his support.
<P>
To turn to the Opposition, first I thank the hon. Members for Northavon and for Newbury, who are popularly known as the Hale and Pace of the Liberal party because of the effective way in which they tabled their amendments. They made a knowledgeable and constructive contribution to our deliberations and their effective use of the Committee stage is a tribute to them. I know that they are both new members of the social security team--it has been a learning curve for all of us--but they have used the opportunity effectively, even if they have sometimes over-zealously relied on other organisations for their amendments. However, we have all done that, have we not? I am grateful for their contribution.
<P>
As for the official Opposition, the sittings have been an interesting experience. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), leading for the Opposition in Committee for the first time, ably directed his troops--I would not call them Dad's Army, because they are a worthwhile group. I have admired the hon. Gentleman's affability throughout, but his ability to turn instantly to synthetic indignation is a hallmark of his approach to the Committee. We will watch that approach with interest in coming years.
<P>
I congratulate new Opposition Members who are serving on their first Committee. I congratulate the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) on her interesting initial contributions, and I look forward with great interest to her career in social security.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) was a master at being able to pick up three, four or five briefs that had arrived in the post the same morning, pick out a relevant phrase, tie them all together and made a cogent argument against something--although it was not always clear what.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) is I think also sitting on his first Committee. I have sometimes rather cruelly called his contributions flights of fancy. He will have a long career in debating and considering social security legislation for many years to come in opposition. He will value the experience.
<P>
The contributions of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) were genuinely interesting and stimulating. He comes from a very different world from that in which some of us live. He is the original computer virus, but he has brought an interesting and original perspective to the Committee, and presented his case pleasantly. Unfortunately, the Government have not been able to agree with a single word of it. Even so, he has been interesting to listen to.
<P>
Finally, I thank all the officials for their tremendous amount of work. We do not often do that in Committee. Having sat on the Opposition Benches for 10 years, I know the great difference that now exists between opposition and government. I should like to put on record the tremendous amount of work that the officials, Clerks, Hansard writers and attendants have done. Committee work is long and hard, and it has been done in extremely good humour. That is a tribute to you, Mr. O'Hara.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I join the Minister in thanking you and your colleague Mr. Gale, the Committee Clerk and the Hansard reporters for the way in which they have helped to smooth over the proceedings and helped to make the Committee as enjoyable as possible for all of us.
<P>
I also thank the Minister. Usually when there is a change of Government, there is a change of programme. The Opposition are indebted to the Minister--with the exception of clause 70--for putting through the Peter Lilley memorial Bill. That has made the Opposition's job much more difficult, because it is difficult to sit week after week opposing a Bill with which we fundamentally agree. We appreciate the good humour with which the Minister has sought to help us. The Opposition have never seen any draft regulations, although we certainly have received many letters. Notwithstanding that, we are grateful to both Ministers for the way in which they have helped the Committee run its course.
<P>
I especially thank the Government Whip. I know that Government Whips are not glad to speak, and that because of that they are often overlooked. Having been a Government Whip, I can appreciate how left out they often feel. I congratulate the Government Whip, because I was amazed by the comments made by the Minister on the Labour Back Benchers with his new Labour, new gall.
<P>
I congratulate Labour Members on the honour that they had bestowed upon them when selected to sit on the Committee. No doubt, in July, when they received postcards from the Clerks' Office telling them that they had been singled out from obscurity for this honour, they sent press releases to their local papers, telling their constituents that they would study the Social Security Bill line by line upstairs in Committee. That gave Labour Members an alibi when their constituents wondered why they could not see them on the televised reports of Parliament.
<P>
To give him his due, the Government Whip selected a group of highly intelligent new Members. Some of them, like the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond), brought specialist knowledge to the Committee. No doubt the hon. Gentleman has been champing at the bit over the past few weeks, desperate to get his point of view across.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not wish to intrude on private grief, but our proceedings have been so quiet because the hon. Members for Preston (Audrey Wise), for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) have not been members of the Committee. The Minster has received able back up from Labour Members, whose fear of the hon. Member for Doncaster, North is so great that they said nothing even when asked to approve Government amendments and new clauses.
<P>
Opposition Members have enjoyed the quietness on the Government Benches. However, I suspect that Labour Members will have much to say when the Bill returns to the Floor of the House, and I look forward to their contributions.
<P>
I wish to thank Conservative Members for their sterling work in opening up the debate on certian matters in the Bill. As the Minister said so eloquently, all hon. Members, in their different ways, have made important and useful contributions to the debate. We have tried to improve a Bill whose defects, if we had remained in government--and with the aid of the able civil servants who have served the Ministers so well--we would have detected before drafting.
<P>
We look forward to the resumption of debate on the Floor of the House, which I assume will take place before Christmas. I know that the Minister needs warning before he can respond in full to a request, but on two occasions in our proceedings he managed to avoid the thorny question of making available information about clause 68 that both the Opposition Members and the public required. I warn the Minister that we look forward to the resumed debates on that clause on Report. I understand that some Labour Members have even stronger views on that subject than I.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. When the Committee first met in July, I sought your indulgence for all of us who were new hon. Members. I am grateful for the tolerance that both you and Mr. Gale have shown for our lack of familiarity with proceedings.
<P>
I have concluded that everyone should be a member of a Standing Committee once. In that regard, the Liberal Democrats have received a recent boost. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury and I are but two of our party's three-strong social security team. The third is my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), whose summer in post has been a little insecure. We are therefore grateful to the Conservative party for giving him cause for greater confidence over the next four or five years.
<P>
I wish to thank also the staff of the Committee and all those who have been tolerant of amendments submitted at the last minute. As the Minister noted, we have had some help along the way, especially with some of the finer points of benefits appeal regulations. That help came principally from the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux.
<P>
It is appropriate to pay special tribute to the hon. Member for West Dorset. We have tabled many amendments and made many speeches, but the rush to get into Committee often meant that we did not have time to write those speeches beforehand. The thoughtful and comprehensive speeches of the hon. Member for West Dorset always gave us the necessary time.
<P>
Finally, we thank the Minister for his good humour throughout the proceedings and for his many letters. I still have an outstanding query on rates of incapacity benefit, but I am sure that the answer is in the post.
<P>
We also look forward to hearing on Report the contributions of Labour Members, who have to date largely remained silent. It has been a novel experience being the only opposition to a Bill. We look forward to progressing through being the official Opposition, to one day introducing our own Bill, which will deal with one or two aspects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I crave the indulgence of the Committee briefly. On behalf of my co-Chairman, Mr. Gale, and myself I give my sincere thanks to my clerk, Mr. Priestly, for his able support and advice at my elbow, which was an important contribution to the Committee, and to Mr. Healey, who has occasionally stood in. I thank the Hansard writers and the Attendants, and the officials, who can be a nuisance to a Chairman, but I pay tribute to the way in which they have comported themselves during the Committee's proceedings while being very helpful to the Ministers.
<P>
Finally, I say to the members of the Committee that it has been pleasant to chair the Committee. There has been good humour throughout, which is important, especially when the Bill has serious content and on which deeply committed, but differing views are held on both sides of the Committee. All members of the Committee--Front and Back Benchers--have committed themselves with good humour and, in general, with courtesy. When there has been discourtesy, it has been good humoured. I thank them for helping me to keep the Committee in good order. It has not been a turbulent Committee, but that does not mean that the proceedings have not been successful. The Minister mentioned classicism. The classicists have words for every occasion. The immortal Virgil said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Deus nobis haec otia fecit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By that I mean that we have had a relaxed, but none the less serious and thorough scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
