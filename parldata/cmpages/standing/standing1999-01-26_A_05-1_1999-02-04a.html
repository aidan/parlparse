<P><center>
(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</center>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): On a point 
of order, Mr. Benton, I welcome you to the Chair. I have 
three points to make, which I hope to wrap up into a 
job lot.
<P>
It may be appropriate for the Business Sub-Committee to 
discuss whether the Committee will meet during the 
half-term break. I should also like information about the 
budget. I am becoming increasingly concerned that the first 
mile post providing for eight sittings in which to discuss 
120 clauses is then followed by the next mile post, which 
covers 80 clauses in nine sittings. The mile posts seem to 
be disproportionately phased. I cannot complain as I am a 
member of the Business Sub-Committee, but I missed that 
point at the time.
<P>
At our previous sitting, the Minister for Transport in 
London said that she would be amending the culture 
clauses, which she described as skeletal. We welcome 
that, but it may be appropriate if the hon. Lady tables the 
amendments, which I imagine will be substantial, earlier 
rather than later so that we have adequate time to digest 
their contents, instead of having just a few days in which 
to do so.
<P>
Have you received representations, Mr. Benton, from 
Ministers about whether they wish to make a statement 
about the amendments that we tabled during the Committee 
sitting of the whole House about the 5 per cent. threshold to 
the assembly? At the time, we were asked to withdraw 
them, and the Minister undertook to consider the points that 
we had made. In the circumstances, I am sure that you and 
members of the Committee were most surprised to read in 
the national press today that a decision has been made about 
the matter. Not only will the Conservative view be rejected, 
but the discretion to have something less than a 5 per cent. 
threshold seems to have been abandoned. It will be a fixed 
5 per cent. threshold. Would not it be more appropriate if 
the Committee, not the media, was informed of such 
decisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey): Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. 
I, too, wish to preface my remarks by welcoming you to 
the Chair. The number of Chairmen is nearly as great as 
the number of members of the Committee. Nevertheless, 
you are welcome.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister could make a 
statement about the threshold, a point that was raised by 
the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway). My 
clear understanding was that no further announcement 
will be made by the Government until after consultation 
with the Conservative party, the Liberal Democrats and 
other parties that might have an interest in the matter. The 
press does not state that the Government have made a 
decision, but suggests that they have reached a view. The 
Government need to distance themselves from such 
reports and refute them if the Minister's understanding, 
for which we were grateful, is to be honoured.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</b> Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. I add 
my voice to those that have already evinced a welcome to 
you, Mr. Benton. As for the points made by the hon. 
Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North 
and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) about a threshold, the 
Government have made no further statement. They stand 
by the commitment that they gave on the Floor of the 
House. They are not responsible for press speculation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The press was briefed.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South 
says that the press was briefed. I have no knowledge of 
that, and the Government stand by what was said on the 
Floor of the House of Commons on this particularly 
important and sensitive matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about the 
amendments that we intend to table on the cultural aspects 
of the mayor's strategy. Yes; as far as is humanly 
possible, we shall of course attempt to furnish the 
Committee with those amendments in good time, so that 
hon. Members can scrutinise them.
<P>
On the question of the Committee's sittings, as the hon. 
gentleman said, the matter was agreed by the business 
managers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the Minister tor that 
reply. It saved me having to be absolutely negative with 
my first ruling. I was about to say that the matters that 
have been raised are not matters for the Chair. However, 
I hope that they have been clarified to the satisfaction of 
the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have not had a response to my question 
on the budget, and whether or not we shall be sitting while 
the House of Commons is having its half-term break.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We should make a little progress. It 
would be more appropriate if that question were directed 
through the usual channels. I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman accepts that.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>General duties of the Mayor in relation to his strategies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69 
in page 19, leave out lines 2 to 18 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(A)(1) The Mayor may prepare and publish any strategies or 
revisions to existing strategies that he considers necessary to further 
the purpose mentioned in section 25(1) above.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The strategies or any revisions to strategies mentioned in 
subsection (1) above shall only take effect with the majority support 
of the Assembly"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is the first of a series of amendments 
to clause 33 and the part of the Bill that is entitled, "The 
Mayor's strategies"	. It sounds rather like the title of a 
medieval play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): Get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall indeed get on with it, to use the 
phrase of the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)
<P>
It is a probing amendment that is designed to discover 
why the Government have suggested that the mayor 
should be responsible for the strategies listed in clause 
33 transport, the London development agency, 
biodiversity, municipal waste, air quality, ambient noise 
and culture but no other strategy or combination of 
strategies. It seems an almost random selection. The only 
strategy that is obligatory on the mayor or the authority is 
the London development strategy, which is required under 
the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998.
<P>
If the Government wish to impose strategies on the 
mayor, my hon. Friends and I suggest at least four more. 
For example, we could include a strategy for health 
promotion. We shall come, in the next amendment, to a 
strategy for sustainable development. Doubtless there will 
be a strategy for wealth creation the Government so 
clearly now believe in that; it is the new socialist mantra. 
There could also be a strategy for environmental 
improvement.
<P>
The alternative, which we would prefer, is the 
procedure suggested in the amendment. We do not want 
a list of strategies, because the mayor, the assembly and 
the authority should be able to decide for themselves what 
they want to do. This will be a recurring theme during 
our debates. The Bill is either telling the GLA, the mayor 
or the assembly what to do and how to do it; or it is 
saying, "We shall not tell you now; the Secretary of State 
will tell you later."	 Neither is consistent with regional 
government having proper authority, status or 
self-management.
<P>
Even if the Government are now resiled from it being 
regional government and are calling it city-wide 
government, the government of our capital city should, as 
far as possible, be free to decide what it wants to do. We 
may argue that it should be required to do certain things, 
but the list that the mayor has to follow is, to cite a phrase 
used yesterday in the House of Commons by the leader 
of the Conservative party, a list of things into which the 
Government are meddling unnecessarily.
<P>
All these matters could properly be decided upon after 
the election of the mayor and the assembly next May. It 
is inconceivable that the mayor and the assembly will not 
come up with a transport strategy because they will have 
to run transport for London. It is inconceivable that they 
will not work out a strategy for municipal waste, because 
they must run the service, or that they will not have an 
air-quality strategy. Stating that the authority needs a 
culture strategy seems extremely municipalist and 
centralist. Stating that it needs strategies for specific 
matters, such as ambient noise, seems superfluous.
<P>
Our preference is to remove those strategies from the 
Bill, leaving the authority to decide what it wants to do. 
However, there should be an overarching strategy for the 
sustainable development of the city, and we shall argue 
for that in the next debate. If, at first blush, the 
Government resist the amendment it is just conceivable 
that they will retain the strategies amendment No. 314 
would at least put them in the context of sustainable 
development.
<P>
We tabled amendment No. 314 as a fall back in the 
event that we are unable to persuade the Committee of 
the merit of amendment No. 69. We hope that Labour and 
Conservative Members will agree that it is not for the 
House of Commons to tell the mayor what strategies to 
have. The mayor should decide on his or her priorities 
within the overall powers given to the authority.
<P>
During the previous sitting, my hon. Friends questioned 
the Government on whether the authority should have a 
responsibility to engage with the business community, the 
voluntary sector and so on. Ministers were helpful and 
said that they thought that a good idea and that the 
Government would return with some proposals.
<P>
I am sure that the Government understand the 
difference between establishing the mechanisms by which 
the authority will operate and defining its powers and 
what should be done by individual players within it. That 
is why we think it proper that the Bill should not state 
in detail how the authority should consult the business 
community or the voluntary sector but simply establish 
that they should be partners in consultation. We think it 
inappropriate to list six particular strategies and not 
others; it will be perfectly possible for the authority to 
sort out such matters itself.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I support 
what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey has said. It is utter nonsense to think that 
sprinkling such words across the Bill will be beneficial. 
Simply repeatedly using the word "strategy"	 will not 
make anyone's life better. In fact, the obligation that the 
Bill will lay on elected and accountable people to produce 
numerous strategies is danger of being counterproductive. 
Simply including those words will not deliver the 
results arguably, it might to the reverse.
<P>
The second point made by the hon. Member for 
Southwark, North and Bermondsey was that the clause is 
yet another example of the Bill running directly counter 
to what Minister have been at pains to tell the Committee 
from the start. We are led to believe that this will be a 
new thrusting, dynamic, exciting and radical authority, 
elected by and accountable to the people of London. 
However, the people elected will be hidebound by 
Ministers' diktats because of the Bill.
<P>
Candidates for mayor will be unable to produce their 
own ideas, present them to the electorate and ask for their 
support. It is at least possible that candidates might say, 
"We want a strategy-free London."	 People would be 
happier and more relaxed as a result; they might even pay 
fewer taxes, too. That is a perfectly reasonable option to 
offer the people of London, not this prescriptive nonsense 
under which Londoners will be killed with strategies and 
taxes to death. We need a serious, mature, adult 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick (Poplar and Canning Town):</B> 
Would not the hon. Gentleman's strategy-free London 
mean that groups such as cyclists, which traditionally 
have not been consulted on transport strategies, would 
continue to be ignored by whoever ran London, to their 
detriment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Perhaps, but perhaps not, because the hon. 
Gentleman could stand as the "I will listen to everything 
that cyclists say"	 candidate, and I could stand as the "I 
don't give a damn about cyclists"	 candidate, and we could 
see who received more support. I always thought that that 
was the point of elections and democracy. I am happy for 
candidates to stand, to be elected and to be judged on that 
basis, but the Bill as drafted tries to preclude most of that 
process, which I thought was the proper process of 
democracy.
<P>
Let us suppose that we had a written constitution that 
was designed to circumscribe what different political 
parties could offer the electorate and what the 
Government of the day could do, or that said that no 
political party will lay a finger on the House of Lords in 
any circumstances. Labour Members would be the first to 
say that that would be outrageous, and that it would place 
an artificial constraint on 
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): Does the hon. 
Gentleman propose no restriction on the activities of the 
mayor and the assembly in London? Is he suggesting that 
the mayor might raise a standing army, or might make 
provisions for London to have its own nuclear deterrent, 
for example? Will he clarify exactly what he is saying? I 
am not clear whether he believes that any constraints or 
parameters should exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is an interesting proposition; perhaps 
the hon. Gentleman and I could put our heads together to 
see whether we could come up with some such thoughts. 
However, that is not what we are debating. We are not 
debating what the authority will not be able to do. Instead, 
an attempt is being made by Ministers and, presumably, 
the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes), to say in 
advance what elected, accountable people will offer and 
try to deliver to the people of London. That is the 
difference.
<P>
I should be interested in propositions about standing 
armies for London, or even for an independent London 
nuclear deterrent; perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I could 
put our thoughts together on that. However, that is not 
what we are debating. We are debating the apparent 
dichotomy and incompatibility between, on the one hand, 
the avowed aims of Ministers to create a new, accountable 
authority, and, on the other, what their Bill says, which is 
that the authority will not and cannot be accountable 
because its activities will be circumscribed from the start. 
I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendments tabled 
by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): Welcome 
to the Committee, Mr. Benton; I hope that you enjoy it.
<P>
We have important business to do, so I shall not dwell 
too long on the amendment, which, according to the hon. 
Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, is merely 
probing. However, the more we probe, and the deeper we 
delve, the more we recognise the fully prescriptive nature 
of Her Majesty's Government's attitude to the authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> With reference to what the hon. Member 
for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) and the right hon. 
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) have 
said, how is clause 33 prescriptive? How does it 
circumscribe which strategies the Greater London authority 
may pursue? It does not. It is a de minimis provision, not the 
be-all and end-all of which strategies the GLA may provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am sure that you, Mr. Benton, will 
rule me out of order if I refer to that part of the hon. 
Gentleman's intervention that referred to the admirable 
speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Bromley and Chislehurst. Nor will I rise to the Latin tag 
that has been prescribed down the other end of the 
Corridor. I believe that I understand what de minimis 
means. However, we are dealing with a maximist 
approach: a list of specific strategies are required of the 
mayoralty, which is unusual in such legislation. Normally, 
powers are spelt out, as in clause 25, and the Greater 
London authority would be allowed to get on with the job.
<P>
That said, that is not my main anxiety, which is the 
overriding emphasis on the mayor alone. As I said in our 
previous sitting, we must not create an autocratic 
government for London. We want an authority in which 
the mayor works with the assembly and that should be 
spelt out, so that the appropriate strategies can be 
produced.
<P>
Subsection (2) which, with the rest of the clause, the 
Liberal Democrats would omit is fascinating. Our 
legislature has traditionally regarded something that is 
"under review"	 as a formula for inaction, not action. 
When it is kept permanently under review, we know that 
nothing will ever get done. Subsection (2) is therefore 
fundamentally in conflict with subsection (1). It makes no 
reference to the assembly having influence on the 
modification of strategies, but it is surely desirable for the 
assembly to have the power to scrutinise, give advice and 
influence things for the better. As have so many other 
clauses, the clause betrays the Government's outlook 
towards the institution that they are creating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): The hon. Gentleman 
said that the assembly will not be consulted in regard to 
strategies, but clause 34 expressly sets out that it will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> We are not dealing with clause 34 and 
were I to stray into it, Mr. Benton, you would rightly 
bring me rapidly to order.
<P>
I was dealing with the wording that the Liberal 
Democrats wish to replace with their amendment. The 
part of the clause that it would be especially apposite to 
remove is subsection (2), which provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor shall keep each of the strategies mentioned in 
subsection (1) above under review and shall make such revisions of 
those strategies he"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather tan the authority or the mayor upon the advice of 
the assembly "considers necessary."	
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have therefore produced more 
than just a probing amendment. In their digging and 
delving, they have revealed a can of worms.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> That has to be one of the most 
interesting exchanges that we have had in our Committee. 
The amendment's proposal that the mayor should be able 
to prepare any strategy to further the authority's general 
purposes is unnecessary because the mayor will be able 
to do that under clause 27, which makes it clear that the 
mayor will have the power to do anything that he or she 
judges would further the authority's general purpose. I 
do not recall the hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey dealing with the second part of this 
amendment, that such a decision by the mayor would 
require the agreement of the assembly.
<P>
The two parts of the amendment therefore have the 
objective that has been central to most of the amendments 
tabled by the Liberal Democrats: to overturn the proposed 
balance of power within the GLA, as the Government 
have presented that to the people of London through a 
Green Paper and a White Paper. That balance of power 
for the mayor to have the executive power and the 
assembly to have the power of scrutiny has been 
overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of London. The 
amendment, in common with other Liberal Democrat 
amendments, demonstrates their overwhelming lack of 
trust and respect for the people of London. Their 
amendments are designed to undermine the power of the 
electorate and the overwhelming endorsement of the GLA 
by the people of London. The hon. Member for 
Southwark, North and Bermondsey received resounding 
support from the right hon. Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood 
for his amendment. It was not unexpected that the right 
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst would present 
his traditional approach to government inasmuch as he is 
utterly opposed to any form of planning. The fact that he 
used the euphemism "strategy"	 in this context shows his 
antipathy to government, which is on the record.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood clearly agrees 
with the Liberal Democrat perspective on the Bill. He 
spoke of the word "review"	 being exclusively to do with 
achieving nothing I am probably paraphrasing and 
said that it was a recipe for inaction. The purpose of 
reviewing strategies is entirely correct for the new, 
innovative, thrusting, model-form of city-wide 
government that the Bill will introduce to the people of 
London. In effect, the whole purpose of the mayor, the 
assembly and the integrated strategies listed in the Bill are 
to solve London-wide problems. Of course there should 
be a requirement to review the effectiveness of those 
strategies, although it is our perception and belief that 
they will be effective. There is little point in pursuing a 
line of activity when the desired outcome has been 
achieved.



<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey spoke of the freedom of the mayor and the 
assembly to decide from a blank sheet the important 
issues and strategies for this capital city. He was at pains 
to point out that his view of what constitutes this capital 
city could be restricted to about six boroughs, comprising 
inner London. Therefore, if he had his way, not only 
would he dispense with the idea intrinsically behind the 
strategies referred to in the Bill, which are essentially 
about problem solving on a pan-London basis, but he 
would restrict any sort of government to a minority of the 
people of London.
<P>
In the light of the arguments that we have heard, I hope 
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am likely to disappoint the 
Minister. I did not elaborate, but she is right about it being 
the old debate that we have been having in the Committee 
so far. We on the Opposition Benches have taken a view, 
which has widespread support elsewhere I am not 
saying that everybody supports it 
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> How does the hon. Gentleman know?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall say how I know in a minute. We 
believe that the mayor and the assembly should be equal 
partners at worst, but with the assembly dominant at best. 
That has been our view consistently from the first time 
we thought of London government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The 
right view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend says supportively that it 
is the right view. If the mayor is to have strategies or 
revisions to strategies it strikes me as incomprehensible 
why it is necessary to legislate for someone to revise 
strategies it should be done only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with the majority support of the Assembly."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am arguing for that not because I have an obsession that 
the assembly must be engaged in everything, but because 
there is likely to be a better result. We are far more likely 
to get a better result by applying 26 brains rather than 
one. Surely, the pooled wisdom of the 26 people elected 
to govern London will produce a better strategy than one 
which comes from only one person.
<P>
The Minister is right that we have argued in different 
ways in different clauses, but the assembly should have 
to approve anything that the mayor proposes. Even if we 
accept the Government's proposition that it is an authority 
in which the mayor will propose, we believe that the 
assembly should dispose. In this clause, the mayor will 
propose, but there is no guarantee that the assembly the 
wider body will dispose.
<P>
I want to clarify the point, which we may not come 
back to again in the same way. The Minister said that the 
amendment would undermine the role of the authority and 
the voice of the people of London, but it would not. It 
would undermine the huge concentration of power in the 
mayor, not the power of the 25 people 14 of them, in 
the Government's plan who will come from the 14 areas 
of London. It would give more power to the person who 
represents Southwark and Lambeth one of the seats 
across the river and to those who represent the 
combination of boroughs in Surrey, Kent, Hertfordshire 
and Middlesex. The amendment would give them more, 
not less power. We are about sharing, not concentrating 
power.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend has read 
the public service agreement that the Department of the 
Environment, Transport and the Regions reached with the 
Treasury before Christmas. It has been published, but the 
House has not yet debated it. In the chapter on the DETR, 
one of the objectives was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to promote a system of elected government in England which 
responds to the needs of local communities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will my hon. Friend consider the DETR's stated objective 
to ascertain whether our amendment or the Bill reflects 
it most?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Being an entirely honest politician, I will 
concede to my hon. Friend that I have not read that 
document. Indeed, until he brought it to my attention, I 
was not aware of the clause that he quoted. I am ever 
being educated by my hon. Friend, and he has found a 
helpful supporting argument, which appears to be 
consistent.
<P>
I shall comment on two other issues that the Minister 
raised. One relates to the debate that she sought to fire up 
about my view of London. We are legislating for the 
whole of Greater London. I took a subjective view of what 
constituted the real, core London. She and her hon. Friend 
the Minister for London and Construction are Members 
of Parliament for the core London. She should talk to the 
constituents of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood 
or to those of the right hon. Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst. When I was little, I stayed with my 
half-brothers in the constituency of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Kingston and Surbiton. We used to go "up to 
London"	 from Kingston and New Malden; my 
half-brothers did not think of themselves as living in 
London. Whey my brothers played for Malden Wanderers 
cricket club, they did not think of it as a London cricket 
club, but very much as a Surrey cricket club. There is not 
a common feeling about what London is; it varies.
<P>
I am grateful for the support of the right hon. Member 
for Bromley and Chislehurst, who is behind me and to 
my right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): He is to 
everybody's right
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No, he is certainly not to the right of 
some members of the Committee. Some people in the 
party of the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) 
are probably considerably to the right of the right hon. 
Gentleman and are certainly to the right of me.
<P>
We are arguing our case because clause 25, as was said, 
sets out the authority's purpose. Clause 25 and subsequent 
clauses set out the authority's power. From clause 67 
onwards, we will debate the individual powers at great 
length in terms of the number of clauses. Those powers 
are set out. There is a whole part clauses and clauses 
on finance, there is one on transport, and there is a short 
part on the London development agency. Thee are parts 
on the Metropolitan police, fire and emergency planning, 
planning, environmental functions and culture, media 
and sport.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> There are strategies
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister says that there are no 
strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There are strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg the Minister's pardon; he said that 
there are strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman commented 
specifically on the passages in the Bill, but did not make 
the connection between the strategies in clause 33 and 
subsequent clauses that relate to the authority's functions. 
The purpose of the strategies, which the hon. Gentleman 
clearly has not grasped, is that they relate to the 
authority's specific functions, as spelt out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course I understand that connection, 
it is obvious that it is there. Clause 33 refers to "the 
transport strategy"	 and to section 123. If we look ahead 
to clause 123, we see that it makes provisions. I am 
arguing that we do not need a specific measure that limits 
the mayor's strategies 
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> It does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Bill limits them in that it qualifies 
them in subsection (3), to which we shall come in a 
minute. The strategies are qualified and are the only ones 
to which subsection (3) is attached. They are plucked out 
of the Bill. The mayor may want to adopt other strategies, 
which do not contain those considerations. I do not know 
why the Government should view the strategies as chosen 
solely to comply with specific qualifications as set out in 
subsection (3), to which we shall come.
<P>
I have a final point, which the hon. Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood made as well as I did. It is 
extraordinary to legislate for somebody to keep under 
review strategies and to revise them as he or she considers 
necessary. I suggest to Ministers that it is civil service 
gone mad. Do we live in a nursery age, in which central 
Government have to tell what they now call local or 
city-wide government: "Not only must you have these 
strategies; not only must you have these strategies for 
these purposes; not only must you have these strategies 
for these purposes with these conditions, but you must 
revise them, and if you revise them you must alter them"? 
That is absolutely and honestly centralist, autocratic and 
nanny-state stuff.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Rubbish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Harrow, East 
(Mr. McNulty) has been in the House of Commons for 
a very short time. I have been here for 16 years, and 
I have never seen in any legislation a provision as 
centralist and as imposing as clause 33(2). In terms of 
central Government setting up an authority and telling 
it what to do, this provision takes the biscuit. If the 
hon. Gentleman, who represents half of Harrow 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> The better half.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have no idea whether it is the better or 
worse half.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Harrow, East believed that 
legislation should contain such stuff, he would be 
legislating for everything until the cows came home. Let 
people who govern capital cities and local councils do 
their own thing. Give them the power and let them get on 
with it, and if the electorate do not like them, let the 
electorate throw them out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes</b> rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I give way to the centralist par 
excellence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Can I take it that the epitaph of the Liberal 
Democrats will be, "Let everybody do their own thing"?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is not a bad epitaph. We believe that 
as long as people do not harm others in society they 
should be allowed to do their own thing. We believe that 
London government should be able to do its own thing. 
We also believe that the Committee should take 
opportunities to change the Bill so as to take away its 
reigns, shackles, restraints, restrictions and impositions. If 
the hon. Member for Ilford, South believes in the opposite 
in politics, that explains yet again why he is on the 
Government Benches and we are on the Opposition 
Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I shall comment only briefly, to 
reiterate comments that I have already made. Their 
importance was highlighted by the reaction of the 
Minister for Transport in London. All too often when she 
seeks to clarify she obfuscates. On this occasion, however, 
she provided a clear picture of the attitude of Her 
Majesty's Government. They believe that a lord high 
munificence should be established, a municipal potentate 
so omniscient and so capable that he or she alone will 
have total power to pursue whatever policy he or she 
thinks fit. Yet the Bill contains an extraordinary 
contradiction. That person can do as he or she thinks fit 
only so far as it is prescribed in law down to the tiniest 
dot, comma or semi-colon of a strategic policy that will 
be laid down and then reviewed and revised in law.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats' formulation, as proposed in the 
amendment, is much more sensible. We should, in all 
conscience, trust the authority with what the electors 
believe it to be capable of doing getting on and 
governing London in accordance with the objectives set 
out in clause 25 and subsequent clauses, which provide 
the necessary powers.
<P>
The qualification that the Liberal Democrats have set 
out in paragraph (2) of the amendment is important. If 
any strategy is to work, it must have the clear majority 
support of the assembly. The assembly men will be in 
touch with their constituents at least, 11 of them will be; 
the 14 others will have no such inhibitions on their 
freedom of action. However, as a body they will be 
responsible to their electors one hopes on a regular 
basis or to their party, in the case of the list members. 
They will be subject to influence, to pressure and to 
advice, which ought to be translated by the mayor into 
strategies that have the majority approval of the electors 
and, of course, of the assembly, as the amendment states. 
Otherwise, the Bill will be a recipe for stasis, complete 
deadlock, conflict and an inability to keep the 
strategies on the road. It may be a recipe for constant 
review, but it is not a recipe for getting things done or 
implementing the strategies set out in the clause.
<P>
As I said, the amendment began as a probing 
amendment, but, my goodness, it has revealed some 
sinister centralist tendencies on the Government's part 
which ought to be condemned, and which the electorate 
ought to understand before they cast their votes.

<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. 
Member for Ruislip-Northwood for complimenting me on 
having clarified my argument for him; I regret that I 
cannot return that compliment. I found it absolutely 
impossible to follow his argument about what constitutes 
strategies, who should have the power to implement them 
and who should decide whether they have worked or not, 
even before they have been implemented.
<P>
I shall refer briefly to the remarks of the hon. Member 
for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who appears to 
regard quantity as the decider. We have always argued 
that we are setting up a GLA of great quality. the hon. 
Gentleman's argument is that in any decision-making 
process, 26 brains are better than one. As my hon. Friend 
the Minister for London and Construction said from a 
sedentary position, not if the one is Einstein.
<P>
I find it somewhat bemusing that the hon. Gentleman 
is taking such pains to examine the powers that need to 
revert to the GLA for the mayor to be able to introduce the 
relevant strategies, which will be part of the pan-London 
delivery of all the improvements inherent in the Bill. If I 
understood him correctly, his idea of ideal government for 
London is for mayoral candidates and assembly 
candidates to campaign with no powers. I believe that he 
would still like a very restricted London real London, as 
he calls it. It would not be necessary for candidates to 
detail what they envisioned for London. There would be 
no clear balance of powers but why would that be 
needed, because candidates would not be asked to define 
in detail what they wanted to achieve?
<P>
I find it absolutely bewildering that a member of the 
Liberal Democratic party, which has argued on the Floor 
of the House and outside that there should be continuous 
review, culminating in defined targets, of virtually every 
aspect of national Government, should now turn his back 
on a policy review that the GLA is to implement 
specifically to produce for the electorate clear unarguable 
evidence of whether those policies are succeeding or 
failing.
<P>
I shall finish my contribution on that note. I urge the 
hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to 
withdraw the amendment. If he insists on pressing it to a 
Division, I urge that it be voted down.

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall sum up in one sentence. 
I hope that, whatever strategies the London government 
adopts, it will review them, set targets and all the rest of 
it, but we do not think that those should be in the Bill 
they should be left for the authority to decide.

inform the strategies set out in subsection (3) below.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(3) Those strategies are '.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Is this a filibuster?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No, it is just a series of amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 314 is about sustainability. Whether 
or not hon. Members, think it was necessary to set out in 
clause 1 strategies that are, as the Minister rightly said, to 
be found elsewhere in the Bill, the amendment would add 
something that is not found anywhere else in the Bill: a 
sustainability strategy. That is necessary because 
everything should work under the umbrella aim of 
producing a sustainable capital city. The amendment 
would include in the Bill the one thing a requirement 
for sustainability about which the Minister cannot say, 
"It's already in the Bill; look at clause 123 or 243."	
<P>
Sustainability is a logical idea that is widely supported 
outside the House. It is logical because it is the only way 
that some of us can see of integrating and co-ordinating 
all the strategies in the context of an environmentally 
sustainable city. Furthermore, it is supported strongly by 
what is now called the sustainable GLA coalition, which 
comprises Friends of the Earth in London, the Royal 
Society for the Protection of Birds, the Council for the 
Protection of Rural England [Interruption.] Obviously 
all these organisations are supported by the right hon. 
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. I shall pass on his 
grunts to the organisations concerned, and I am sure that 
they will be even more enamoured of him than they might 
have been before. The coalition also includes the London 
Wildlife Trust, English Nature and the Environment 
Agency.
<P>
Those bodies believe that sustainability is important 
and that, as the Minister said in the last debate, there 
ought to be targets and achievable goals and that we ought 
to know how to measure them. They believe that the issue 
should be seen in the context of delivering the Rio Agenda 
21. The goal is to make London a more, not less, pleasant 
place to live with every year that passes. We want a less 
polluted, less congested city which is capable of 
preserving and enhancing the lives of all its inhabitants.
<P>
People's views will differ on whether the Government 
were right to replicate strategies covered in clause 1. 
Nevertheless, they will find it appropriate that those 
strategies, however many may be involved, should be 
incorporated under the umbrella of one sustainability 
strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I support the Liberals' 
amendment, as do all Conservative Members, almost to a 
man [Interruption.] I repeat: almost to a man. If 
strategies are to be included in the Bill we have already 
had that debate it is right that one of those should be the 
sustainable development strategy. I dislike some of the 
amendment's terminology, but support its sentiments 
wholeheartedly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> As usual, I support my hon. Friend the 
Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall), who is surely the 
best ornithologist in the Committee and a most effective 
local representative. As such, he understands the strength 
of feeling that exists in the borough of Hillingdon in 
favour of the preservation of the environment in the 
broader sense. I support the amendment, which, in tandem 
with the London biodiversity action plan, will ensure that 
there is a double check on the mayor's commitment to the 
preservation of the environment and will guarantee that 
the issue is given the priority that it deserves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment was suggested to 
members of the Committee by the Royal Society for the 
Protection of Birds notwithstanding the fact that the 
previous head of the RSPB spent most of the duration of 
the previous Parliament trying to defeat the Conservative 
Government. I hope that the Minister can assure the 
Committee of her support for sustainable development, 
even if she is unable to accept this worthy amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I was not aware that the previous 
head of the RSPB had spent a great deal of time 
attempting to destroy the previous Conservative 
Government. That is another plus on behalf of an already 
admirable organisation.
<P>
I pay due tribute to the legal training of the hon. Member 
for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. It is astounding and 
admirable that he was able to spend the first part of this 
afternoon's sitting arguing against the inclusion of 
strategies in the Bill and then, as soon as the Committee had 
successfully negated that proposal, begin to argue for the 
absolute necessity for a strategy's inclusion.
<P>
His concern that the Bill makes no provision for 
sustainable development is not borne out by the facts. 
Clause 25(3)(b) refers to the desirability of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"promoting sustainable development in Greater London".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Within the space of 30 seconds, the hon. Gentleman 
argued first that it would be appalling to include a strategy 
in the Bill and then that it is overwhelmingly important 
that the Bill should include it. That is an illogical position. 
He is arguing for an overarching strategy while at the 
same time saying that there should be no strategies 
underneath the arch, which is somewhat bemusing. We 
have already made it clear that it is within the mayor's 
power to devise any strategies that he or she believes will 
help to deliver the general purposes of the Bill. The mayor 
and the assembly will not be assisted in delivering 
strategies for pan-London improvements which is what 
we are discussing if the mayor is tied to a hierarchical 
approach to those strategies.
<P>
Far from increasing the powers of the mayor or the 
democratic remit, the proposal of the hon. Member for 
Southwark, North and Bermondsey would limit the 
powers of the mayor something he argues, erroneously, 
that the Government intend to do under the Bill. For the 
mayor to observe an hierarchical structure to those 
strategies would take away the freedom of the mayor and 
the assembly to act and react to what they discover as 
their strategies are put into place, and the ability of the 
people of London to express directly to the mayor and 
the assembly areas in which they wish more or possibly 
less to be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I understand, for once, the logic of the 
hon. Lady's argument; but does it not also apply in 
reverse? Government Members have argued forcefully for 
these wonderful strategies. They are now saying that their 
own proposed strategies are fine, but no more are needed. 
The accusation of lack of logic that has been levelled at 
Opposition Members can also be levelled at the Minister.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Not on the basis of the argument that the 
hon. Member for Uxbridge has just put forward. As I 
pointed out, the phrase central to the delivery of these 
strategies which will be within the power of the mayor 
and the assembly is contained in clause 25(3)(b), which 
refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"promoting sustainable development in Greater London".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is central to and essential for the strategies set out in 
the Bill. It is central to and essential for all the 
decision-making processes of the mayor and the assembly 
in delivering those strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Following the argument so succinctly 
put by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, 
I wonder whether a merit of graciously accepting this 
entirely worthy amendment is that the matter could 
thereafter be kept permanently under review by statue.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I thought that I had already managed to 
establish with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood 
that his interpretation of the word "review"	 within the 
context of the Bill is markedly different from mine. For 
the hon. Gentleman, the word "review"	 means doing 
absolutely nothing. For me, the word is an additional spur 
to even greater development of pan-London strategies to 
improve not only the economy of London, but the health 
and social quality of life.
<P>
In the light of the arguments that I have put forward, 
I trust that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am sad that the Minister did not 
give a more positive response. I shall have one more go 
at persuading her, and even if she does not accept the 
amendment today, I am still hopeful that the logic of the 
case, if not my argument, will prevail.
<P>
Clause 33 takes from the rest of the Bill the strategies 
covered elsewhere and lists them unnecessarily, as we 
have argued. It then gives power to the mayor to review 
and revise them unnecessarily, as we have argued. It 
then sets out what the mayor must take into account when 
considering them. We think that sensible, subject to 
qualification, but it did not need repeating.
<P>
The list of strategies was originally spelt out on page 
22 of the White Paper. It includes spatial development, 
which nearly got left out, but which is about to be 
reintroduced,. The White Paper says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As explained in chapter 5, the Mayor will be required to produce 
separate strategies for"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
followed by a list. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is obviously important that these different documents are 
mutually consistent. To that end, the Mayor may wish to consider a 
single over-arching strategy statement which sets clearly and 
succinctly the Mayor's key economic, environmental and social 
objectives."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let me say to the hon. Lady that there has been no 
inconsistency. I explained very carefully int he earlier 
debate the sequence of the two amendments. I am grateful 
for the support of Conservative Members on the 
Committee. However many strategies end up in the Bill 
the Government have put in six already, but this would 
apply even if there were only two there should be some 
way of pulling them together.



<P>
In this day and age, the best way to define how the 
strategies can be pulled together is to ensure that they all 
fit under what is called a sustainable context for 
sustainable development. We may disagree about how 
that is defined, but in the White Paper the Government 
went half way towards accepting that view. Interestingly, 
it was at that point that the Government said that the 
mayor could do this or that if he wanted. We were not 
arguing that there should be any strategies at all, but that 
the position should be left open. None the less, accepting 
the Government's premise that there will be strategies in 
the Bill, we ask that the mayor put them in an 
over-arching structure.
<P>
I am happy not to press the amendment at the moment 
if the Minister is at least willing to tell the Committee that 
she will take the proposition away and discuss it with 
colleagues, especially those at the Department of the 
Environment, Transport and the Regions. There is clearly 
near unanimous support for it from Opposition members 
on the Committee, and I believe that there would be 
strong support from Labour Members. I would be grateful 
for a suggestion, at least, that the Government will 
consider the matter.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone </B>(Brent, East): I join those who 
have welcomed you to the Committee, Mr. Benton. You 
will find, as we all have, that one of the great pleasures 
of the Committee is that it will give you the chance to 
form an encyclopedic knowledge of the wit and wisdom 
of the hon. member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey. I have broad sympathy with almost 
everything that he has said so far in Committee, but my 
sympathy is in inverse proportion to the length of time he 
takes to say it. I have almost felt at times that there is a 
filibuster at work.
<P>
The point that I am about to make could apply to our 
previous debates and to many more to come concerning 
the exact powers and their degree, and the nature of the 
relationship that the Government need with the new 
authority.
<P>
We need to look at what we are doing in the context of 
the past. For 150 years of central Government, there has 
been a degree of suspicion about the nature of local 
government it might be a threat, or too radical. That fear 
has come up in dozens of forms. Therefore, when I looked 
at the White Paper, I made a lot of recommendations. To 
my amazement, two seem to have resulted in changes in 
the Government's strategy; the other 200 have not yet 
found that favour.
<P>
Although I do not totally agree with the package, it 
seems a reasonable one for a new administration to get to 
work on during its first term or two. It would be 
wonderful to add everything in. I think that the GLA 
should be London's waste disposal authority, its health 
authority, its higher education authority; the list could go 
on almost ad nauseam. However, to begin to tackle 
problems of transport, urban decay and the terrible blight 
in parts of our city will be more than enough to keep 
an mayor and assembly incredibly busy for the first term 
or two.
<P>
It reminds me very much of when the old Greater 
London council was set up. After five years, the then 
Government gave it London Transport to get on with. The 
package is not a fixed one for all time: it will be added to 
and amended by future Administrations. Minister are not 
keen to emphasise it, but I think that it is the first step 
towards regional government for England. Therefore, as 
regional government spreads throughout the rest of the 
country, there will be changes that will have an impact on 
the already established Greater London authority.
<P>
I read the package without the suspicion expressed by 
the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, 
but with knowledge of the reality, the history, and the 
attitude of central Government towards anything new. 
Having done so, I think that it is just about the best 
package that could be put together at the moment within 
the Government's financial constraints. Therefore, if the 
hon. Government is hoping at some time to provoke me 
to break ranks on this or any other issue if he is looking 
for allies among Labour Members I should say that I do 
not distrust the Government on it. I speak as one who 
never gives the Government the benefit of any doubt, even 
if they are my own Government I am inherently unlikely 
to do so.
<P>
The overall package hangs together. It will not help to 
add a lot of bits and pieces and try to define them too 
closely, or to worry too much, as in the previous debate, 
about what the Government may do or whether they may 
intervene. Once the mayor and the assembly are 
established, the Government will give them some freedom 
to act quickly and without interference. We do not need 
endless debates of this nature because the package hangs 
together reasonably well and provides more than enough 
work for the first two terms of the new authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and 
Westminster): I join others in welcoming you to the Chair, 
Mr. Benton. I shall be brief. I declare an interest, which I 
think I share with the hon. Member for Southwark, North 
and Bermondsey. I am vice-president of the London 
Wildlife Trust. Therefore I support the general cause that 
we are discussing.
<P>
I enjoyed a reputation for patience while I was in 
Northern Ireland. I wish to tell a short moral tale that 
involves a Polish bishop arriving in a parish in his diocese 
and inquiring of the cure why he had not been greeted by 
the sound of bells. The cure said, "There are, my Lord, 
three reasons, the first is that there are no bells."	 "Pray go 
no further,"	 said the bishop. I have a feeling that the 
bishop was a Tory and that the cure was a Liberal 
Democrat. The initial answer that the Minister for 
Transport in London gave that the matter is covered in 
clause 25(3)(b) really provided game, set and match to 
the discussion. If we are to complete consideration of the 
Bill, we ought to get on with it.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I do not believe that one could 
top the contribution made by the right hon. Member for 
Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). He put 
his finger on the argument and debunked the proposals 
put forward by the hon. Member for Southwark, North 
and Bermondsey.
<P>
The powers are in the Bill, and sustainable development 
will be at the centre of the approach of the mayor and the 
assembly to implementing the strategies. Indeed, how can 
sustainable development be delivered without the kind of 
strategies listed in the Bill? The powers are there should 
the mayor and the assembly wish to introduce another 
strategy.
<P>
I repeat my view that the amendment moved by the 
hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bemondsey, is 
unnecessary and I ask him to withdraw it. If he does not, 
and pushes it to a vote although our experience is that 
that is a threat that he does not always deliver I will ask 
the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to respond to the Minister 
because, clearly, she is not persuaded. In time, the 
lobbying powers of the London Wildlife Trust and other 
groups will none the less persuade her. On that basis, we 
shall wait and see how the Bill looks at the end of the 
Committee stage. We will consider the strategies in it and 
whether further amendment is necessary. I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in 
page 19, line 6 at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(bb) the spatial development strategy prepared and published 
under Part VIII below,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
Government amendments Nos. 212 and 213.
<P>
No. 164, in page 19, line 21, after `shall', insert 
`wherever practicable'.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 216 to 224.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I also would like to take the 
opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. 
You are the fourth Chairman to look after our proceedings 
in only five sittings. That implies either that we have such 
a terrible reputation that your fellow Chairman could not 
stomach the prospect of seeing us again perhaps we will 
therefore see a great deal more of you or, that the 
proceedings are such a delight that four Chairmen want 
to enjoy them. Whatever the reason, we welcome you 
very much.
<P>
The Government amendments relate to the spatial 
development strategy that is already set out from clause 
226 onwards. However, although the spatial development 
strategy is covered in the Bill, it is right that the strategy 
should be listed along with the other fundamental 
strategies that are defined in clause 33.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): I wish to 
save time by asking now whether the Bill is the first to 
mention the phrase "spatial development". If it is, will the 
definition of that phrase be given?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is knowledgeable 
in planning matters and asks a pertinent question. The 
Bill is the first to mention a spatial development strategy. 
Spatial development is a development concept that is 
becoming increasingly current in the planning world. A 
wider approach than the more limited, traditional land use 
planning framework is envisaged by it. The phrase is 
familiar to all those involved in the planning process and 
it requires no special definition in the Bill. When we come 
to the relevant passages clause 226 onwards we will 
be able to discuss in detail the full implications of a spatial 
development strategy for Greater London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am sorry to intervene, but I am no 
wiser about the meaning of the term. The Minister said 
that the term was wider in its application than normal 
development planning terms, but in what way? Does it 
mean wider powers for those who wield them? Will the 
Minister explain what he means by the phrase? I do not 
think that any one understands it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman 
does not have the expertise in planning matters of the hon. 
Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman). I made it 
clear that we would have the opportunity to discuss the 
topic in considerable detail when we came to the part of 
the Bill that relates to planning matters. We are discussing 
a technical amendment that is intended to ensure that the 
spatial development strategy is treated on a par with the 
mayor's other principal strategies. That, not a wish to 
discuss the ramifications of a spatial development 
strategy, is the purpose of introducing the reference now.
<P>
For the benefit of the hon. Gentleman and to whet his 
appetite, I shall briefly explain the position now. Whereas 
land use planning has traditionally focused mainly on the 
allocation of uses for parcels of land, a spatial 
development strategy takes account of wider 
considerations, such as transport and linkages between 
different uses, as appropriate to the planning framework. 
We shall have an opportunity to discuss the subject in 
much greater detail later. I hope that we can make some 
progress now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Is spatial development the only 
strategy mentioned elsewhere in the Bill that was not in 
the list in clause 33 (1)? If so, was it left out accidentally 
and then put in because someone spotted it? Will the 
Minister want to include other strategies in clause 33?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Had the hon. Gentleman restraint his 
impatience, he would have received a full explanation. 
We did not include the spatial development strategy 
among the strategies listed in the clause because there is 
detailed provision relating to it in clause 226 and 
thereafter.
<P>
The strategy must conform to the patterns that exist for 
planning in all other regions and areas of the country. It 
would be inappropriate to have a planning framework in 
Greater London separate from the one that exists in other 
parts of England. Therefore, provision was put into later 
clauses to set out the spatial development strategy and 
how it operates in terms that exactly mirror the planning 
framework that applies to all other relevant local 
authorities.
<P>
That was why the spatial development strategy was not 
mentioned in the clause. On reflection, however. we 
concluded that it should be listed here so that there could 
be no possibility of any subsequent interpretation. As the 
hon. Gentleman knows, it is not for us but for the courts 
to interpret legislation in future. It would be wrong for 
any inference to be drawn from the omission of spatial 
development from the list of key strategies. In answer to 
the other question that the hon. Gentleman asked, I should 
point out that those are all the strategies that are 
specifically mentioned in subsequent clauses.
<P>
I make it clear, as my hon. Friend the Minister for 
Transport in London has done, that that will not prevent 
the mayor from introducing other strategies. The 
strategies listed in the clause are the ones for which 
statutory provision is made in the legislation. They are all 
listed and we felt it right that the spatial development 
strategy should be listed too, to ensure that no inference 
could be drawn from its omission from the list and that all 
the principles that will apply, such as consistency between 
strategies, also clearly apply to the spatial development 
strategy. It is a common sense amendment and would 
achieve those ends. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 164 tabled by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Croydon, South, is unnecessary. By stating 
that the mayor should "have regard"	 to matters listed 
therein, clause 33(3) is already flexible in its effect. If, on 
first consideration, a specific condition listed in the clause 
was not relevant to a particular strategy, no further 
consideration would be needed. I would ask my hon. 
Friend to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I intended amendment No. 164, a rather 
lonely one among 11 Government amendments, to be 
debated with amendments Nos. 165 and 166, but such are 
the vagaries of selection that it has become detached. For 
the convenience of the Committee I would seek leave to 
withdraw it but perhaps will allude to it in debates on the 
other two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am sorry to say that the Government 
compounded their own inconsistency over the previous 
amendment. It is all right to spell out a strategy whose 
periodicity will be dictated by the Secretary of State. 
Sustainable development is a bad thing: we cannot spell 
that out as a strategy for promulgation under the Bill. 
Spatial development is fine. It has to be plucked from the 
initial objectives and put into clause 33. Either all the 
objectives that merit a strategy ought to be in the clause 
in full for example, the strategy for sustainable 
development, which we have just negatived, would please 
conservationists, environmentalists and so on 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
Gentleman, but the level of background noise is a little 
too high, which is unfair on an hon. Member when he is 
speaking. I ask that the background music be kept down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The fault, I am sure, Mr. Benton, is 
mine. I was getting more excited than this little 
Government amendment merits.
<P>
There is an immediately apparent logical inconsistency 
in the Government's attitude. But it is important inasmuch 
as spatial development we are not, for now, permitted a 
full definition of what it entails has an immense 
connotation for our electors. I presume that it means 
achieving an appropriate ecological and environmental 
balance between economic development and associated 
transport projects, and so on for example, the utilisation 
of land resources, to which the Minister referred in 
planning terms and preserving good air quality, a clean 
environment and biodiversity. That is greatly significant.
<P>
We debated the green belt on the Floor of the House. 
A great many Londoners will no doubt be particularly 
keen to know how this proposed legislation will affect the 
preservation of the green belt around London. I declare 
an interest, as the president unpaid of the London
Greenbelt Council. Inasmuch as the authority will have 
the responsibility of producing a strategy for spatial 
development, I presume that, prima facie if we are still 
allowed to use Latin words 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Pro tem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> So long as we have legal Gentlemen 
in the other place. When they are all elected, perhaps that 
will be different.
<P>
Will the green belt be affected? If so, how? Why has a 
strategy relating to spatial development been included in 
the Bill?
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> The Minister was generous to 
say that I knew about planning. My knowledge is rather 
rusty. I no longer have the ambition that I had originally 
when I came to this House of becoming Britain's first 
minister of town, country and family planning.
<P>
I do not wish to be pedantic, but all previous legislation 
on spatial development, is known as town and country 
planning. It is therefore confusing to use a new phrase to 
describe elements of town and country planning. Town 
and country planning is about not just the position and 
size of buildings, but also the space between them. I will 
not press for the phrase "spatial development"	 to be 
altered, but a return to the traditional phrase would 
minimise confusion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We are grateful to the hon. 
Member for Chipping Barnet for telling us about his 
historic interest in indoor and outdoor activity. He 
revealed something new about his all-encompassing 
aspirations, and he is knowledgeable about planning.
<P>
It is odd that the Bill does not contain a definition of 
spatial development. We are trying to produce legislation 
that people understand. The phrase "spatial development"	 
is unlikely to trip off the tongue, either in the Old Kent 
road which is in my constituency or in the Minister's 
constituency of Greenwich and Woolwich. We would do 
better to return to the old phrase.
<P>
The Bill includes a requirement for a list of consistent 
strategies, along with reasons for their inclusion. It is 
completely illogical not to include spatial development in 
such a requirement. Planning policy should be integrated 
with the other policies, so we support the amendment. We 
hope that its proposals will be included in the overarching 
sustainability amendment that the Government have yet 
to accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall respond briefly to the two key 
points made in interventions.
<P>
We will have a good opportunity to discuss fully the 
implications and ramifications of spatial development 
when we come to debate clause 226.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, 
I repeat the point made earlier by my hon. Friend the 
Minister for Transport in London. We have set a 
framework in which sustainable development objectives 
must be taken into account in all aspects of the authority's 
work. Provision for that is made in clause 25(3)(b), as the 
right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said in an earlier debate. Such provision must be taken into account in discussions on the preparation of spatial 
development strategy.
<P>
It is false to suggest that we are giving preference to 
certain considerations at the expense of sustainable 
development. Sustainable development is central to the 
work of the Greater London authority, and the principle 
of sustainability will be taken into account in the framing 
of all the strategies. I therefore urge hon. Members to 
support this amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 163, in 
page 19, line 15, after `below', insert

performance indicators and targets by reference to which it is

No. 178, in clause 38, page 21, line 19, after `1998', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including, with regard to each strategy, a report on the outcomes of 
the performance indicators and targets described in section 33(1).'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We have had a long debate about 
strategies and their relevance to the new authority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask for silence when an hon. 
Member is speaking. That is most important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We have had a lengthy debate about 
strategies but no debate about their effectiveness. The 
amendment would oblige the mayor to include in the 
strategy specified performance indicators and targets, by 
reference to which the success of each strategy can be 
measured.
<P>
The mayor must produce a variety of strategies, but 
there is no way of measuring whether they work. The 
amendment would require the mayor to include within 
those strategies some measurable targets, which can be of 
his or her choosing. We are not being prescriptive, but we 
need to know whether a particular strategy is producing a 
positive outcome and to be able to measure its real effect. 
It is easy to have a strategy; it is words on a piece of 
paper. It is much more difficult to achieve results. 
I suspect that the Government will be sympathetic to the 
amendment because, as we well know, their hideously 
embarrassing Government annual report outlined the 
departmental targets set in the comprehensive spending 
review. There are too, the five key pledges made during 
the general election against which the Government said 
that they wished to be assessed, measured and judged. We 
therefore believe that they will support the principle of 
the amendment. I look forward to having the support of 
Labour Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am surprised that there is such 
diffidence in the Committee, as this is one of the more 
important Opposition amendments. Electors will wish to 
see the authority performing well. They will want value 
for money. They will want clear, properly set out criteria, 
which they can read and against which they can judge 
how well or how poorly the authority is functioning, 
especially the mayor, who has executive responsibility. 
Prescriptive criteria of the kind proposed, important as 
they are, will probably not be as important as the more 
subjective and, perhaps, more qualitatively demanding 
assessment that the electorate as a whole will make.
<P>
What is crucial is the interpretation that the assembly 
will put on the performance of the mayoralty. That 
assessment of the assembly, qualified as it will be by the 
input of the electorate, needs to be measured against 
specific criteria set out at the start of each term of office.
<P>
In every sense these are important amendments and I 
am sorry that the Government did not include such 
phraseology in the Bill. The Government are very ready 
to give powers to the mayoralty, but reluctant to give any 
significance, even influence, to the assembly. There is no 
evidence that they want the mayoralty's performance to 
be measured. That is a deficiency on the part of the 
Government, which the electors of London will have 
noted, and which the amendments seek, admirably, to 
rectify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> If we are to have strategies there 
should be indicators and targets. That is one of the reasons 
why it is proper for Governments to ensure that they, and 
everyone else comply.

On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I well understand the 
embarrassment of the hon. Member for Croydon, South 
on seeing the Government's annual report, which so 
succinctly points out the Government's achievements over 
the short period of 12 months in marked contrast to the 
18 miserable years of his party's Administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a little mean.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It is entirely accurate.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 163 and 178 would require mayoral 
strategies to include specific performance indicators and 
targets. We have no difficulty in agreeing with the 
underlying intention of that.
<P>

<P>
The White Paper states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Mayor would set a small number of clear benchmarks as part 
of each strategy, against which progress could be measured".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have already made it clear that Labour's idea of review 
includes ensuring that outcomes are achieved. Of course, 
the new local authority "Best Value"	 regime will apply to 
the GLA. We should expect that to achieve much of what 
the hon. Gentleman intends.
<P>
We are still considering whether it will be necessary to 
legislate to achieve the relevant commitments. We should 
of course expect the mayor to set out a series of targets 
against which performance might be measured, as is now 
common practice in local authorities and other 
organisations. As it will be necessary to consider exactly 
what such a requirement would mean in practice for each 
strategy and what mechanism for reporting on progress 
would be most appropriate, I ask the hon. Gentleman to 
withdraw the amendment, on the clear assurance that we 
shall fully consider his arguments and return to the 
matter later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In the light of those assurances, I beg to

<P>
and Government amendment No. 215.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Amendments Nos. 37 and 39 are simply 
consistent with our previous argument that the clause 
should impose the minimum requirements possible on the 
mayor. Thus they would limit subsection (3) to imposing 
a requirement to comply with international obligations. It 
would then state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Mayor shall have regard to policy and international 
obligations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We emphatically do not believe that it is important or 
necessary for the London strategy to be consistent with 
national policy. If the London government want to do 
something different from what central Government would 
do, it should be allowed so, to do. Otherwise, in the case 
of a Labour Government and Tory-run London 
government, the latter would be expected to do what the 
former required. Instead of such a system, let us have 
some pluralism in politics.

<P>

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> By the same definition, a social 
democrat-led Europe might determine that Tory-led 
GLA's actions. If the hon. Gentleman accepts that, he 
should also accept the national-local relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Europe legislates on matters at a 
European level, but it has no power to determine the 
United Kingdom Government's strategy on matters that 
are under the Government's jurisdiction. [Interruption.] 
Absolutely. There is no requirement on the Greater 
London authority to comply with the Government's 
wishes on strategy and policies for which the authority is 
responsible. Otherwise, what is the point of elections? We 
might as well have the Secretary of State for the 
Environment, Transport and the Regions as mayor and a 
member of the authority. Londoners want to elect people 
who can frame policies for London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The hon. Gentleman provides another 
example of the secessionist politics of the Liberal 
Democrats. They want the government of London to 
resemble that of a quasi-state. They want, not local or city 
government, but an all-encompassing, quasi-state 
government. They know that they will never gain power 
at Westminster, so they try to build little empires in local 
government, but, the electorate will not accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is unwise to suggest that something 
may never happen because, in politics, a week is a long 
time and the hon. Gentleman may be out as quickly as he 
came in. Less arrogance from those in power for a 
transitory period would be helpful.
<P>
The view of the hon. Member for Ilford, South explains 
why the Prime Minister claimed last year that the powers 
of the Scottish Parliament were like those of a parish 
council, and why the Government gave Scotland power to 
vary its taxes but subsequently said that Westminster 
would not allow it. Like many members of his party, the 
hon. Gentleman is a centralist. He has revealed his hand. 
We believe that a London government should do what 
Londoners want. If it wants to do things differently from 
central Government, it should be allowed to do so.
<P>
We believed that the hon. Members for Croydon, South 
and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) supported us because 
amendment No. 165 would omit "national policy and"	 
from subsection (3)(a). I rejoiced to find fellow comrades 
in arms. However, I subsequently realised that their 
intention was to remove "national policy" from the middle 
of a phrase and replace it at the end. My moment of hope 
was shattered and followed by a moment of despair. The 
hon. Member for Croydon, South is about to explain the 
amendment. Whatever the Tory explanation, for heaven's 
sake let us limit the requirements and impositions on the 
Greater London authority. National obligations and our 
reactions to them should be put aside. Let us make 
London do only that with which it is obliged to comply 
by international agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I will not be long.
<P>
I often endeavour to make the point that the hon. 
Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey expressed 
at the beginning of his speech. Removing "national policy" from subsection (3)(a) and placing it in the list means that the mayor will have to "have regard to"	 
national policy, rather than
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with national policy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important distinction. We are at one with the 
hon. Gentleman on that.
<P>
My second point refers to lonely amendment No. 164. 
If it had been accepted, the mayor would have to have 
regard to national policy "wherever practicable". What the 
heck do we mean by national policy? Government 
amendment No. 215 in this group sets out their meaning 
for this clause. From that I gather that it would be policy 
set out, for example, in the White Paper. Even for this 
Bill what the Government said in the White Paper is not 
being transferred into legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Well, the Government have climbed 
down on a number of tourism and health issues. Even the 
structure of clause 25 is different from the way it was 
envisaged in the White Paper. The important point even 
if the Minister does not accept it is that policy that is 
enunciated in a White Paper does not always transfer itself 
into legislation. The mayor may have to have regard to 
something which never becomes law. That would be 
preposterous. I urge the Minister to have a further think 
about this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I hope that nothing I did in a past 
life has led to these worries about consistency with 
national and international policies. I recall that Baroness 
Thatcher's Government were rather upset when the GLC 
opened trade negotiations with the Democratic Republic 
of Vietnam. Bearing in mind how much time I spent with 
expensive lawyers at the GLC, I can see that these words 
are open to a variety of meaning and parameters. Lawyers 
could have a field day if an imaginative and resourceful 
mayor extends the boundaries of his responsibility. 
I suspect that ultimately none of this will matter as much 
as the simple safeguard built into the Bill that every year 
the mayor must go cap in hand to the Government for 
3.5 billion. That will be the real determinant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> It is reasonable for an authority to 
have regard to national policy. Any responsible elected 
authority could do only that. Were it not to do so and were 
it to be oblivious to the background of national policy, it 
would soon go off the rails, leading to a misapplication 
of resources and ineffectiveness on behalf of the electors. 
But to say that it has a need to ensure that its strategy is 
consistent with national policy goes far beyond having a 
due, proper and appropriate regard.
<P>
As usual, Her Majesty's Government reveal a highly 
dictatorial attitude in this wording and they are, of course, 
hypersensitive to the European ramifications. There is the 
need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with 
international obligations. I hope that the authority would 
so conduct its business to ensure that the capital is the 
outstanding capital city of Europe, better by far than 
Brussels, and would set an example which would mean that all Governments of this country could foreswear any deference to Brussels and those who have power therein 
and over us.
<P>
I find this phraseology objectionable on two counts. 
First, the Government are not prepared to see an authority 
elected in London which might pursue a distinct policy 
line from that adopted by Her Majesty's Government. The 
electors of London may with good reason want a different 
kind of authority, in ideology and practice distinct from 
and better than the Government that appertains at 
Whitehall. It should be allowed to do so. That is the 
variety of representation that our balance of national and 
local government has always provided hitherto.
<P>
As for the international obligations, I have never before 
seen a provision of this kind in local government 
legislation. Perhaps it is because of the regional 
dimension, to which the hon. Member for Brent, East 
(Mr. Livingstone) referred. He said that he regarded the 
authority as a prototype for regional government within 
England. We all know that regions in an European Union 
context must have an appropriate relationship with the 
European Union. The Government may be fearful that a 
highly effective mayor and assembly may secede a word 
from the demoniac vocabulary of the hon. Member for 
Ilford, South. International obligations are not normally 
required to be met in local government legislation. I ask 
the Government, and the Ministers in Committee, today 
to explain exactly why that stipulation has been put into 
the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> First, I shall address the 
amendments standing in the name of my hon. Friend the 
Minister for London and Construction. These are 
tidying-up amendments which I urge the Committee to 
accept. They relate to the conditions to which the mayor 
will have a duty to have regard in preparing strategies. 
They would amend the definition of "national policies" to 
which the mayor has to have regard to ensure that it is 
consistent with the definition used in part VIII of the 
Bill regarding planning provisions, for example.
<P>
The original definition set out in part II did not include 
published documents policy planning guidance, for 
example but included only documents formally laid 
before or presented by a Minister to Parliament. the 
amendments would correct that anomaly and ensure that 
the broader definition were used throughout the Bill.
<P>
Clearly, several documents that represent statements of 
national policy are not always formally laid before 
Parliament. That does not mean that such documents 
should not be a material consideration when the mayor is 
preparing his or her strategies. For example, the hon. 
Member for Croydon, South referred to a White Paper not 
automatically becoming part of legislation. He and the 
hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in 
their attempts to probe the Bill mentioned that in some 
instances words in the White Paper were not precisely 
replicated in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South also referred to 
the Government's failure to touch on tourism. As I said 
to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, that comes 
under the heading of culture, and we shall deal with amendments on that subject later. That issue was touched on earlier this afternoon. I am somewhat surprised that the 
hon. Gentleman has forgotten in such short a time.
<P>
I turn now to the amendments standing in the name of 
the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, 
which strike me and clearly others on the Government 
Benches as utterly bizarre. My hon. Friend the Member 
for Ilford, South referred to the increasing externalisation 
of the secessionist policies of the Liberal Democratic 
party. The hon. member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsy seems to want the mayor and the assembly to 
be able to ignore international obligations. Does he really 
wish the mayor and the assembly to have no regard for 
the international obligations that national Governments 
have put in place obligations to, for example, the 
European Court of Human Rights, or the obligations of 
this country to take asylum seekers or offer sanctuary to 
the victims of torture? I see that the hon. Gentleman 
wishes to intercede.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is misdirecting 
herself. The amendment left in international obligations.<P>

<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I should be interested to know how the 
hon. Gentleman imagines that a mayor and assembly for 
London would be able to meet international obligations 
when international obligations are carried out by national 
Governments. I understand that the hon. Gentleman wants 
the mayor and the assembly to be able to ignore national 
Government policies. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
Ilford, South said, the hon. Gentleman seems to be 
pushing for an independent, autonomous nation state. As 
we know from the hon. Gentleman's earlier definition of 
the real London, it would be an extremely small, 
autonomous nation state. The amendments are part and 
parcel of a philosophy propounded by the hon. Member 
for Southwark, North and Bermondsey which would in 
effect create a cordon sanitaire around this ever-shrinking 
capital city.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Again the Minister misunderstands the 
amendment, but that is not because the amendment is 
unclear. We are all governed by international obligations, 
the state as well as its citizens. That is why the 
amendment leaves that requirement in. We merely want 
to remove the obligation to ensure that the strategy of the 
London mayor is consistent with national policy. The hon. 
Member for Ruislip-Northwood made the same point.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I repeat that I would be very interested 
to know whom the hon. Gentleman supposes would adopt 
the role of foreign secretary within the GLA.
<P>
One cannot have international agreements conducted by 
either a citywide government or a local authority. 
International agreements are made after argument and 
debate between independent nation states. The hon. 
Member for Ruislip-Northwood is clearly much attracted 
to the idea I have little doubt that he would love to see 
a unilateral declaration by the mayor and the assembly 
that they were seceding from the European Union. I do 
not know how that action would square with the 
Government's clear commitment to the City of London 
corporation being the central financial capital of that 
European Union.
<P>
The amendments of the hon. Members for Southwark, 
North and Bermondsey and for Croydon, South are not 
only unnecessary but unworkable and bizarre. I find them 
almost insulting to the people of London, in as much as 
they imply that it is impossible for the people of London 
to be simultaneously loyal to their borough, to this great 
capital city and to the nation state. I therefore ask the hon. 
Gentlemen to withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sorry that the Minister has clearly 
chosen to misrepresent and misunderstand the 
amendments. I will not withdraw them because they raise 
an important issue.
<P>
International obligations commit the state and thus its 
citizens. That would remain the case. Of course such 
obligations become national policy, because they have to 
be adopted. We exempted them purposely because we as 
a country subscribe to international obligations. We have 
no objection to that. However, as was clear in what I said 
and in what the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, 
we object to the fact that the mayor must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with national 
policy".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Moreover, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South 
pointed out, national policy is widely defined as being 
prospective as well as actual policy. the hon. Lady is 
wrong to call it secession; it is pluralist politics with tiers 
of government and a separation of powers between the 
nation state, regional government and local government.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have already called it secessionist but 
now it is schizophrenic. It is bizarre to argue that a nation 
state can reach international agreement, but that it may 
not reach agreement in the national interest and that local 
government should be outside that agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am sorry if the Minister chooses not 
to understand. Of course national government can adopt 
policies. We are saying merely that the mayor should not 
have to have strategies consistent with national policies. 
That is all, It is very simple. The Minister clearly wishes 
the mayor to have strategies that are consistent with 
national policies, but we think that the mayor and the 
assembly should be free to decide, within the powers that 
are given to them, their own strategies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore (Hendon):</B> Perhaps I may repeat 
the point about pollution, which I made earlier from a 
sedentary position. International criteria on pollution 
would be binding on national Governments. Suppose that 
our national Government decided to introduce obligations 
that were more stringent than the international 
requirements on air pollution. Is the hon. Gentleman 
seriously suggesting that the London authority or the 
mayor should have the power to impose less stringent 
criteria than those that apply nationally? Air pollution is 
both national and international. Does the hon. Gentleman 
not therefore agree that it would be ludicrous for the city 
not to have to meet national policy obligations? He is 
trying to turn the clock back two-and-a-half thousand 
years to the ancient Greek city states, and completely 
ignoring the realities of the world in which we live.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> City states denied votes to women and 
slaves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly does not 
understand how legislation works or how government is 
structured in many parts of the world. Go to Germany and 
ask Germans about how they organise their government. 
Go to Spain and look at the constitutional settlement that 
it recently reached. Go to Canada, to Australia, to the 
United States.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes</b> rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No, I shall not give way to the hon. 
Gentleman. Let me first deal with his hon. Friend. If there 
is an international obligation, we will be bound by it. If 
the Government have a national policy that is not 
legislated for, London should be free to dissent from it. 
What is the point of having a London government if every 
national policy must be adopted? London's government 
would merely be a cypher that endorses the national 
Government. The Government may, of course, introduce 
Bills that require action by London's government, as it 
regularly does in the case of other bodies such as the 
police and the fire authorities. However, let us ensure that 
London's government has only to do what central 
Government specifically requires it to do, rather than 
creating a general requirement that every single 
Government policy must be followed by London's 
government. That is madness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. Gentleman still has not 
answered my specific point about pollution. The Road 
Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Bill, which was 
enacted last year, set targets: those targets are laid down 
as policy, not as legislation. That legislation was 
vehemently supported by the hon. Gentleman's party as it 
progressed. Is he now saying that the London authority 
should ignore the policy that has been set by national 
Government when setting its road traffic reduction 
targets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly does not 
remember that debate or understand the argument. Of 
course the London authority has to know what national 
policy is and take account of it. However, if a separate 
duty had not been placed upon London's government in 
a road traffic reduction Bill, or elsewhere, it should 
naturally be free to have targets that are not as tough as 
the Government might wish. I would probably argue that 
it should have tougher targets, but it should be London's 
decision.
<P>
A more acute example is that of tax. The Government's 
policy is to tax rich people no more than less rich 
people to have a 40 per cent. top rate. Liberal Democrats 
Members argue that London's government, in common 
with those of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 
should have the power to raise and lower, for the purposes 
of London's functions, the amount of money that 
Londoners pay. There should not be an upper or a lower 
cap. We believe in giving power to people rather than 
holding on to it. That is the difference between the Liberal 
Democrats and the Labour party. The hon. Member for 
<P>
<B>Hendon </B>(Mr. Dismore) is entitled to argue that London's 
government should be a cypher. We disagree with that, 
and we are sure that Londoners do not want London's 
government to be the poodle of central Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes </b>rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall finish on this note. There is no 
point in me, the hon. Member for Brent, East or anybody 
else being the mayor or a member of the assembly if 
ultimately one has no power to do anything that differs 
from the requirements of the right hon. A. C. L. Blair in 
No. 10 Downing street.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned tax. Is he 
arguing that the powers of the London assembly and 
mayor should be the same as those of the Scottish 
Parliament? The hon. Gentleman is, in effect, arguing that 
London is not a city but a nation, confirming our earlier 
argument about his separatist, secessionist philosophy.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am astounded, not only at the lack of 
awareness of some Labour Members but at the lack of 
willingness to understand what regional government 
means. This is meant to be regional government. I know 
that it has been redefined as citywide government. Even 
then, the powers are different. The answer to the question 
is yes, we do. [Interruption.]
<P>
I am not a separatist. London should have regional 
government, as should the rest of England. Regional 
government should have the power to increase and reduce 
the amount of revenue that it raises for its people. That is 
what we argued should happen in Scotland, and that is 
what we believe. The hon. Member for Ilford, South does 
not believe in that, because he is a centralist; we do, 
because we are not.

<B>Mr. Dismore</b> rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am not going to give way. There is a 
clear difference of view. The pluralist are, interestingly, 
on the Opposition Benches.
<P>
<B>Mr. John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington)</b> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I give way to someone who I hope is still 
a pluralist.
<P>
<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> On Second Reading, I referred to this 
as possibly the most brutal expression of centralism that 
I have seen in any piece of legislation. The amendment 
tabled by my hon. Friend the Minister which clarifies the 
definition of national policy is important. It defines 
national policies as those that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) have been laid before, or presented to, either House of 
Parliament; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) have been published by a Minister of the Crown"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not content with the clause but will support it 
because in the past, when policy has been laid before 
Parliament or published by a Minister of the Crown, it 
has usually been a duty placed upon local government to 
include it in the relevant factors, or dismiss it as an 
irrelevant factor, under the Wednesbury principles. On 
that basis, I think that there is a way forward for the future 
mayor of London to take it into account as a relevant 
factor but to build up sufficient argument on other factors 
if necessary, which are specific to the capital city, to 
enable the regional judgment to go ahead with a policy 
that might be contradictory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman at 
least understands the issue before us and that we have to 
allow discretion. I also understand the Wednesbury 
principle.
<P>
Clause 33(4) defines policy as matters that have been 
legislated for, plus those which have been presented 
formally to Parliament. I urge the hon. Gentleman to 
reflect on this, and perhaps he can support us to some 
extent. I believe that London government must listen to, 
but be free to differ from, the policy of the Government 
of the day. If Labour Members do not believe that 
Londoners want that, why are we going through this ritual 
of giving London its own government? Otherwise it is all 
a delusion and a deception.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> This is the first time that I have had the 
privilege of moving an amendment that stands in my 
name, and which appears to enjoy the support of the 
Liberal Democrats. If they move into a "Passport to 
Pimlico" mode, I may disown their rapport later. At the 
moment, however, I am delighted to have their support.
<P>
At least one of the Ministers took part in the 1997 
debate on the governance of London, as did the hon. 
Member for Brent, East, one or two other hon. Members 
in the Room and I. In that debate, I referred to the 
disadvantages that had flowed from the Abercrombie plan 
and from the consequent reduction in manufacturing in 
London. I referred also to Lord Stallard's unhappiness 
when he and I served on Camden borough council at the 
fact that Greater London council transport regulations had 
effectively destroyed the piano industry in his ward. That 
example is important to the piano industry and to Lord 
Stallard's ward, and it may be relevant to my amendment, 
if the piano industry was globally competitive at the time.
<P>
London is very important to the United Kingdom's 
global competitiveness. For obvious constituency reasons, 
I shall cite the single example of financial services, whose 
current work force in Britain is now equal to that of 
manufacturing. I recognise that such services are practised 
outside London, notably in Edinburgh. London is, 
however, central to the financial services industry. 
I acknowledge also that other industries are relevant 
besides financial services. Within my own constituency, 
I could cite information technology, tourism and 
media-related activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman 
agree with the Lord Mayor of London, Lord Levene, that 
the City of London will lose out if Britain does not join 
the euro in the next three or four years?
 <P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> You, Mr. Benton, would immediately rule 
me out of order if I were diverted by that question. At 
present, the Governor of the Bank of England and Lord 
Levene, the Lord Mayor of London, take different views, 
but that is not a matter for debate here.
<P>
Some Committee members may not like globalisation. 
I am not wholly sure that I like it myself, but it is a fact 
of life with which we have to live and which necessarily 
has a strategic impact. The mayor will have plenty of 
powers, provided for later in the Bill, to stop things 
happening. That is a line with a well-known British 
characteristic thinking of reasons for not doing things. 
In respect of global competitiveness, it will also be 
important for the mayor to have powers to enable him to 
push things forward and to desist from stopping things 
because of the possible effect on global competitiveness.
<P>
The Government are a business-friendly Government, 
so I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to 
the amendment. If I am hoist with my own petard, and 
the Minister points out other parts of the Bill in which the 
matter is more than adequately dealt with, I shall, unlike 
some members of the Committee, grin and bear it and 
move on to the next amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendment No. 168 is broadly in line 
with the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend, so I 
will not dwell on it. My right hon. Friend put the case 
admirably. Amendment No. 169 invites the mayor to 
consider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the compliance costs for business and the impact on 
employment"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in Greater London. That is important and consistent with 
our earlier argument about compliance. I hope that the 
Minister will consider the amendment favourably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We support the amendment. If the 
Government are to require strategies and prescribe what 
the mayor should take account of, what is mentioned in 
the amendment should be listed. We argued that the 
strategies should not be written into the Bill, but if they 
are to be there, the amendment suggests a perfectly proper 
subject for inclusion. We urge the Minister to be positive 
toward the lead amendment, and toward those grouped 
with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an admirably brief 
debate, which was elegantly introduced by the right hon. 
Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I shall try 
to give him the response that he wants as quickly and as 
elegantly as I can.
<P>
I refer the right hon. Gentleman back to clause 25, 
which specifies in subsection (1):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Authority shall have the purpose of promoting economic and 
social development in Greater London and the improvement of the 
environment in Greater London."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 25(3)(c) amplifies that by stating that the matters 
to which the authority shall have regard include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"facilitating the creation of wealth in Greater London".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that makes it clear to the right hon. Gentleman 
that we place the issue of London's financial success and 
economic competitiveness absolutely at the core of the 
role of the new body.
<P>
Clearly, the promotion of inward investment will be an 
important part of that role, and that will be covered under 
the economic development strategy, to which we referred 
when debating clause 33, which mentions the mayor's 
strategies. The London Development Agency strategy will 
be prepared under clause 33(1)(b). Those provisions of 
the Bill meet the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, so I 
urge him to withdraw his amendment, because it is 
unnecessary.
<P>
Similarly, I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South 
not to press his amendments. We have already discussed 
consultation in our debate on clause 25, and have given a 
clear undertaking further to consider the definition of the 
duties to consult, including consulting the business 
community, so I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press 
amendment No. 168.
<P>
Amendment No. 169 appears a tad eccentric. When 
drawing up his or her strategies, the mayor will obviously 
have to bear in mind compliance costs for business and 
their impact on employment. If the mayor were not to do 
so, he or she would be failing in his or her duty. Public 
safety will also obviously be an important consideration 
for the mayor in formulating his or her strategies, not least 
because of the close relationship that the mayor will have 
with the new London fire and civil defence authority.
<P>
Given that all the considerations raised by the 
amendments are fully and satisfactorily covered elsewhere 
in the Bill, I urge the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw 
his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I thank the Minister for the graciousness 
with which he responded to my amendment and those of 
my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. I have 
one misgiving about the argument that he deployed. He 
implied that the two provisions that he cited in clauses 
25 and 33 embraced the issues raised by my 
amendment. It would be possible for the global 
competitiveness of London to be harmed without 
contradicting the clauses that the Minister cited. I am sure 
that he is not claiming that every single thing that involves 
economic development or the creation of wealth in 
Greater London would naturally be supported by the 
Government. I will pause before deciding what to do 
about the amendment if the Minister will respond on 
that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to respond to the right 
hon. Gentleman's challenge. In certain circumstances, an 
economic development strategy that was being developed 
in London might conceivably not accord with every 
aspect of the regional development policies that the 
Government were pursuing. I find it difficult to believe, 
however, that the economic development strategy for 
London would not be about securing inward investment 
and improving London's competitiveness. For that reason, 
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman accepts that the 
concerns that he voiced will be properly covered and that 
the mayor will be able to act properly in the interests of 
the people of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> You have not called me to respond,
Mr. Benton, but I am trying to speed up the 
proceedings. As some hon. Members will know, I see 
all life through the filter of cricket. On this occasion, I 
will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and not 
press the amendment. Whether my hon. Friends press 
theirs is a matter for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Likewise, we will not press our 
amendments.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the 
following amendments:
<P>
No. 317, in clause 34, page 20, line 4, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) the general public to the extent that he considers practicable.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 318, in page 20, line 9, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) In discharging the duty under subsection (1)(f) above, the 
Mayor shall report to the Assembly on the arrangements he has 
made.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Committee will be pleased to know 
that the amendments are almost self-explanatory. 
Amendment No. 315 is entirely self-explanatory and is 
included only because I thought that we might lose the 
vote on whether to get rid of the relevant part of the Bill. I 
thought, therefore, that we should comprehensively ensure 
public participation in the drawing up of the mayor's 
strategy.
<P>
Amendment No. 317 is arguably more important. It 
would specifically write into clause 34 that the general 
public should participate when the mayor prepares or 
revises any strategy. At present, the clause allows the 
mayor to talk to any other person or body, but that could 
imply a legal entity or an authority; the public are not 
mentioned.
<P>
Most important of all is amendment No. 318. We argue 
that a report should be made to the assembly on the 
arrangements that the mayor makes when carrying out his 
or her strategy. For the purpose of the amendment, we 
accept that the balance of power between the mayor and 
the assembly will remain weighted towards the mayor. 
None the less, if the mayor is going to consult, he or she 
must tell the assembly what process is involved and allow 
it to have an input into that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I do not understand what public 
participation means; it probably means nothing whatever. 
It is probably another of those silly warm phrases that 
people trot out without thinking too much in the belief 
that they add somewhat to the Bill's value. I doubt that it 
will. Does public participation mean focus groups or mass 
meetings? Does it mean sending a questionnaire to every 
household in London? I do not know what it means in the 
present context. We should put nothing of the kind in 
the Bill.
<P>
I take exception to amendment No. 317 because, even 
though the term "general public"	 is, I regret to say, used 
on notices in the Palace of Westminster, it is a tautology. 
I have never understood how the public could be anything 
other than general. If someone can point me to a specific 
public, I might go along with the amendment. On the 
grounds of tautology and incomprehensibility, therefore, I 
support neither of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has made a 
strong case against the amendments and I do not intend 
to detain the Committee long, but they are unnecessary 
and create the impression that the Liberal Democrat party 
is more interested in talking than in getting things done. 
That impression has been conveyed quite a lot during the 
Committee's sittings.
<P>
The amendments are unnecessary because, as the hon. 
Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will 
know, clause 34(1) imposes obligations on the mayor to 
consult widely in the preparation of all the strategies. 
Clause 34(1)(e) provides for the duty to consult to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any other body or person whom he considers it appropriate to 
consult"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot see the benefit in including consultation of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the general public to the extent that he considers practicable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That strikes me as otiose.
<P>
As to the requirement to report back to the assembly, 
the hon. Gentleman will be aware we shall consider the 
relevant clauses later of detailed requirements in the Bill 
for the mayor to report monthly to the assembly 
explaining his actions, and making him accountable to the 
assembly for those actions. A satisfactory framework will 
exist for ensuring public participation in the preparation 
of the strategies through proper consultation, reporting 
back, and accountability.
<P>
I urge the hon. gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The right hon. Member for 
Bromley and Chislehurst made quite a good point about 
the words "public"	 or "general public"	, and perhaps that 
term of art should be amended. The other matters are not 
hugely important and I shall not pursue them now. I hope, 
however, that before the Bill is passed we shall be sure 
of maximising the public's opportunity to participate in 
the processes that form the obligations of the mayor and 
assembly.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 316, in 
page 19, line 31, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) the desirability of promoting harmony, equity and mutual 
respect between members of different ethnic groups'.
<P></ul></font>
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the 
amendment, which concerns an important issue, although 
I do not pretend that the drafting is perfect. If we are to 
include in the Bill important issues to which the mayor 
should have regard in preparing strategy, among those 
obligations should be the promoting of harmony, equity 
and mutual respect between members of different ethnic 
groups. It is just conceivable, although I pray God it will 
never happen, that a mayor whose natural instinct was not 
to do that could be elected. In that eventuality if the law 
at least stated that it was the mayor's duty there could be 
some recourse through the courts or otherwise.
<P>
It will become more apparent than it has for some time 
been, following the publication of the Stephen Lawrence 
inquiry report, that, below the surface we had a good 
debate about this in the Committee of the whole House, 
with regard to thresholds there is always potential for 
ethnic and racial disagreement and differences to turn into 
something worse. I do not doubt the wish of all 
Committee Members to ensure that the new London 
authority will accommodate all ethnic communities and 
encourage more harmony and mutual respect between 
them. However, I hope that the amendment will be a 
reminder that the inclusion in the Bill of issues such as 
river transport and biodiversity, but not the desirability of 
what I have explained, would send very unsatisfactory 
signals.
<P>
I am not attached to the wording of the amendment and 
do not hold a brief for its perfection, but I hope that we 
can arrive at some way of showing that as the Minister 
for Transport in London explained very well on the Floor 
of the House, we want to be seen to be committed to 
the issue.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I believe that this country has some of 
the best race relations laws in the world, which is why it 
is a stable country. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for 
Southwark, North and Bermondsey makes an important 
point and we wish to be associated with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> We all wish to be associated with the 
hon. Gentleman's comments. Many of us are elected from 
constituencies with a variety of racial groups. I just 
wonder whether the wording of the amendment will 
achieve the purpose. I should have thought that the best 
way to promote
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"harmony, equity and mutual respect"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
was not by spinning it out in statute but by leading 
example, and demonstrating that the mayor heads an 
authority that in every way promotes these ideals. The 
inclusion of that phrase would mean that all times the 
provision would conceivably be justifiable, not against 
poor performance in a benign and just way, but in a 
malign manner by people using the legislation to 
demonstrate, maliciously, that the mayor and his authority 
were racist, bigoted, inequitable or divisive in their policy 
to ethnic groups.
<P>
I sympathise entirely with the Liberal Democrats' 
objectives, but wonder whether they are achievable. We 
know that much race relations legislation can have 
negative consequences inasmuch as there is a backlash 
against it. The suggested phrase could not in any sense be 
so construed, but we must be ultra-cautious in matters 
relating to race.
<P>
I had thought that the general purposes and objectives 
of the assembly as set out in clause 25 were sufficient. 
"Social development"	 must surely mean the development 
of a racially cohesive, equitable, tolerant and positive 
society whose constituent elements, regardless of race, 
bring their respective qualities to the assembly's work and 
to the people of London for the good of all. I have my 
doubts about the amendment. I would not go so far as to 
vote against it, but it is worth injecting a note of caution, 
good as the intention behind the amendment may be.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I also welcome you to the Chair, 
Mr. Benton. I have not done so before today.
<P>
I am reasonably happy with the idea of mentioning 
those aspects, but I wonder whether the wording should be 
considered further. London will not be a separate state it 
will be governed by race relations, crime and disorder, 
and equal opportunities legislation, and by all other 
legislation applying to the United Kingdom, or to England 
and Wales if there is separate legislation for Scotland. 
Therefore, wording relating to discrimination must be 
sensitive to other Acts that will apply to other matters in 
this city. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, 
North and Bermondsey will withdraw the amendment so 
that Ministers may reconsider it, or at least try to ensure 
consistency. The worst outcome would be legislation that 
differed from other Acts dealing with the same matters. 
That would lead to a field day for lawyers and perhaps 
difficulties of the kind that the hon. Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood mentioned. We must be careful to 
achieve consistency between the Bill and other measures 
applying to London and other parts of the country.



<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Contributions from the hon. 
Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, for 
Ruislip-Northwood and for Croydon, South and from my 
hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South makes it clear 
that this Committee is unanimous in believing that racism 
or any form of prejudice that is based on skin colour or 
religion is anathema. That opinion is, I believe, shared by 
Parliament as a whole.
<P>
Clearly, racism is an issue of great sensitivity in our 
remarkable capital city, with its vast range of ethnic 
groupings. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and 
Bermondsey touched on a recent, scandalous and 
appalling case, from which lessons continue to learned. I 
do not believe that Londoners with the exception of a 
comparatively small minority have any great desire to 
foster the prejudice and enmity to which the hon. 
Gentleman referred obliquely.
<P>
His amendments aim to eradicate such prejudice; no 
one would disagree with their desired outcome. However, 
as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South said, there 
are other legal frameworks. For example, clause 265 
makes provision for section 71 of the Race Relations Act 
1976 to apply to the Greater London authority. The GLA 
will therefore be under the duty that applies to other 
authorities. Section 71 of the Race Relations Act 
requires them
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to make appropriate arrangements with a view to securing that 
their various functions are carried out with due regard to the need <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to promote equality of opportunity, and good relations, 
between persons of different racial groups."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood pointed 
out, the general purposes specified in clause 25 lay a duty 
on the GLA. Clause 33 specifies that the authority has a 
general purpose to promote economic and social 
development in Greater London, as well as environmental 
improvements. Clearly, eradicating bad race relations is a 
major part of that.
<P>
I said that I intended to re-examine the wording of 
clause 25 to determine whether amendments are necessary 
to clarify the authority's general purpose. The hon. 
Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised an 
issue of great importance, and did not make a dogmatic 
insistence that the wording of his amendment is necessary 
to deliver its desired outcome. We will address the issues 
raised by his amendment, and, in the light of that 
commitment, I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am happy to accept the 
Minister's offer and am grateful for the interest that has 
been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the 
Committee.
<P>
The amendment was not tabled in the belief that it 
would deliver a perfect outcome. Indeed, it might be 
better to include a statement in other places, such as the 
purposes section mentioned by the Minister. I understand 
the point made by the hon. Member for 
Ruislip-Northwood that we do not want complicated 
litigation. I accept, too, the point made by the hon. 
Member for Ilford South that we must not replicate 
obligations under mational legislation.

<P>
The Government made clear their commitment to 
getting such issues right in the Bill. That is important, and 
I hope that the Minister will collaborate with us. If we, 
as a three-party Committee, can agree, that would be in 
everybody's interest, and I would be happy to withdraw 
the amendment and talk to the Minister later.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It can be seen from the clock that there 
has been much discussion of the clause. Fundamental 
differences exist between the Government and the 
Opposition, despite several generous concessions from the 
Government. Therefore, we wish to divide the Committee 
on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We have one fundamental difference of 
opinion with the Government. The Bill provides that all 
the GLA's actions must be consistent with national policy. 
Like the hon. Member for Croydon, South we would like 
the clause to be redrafted. Therefore, we wish to divide 
the Committee.
