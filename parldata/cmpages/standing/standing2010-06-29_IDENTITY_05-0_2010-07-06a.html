handling our proceedings today, Mr Caton, and I welcome serving under
your continued chairmanship. This is my first sitting in Committee as a
Minister in the coalition Government and I am particularly pleased that
we are discussing the scrapping of the identity cards scheme. Like the
Minister for Immigration, my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, I have
been a consistent critic of ID cards, and on Second Reading of the Bill
I raised several serious concerns about the scheme. There were two key
issues, the first of which was that it was too wide and not
purpose-specific, and I was pleased that that sentiment was expressed
by Liberty in its oral evidence to the Committee. The second issue was
about security and protecting the information that is held. Clauses 4
to 6 deal with that important matter and I am
grateful to have been allowed to speak to the three clauses
together.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000040">&#160;</a>

Committee will note, the provisions are taken from the Identity Cards
Act 2006 and are proposed for re-enactment under the Bill. I hope that
hon. Members will appreciate that the purpose of the Bill is to scrap
the ID cards scheme and the national identity register. Its aim is not
to dismantle parts of the criminal justice

4 covers the possession of false identity documents with improper
intention, and re-enacts the offence under section 25(1) and (2) of the
2006 Act and the penalty for the offence under section 25(6) of that
Act. Clause 4(1) provides that a person is guilty of an offence if that
person is in possession of a document that they know or believe to be
false, or of a genuine document that has been improperly obtained or
relates to someone else. However, to be guilty of an actual offence,
the person must have an improper intention, which is defined under
subsection (2), for example, using the document for identity fraud.
Subsection (4) sets out the maximum penalty for such an offence as 10
years’ imprisonment or a fine, or both. It is important to
stress that the offences provide for an offence of being in possession
of documents when such possession is for an improper intention or
without reasonable excuse. Being in possession of an identity document
for, say, an elderly relative in order to obtain health care or care
services for them would not be an
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000042">&#160;</a>

5 deals with apparatus designed or adapted for the making of false
identity documents and re-enacts the offence under section 25(3) and
(4) of the 2006 Act, and the penalty for the offence set out in section
25(6) of that Act. Clause 5(1) and (2) provide that a person is guilty
of an offence if, with the prohibited intention, they are in possession
of equipment that is designed or adapted for making false identity
documents. Subsection (3) sets out the maximum penalty for
such an offence as 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine, or
both.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000043">&#160;</a>

6 covers possession of false identity documents without reasonable
excuse and re-enacts the offence under section 25(5) of the 2006 Act

Act. Clause 6(1) provides that it is an offence for a person to have in
their possession, without reasonable excuse, a false identity document,
or a genuine document that has been improperly obtained or relates to
someone else, or equipment used for making false identity documents.
Subsection (2) sets out the maximum penalty for such an offence as a
maximum of two years’ imprisonment on indictment or a fine, or
both. On summary conviction, a person may be subject to a term of
imprisonment up to a maximum period or a fine, or both. Subsections (3)
and (4) set out the maximum period in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. So far as Scotland is concerned, the provisions
reflect the effect of section 35 of the Criminal Proceedings etc.
(Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007, which has increased the maximum term of
imprisonment for an either way offence to 12

Majesty’s Opposition welcome the re-enactment of parts of the

terrorists frequently use false documents and false identities, as I

identity documents and measures in law to ensure that people cannot
produce fraudulent documents or use them for wrong purposes are very
important. Of course, this does beg the question of why the Government
are rushing into abolition of the whole of the Identity Cards Act 2006
without proper scrutiny of all aspects of the Bill, and we will touch
on that in our discussions of new clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000046">&#160;</a>

welcome this part of the Bill. It is the only area so far where the
Government are not throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The number
of convictions demonstrate its use. One could argue, and I certainly
do, that had other aspects of the 2006 Act been in use
longer—namely, the actual use of identity cards—we would
be seeing equal benefits, but in principle we have no practical
objection to the re-enactment of clauses 4 to

experience of the law-making process under the previous Government, I
do not automatically assume that just because they created an offence
it definitely needs to be re-enacted. We saw far too many offences
created, and it is important to think carefully about every new offence
that we create. In particular, we took oral and written evidence from
Justice, which was concerned that clauses 5 and 6 might replicate
previous legislation. I got the Library to do some research—the
reference is 2010/6/223-HAS if anyone wants to look at it. They found
that in this case the clauses do not entirely re-create the previous
laws, so I am happy that they are in fact needed in this instance.
However, it is an important principle to think carefully about creating
new
offences.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000048">&#160;</a>

welcome the provisions in clauses 4 to 6. When we debated previous

that needs to be addressed. When the Government get it right, as they
have in these clauses, Opposition Members should welcome that. ID fraud
is a big issue that needs to be addressed. There are a number of ways

                           </strong> Clause 8 defines what constitutes personal
information, for the purposes of the criminal offences defined in
clauses 4 to 6. The clause defines specific areas of personal
information, such as residential status or previous name, and it
focuses on key pieces of information for consideration when a person is
suspected of being involved in an offence. We consider that it is right
to adopt a focused approach, because it is essential to have certainty
in the definition of a criminal
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000061">&#160;</a>

believe that it would not be appropriate—as the Information
Commissioner discussed in his written evidence—to use a broader
approach, such as adopting the definition of personal data set out in
section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998. To do so would mean that
a potential offender would not be sure whether a behaviour is
criminalised. The criminal offences defined in the Bill are those of
using false identity documents to establish certain facts about a
person. It is essential that those facts are set out in the definition
of the offence. If a more open-ended definition is used, there is a
risk that an innocent person might unwittingly be caught by an
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000062">&#160;</a>

10 re-enacts the provisions of section 38 of the 2006 Act. It is a
fraud prevention measure that allows the Secretary of State to require
that relevant information is provided to verify the information within
a passport application, or to decide whether to withdraw a passport.
Relevant information includes identity information, to confirm that the
applicant is a real person and is who they claim to be. It enables the
Identity and Passport Service to obtain information on the completed
application, which is necessary to conduct an effective interview with
first-time applicants. That may include records from a credit reference
agency about how long a person has resided at an address, or at how
many addresses they have lived.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It would be
unlawful, and a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998, to require
information that was not relevant to the passport application. The use
of a credit reference agency mirrors the approach in the private
sector, which routinely uses such agencies for bank loans or credit
applications. Whereas the focus may be on credit worthiness, it also
provides organisations with some confidence in the identity of the
person applying for the bank or credit facility, and enables them to
check personal details such as an address and the length of time that a
person has resided there. Checks with an external credit agency, in
addition to the range of governmental agencies, provide a high degree
of security and verification in considering applications for passports.
It would be odd if the Identity and Passport Service could not check an
applicant’s identity with a credit reference agency, when mobile
phone companies, shops, and banks and building societies that offer
credit terms do so every

information supplied to the Identity and Passport Service is
automatically deleted 28 days after a passport has been issued. When a
passport has been refused, the information is retained for possible
investigative and prosecutorial purposes. We hope that that is an
appropriate and proportionate approach to data retention. I commit to
ensuring that that policy remains in place and is firmly applied. I am
aware, from conversations with colleagues from all parts of the House,
that there are concerns about the scope of the clause, so I will be

as they will be the only secure identity document, if the Bill reaches
the statute book. Of course, a higher level of verification was
required for the issuing of identity
cards.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000075">&#160;</a>

need to undertake verification by going to credit reference agencies or
other bodies. That system would have limited the amount of data that
private sector and other organisations need to look up, because of the
secure nature of the identity card and the fact that an identity check
can be made against the register to prove, once and for all, that
somebody was on

                        <p>Questions
arise about what information might be used by the Secretary of State to
determine whether to do that, and what rules apply. That was briefly
discussed during the first oral evidence session under
Question 26. Again, the Library has done some work on this
issue—reference 2010/6/80-HAS. There is no statute law governing
the granting, refusal and use of British passports, and no limitation
on what can be done. The question whether that should be statutory is
for another
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
there are no rules stating that the Secretary of State can use some but
not other information to determine, for example, whether to withdraw a
passport. If the Secretary of State makes the argument that
somebody’s tax records are an important factor in deciding
whether to withdraw their passport, they would be able to do so under
this clause. If the Secretary of State believes a record of
somebody’s speaking to undesirable people during the past few
years would be useful information in making such a decision, they would
be allowed to do so. I am not in the slightest degree suggesting that
those are the intentions of the Minister, of the Opposition when they
were in government or of anyone else, but I am worried that the wording
is too loose and that “Relevant information” is
undefined.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have heard what the Minister said, and I hope that he will consider how
the phraseology can be slightly tightened. If the relevant information
concerns identity or residence, that might be written in the Bill,
which would avoid any of those concerns. I hope that the Minister will
take my comments in the spirit in which they are intended—as a
constructive suggestion. I hope that we will see a slight limitation
applied to the clause, so that we do not give excess powers to future
Secretaries of State, who may not be as wise the current
one.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000082">&#160;</a>

made last week—the record will show this—is that the IPS
and all Governments over the years have been ahead of the curve in
ensuring that the passport remains secure and will be secure in the
future, which is why I am concerned about the loss of fingerprints and
biometrics.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000084">&#160;</a>

Second Reading. In the oral evidence session, I was interested to hear
that both Liberty and Justice were broadly supportive of the clause,
which was noteworthy and welcome. I have a degree of sympathy for the
points made by my hon. Friend about the scope of the Bill. There is the
opportunity to consider clarifying what was section 38 of the 2006 Act.
I am particularly keen to examine how the Bill will ensure that
information requests are passport application specific and how we can
increase transparency and public accountability by ensuring that a data
retention policy is set out in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000085">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch may know the answer off
the top of her head. I do not know whether someone who has applied for
a passport in the past couple of years is given that information, but I
imagine that that is not the case. The hon. Gentleman has raised an
underlying important point about the confidence of the citizen in the

to ask for that information. Clearly, the system is designed to ensure

will move on to why a little less haste would be good, for the fairness

to think that if the Minister had been in his job a little longer, he
may have realised, after examination and scrutiny, some of the benefits
of the 2006 Act. We recognise that both parties in the coalition
Government are keen to rid the country of the benefits of ID cards, but
to do so with such haste is like throwing the baby out with the

The new clause is moderate, and would slightly slow the
Government’s plans to remove identity cards. It would allow
citizens with a card to transfer the £30 fee as a
credit towards a new passport. All of us—certainly those of us
from London and the Manchester area—have constituents who bought
cards because their passports had expired, or were about to, and felt
that this was suitable for their needs. Those individuals paid
£30, thinking that the card would last for 10 years. Now, they
are being asked to pay £77.50 for another travel document, which
is unfair.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000117">&#160;</a>

produce the card at the passport office and ask for £30 off the

                           </span> I will not repeat all the
arguments that I made last week, but I want to raise a couple of those
issues, because some of my constituents have written to me expressing
their concern that identity cards are going and asking for some sort of
recompense. Last week, we discussed the mean nature of the Bill, which
meant that I have been unable to table an amendment stating that my
constituents should be reimbursed. The new clause would ensure that
people who paid the Government £30 for an identity card in the
best faith, and now discover that they will not be able to use it,
would at least have some recompense.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I remind the
Committee that many of the people who purchased the cards are on low
incomes or on fixed incomes. Many of those who have written to me are
pensioners who, when their passport ran out, decided to get an identity
card, because it was cheaper and because at their time of life they
intended to travel only to Europe. Their faith in the Government has
been dented, and I ask Government Members to consider supporting the
new clause, because it goes some way towards restoring people’s
faith in the system. It is important that such people are not asked to
pay a further £77.50, but are offered the difference
between the money that they paid for the identity card and the cost of
a
passport.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000122">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The new clause is interesting, and the objections
to it fall into two categories: there is an objection in principle and
two serious practical objections. The objection in principle is that
the new clause would force the taxpayer to reimburse those who bought
an identity card voluntarily. We had long and passionate debates last
week on how we can extricate ourselves from the ID card scheme with the
least possible cost to the taxpayer. The Committee has been running for
32 minutes and nobody has yet mentioned the former Chief
Secretary’s notorious letter revealing that there was no
money—an epitaph on the previous Government’s economic
policy. One of the effects of there being no money—he was
exactly right and honest in telling his successor that—is that
the current Government must be as prudent as possible in their running
of the nation’s finances.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000123">&#160;</a>

not the intention of the new clause. I am not a parliamentary

that the measure applies to the several thousand people who were given

the retention of ID cards. She was clear that what the hon. Member for

would be of no relevance to her, because she had just renewed her
passport. In both principle and practice, the new clause would be
damaging, so I ask the Committee to reject

                           </strong> The new clause simply provides an option, which
is limited to 12 months, so it will not satisfy everybody. There are
people who have passports as well as identity cards, but the new clause
provides an option for those who do not. The Minister is concerned
about money—we are all concerned about money—but it is
mean-spirited not to give back £30 to those who paid for
something that they did not receive. For the financial

offer the Minister one more chance to commit the Government to looking
again at the new clause, which would provide a simple solution for the
relatively few people who will otherwise find that extra £77.50
difficult to find, whom my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West has
talked about. That would not even include all those who obtained an
identity card, because not all of them paid for it. The new clause
provides a reasonable option, and I will be disappointed if the
Minister recalcitrantly sticks to his argument. I do not see how the
new clause breaks the principle behind his desire to be the Minister
who abolishes identity cards and to be the poster boy for that issue.

the new clause addresses a fringe element of the scheme that the Bill

Department’s responsibility for ensuring the safety of the

scheme was carefully worked out by the Department for Transport and was
developed with airports, the air industry and other groups. All those
involved in the discussions are looking forward to seeing the result of
that pilot scheme, so that they may discover what benefits might accrue
in the areas of good practice, money saving and security improvement;
we have already heard from Manchester Airports Group some of the
benefits that it saw in the scheme’s early days. Frankly, it
seems crazy to throw out the baby with the bathwater by

new clause addresses the haste with which the Government are trying to
get rid of identity cards. Were they to take a measured approach, they
would allow the pilot scheme to finish. We recognise the coalition
Government’s position on identity cards—they could get
rid of the cards when the pilot scheme finishes—but they should
look at what lessons can be learned and whether there is any other way
in which they could introduce such measures. There will be challenges
if the Minister sticks to his guns on not allowing passports ever to
contain the holder’s fingerprints, but, nevertheless, that is an
important matter that needs to be looked

have been beneficial both financially and in aiding security. These are
early days, however, and it is a shame to get rid of identity cards
now. Money has already been spent on the scheme, so discontinuing it
would mean yet more money being wasted in the abolition of identity
cards. For the sake of a few more months, we might have seen real
benefits from the scheme. I urge the Minister to consider the new

am acutely aware of the difficulties faced by the aviation industry,
airports and the businesses housed in airports, and I want to highlight
some of the problems that ID cards were designed to
resolve—there is evidence that the pilot scheme was positive in
resolving such problems. The aviation industry has suffered
considerably of late with the bad winter snow, the rising cost of fuel,
the economic downturn, the British Airways strikes, and, most recently
and devastatingly, the volcanic ash. In particular, Newcastle
International airport suffered £1 million in direct losses due
to the volcanic ash, and that figure does not include the losses of
other industries and businesses that relied on the airport for their
income. On that basis, it made sense for the then Government to make an
effort to assist the aviation industry and airlines with at least one
aspect of their costs and time constraints through the ID card
system.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
trial scheme showed some positive results. The turnaround time for
staff recruitment—getting new members of staff on
board—went from four days to one. There was also an impressive
reduction in the bureaucracy and red tape that airlines and airports
have to go through, reducing the application form from eight pages to
two. The three-day process for visitors from other airports became a
same-day process for those with ID
cards.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000152">&#160;</a>

benefits of a successful ID card system for airports and the aviation
industry were clearly demonstrated in the short time that the pilot was
allowed to run. That is why I support the new clause. I accept that in
principle the ID card is not accepted by the Government, who want to
repeal the legislation, but I want to persuade them to allow the pilot
scheme to continue for at least

those people who wanted to progress, they had to go through the process
of obtaining airside security clearance again. That is costly to

Opposition accept that the Government want to get rid of ID cards, but
the new clause suggests that we let the trial run its course and allow
airports to continue to develop a better system. The airports have said
that they need another system, but that will not be in place tomorrow
or within a month of getting rid of ID cards. We must not get rid of
the cards with undue haste. Several sectors of the population found the
ID cards useful, one of them being airports with airside workers.
Rather than waste money, let us see the scheme through to the end and
see how it can be
developed.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000161">&#160;</a>

airport told us clearly that, while foreign nationals and other migrant
workers still have identity cards it is much easier to employ them,
rather than people who live near to the airport. That is particularly
true of Manchester airport. The community surrounding the airport is
not affluent and does not gain great benefit from it. Let us not put up

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to pick up on what my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney South and
Shoreditch intends with new clause 2. One of the by-products of the
development of the ID card system was that work that had to be
undertaken in relation to airports was undertaken at that
time. It may be that the Minister, for good reason, does not
want to accept new clause 2, but we would like to hear how seriously he
treats this problem. He has obviously looked at it in the context
of scrapping the Identity Cards Act 2006, so it would
be helpful to the Committee if he could describe how
he plans to take this piece of work forward. Obviously, the
security of the public at airports is core business for the Home
Office. We know that there was a programme of work in place. The risk
is that that will be scrapped and that the money spent will be lost if
there is no assessment in the valuation. A Government who talk about
effectiveness and value for money would not want to be found guilty of
wasting money in that way, so it would be really helpful to know
exactly what the Minister has in mind.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend suggested, the airlines are having a hard time at the moment.
Anyone who has used an airport recently will know about the delays and
problems that the public experience due to security anxiety. Anyone who
has any contact with people who work for airlines can relate the
difficulties that the airlines and airport operators have with regard
to security issues. Almost any person in the security business will say
that the biggest anxiety about security at airports is not actually the
public—it is people who appear to work at the airport. At
regular intervals, we have the benefit of the press showing us a
headline and photograph of someone who has managed to get airside or on
board an aircraft to show how easy it is. We all know that that is a
genuine problem. The difficulty for airports and airline staff is how
they manage, in a way that does not cost them excessively, to carry out
reasonable and proper security checks so that they are able to employ
staff in a reasonable period of time, rather than employing people who
cannot do their job because the security processes are not yet
completed.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
cannot say with certainty that the work the previous Government
undertook was absolutely going to resolve those problems, but it was a
serious and deliberate programme of work. It was well in train and
there are lessons that should be learned from it. It is not sensible to
scrap that work without any attempt to assess it, or any attempt to
tell us what will happen
subsequently.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000171">&#160;</a>

anyone out there saying that this Minister is lax about airport
security, do we? If he is going to scrap this scheme and has no

will be aware that the Home Office research, development and statistics
directorate published a baseline for the evaluation of airside
workers’ identity cards on the Home Office website in February
2010. The research was not taken forward because the Home Office knew
that a general election was coming and that one of the eventualities
was the one that has happened: a Government would be elected who would
not continue with the ID card scheme. The idea, implicit in several
speeches, that we are halfway through a research programme that is now
being junked, is not true. There is no research programme to junk. As
the Bill is about scrapping the ID card scheme it would be a complete
waste of taxpayers’ money to carry out an evaluation on a
project that will not be
implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000175">&#160;</a>

is already plan A in every airport in the country, which is to ensure
that airside workers have their identity properly secured. It would be
extraordinary if that were not already the case. I hold many things
against the previous Government, but not the thought that they treated
airport security in a lax way. They were perfectly serious about that,
as any responsible Government would have been, given the current state
of terrorism in the world. I do not suggest that airport security was
in any way lax in the many dozens of airports other than Manchester and
London City, where the ID card pilot was

was about to make in response to the hon. Members for Birmingham, Selly
Oak, for Newcastle upon Tyne North, and for Houghton and Sunderland
South. We had an extremely good evidence session on airport security
with someone who runs an airport. He made several interesting points,
one of which was made in response to a question asked by my hon. Friend
the Member for Amber Valley, who is interested in an airport in his
constituency and worried about its security. Mr Fazackerley happily
reassured him that security at East Midlands airport is as strong as it
is at Manchester airport. His actual answer was, “Yes, of
course.” I can therefore put to rest the worries of the hon.
Members for Birmingham, Selly Oak, and for Hackney South and
Shoreditch. Do not forget that the Manchester Airports Group owns a
number of airports throughout the country, some of which had the ID
card pilot scheme, some of which did not. Those who run our airports
reassured us that security at those airports that did not have the
scheme was every bit as good as at those that
did.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000186">&#160;</a>

simply security and whether the airport is more secure? The level of

outlined. Perhaps it would be worth £5,000 to the aviation

                           </strong> That is a good point that starkly highlights the
airport security aspect. It is compulsory, with or without a voluntary
ID card scheme, for workers who go airside at airports to have some
kind of secure identity. In direct response to the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Selly Oak, of course all airports have that kind of
security, because they more than anyone want to ensure that the
passengers using them are secure. A voluntary ID card scheme added
absolutely nothing to the security of
airports.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000191">&#160;</a>

well. It has indeed probed the issue of airport security. All
those who heard Mr Fazackerley’s evidence will now be
reassured that the ID card scheme offers no addition to airport
security, and that it is therefore sensible for the Government not only
to scrap it, but to not delay doing so in the interests of an
assessment exercise on the effect that the scheme might have had. The
effect that it might have had was zero, so I recommend that the
Committee rejects the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000192">&#160;</a>

We are talking about a pilot scheme that looked at the potential
benefits of using a secure initial form of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 128<a class="bkMark" name="Column128">&#160;</a>
                           </div>identity check that was Government-backed—gold-plated, as it
were—to deal with a number of issues at airports, of which
security was a major part. For example, the scheme could improve
pre-employment and security checks by making them quicker and cheaper.
Some airports said that they were spending up to £160 on the
identity part of a security check. The approach taken in the pilot
meant that it was a lot cheaper.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There was a
holy grail among airports and air industries of having portable passes,
so that an individual who needed to work in several airports did not
need several different airport passes, or could at least get those
passes more quickly if they had first gone through a secure identity
check—for the ID card, in this case. Those individuals could
include pilots, who often have to relocate to different airports due to
fog, or the engineer who was the only person in an airline company able
to deal with a particular maintenance task arising in different
airports.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000194">&#160;</a>

covered for Manchester and London City airports. There is
self-evidently the £30. Can the former Minister explain how much
cost there was to the Government per ID card issued? It was clearly way
more than £30.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is for the Government to provide those
figures. We did hear some evidence from Mr Fazackerley on
that point. The money went in from Government because sometimes
Government need to lead from the front, rather than wait and negotiate
slowly to get everyone to implement. This was at a time when there was
an oil crisis and other issues—raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North—such as challenges to
airports, airlines and air industries. Another benefit, in addition to
security, was the cost and efficiency savings to air
industries—everything from retailers through to airports and
airlines that needed to employ people airside at an airport.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We recognise
where the Government are coming from on ID cards, but the pilot had
begun. Why not let it continue, see whether it provides lessons that
could be applied in other ways, with or without ID cards, and see what
the benefits of that security check might be and whether they could
continue?<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other
benefits included faster Criminal Records Bureau checks, which were
speeded up. I will not repeat the evidence given by Mr Fazackerley, but
he talked about reduction in bureaucracy and the fact that processing
could be reduced from four days to one. There was also some indication
that the application form shrank from eight pages to two. As all
Governments say that they want to get rid of red tape, I would have
thought such benefits could be learned from. Even if identity cards are
to be abolished, which is the Government’s intent, there may be
other ways of bringing on board those benefits, potentially through the
passport. However, even Mr Fazackerley would agree that he is not an
expert on what the passport could do, particularly without
fingerprints. However, we know that the identity card involved a more
secure identity check than passports did, and that was one of the
points of the card.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Even without
that, practical benefits for airlines, airports and airside industries
could be accrued if the Minister were willing to extend the pilot long
enough to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 129<a class="bkMark" name="Column129">&#160;</a>
                           </div>learn the lessons. We are not talking about acres of research; we are,
as the Minister revealed, talking about £5,000 to continue the
process. Compared with the cost of setting it up, that is small fry, as
the hon. Member for Hexham rightly highlighted. That is a very small
amount for the Government to commit to looking at what could be huge
cost and efficiency savings for business, at a time when I would have
thought that the Government, as well as the Opposition, would want to
support business. We are looking at a practical element here.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Mr
Fazackerley touched on the subject of passports. A passport validation
service already exists, but that system is not as secure as an ID card
and requires a slow manual check. In time there could have been
automatic checks, but I am not going to rehearse the arguments for ID
cards. I am saying that we should look at the issues around security,
delays in checks, and benefits to employees and employers, and make
sure that we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater. It would
take very little movement from the Government to acknowledge that there
could be lessons learned. If the Government chose to, they could apply
those lessons to another identity document, possibly the passport, or
just use them to streamline processes at airports. They could share the
information with other airports and perhaps other industries, such as
the nuclear industry, where such protection is vital and speed of
checking is important. There were many potential benefits, yet we will
now see none of them—all for the sake of £5,000. The
Minister wants to get rid of ID cards, but I beg him to use this
opportunity to make a clear statement that he will at least allow the
assessment to continue long enough to ensure that we can see the
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000200">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
important aspect of identity cards would have been lost on many members
of the public, but it was important to those immediately affected. It
relates to identity documents for transgender individuals, who face
many challenges as they go through that difficult process. I am
delighted that the Minister for Equalities is serving on the Committee,
but I am disappointed that this matter was not mentioned in the impact
assessment. An identity card was the only document that could be given
to someone in an acquired identity without a gender recognition
certificate as well as a certificate of their birth
identity.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
process of transgendering is not a subject that needs to detain the
Committee at great length, but the introduction under legislation
passed in 2004 of a gender recognition certificate was a major step
forward. It allowed someone who had acquired a new gender to have an
identity document in their acquired gender. That was fine for those who
had gone all the way through the process, such as those who had had
surgery and others who had lived for a time in their acquired gender.
However, the process takes some time and it can be distressing for
people to travel on one identity document while looking very much like
their new acquired gender and having a new identity in that
gender.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the 2006 Act, identity cards allowed people to travel and use an
identity document in their acquired gender—in the gender that
they were living in at the time. It made the transition process much
less painful, more manageable and much more fair. I hope that the
Government recognise that as an important step. They have made
commitments to support members of the transgender community. This is
their first test, yet they are repealing the 2006 Act and the option
for people to have the two documents. They will be restricting their
ability to carry out their day-to-day life with the ease that identity
cards would have allowed. A small number of people will be affected,
but I hope the Government acknowledge that fact, and I ask them to tell
us what proposals are in place to support people going through the
process of changing their gender and to ensure that they are not
disadvantaged by this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000226">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to add a little to what my hon. Friend the
Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch has said about the journey that
people go on. Changing gender is not something that just happens.
People have to go on a journey and it can take many years. For the vast
majority of people it will take at least two years before they reach a
position of saying, “Yes, I wish to live as another
person” and before they can undergo surgery. Of course, in the
end many people do not undergo surgery because it can be dangerous,
painful or not a
success.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to say a little about my friend, whom I will call Jane. My friend
Jane is still working as John in what is a male-dominated industry, and
has been for a long time. She is usually Jane at home, although with
some of her family she is not yet Jane—her elderly parents are
finding it difficult to accept. Because of such different situations,
she has to live her life with two genders. That is hard enough to
imagine—one cannot even say, “Right, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 131<a class="bkMark" name="Column131">&#160;</a>
                           </div>I am going to have that transition”—but let us also try to
imagine Jane’s embarrassment in other ways. What does she do
when she wants to book a hotel room or a flight? How does she do that?
Identity cards have allowed her to say, “Okay, I will go on
holiday because then I am able to live as Jane, but at work I need to
continue as John.” Jane’s story is not
unusual.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said earlier, the transgender process is a journey prior to receiving
a gender recognition certificate. If a person does not undergo surgery,
they can of course still achieve a certificate, but it takes
considerably longer. What we are saying is that their passports will
still be in the name of the opposite gender until they have reached the
end of that journey. Identity cards were a liberating thing for
transgender people. Transgender organisations that made contact said,
“That has been forgotten in terms of the equality agenda. Yes,
we are a small group, but identity cards made a huge difference to our
lives.” We therefore ask the Government to consider this issue
and see whether there might be a
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000229">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As hon. Members may have observed, I am keen on
finding evidence, and we have a number of transgender people in my
Cambridge constituency. Indeed, we had the first transgender mayor in
the country—a good friend of mine and a ward colleague. My
immediate reaction was to talk to them and find out their response. It
was very interesting, and contrary to what the hon. Member for Bolton
West just said.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clear
steer from members of the transgender community in Cambridge was to
oppose the amendment. Under the amendment, the only valid ID cards
would be for transgender people, so if someone presents an ID card it
is not a valid card unless they are transgender. I am sure that that is
not what is intended, but that would be the impact of the amendment,
and the people I consulted were very concerned about it. As I am sure
the hon. Lady will be aware, inadvertent or deliberate outing is a real
concern to many people in that community, and they felt that it would
make it easier rather than harder for them to be outed.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
transgender community also commented that the passport system works
quite well at present. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will
talk briefly about what flexibility there might be, but according to
one transgender constituent the Passport and Records Agency and the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency accept a doctor’s note
confirming that the person is undergoing gender transition and the
transition is intended to be permanent, which allows for a graduated
process. In her particular case, in 2005 it took five days to get a new
passport, so the system does
work.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000232">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I respect the point of view. However, although it
is true that a transgender person can get a passport in the required
gender, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West has highlighted
with a particular case—and there are many others—not
everyone lives solely in one gender, and the benefit of ID cards was
the entitlement to two, one of which was travel-enabled, which meant
that an individual could live in whichever gender they were using at
that particular
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000233">&#160;</a>

moment. They did not want to see such a solution. I accept that it may

doable.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000234">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
are a number of different circumstances: there are people who are
neutrois and inter-sex people—there is a complicated collection.
The simple solution to many of these circumstances is just not to have
gender information on any of these identity documents. The people I
spoke to would push for that very strongly. They are concerned about a
repeat of what happened in Trafalgar square at Pride 2008 when there
were inappropriate demands for gender recognition certificates. Hon.
Members will know some of the history of that.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There does
not seem to be a need for identity documents of any kind to have gender
information. It is not a very good biometric; it is roughly a 50:50
split. Military ID, such as the MOD90, which obviously can have quite a
high security clearance, contains no gender information. That might be
what we should look at. It is certainly what some of the people I spoke
to were keen on.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000236">&#160;</a>

them.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000237">&#160;</a>

agree with the hon. Member for Bolton West. Transgender people are on a
journey, and they can be anywhere on that journey at any point. I hope
she agrees with me that it was a great shame that in the Equality Act
2010 the previous Government did not accept my suggestion that the term
“gender reassignment”, which is rather far along that
spectrum, be changed to “gender identity”, which might
cover anyone on that
spectrum.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000238">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch has spoken about having
two ID cards, but the new clause would not do what she wants. As I
understand it, the purpose of the new clause is to provide that the
Secretary of State cannot cancel an ID card until a transgender person
in the assigned gender—the gender of choice—can apply for
an identity document in that assigned gender. I can confirm, as the
hon. Lady confirmed in her speech, that the Identity and Passport
Service currently has a policy of issuing a passport in the acquired
gender to a transgender person who is able to provide the necessary
medical evidence. So this clause would have no practical effect except
for requiring the Secretary of State to lay an unnecessary report
before both Houses of Parliament. I am sure that is not what the hon.
Lady intended, but that would be the effect of the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000239">&#160;</a>

passport policy permits someone who experiences gender dysphoria to

evidence. A gender recognition certificate is not required. Obtaining a
passport in an acquired gender is a key facilitator in obtaining the
evidence necessary to demonstrate to the gender recognition panel that
a person has lived their life in an acquired gender. It enables them to
change their identity on utility bills, at work and in a variety of
other circumstances. An application for a passport in an acquired
gender is also an indicator used by the gender recognition panel
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000240">&#160;</a>

recognition of their acquired gender. Approximately 1,000 people per
year apply for a change of gender in their passport, although that

to the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge, it is
extremely instructive that transgender people would find this new

that the previous Government had introduced a policy that would have
allowed a transgender person who was in the process of changing gender
to hold and use two ID cards—that is the point that the hon.
Lady raised, but not the one included in the new clause. She deserves
credit for the enlightened approach adopted on transgender people in
that area, and for me, as Equalities Minister, it is something of an
open door. She will also be aware that the policy was not extended to
passports. I should make it clear that as a passport is primarily a
travel document, the current policy is that a person can hold a
passport in one gender only. The principle behind the Bill is that ID
cards are not the answer, and it follows logically that passports
are.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000247">&#160;</a>

scheme was not long-running and was available in only a few areas of
the country, that is not surprising. I have no evidence that the
Government have acknowledged, as my hon. Friend has once again reminded
the Committee, the impact on the group in the impact assessment. There
appears, if I take silence as a no, to have been no consultation with

“people to whom she has spoken” is not the same as a
formal Government consultation. I remind the hon. Lady that she is now
a Minister of Her Majesty’s Government, and consultation has a
proper process, which means writing to certain groups. If she cannot
tell me now, will she write to me with a list of the groups that she or
her senior Minister wrote to about the Bill to gauge opinion? It is
important that before an Act of Parliament is laid, there is assessment
of the full impact. Clearly, that assessment was not properly done
because it was not mentioned in the impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000255">&#160;</a>

point about passports being primarily a travel document is valid, which
was why two identity cards would have been produced: one as a travel
document, and the other a non-travel version. It would be good to know
whether there was a proposal to produce a non-travel version of the
passport, which seems a bit odd as it is self-contradictory. I am not
sure that there is an easy alternative.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000256">&#160;</a>

I am slightly alarmed, but it shows the benefit of Opposition. I am
heartened that she will continue to look at this matter and would like
to know whether she will report any progress to Parliament. No doubt we
will have the opportunity to raise the issue—she is twin-hatted
at Question Time—but I hope she will be proactive in letting the
Opposition know what is happening. We have a shared agenda
here—we all want to ensure that the right support is available

                           </strong> I, too, thank all involved in ensuring that
democracy takes place and that the Committee has run smoothly. Thank
you, Mr Caton and Mr Streeter, for your chairmanship. Democracy may run
smoothly, but we may not always agree with its outcome. I would just
like to say a word about lost opportunities.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have now
removed, if the Bill becomes an Act, fingerprints from the lexicon of
identity documents and identity security, and that is a missed
opportunity. I wish to put on the record that the Opposition will look
to pursue what we do about security of identity documents when we are,
one day, again in Government, which may be sooner than the Minister
hopes. We will look closely to ensure that the safety of the British
public is paramount and that passports are a secure—not just
now, but in the future—and convenient document. We will continue
to probe the Minister further.<a class="bkMark" name="10070632000269">&#160;</a>

during the Committee and look forward to engaging with him further on
