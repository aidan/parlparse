8 stand
part.</div><a name="08112036000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
point out to hon. Members the fact that this group now includes a
number of amendments that were starred at the previous sitting of the
Committee. I call Jonathan Djanogly, if he has recovered his
breath.</div><a name="08112036000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112036000264"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Thank you, Sir
Nicholas, and the answer to that is &#147;barely&#148;. I apologise
for my
lateness.</div><a name="08112036000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8 is entirely unacceptable in almost every respect. It is an example of
needless, ill thought through provisions at their worst. Given the
varied issues covered by the clause, we were surprised at the lump
grouping of amendments. Furthermore, given that significant issues go
not only to the context of the clause, but to the sense of the clause
itself, we did not expect the stand part debate to be included in the
grouping. That has not made it easy to discuss the clause in a coherent
fashion.</div><a name="08112036000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000265"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman should not question
the decisions of the
Chair.</div><a name="08112036000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000266"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I would never think of questioning the decisions
of the Chair, Sir Nicholas. I was just saying that, from our point of
view, the grouping of amendments has made it difficult to debate the
clause.</div>
<a name="08112036000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than
debate the amendments in the group by issue, it would be more sensible
to take them in order of tabling, which is Labour Back-Bench
amendments, Government amendments, our amendments and then 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>the stand part debate. I come first to those amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) and
supported by Labour Back-Bench Members. They have made a valiant effort
to put some order into what we see as the dog&#146;s breakfast that
the clause represents. The fact that they were tabled early effectively
said to the Minister, &#147;Please can you get your act in order on
the clause?&#148; However, they are not good enough and would not go
far enough, and we remain to be convinced of why the clause needs to be
retained.</div><a name="08112036000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now rebut the Labour Back-Bench amendments. Clause 8 creates a
new responsibility for donors to political parties to clarify the
source of donations. Donors giving more than &#163;200 will be
required to make a declaration whether another person is providing them
with money or benefits worth more than &#163;200. Amendment No. 3 and
others would increase the donation that triggered the reporting
requirements under the clause to various amounts between &#163;1,000
and &#163;5,000. If we agreed with the clause&#151;I have just said
that we do not&#151;we would agree in principle with the need to
increase the trigger thresholds to avoid unnecessary administrative
burdens being laid at the feet of donors and local party volunteers
alike.</div><a name="08112036000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
my estimation, setting the threshold at &#163;200 would result in
about 100,000 declarations being handled each year by the Conservative
party alone. That would be a huge increase in the work load of many
local party officers&#151;and a fairly pointless one at that. I doubt
whether the systems or, indeed, the manpower are in place to cope with
such an
increase.</div><a name="08112036000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112036000267"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): Will my hon. Friend
make it clear that many of those people are not paid, but are
volunteers?</div><a name="08112036000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000268"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point to which
I shall certainly
return.</div><a name="08112036000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, the Secretary of State noted that the Government had
received representations from all the main parties and many of the
small ones advocating an increase in the limits, and they said that
they would be willing to consider them in detail. We now have the
Government&#146;s proposals to increase the limit to the relevant
reporting threshold for the declaration, saying that it will be
&#163;5,000 or &#163;1,000. The most recent missive from the
Electoral Commission, issued yesterday in response, states:</div>
<a name="08112036000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
changes should reduce the administrative burdens of the new declaration
requirement, while introducing a new procedural reminder of the rules
on agency in respect of reportable donations. The Commission welcomes
the decision to set the declaration threshold at the same level as the
existing donation reporting limits rather than introducing a general
&#163;1,000 threshold, which would have created a new regulatory
threshold for those parties without accounting
units.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
move on to Government amendments Nos. 153 to 170, the Government have
clearly admitted that they see a good deal of deficiency in the clause.
As the Minister said, the amendments will have twofold effect. First,
they will do away with the previous threshold for declaration of
&#163;200 and replace it with two different
thresholds&#151;&#163;5,000 for donations made nationally and
&#163;1,000 for donations made locally. Secondly, they will remove
the requirement on parties to take all reasonable steps to verify the
veracity of the declaration. While the amendments are welcome, we think
they are too little, too late.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div><a name="08112036000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 158, 163 and 167 will remove the need for anti-money
laundering-style verification processes. The amendments, which have the
support of the Electoral Commission, will go some way towards relieving
the huge administrative strain that would have burdened local party
offices. We were in real danger of exposing the volunteers in those
offices to a crushing administrative load. Mr. McIsaac, the
Conservative treasurer, noted in evidence to the Committee the scale of
the potential
problem:</div><a name="08112036000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
can see the pattern. There is the whole verification area, the
judgmentalism and the lack of staff. A large investment bank that I
dealt with in professional practice had more than 1,000 people in
compliance and legal&#151;not risk. I think of the Conservatives, and
we have a handful.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i><i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Official
Report, Political Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>6
November 2008; c. 80,
Q20.<i class="I">]</i></div><a name="08112036000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
anti-money laundering-style language was dangerous and the
consequential regulatory burden that would be imposed could have
devastated parties at local level. Basically, verification would have
involved something that textbooks have been written on in the context
of other areas such as money laundering. Although we welcome the
Government&#146;s reassessment of the provisions, we are still
cautious about their impact. Placing disclosure requirements on donors
must be carefully thought through so that we do not push people away
from donating to political parties for fear of breaching these complex
and, at times, opaque
rules.</div><a name="08112036000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions, while doing away with the need for parties to verify
donations, still impose significant burdens on donors in the
declaration process, and there is real need for clarity. The increased
threshold limits mirror those in the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 on the reporting of accounts to the commission.
These limits will be applied by Government amendments Nos. 153, and
those following, to the thresholds for donors making declarations.
Given the possible deterrent effect that the declaration requirements
may have, we would like to see these thresholds much increased. The
Government have taken a step in the right direction, but we feel that
they must go much further. From our point of view, this is unfinished
business.</div><a name="08112036000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are pleased to be holding a debate today on our amendments, because
when we last met they were starred due to the little time we had for
tabling them. Amendments Nos. 179 to 181 would insert a test of
reasonableness into clause 8. Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 would insert
into proposed new section 54A(3) of PPERA a reasonableness test for the
opinion of the person making the donation, as required by proposed new
section 54A(2). Given the possible sanctions that attach to
the declarations that must be made&#151;a possible unlimited fine or
one year of imprisonment&#151;we do not think it fair to place too
low a threshold on the opinion that must be held.</div>
<a name="08112036000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout,
the rationale behind our amendments has been the need for
proportionality and striking an appropriate balance between the
competing interests at stake. Here, too, we feel that a mere opinion
may not be satisfactory. There should be reasonable grounds for holding
such an opinion. The complexity of the provisions of proposed new
section 54A and the fact that a lay person potentially unsure of what
they are being asked to do might land themselves in hot water as a
result of giving a declaration on something with which they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>unfamiliar or unsure represent a potentially dangerous situation. By
imposing a test of reasonableness, we would allow for the basis of the
opinion to be tested objectively by an external party or a court of
law. That in turn would add to the process a potential judicial
safeguard that would otherwise not exist if an opinion could be held
subjectively.</div><a name="08112036000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 181 would apply the same test of objectivity to proposed new
paragraph 1A(1) of schedule 6 to PPERA. In similar vein to
the reasoning just  described, we should apply the same test of
reasonableness to the requirement to produce a quarterly or weekly
report and the requirement to say in it whether the details given in a
donor declaration
are</div><a name="08112036000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;suspected
to be untruthful or
inaccurate&#148;.</div><a name="08112036000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Otherwise,
we would have no solid foundation on which to impose any liability for
a breach of the provisions. The reporting person or persons would, in
effect, be expected to second-guess what the commission viewed as
suspicious or
not.</div><a name="08112036000235"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08112036000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 185, 186, 200, 190 to 192 and 195 to 197 are consequential on
amendments Nos. 179 and 180, in that they would apply to each of the
donor types set out in schedule 3 of the Bill the same reasonableness
test proposed in relation to proposed new section 54A(3) of
PPERA.</div><a name="08112036000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 185, 186 and 200 would apply a test of reasonableness to the
opinions expressed by individuals and members&#146; associations in
declarations made pursuant to proposed new paragraphs 6A(1) and (3) of
amended schedule 7 to PPERA, in respect of declarations by the donor
and an individual acting on behalf of a donor respectively. Likewise,
amendments Nos. 190 to 192 would apply the same test to the
declarations to be given by a third party, pursuant to proposed new
paragraphs 6A(1) and (3) of amended schedule 11 to PPERA, in respect of
declarations by the donor and an individual acting on behalf of a donor
respectively.</div><a name="08112036000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 195 to 197 would apply the same test to declarations to be given
by permitted participants, pursuant to proposed new paragraphs 6A(1)
and (3) of amended schedule 15 to PPERA, as applies to declarations by
the donor and an individual acting on behalf of a donor
respectively.</div><a name="08112036000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the sake of brevity, I will not rerun in respect of each amendment my
arguments on the need for a test of reasonableness and an objective
yardstick, save to say that without the amendments we would make the
job of donors, party officials, the Electoral Commission and, as a last
resort, the courts, that much
harder.</div><a name="08112036000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 189 relates to paragraph 3(6) of schedule 3 to the Bill, which
amends paragraph 11 of schedule 7 to PPERA. It would again insert a
reasonableness requirement on the appearance of the ultimate donor. As
with the other amendments, it would clarify the
process.</div><a name="08112036000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 188, 194 and 198 would insert new provisions into each new
paragraph 6A to be inserted into schedules 7, 11 and 15 to PPERA, which
apply the requirements for declarations on the source of donations to
individuals and members&#146; associations, third parties and
permitted participants respectively.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div><a name="08112036000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
new provisions require the commission to publish guidance notes on the
requirements of clause 8 and schedule 3, which must be attached to any
declaration to be completed by a donor. As a minimum, such guidance
will give examples to assist in understanding how benefits are valued
and in completing declarations, and will give details of the penalties
for non-compliance with time periods and for knowingly or recklessly
making a false declaration, as well as the appropriate details on when
time limits for the submission of declarations commence and
end.</div><a name="08112036000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the complexity of the new provisions, it is hoped that such guidance
notes will provide valuable assistance to those making declarations,
and allow them to do so in a compliant fashion, thereby reducing the
need for the commission to investigate and possibly penalise
individuals or groups for non-compliance. As with many of our
amendments, our aim here is clarity and ease of
understanding.</div><a name="08112036000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must aim, as legislators, to provide clear signposts and assistance
when compliance issues may involve significant penalties. That is
particularly important in this Bill, given that it is to be interpreted
by individuals who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight
said, volunteer their time out of a sense of civic duty, and who more
often than not will have no legal background or teams of assistants to
aid them in understanding these complex provisions. Therefore, we, as
legislators, and the commission, should do our utmost to guide them
through the tangled web of the
Bill.</div><a name="08112036000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would hope that, in the interests of having a workable system for the
regulation of party funding, the commission will do its best to produce
such guidance in a timely
fashion.</div><a name="08112036000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to the stand part debate, the clause is poorly drafted, poorly
researched and almost entirely negative. To our mind, it stands out in
the legislation like a sore pimple. I am afraid that if the
Minister thinks that he can table a few
amendments and then get away with the clause, he will have
to think again. That is why I now wish to discuss the more
substantive stand part
issues.</div><a name="08112036000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
impact of the clause will still be widespread and costly&#151;even if
not as much as beforehand, following the introduction of the Government
amendments&#151;in time and money for parties at the local level,
where such burdens are most heavily felt. Political parties need
sufficient funds to fulfil their democratic functions. There is,
however, a paradox at the heart of party politics in the UK: while on
the one hand there is recognition that political parties are key in
mobilising local political activity and are a central vehicle in
promoting civic engagement, on the other, membership of political
parties, election turnout, and trust and confidence in politicians are
at an all-time low. That has major implications for the financial
management of political
parties.</div><a name="08112036000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Modern
centralised campaigns have resulted in escalating campaign costs, while
at the same time the financial impact of the decline in party
membership has resulted in increasing reliance on large donations and
loans to fund political parties&#151;a situation that appears to have
eroded public confidence still
further.</div><a name="08112036000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2006 Constitutional Affairs Committee report on party funding
states:</div>
<a name="08112036000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
New Policy Network warned that without an accepted system of adequate
funding for political parties &#145;we risk the health of our
democratic system&#146;&#148;.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div><a name="08112036000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The traditional practice
of secrecy surrounding the source and amount of donations received has
been one of the causes of increasing disquiet about party funding. On
the back of that, the Labour party 1987 election manifesto included a
commitment to require parties to declare the sources of their donations
and to ban foreign donations. That commitment manifested itself in the
Committee on Standards in Public Life inquiry entitled &#147;The
Funding of Political Parties in the United Kingdom&#148;, under the
chairmanship of Lord Neill. The Neill report was published
in October 1998 and it suggested a greater transparency of
donations, among several other
things.</div><a name="08112036000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Home Office submission to the committee dated 6 March 1998, the
Government had sought the committee&#146;s advice on specific topics,
including:</div><a name="08112036000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
should be the mechanics for disclosure of donations? Should there be a
separate threshold for the acceptance or rejection
of anonymous donations? What should be the timing of
disclosure?&#148;</div><a name="08112036000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
were already statutory requirements on trade unions and companies with
regard to the disclosure of information on political donations,
although some had argued that those rules did not go far enough.
Despite all the evidence of submissions made to it, the Neill committee
did not uncover any wrongdoing. It did, however, acknowledge the
potential for speculation and rumour about improper motives and tacit
obligations where details of donors are unknown.</div>
<a name="08112036000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advantages of greater transparency are summarised by the Neill
committee and apply as much to this debate as they did eight years ago.
The main drive of these arguments is that greater transparency provides
the opportunity for public and media scrutiny, which makes the system
less opaque and means that not only do rumour and suspicion wither, but
public confidence in the system is increased. Further, there was no
evidence that donations have been used to influence Ministers or
policy, where such sums would be recorded on a publicly accessible
register.</div>
<a name="08112036000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
reverse, the principal arguments against disclosure and transparency
centre around an individual&#146;s right to privacy. The Neill
committee report cited various issues in this context. Its conclusions,
while recognising the strength of the arguments in favour of privacy,
advocated a disclosure regime on the grounds that there was a public
interest in knowing when a donation is made to a political
party,</div>
<a name="08112036000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which is
significant enough to prompt questions or to raise suspicion about its
purpose&#148;.</div><a name="08112036000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the back of this, the committee made two recommendations, which formed
much of the basis for the disclosure requirements in PPERA. First, it
said that opinion will differ on what constitutes a significant
donation, but it recommended disclosure of donations to national party
organisations of &#163;5,000 or more per annum from one source, as
supported by the two main parties and others. Secondly, it recommended
that donations to constituency associations or regional organisations
from one source, which total &#163;1,000 or more per annum, should
also be publicly disclosed.</div>
<a name="08112036000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course
this is important in the context of this debate because these figures
were issued in 1998 and yet even the Government, in their revised
position in their amendments, use the figures from 10 years ago.
However, despite this emphasis on disclosure when it came to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>subject of where responsibility for making the disclosure should lie,
the Neill committee felt that it was &#147;wholly
unreasonable&#148; to place the obligation on the donor. A decade
later, here we are doing exactly that. The Minister has yet to make the
case for this change of approach. I hope that he will do so in his
later
remarks.</div><a name="08112036000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Neill committee concluded that the obligation should rest with the
political party&#146;s central office not only to report on donations
received by the national party, but to ensure that the party&#146;s
organisational structure was adequately set up to deal with all
disclosable donations received by sub-units of the party. It would be
up to each party to ensure that each sub-unit supplied the required
information to a designated officer at the central office. Only
donations to candidates or election agents would be an
individual&#146;s
responsibility.</div><a name="08112036000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government agreed with the general approach of the Neill committee and
enshrined the main elements of the proposed reporting regime
in part IV, chapter III of PPERA. Under this, the treasurer of a
registered political party is required to make a quarterly donations
report to the Electoral Commission, recording any donations of
&#163;5,000 or more to the national party, or &#163;1,000 or more
to local associations or regional organisations, which are called
accounting units of a national party. To ensure that multiple donations
from the same source are properly accounted for, the party must also
record any further donations of &#163;1,000 or more from a source
already recorded during the same reporting year.</div>
<a name="08112036000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In PPERA, all
donations must be from named permissible donors who are defined as an
individual on the electoral register, or a company that is registered
under the Companies Act 1985 or incorporated in the UK. All such
companies must carry on business in the UK. Other legitimate donors,
with various caveats, are trade unions, building societies, limited
liability partnerships, friendly societies and various other
unincorporated associations. PPERA requires registered political
parties to submit an annual statement of accounts to the Electoral
Commission, by a particular date and in a specified format.</div>
<a name="08112036000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
under PPERA, donations to parties in excess of &#163;5,000 nationally
or &#163;1,000 locally must be publicly declared with the details of
the donor and the amount. That includes donations in kind as well as
cash donations. Contributions may only be from permissible donors;
foreign donations are banned and anonymous gifts in excess of
&#163;200 are also prohibited.</div>
<a name="08112036000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part IV of
PPERA is concerned with the control of donations to registered parties.
It imposes restrictions on the sources of donations, so as to prohibit
foreign and anonymous donations to political parties and make
registered parties subject to reporting requirements in respect of
donations above a certain value. Section 50 of PPERA defines a
&#147;donation&#148; as</div>
<a name="08112036000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
gift...any sponsorship provided in relation to the
party...any subscription or other fee paid for affiliation to, or
membership of, the
party&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08112036000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">or&#151;</div><a name="08112036000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
money spent...in paying expenses incurred directly or indirectly
by the party&#148;.</div>
<a name="08112036000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 52
goes on to specify certain payments that are not to be regarded as
donations, while section 53 sets out how the value of donations in
kind, such as property, is to be calculated. Further, section 54
specifies who or what is to be considered a permissible donor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>and the list is comprehensive, sections 55 and 56 deal with the
acceptance or return of donations that fall foul of those sections, and
section 61 specifies offences regarding evasion of restrictions on
donations.</div><a name="08112036000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions relating to the reporting requirements placed on political
parties are no less extensive. Section 62 and schedule 6 require the
treasurer of a registered party to make quarterly donation reports to
the Electoral Commission and the details to be included in such
reports. Sections 65 and 66 give further details on the process to be
followed when submitting a report to the commission and the details to
be set out in each submission, including the need for a declaration by
the treasurer that he has recorded all known
donations.</div><a name="08112036000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
scene setting gives some idea of the provenance of the clause. In its
short history, it has not been without its problems. The Constitutional
Affairs Committee, in its 2006-07 report, expressed significant
concerns about the disclosure system under PPERA. It
said:</div><a name="08112036000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that there are problems, both actual and perceived, with the
current arrangements for party funding in the UK...While the PPERA
2000 introduced closer regulation and some improved transparency, it
has not finally resolved problems with the system; if anything
increased transparency, by revealing the extent of and dependency on
donations from a few rich individuals, corporations and trade unions,
has increased the negative impact on public
confidence.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must be careful that we do not paint ourselves into a corner with this
new provision and rather than increasing public confidence, engineer
the reverse effect. That point was picked up on by the Constitutional
Affairs Committee, which
said:</div><a name="08112036000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
we endorse a transparent system, transparency does not solve problems,
but draws attention to them. It also invites &#145;sniping&#146;
between opponents. It must be based on readily identifiable risks so
that audit functions have a clear overall
purpose.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
an evidence session, the Secretary of State
said:</div><a name="08112036000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;By
way of background, there is a consensus that there has to be greater
transparency; that was the whole purpose of the 2000 Act. As
far as I can see, no one is arguing on the issue of
transparency.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

2008; c. 14,
Q27.]</div><a name="08112036000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
true, but, that statement implies that the clause is about
transparency, which, given its non-public procedures, is simply not the
case. More specifically, I cannot see how it will deal with
identifiable risks that would give it the clear purpose demanded by the
Constitutional Affairs Committee. Perhaps too, we should be mindful of
the comments in the evidence session last week of the Conservative
party&#146;s Mr. McIsaac, who
said:</div><a name="08112036000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have noticed that innocent mistakes have a habit of being magnified in
the press, on the blogs and the rest of it, as if they were some sort
of scandal. People make mistakes, even in the best regulated
organisations. To open up the possibility of mistakes, and thereby the
whiff of scandal, could be very
counter-productive.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

2008; c. 91,
Q47.]</div><a name="08112036000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
then do we have in clause 8? How does it attempt to remedy the problems
faced by political parties in raising finances in an open and
transparent manner, against a background of growing public scepticism
at donations to parties? The clause amends section 54 of
PPERA&#151;the clause dealing with who is considered as a permissible
donor. It inserts a new subsection that requires a party to have a
declaration from a donor where the party wishes to accept any donation.
We have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>been debating what the level of that donation should be. It creates a
new responsibility for donors&#151;not political parties&#151;to
clarify the source of
donations.</div>
<a name="08112036000236"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30am</div><a name="08112036000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall,
the Government have started to make some sense of the clause with the
amendments that they have tabled, which do away with the provisions
requiring parties to take all reasonable steps to verify those
declarations. Bodies such as companies and associations that make
donations under the threshold will be expected to identify the
responsible person who will make a declaration. The Bill will insert a
subsection, as set out in proposed section 54A(5), making it a criminal
offence for a person knowingly or recklessly to make a false statement
about a donation, with a maximum penalty of one year&#146;s
imprisonment or a fine on indictment. I appreciate that certain hon.
Members will move an amendment on that aspect, so I shall not talk
about that here.</div>
<a name="08112036000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the Secretary of State summarised the effect of clause 8. In
his remarks, he noted:</div>
<a name="08112036000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
provisions supplement the existing requirements of the 2000 Act by
making it clear that the identities of the true donor, on whose behalf
the donation is made, must be given to the recipient of the donation.
If a donor declares that those sections of the 2000 Act do not apply,
they must explain why.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20
October 2008; Vol. 481, c. 51.]</div>
<a name="08112036000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We fear, though, that
in practice, it would be far from that simple for the receiving party
official or the donor. Under the clause, political parties and
regulated donees will be required to confirm that they have received
these declarations and retain them for the future review by the
commission. We remain concerned about the potential impact
of this if the clause were to come into force. We would like to see the
thresholds increased much further to ensure that these new reporting
burdens do not weigh too heavily on those concerned. We hope that the
Government will be reviewing these thresholds again.</div>
<a name="08112036000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assertion
of Mark Sweeney of the Ministry of Justice, in the first evidence
session before this Committee, has done little to soothe our concerns.
He
said:</div><a name="08112036000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
8 is not intended to add any additional requirements, in terms of who
may or may not donate, or the way in which they may do
so.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Political
Parties and Elections Public Bill Committee, </i>4 November 2008; c.
14, Q27.]</div><a name="08112036000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
simply turns the situation on its head by saying, &#147;Because there
is no substantive change to the law, there is no problem.&#148;
There, to us, speaks the bureaucrat who has not given thought to the
difficulty of the process in real life. We have concerns about the
practical applications in real life and we think that the Electoral
Commission is on our side. In its October briefing, it
said:</div><a name="08112036000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that the benefits of these changes will be quite limited, since
all they do is place additional procedural requirements on donors and
recipients. They will not extend the current restrictions on concealing
donations, nor will they add materially to the transparency of party
funding as the new declarations will not be sent to the Commission or
made public. However, they will impose potentially substantial new
regulatory burdens on parties and donors. It is not presently clear
whether the benefits of these provisions will be sufficient to justify
those new
burdens.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative party is concerned that this is a disproportionate and
excessive regulatory burden. Rather than helping parties broaden their
fundraising, clause 8 could put off donors and discourage volunteerism.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>Sections 54 and 61 of PPERA already prohibit donors from concealing the
source of donations by channelling money through others. The use of
proxy donations is also illegal. Moreover, if an unincorporated
association is used as an agency to channel a donation from a
particular donor, that original donor must be declared. I shall not
speak further on that aspect as I appreciate that we shall be debating
it on later amendments.</div>
<a name="08112036000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission, through its chief executive, Peter Wardle, has also backed
these concerns. As mentioned in the evidence session to the Committee,
his memorandum
states:</div><a name="08112036000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
the other hand, the changes will impose potentially substantial new
administrative burdens on parties and donors. Political parties have
expressed reservations to us about the impact of these compliance
requirements, particularly on their volunteer
officers.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
when pushed by the Minister some time later on
the benefits of the Bill, Peter Wardle
responded:</div><a name="08112036000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
terms of what is in the Bill, we are concerned that the potential
disbenefits in practical terms may outweigh the benefits; we are not

such a damning assessment by the commission, have the Government
reviewed this clause in light of what he said? If not, why not?

consultation process that was gone through to end up with what we see
as a pretty dreadful
clause?</div><a name="08112036000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
reiterate the concerns raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Horsham on Second Reading, and which remain despite the
Government&#146;s amendments, the compliance burden on a central
party and the registered treasurer will be considerable given the
number of transactions and accounting units involved, the lack of
professional staff in most accounting units, the small number of
compliance staff employed by the central party and the threat of the
new regulatory sanctions available to the Electoral Commission. On 29
October, my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester tabled a question for
the Secretary of State. In reference to the Bill, he asked</div>
<a name="08112036000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what the
evidential basis was for the estimate of five minutes processing time
per donation for the processing of a donation declaration; and what
estimate his Department has made of the average time taken to verify
the source of a
donation.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
6 November, the Minister replied:</div>
<a name="08112036000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
estimates in the impact assessment&#151;both for processing
declarations and carrying out further verification checks in
exceptional cases&#151;were based on an assumption that the
additional requirements on the parties to process declarations would be
embedded to a degree within checks that they already carry out to
ensure that the donations they accept are permissible under the
Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act
2000.</div><a name="08112036000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Government accept that a number of political parties are concerned that
the impact assessment underestimates the compliance burden that the
requirements of clause 8 might impose on political parties, and that
the impact assessment understates the potential burden. As my right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor (Jack Straw)
indicated before the Public Bill Committee on 4 November, while we are
clear that greater transparency is essential, it should not be achieved
at the cost of overburdening political parties, and I am ready to
consider raising the thresholds at which declarations are
required.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6 November 2008; Vol.
482, c. 753W.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div><a name="08112036000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister can clarify that answer, or tell hon. Members what the
rationale was behind the Government&#146;s sudden change of heart. It
hardly points to proper preparation and research on the Bill by his
Department. The impact assessment&#146;s estimated costs of the rules
to all political parties are between &#163;7,000 to &#163;10,500
per year. In our view, that grossly underestimates the volume of small
donations from &#163;200 to &#163;5,000 and wrongly assumes that it
will take only five minutes for parties to verify each
donation.</div>
<a name="08112036000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
recent amendments, can the Minister revise the impact assessment and
the costs that parties will be forced to accept? How will that change
once the Government have reviewed the thresholds? We are concerned
about the thresholds and believe that a higher figure would do away
with any potential confusion and would be more proportionate and
risk-based when the provisions commence.</div>
<a name="08112036000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government must review the thresholds again and increase the limit so
as not to place burdensome obligations on donors and volunteers. Given
the difficulties, it is essential that the Electoral Commission issues
guidance&#151;hopefully light-touch guidance&#151;on the operation
of the new
rules.</div><a name="08112036000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
money laundering-style language and the high tests proposed, in which
all reasonable steps had to be taken forthwith by or on behalf of the
party for verification, have thankfully now been removed. However, the
Government were in danger of imposing anti-money laundering-style
regulations on parties and donors. The consequential regulatory burden
that would have been imposed could have been devastating, and for what
purpose?</div>
<a name="08112036000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement for declarations and the need to retain them on file could
place a significant burden on the party-financing system. For instance,
what format must they be stored in? How long must they be stored and
what notice will be given of the commission&#146;s desire to review
them? How frequently does the commission expect to review
them&#151;as a matter of course or in exceptional circumstances?
Those are a few of the questions that remain with the
provisions.</div>
<a name="08112036000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
McIsaac, the Conservative party treasurer, gave some idea of the scale
of the potential problem in his responses to the Committee during the
evidence taking session:</div>
<a name="08112036000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Think
about a party such as ours. We have 600 and something constituency
associations, of which about 350 put in financial statements, which
means that they have income in excess of &#163;25,000 a year. Only a
very small number of them have professional staff, and the rest are run
by
volunteers.&#148;</div><a name="08112036000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to note the acute problem of requiring party officials to make
judgment calls as required by clause 8 and
said:</div><a name="08112036000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Once
you start getting into areas of judgment it gets more
difficult...All these things are highly judgmental and very
difficult. You can imagine yourself, or your parents, being asked to
become chairman of the local constituency association... and then
being told, &#145;By the way, there is a bit of a snag. There is the
compliance manual. And, by the way, you ought to be aware that if you
make a mistake, albeit an innocent one, it could be looked at through
the eyes of someone who is very suspicious. Also, be aware that the
Electoral Commission has all sorts of powers to gain access to your
home and to look at your records. By the way, you do want to be the
chairman of the association, don&#146;t
you?&#146;&#148;</div>
<a name="08112036000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">That typifies the sort
of problem that will face every local party office across the country
in the wake of  the Bill. As the system stands, the registered
party 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>treasurer takes responsibility for the compliance of all associations.
With the insertion of a test of objectivity and reasonableness, as
proposed in amendment No. 179 and those following, we could do away
with the need to rely so heavily on such subjective opinions.</div>
<a name="08112036000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also note
that Hilary Stephenson, who holds the equivalent position in the
Liberal Democrat party, in reply to Mr. McIsaac&#146;s
contribution
said:</div><a name="08112036000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I

Q21.]</div><a name="08112036000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
removal of the verification process is a step in the right direction,
but the Government must consider what they are trying to achieve with
clause 8. The cost of the clause as it stands might be a high price to
pay as volunteers and donors turn their backs on political parties for
fear of incurring liability for breaching complex rules. That was the
point made by Roy Kennedy, director of finance and compliance for the
Labour party, in his reference to the &#147;volunteer armies&#148;.
Anything that imposes complicated and misunderstood rules on those
people by way of regulatory sanction could stifle their desire to
become involved. At a local level, such volunteers are the lifeblood of
our parties. Often more senior in age, they give their time from a
sense of civic or national pride. At a time when more and more people
are turning their backs on the political process and large sections of
the electorate feel disfranchised, we must be careful not to discourage
involvement by imposing heavy-handed regulations that are difficult to
understand and comply with, and which could lead to financial or
criminal penalties if
breached.</div><a name="08112036000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would very much like the position of volunteers to be protected in the
Bill. We must ensure that we do not push away those already involved or
likely to become involved in the political system with the fear of
regulatory penalty. The Minister may come back with something more
acceptable in due course. In the meantime, I shall certainly recommend
to my hon. Friends that we vote against the
clause.</div><a name="08112036000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112036000269"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): The starting point for this
debate ought to be whether proxy donations are a good thing or a bad
thing. I am quite clear that they are a bad thing, and that people
making donations on behalf of others is, as the Government are right to
think, inherently fishy. The question is what to do about them. I
congratulate the Government on introducing such a strict clause in the
first place, because it is the Labour party, until very recently, that
has had the most trouble with proxy donations, such as in the David
Abrahams affair. However, it should be mentioned that all parties could
be in trouble over such matters. Only this weekend, a question was
raised about what might have been an attempted proxy donation to the
Conservative party, and it made headlines in <i class="I">The Sunday
Times</i><i class="I">.</i></div>
<a name="08112036000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The starting
point must be that proxy donations are inherently not a good idea,
especially in the context of the 2000 Act, which tried to create
transparency. However, there are the questions of proportionality,
which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Huntingdon, and of putting
excessive burdens on volunteers, which he was also right to mention.
The Government have introduced an amendment raising the limit to
&#163;5,000, which is to be welcomed. However, in order to understand
how much that new approach should be supported, it is important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>to put it into its potential context to see where the reform lies. He is
right that clause 8 will not change the substantive rules about
donations, so the question of proportionality is difficult to judge.
The limit will be &#163;5,000 where there is no donation limit. Is
that
proportional?</div><a name="08112036000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a question, again raised by the hon. Gentleman, about how the
clause will work in a mechanical way. The transparency parts of it will
not put the real donors&#146; names on the public record, as perhaps
they ought to. Why will it work that way? I have an optimistic scenario
for why that has been done and why it might work in other
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08112036000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
optimistic scenario is simply this: the clause will work, in an
interesting way, if a donation cap exists. If there were a donation
cap&#151;&#163;50,000 was proposed by Hayden Phillips, and the
Committee will debate a &#163;10,000 option later&#151;political
parties would need to be clear about who gave them the money.
Otherwise, it would be a simple matter for donors to evade the donation
cap by making a proxy donation. That would be an easy avoidance
technique. At that point, declarations to parties would be a way in
which parties could effectively protect themselves against the
accusation that they had taken a donation above the limit because they
would have a declaration from the donor and would know who the real
donors were, so that mechanism can be a coherent part of a capped
donation system. I want to know whether that is how the Government
conceive it. If that is how they conceive it, I am rather more
optimistic about the future for that area of regulation.</div>
<a name="08112036000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were we to
move to a cap on donations, even one as high as &#163;50,000, as
proposed by Hayden Phillips, we would be on the way to taking big money
out of politics. The points about volunteers and participation,
although valid, do not justify massive donations by individuals, the
only plausible interpretation of which, from the outside, is that they
have massively more influence over politics than ordinary people who
make small
donations.</div><a name="08112036000139"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000270"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to be basing his
understanding of the clause on what the Government might be thinking,
which is only a maybe, maybe, but even on that basis is he saying that
the level should be set at &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000, because
presumably he is only talking about the largest
donors?</div><a name="08112036000237"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
pm</div><a name="08112036000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000271"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is getting to the point. If we
did have a &#163;50,000 donation cap, what should the proxy donation
limit be? The lower the overall donation cap, the lower the limit
should be on declarations of proxy giving, because the danger would
increase that people would use proxy donations to get around the caps.
If it was a &#163;10,000 donation cap, there is a case for going back
to the Bill&#146;s original proposal of just &#163;200. The
proportionality issue becomes quite different, because proportionality
would then include the question of making sure that individuals did not
avoid the overall cap, which would be an important matter at that
point.</div>
<a name="08112036000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
my central question for the Government: do they conceive of the clause
as part of a road map that would get us to a donation cap? I think that
a donation cap is absolutely essential. It is part of the Hayden
Phillips compromise, and although it is at a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>level that I think is far too high, it is nevertheless agreed to by all
parties. If we are to clear up politics and deal with the perception
that it is dominated by very wealthy people who have much greater
access to the political process than ordinary people, that is the route
that we must take. I hope that the Government can give us a clear
answer now, and the Opposition too, on whether they support caps on
donations.</div><a name="08112036000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will speak briefly to amendment No. 179, because I do not understand
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention in tabling it. He says he wants
to reduce the regulatory burden, yet inserting the word
&#147;reasonable&#148; in clause 8 would move away from the
situation in which the opinion of the person making the declarations is
relevant, and of course their opinion is their opinion, to one in which
that opinion would count only if it was reasonable. That would increase
the regulatory burden and the possibility of a legal challenge against
someone who he says is a volunteer. I do not understand the insertion
of the word &#147;reasonable&#148; in clauses where it is not the
state we are regulating, but individuals. Inserting the word
&#147;reasonable&#148; into clauses about individuals increases the
burden on them; it does not reduce it. That applies to most of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments, which are entirely
misconceived.</div><a name="08112036000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
central point in the debate on clause 8 is the cap on donations.
Without a cap on donations the clause makes less sense. My optimistic
view is that the clause is part of an original much bigger plan to
introduce donation caps, and is all that survives of it. If that is the
case, and that bit of political archaeology is true, we may be on to a
better path than the one we seem to be on in the
Bill.</div><a name="08112036000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112036000272"></a><b class="B">Nick
Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab): I
want briefly to congratulate the Government on accepting my amendments
and those tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. In
speaking to my amendments I shall not take the 40 minutes
that the hon. Member for Huntingdon took. I merely say that the level
set in the Bill was clearly too low. We had a lot of evidence to that
effect, which the hon. Gentleman listed at length.</div>
<a name="08112036000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
what the Government have done, which is sensible and makes it far
easier now for individual parties locally and nationally to administer
the provision. The Government have tabled a very sensible
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000273"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> Welcome back to the Chair on the last day of the
Committee&#146;s proceedings, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="08112036000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire.
His and his hon. Friends&#146; judgment and experience have been
influential in shaping the Government&#146;s approach, and we are
extremely grateful for all their work. I hope that he will feel that we
have addressed the concerns adequately and that he will not press his
amendments.</div><a name="08112036000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I comment on clause stand part, I will deal with the issues raised by
the hon. Members for Huntingdon and for Cambridge. We are grateful for
the Opposition amendments, which we hope are essentially probing
amendments on which we will be able to provide sufficient reassurance
that they need not be pressed to a vote.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div><a name="08112036000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course
reasonableness is important. For instance, when someone is required to
give an opinion it should be a reasonable one. However, the effect of
the Bill will be to ensure that sensible and reasonable opinions are
given. Therefore the amendments are not needed. It is an offence
knowingly or recklessly to make a false declaration about one&#146;s
opinion under the clause. Accordingly, there is effectively a
requirement in the clause to give an opinion that has been considered
with due care and attention. On that basis, we think it is enough that
someone genuinely believes the opinion they record in a declaration. We
do not think that adding an extra objectivity test that requires a
person to show that their opinion is reasonable would add anything
useful, and might in the end be unnecessarily
onerous.</div><a name="08112036000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that as well as being unnecessary to achieve what is
intended the amendments would not consistently change the requirements
in relation to all the different types of recipients of donations to
which clause 8 and schedule 3 apply.<b class="B"> </b>The Bill replicates the
requirements in relation to donations to political parties, set out in
clause 8, for donations to individuals, members associations, third
parties and permitted participants in referendums. Any changes to
clause 8<b class="B"> </b>should therefore be reflected throughout schedule 3,
and vice versa. I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will accept
my assurance that the amendments are not necessary, and not press
them.</div>
<a name="08112036000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to
amendments Nos. 188, 194 and 198, I again invite the hon. Gentleman not
to press them. I remind the Committee that they would require the
commission to produce guidance notes, which would have to be attached
to declaration forms. As a minimum, the guidance notes would include
examples of how to value benefits, examples to assist owners in making
declarations, an explanation of the penalties for non-compliance or for
knowingly or recklessly making false donations, and an explanation of
the time limits for the submission of declarations. This requirement
would apply only to donations to individuals, members&#146;
associations, third parties and permitted participants, but not to
donations to political parties. I am not sure whether that is the
effect that the hon. Gentleman intended, so I shall speak about the
content of the amendment, rather than about the types of donations to
which it would
apply.</div><a name="08112036000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
1 provides that the commission may prepare guidance on any of the
requirements of the 2000 Act. The clause also gives the commission the
function of taking such steps as it considers appropriate to secure
compliance with the requirements of the Act. The commission is,
therefore, already empowered by the Bill to issue guidance on the new
requirements for a declaration. In fact, the Electoral Commission has
already published guidance for political parties on valuing benefits,
such as items sold at auction, secondment of staff by employers to work
for political parties and the provision of free or discounted office
space.</div>
<a name="08112036000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
expect the commission to include in its guidance the details set out in
the amendment, but a blanket requirement for the guidance to be
attached to the declaration form may be unduly rigid. Those giving
donations will not be required to complete specific forms, although the
commission might produce a standard form, which recipients may choose
to use to comply 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>with the requirement. The individuals and organisations regulated by the
2000 Act and the Bill may choose to comply in the way that they find
easiest. That is preferable to prescribing, in primary legislation,
that a specific form must be completed and a specific piece of guidance
attached. I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08112036000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000274"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I help the Minister? The Opposition
do not have to withdraw their amendments, which are merely grouped with
the Government amendment. If the Opposition ask the Chair for a
specific Division, I would give serious consideration to that, but at
present they have
not.</div><a name="08112036000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000275"></a>Mr.

for your
guidance.</div><a name="08112036000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now come to the stand part debate on the general purposes of the clause
and its associated schedule 3. However, before I do so, I remind the
Committee of the wise words of the hon. Member for Cambridge, to which
I have had recourse many times during the Committee proceedings,
although the hon. Gentleman has not, sadly, been able to contribute as
much as other Opposition members to our proceedings. I am endeavouring
to put on record that he has made a significant contribution to the
work of the Committee by reminding us all that, as we proceed, we
should always have in mind two separate and sometimes conflicting
imperatives. We must make sure that our democracy functions, and that
depends, for all of us, on volunteers who are prepared to give their
time and, on occasion, money to political parties. To put undue burdens
on them would, in the end, be damaging to our democracy. However,
equally, we must recognise the legitimate public concerns about the
integrity and transparency of our political
processes.</div><a name="08112036000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
those imperatives in mind, the objective of the clause and the
associated schedule 3 is to bring greater transparency to donations to
political parties. The clause also seeks to address the concerns of a
number of Members on both sides that there was a lack of transparency
as to the ultimate source of donations to political parties. As
drafted, the clause adds a new requirement to section 54 of the 2000
Act, that all donations to parties of more than &#163;200 are
accompanied by a declaration relating to the source of the donation.
Where money or a benefit of more than &#163;200 has been given by an
individual or organisation other than the person who physically makes
the
donation,</div><a name="08112036000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
a view to, or otherwise in connection with, making of the
donation&#148;,</div><a name="08112036000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
declaration will need to be made about whether section 54(4) or 54(6)
of the 2000 Act
applies.</div><a name="08112036000238"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08112036000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
subsections of section 54 require the disclosure of the identity of the
true donor, where someone makes a donation on behalf of another person
or organisation. If a person making a declaration concludes that those
sections do not apply, they must say why. It is a criminal offence to
knowingly or recklessly make a false donation, and a party cannot
accept a donation if it is not accompanied by such a declaration. If it
does and fails to return the donation within 30 days of receipt, the
party or treasurer may be guilty of an offence. A donor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>must submit a report to the commission where a donation has been
received without such a declaration, in the same way as it is obliged
to do where a donation is sent in by an impermissible donor.</div>
<a name="08112036000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8,
therefore, does not add a new restriction on who can give a donation,
but seeks to ensure that the important disclosure requirements in the
2000 Act are firmly in the minds of both donors and recipients when a
donation is made, and that there is a dialogue between the two sides
about the relevant legal
requirements.</div><a name="08112036000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8 requires a declaration to accompany all donations above a threshold.
I believe that that is of benefit. Having to sign a declaration stating
whether the money is one&#146;s own when making a political donation
draws a donor&#146;s attention to the existing requirements to
declare when one is acting as an agent or otherwise giving money on
behalf of another. I understand that that might seem unusual, but we
believe that it is justifiable in the specific
circumstances&#151;</div>
<a name="08112036000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000276"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08112036000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000277"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> In a moment. I want to make this point, as it is
fundamental to the purpose of the clause. We believe that the
requirement is justifiable, given the gravity of the perception that
someone has secretly given money on behalf of another person. It is
justifiable precisely because the consequences of such an action extend
more widely than to those directly affected, the donor and donee. They
extend to the very integrity of our democratic system, which depends on
public confidence in our politicians. We believe that making it more
difficult for those giving and receiving financial support to be
ignorant of the laws that apply to them can only be a good
thing.</div><a name="08112036000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000278"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Taking the Minister&#146;s line of thought
forward, we could double the amount of legislation in this country by
saying that for every law, we should have a law saying that people need
to comply with that law. It is a circular
argument.</div><a name="08112036000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000279"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, I had hoped
that my not giving way when he first intervened would allow him to get
the point of what I was saying, but he was obviously too anxious to
make his intervention to listen. I recognise that the circumstances are
specific and that it is not to be extended as a general principle. I
made that point specifically. The reason for the measures in this
specific set of circumstances is precisely that the consequences
stretch so much more widely&#151;to the very heart of our democratic
system&#151;than their immediate effects on those directly involved,
the donor and the donee. That is why the measures are so
important.</div><a name="08112036000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000280"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister has not given any evidence, based
on what has occurred under PPERA, to explain why the measures are
required. If he could do so, we might reconsider
them.</div><a name="08112036000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000281"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We have. The hon. Member for Cambridge referred to
a recent controversy about a donation given by family members of a
foreign businessman to the party to which the hon. Member for
Huntingdon belongs. That can only highlight the fact that clarity is
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>always present when donations are made. Surely, in such circumstances,
clause 8 will impose a useful reminder that donations must be
one&#146;s own or, if given on behalf of another, that that fact must
be declared and the original source of the money must be permissible.
If clause 8 had been in effect when the donation in question was made,
the embarrassment of the publicity given to the donation in recent days
might have been avoided. I am sure the hon. Gentleman would have
welcomed that, if nothing else about the
clause.</div><a name="08112036000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112036000282"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): Does the Minister agree that the
hon. Member for Huntingdon might need his memory jogged about a number
of other cases, such as that of Midlands Industrial Council, in which
there has been a lack of transparency and clarity about the source of
donations? That has now been addressed, but it took some time before
the spirit of the PPERA was instilled in the unincorporated
associations and members associations that regularly donate money to
the Conservative party, and indeed to ours. It took some time for them
to understand that the true donor in every case must be
declared.</div><a name="08112036000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000283"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. No doubt he has
effectively jogged the memory of the hon. Member for Huntingdon, and I
need not add to my hon. Friend&#146;s eloquent exposition of the
point.</div><a name="08112036000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
must be a good thing to encourage transparency. This is a necessarily
complicated area. Anything that encourages transparency must be a good
thing.</div><a name="08112036000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference
was made to Mark Sweeney. The matter does not relate to him alone. The
hon. Member for Huntingdon referred to him as a bureaucrat who was not
sensitive to the circumstances of political parties. May I put it on
the record that Mark Sweeney&#151;who, as a civil servant, cannot
answer for himself, as the Committee will appreciate&#151;is an
outstanding public servant who has done extraordinarily good work on
the Bill, way beyond the call of duty? The Government are extremely
grateful for what he has done. From my own experience, I know that he
is extremely sensitive to the situation of volunteers. He is very
sensitive to the way in which political parties operate,
notwithstanding the fact that he is an impartial civil servant of the
highest integrity. I associate myself proudly with him and with the
work that he and other officials have done on the Bill. The British
public will have reason to be grateful to him  for
that.</div><a name="08112036000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
3 makes consequential changes to the existing legislation and extends
the requirements of clause 8 to donations to individuals, members
associations, third parties and permitted participants. In moving
forward, it is important that we get the balance right between the need
for transparency and the degree of burden placed on those who have the
job of ensuring compliance with the law. The hon. Member for Huntingdon
made his points clearly and we have a great deal of sympathy with his
remarks about the role of volunteers in public life. We listened
carefully to representations from political parties and the Electoral
Commission, and that is why we tabled amendments that raise the
threshold at which declarations are required to &#163;5,000 in
respect to registered parties and &#163;1,000 in respect of donations
to their accounting units.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div><a name="08112036000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recognition
of the practical difficulties that have been raised since the
introduction of the clause, we have also tabled amendments that remove
the requirement for parties to take reasonable steps to verify the
accuracy of the declarations. This will not remove the need for parties
to take reasonable steps to ensure that a donor is permissible and that
the identity of the donor is clear, as is already required by section
56(1). Even with these concessions, clause 8 and schedule 3 will
promote greater transparency. The additional declaration requirement
will mean that donors to political parties will be obliged consciously
to consider whether they are acting as agents for someone else when
giving a
donation.</div><a name="08112036000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have made clear, these amendments are intended to take into account
concerns that have been expressed, and for the sake of consistency, the
thresholds have been raised to those that are used in relation to a
number of requirements in the 2000 Act. There is a separate question
about whether those thresholds should be amended because they have not
been adjusted for eight years&#146; worth of inflation. Long term, we
perhaps also need to consider whether it might be desirable to ensure
that changes in the value of money are reflected more routinely. I am
happy to hear views on that issue. We have already shown our
flexibility. If there is consensus, I am happy to consider whether we
might be able to put something to that effect in the
Bill.</div><a name="08112036000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specific
concerns were raised about the impact assessment and consultation. We
accept that we had to make a reasoned guess when making the impact
assessment. We readily concede that. We still do not have a full data
set of all the donations between &#163;200, &#163;1,000 and
&#163;5,000 for the political parties. I concede that we had to make
an estimate. We do not know how far out that estimate is, but we had a
number of problems in reaching it. That is why we have been so flexible
in our response, trying to address the legitimate concerns that have
been raised. We will continue to operate in that spirit. If we find
that we need to make further adjustments, we are happy to take account
of views and, if we can reach consensus, to make provisions for
them.</div><a name="08112036000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked various detailed questions about the storage of
declarations&#151;where they should be stored, how long they should
be stored and so on. Those are legitimate points of detail. As he
rightly said, they go to the heart of how parties operate on a local
level, and such concerns might become onerous in some circumstances. He
is right to raise them. However, the clause, sensibly, is not
prescriptive about that. We will discuss the issues with the
commission&#151;because, as he said, they are important&#151;with a
view to its issuing guidance. We think that that provides the right
balance between certainty and allowing appropriate flexibility. He is
right to raise those issues. They need to be addressed, and I assure
him that they will
be.</div><a name="08112036000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the points made by the hon. Member for Cambridge, I am glad that he
found an opportunity to raise matters that I know have been of concern
to him. I know that he is also concerned that the Committee might run
out of time to address them later, so he seized the moment. In
response, I point out just two things, because I do not want to stray
too far from the clause. First, I remind him that where donations are
made on behalf of another, the name of the original source is already
required to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>disclosed to the Electoral Commission and made public under the 2000
Act, and that clause 8 merely draws attention to that requirement.
Provision already exists for making the names public.</div>
<a name="08112036000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
hon. Gentleman asked me a specific question about caps on donations. He
will be aware that that is not on the agenda now. They would not work
without state funding. There does not seem to be any consensus on that
point among the political parties at present. The issue is fundamental
to systems of party funding, and we believe profoundly that we cannot
move forward without consensus. I am sure that it will be a subject for
continuing discussion among the parties as well as in the public
arena.</div><a name="08112036000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope I have persuaded the Committee that the clause should stand part
of the Bill. Transparent, clean political party finance is vital to the
health of our democracy. All parties have been affected by concerns
about tainted donations or the inaccurate or incomplete reporting of
donations. Adding a simple process to the existing permissibility
requirement will encourage donors to political parties to be more open
about their donations. I hope that it will also act as a deterrent to
those who want to make impermissible donations. The public are rightly
intolerant of any perception of sleazy politics. I believe that the
additional requirements in the clause will help to achieve greater
public confidence by promoting transparency, and I hope that it will
stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08112036000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendm</i><i class="I">e</i><i class="I">nt

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000286"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Clause 8 creates a new responsibility for donors
to political parties to clarify the source of their donations.
Amendment No. 151 would insert a new sub-paragraph after proposed new
section 54A(5) of PPERA, as set out in clause 8(2). The main purpose of
the sub-paragraph is to provide a defence for those who have made an
innocent mistake and have fallen foul of the regulation in PPERA only
as a consequence of an administrative oversight or an honest mistake.
We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>want to make it clear with this amendment that the commission is
empowered to excuse those who have made an innocent
mistake.</div>
<a name="08112036000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafting
of section 54A(5), as proposed in  clause 8(2), is not
sufficiently prescriptive. The sub-section as
drafted&#151;</div><a name="08112036000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;knowingly
or recklessly makes a false
declaration&#148;</div><a name="08112036000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;does
not specify that innocence will be a defence. By articulating a
protection for innocent mistakes, we would force the commission to have
regard to the mental decision element of the crime, rather than simply
allowing it to hand out criminal sanctions based solely on the action
of giving a false
declaration.</div><a name="08112036000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
167 of the Representation of the People  Act 1983 contains that
idea. It states that where a person has been charged with an offence
under its provisions, they may apply to the High Court, an election
court or other court as appropriate, for relief from liability on the
grounds
that</div><a name="08112036000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
act or omission arose from inadvertence or from accidental
miscalculation or from some other reasonable cause of a like nature,
and in any case did not arise from any want of good
faith&#148;</div><a name="08112036000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister might suggest that sub-section (5) is sufficient to protect
those who make an innocent declaration because they would not fall into
the definition of having</div><div class="hs_brev">&#147;knowingly or
recklessly made a false declaration&#148;,</div>
<a name="08112036000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">but I would point him
to the volumes of criminal case law that deal with the difficulty of
those two concepts. If the protection was included in the
Representation of the People Act 1983, I cannot see the basis on which
it should not be included in the Bill. While we have the chance, we
should aim for clarity, not only for donors and the commission, but to
prevent the need for interpretation of our intentions by the judiciary
at some later date when a sanction is challenged in a court of
law.</div><a name="08112036000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 6, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Battersea, would remove
the summary conviction and indictment penalty tariffs in relation to an
offence under section 54(5)&#151;making a false declaration about the
source of a donation. In its place would be inserted a standard
&#163;1,000 fine. I do not support the imposition of
one-size-fits-all penalties and I am concerned that the amendment,
while well intentioned in that it would reduce the maximum penalty,
would be an arbitrary and in some cases, a disproportionate
penalty.</div>
<a name="08112036000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much was made
in the lead-up to the Bill of the role of better regulatory regimes and
the use of flexible tariffs. My concern with the amendment is that we
would take a step back from that flexibility. A range of sanctions will
always require a top-end option. It may not be used often, or at all,
but its existence acts as a deterrent. I am afraid that the amendment
could remove that option and undermine the seriousness of the offence.
I have more sympathy with the view that it should be an indictable
crime. We will consider that element
further.</div>
<a name="08112036000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000287"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question is how serious a crime it is to make
a false declaration about the source of a donation. As drafted, the
Bill allows for a prison sentence, and the amendment would change that.
To come back to my previous point, does the question not depend on what
the purpose of clause 8 is, and whether it is to pave the way for a
donation cap at a later date? The Minister has now put that off even
further, but the issue depends on whether there is to be a donation
cap. What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attitude to a donation
cap?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div><a name="08112036000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000288"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting
point.</div><a name="08112036000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000289"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Not at
length.</div><a name="08112036000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000290"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I will not go on to donation caps, Sir Nicholas,
but the hon. Gentleman made an interesting point with regard to the
amount that would fit. Of course, if there is an offence with respect
to the lack of declaration, there will probably be another offence
caused in relation to a breach of PPERA, or whatever. There will
probably be an underlying charge, which could relate to the seriousness
of the underlying offence&#151;simply for not putting in the right
bit of paper. I have some sympathy for the views of Government Members
on the seriousness of not filling in the bit of paper, which is why we
should look again at whether the offence is summary or
indictable.</div><a name="08112036000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000291"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is my point. If the underlying offence were
to be to exceed the donation cap, it would be a very serious offence.
That changes the entire context, so I come back to my question. What is
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attitude towards the donation
cap?</div><a name="08112036000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000292"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No. The underlying offence could be in relation
to a number of issues under PPERA, not necessarily the donation
cap.</div><a name="08112036000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000293"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I am confident that the Minister will, in the end,
accede to my plea under an earlier amendment, that the relief system
under the Representation of the People Act should be imported into
PPERA. If my hon. Friend is unable to do that, I hope he will accept
the amendment. No one in Committee would want the threat of a jail
sentence to hang over someone for a simple mistake that was not made in
bad faith and was not an attempt to deceive or withhold information.
The amendment does not ask for special privileges for politicians, but
it is unfair to have the potential of a jail sentence for an unintended
error. The issue, central as it is to the Bill, would be better dealt
with by the Minister tabling an amendment to introduce section 86 of
the Representation of the People Act into the PPERA, so that hon.
Members who find themselves in this difficult position can seek relief
from the court to have the offence struck out, and we do not have all
the unnecessary paraphernalia of investigation by the Electoral
Commission or the police over an unintended
error.</div><a name="08112036000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112036000294"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Throughout our consideration of the Bill, we have
tried to tread the line between having an effective set of regulations
and avoiding unduly onerous burdens on volunteers and, indeed,
politicians, whose work is vital to our democratic processes. We have
been striving to get the balance right, which is why clause 8 states
that a person commits an offence only if he or
she</div><a name="08112036000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;knowingly
or recklessly makes a false
declaration&#148;.</div><a name="08112036000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Member for Huntingdon is sceptical about the
requirement, but it will catch those who intentionally make a false
declaration, or who do not properly turn their minds to whether the
declaration is accurate. It does not seek to punish innocent mistakes,
where steps have been taken to ensure that a declaration is accurate or
where there is no good reason to think 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>that it might not be. We believe that our wording strikes the right
balance. Importantly, it goes no further than the wording of other
false declaration offences in the 2000
Act.</div><a name="08112036000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members spoke about the 1983 Act, but that framework was replaced by
the 2000 Act, and there is no reason why the particular offences are
special cases requiring different treatment. We do not believe that the
amendment is necessary, but of course we hear the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>concerns about the dangers of an overzealous approach to
enforcement&#151;of the minor, technical breaches. We are not talking
about substantive breaches, but about the inadvertent, minor breaches,
which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has mentioned on several
