<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I wish to draw to your attention the remarks made by the Financial Secretary at our sitting on Tuesday. He said that a written parliamentary answer would be published about the climate change levy and combined heat and power. It was published yesterday and referred to documents that had been placed in the Library. As a result of my inquiries, I found that those documents were not available to right hon. and hon. Members until ten minutes to 1 o'clock this afternoon, immediately before the commencement of our proceedings. That puts members of the Committee who needed such information to take part in our debate at a severe disadvantage. I hope that you, Mr. Cook, will draw the matter to the attention of Madam Speaker and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, so that we are not put at such a disadvantage in future.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that that is not a matter for the Chair, whose remit is restricted to the Bill. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will have heard his comments, will register them in the appropriate place and will ensure that such action is not repeated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I seek your guidance. The Financial Secretary offered to write to members of the Committee, particularly my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), about the level of interest rate rise assumed by the Government in their forecast. We are grateful for the letter, but it contains no reference to the question that was asked. Is that an appropriate way in which to deal with matters pertaining to our proceedings?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has sufficient experience to know that that is not a matter for the Chair. However, he can count himself fortunate that he has managed to get it on the record. I am sure that he will receive an appropriate response from the appropriate quarter. Now, can we get on?
<H4><center>Schedule 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>CLIMATE CHANGE LEVY</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 152, line 32, leave out from `Schedule' to end of line 32 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a reduced rate supply to horticultural producers is a taxable supply payable at one third of the amount ascertained from the Table in paragraph 40, and in'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 35, in page 152, line 32, leave out from `Schedule' to `the' in line 33 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`supply is not taxable if'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 36, page 152, line 36, leave out `intends' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`would have intended'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Amendment No. 77 and the other two amendments, tabled by the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), relate to the application of the levy to the horticulture industry. The Government have responded to some points made to them by the industry. Originally, the levy was to apply at the full rate on the horticulture sector, which would have been catastrophic. Paragraph 41 allows that, for the first five years, a half-rate levy will apply, which will be better than paying the full rate. However, it is far from satisfactory and will damage the horticultural sector.
<P>
The amendment would reduce the climate change levy that will apply to the horticultural sector from one half to one third of the standard rate. It is designed to test the Government's short-term and medium-term intentions for the horticultural sector.
<P>
In its more refined forms at least, horticulture is a major international industry. Under the auspices of the National Farmers Union, I met horticultural growers in this country, one of whom also had horticultural interests in Chile. It may surprise hon. Members to know that routine flights from Chile bring horticultural produce to this country and the rest of western Europe. It is an international trade, especially in flowers.
<P>
Therefore, growers in this country are preparing products not simply for a local market, as they might have been 100 years ago, or a regional or national market, as they might have been 20 years ago, but for an international market. The impact of the levy on their business will be correspondingly severe.
<P>
That might be said of a number of industrial and commercial sectors, as no doubt the Financial Secretary will argue. However, the horticultural sector is different, in that those who work in it are not net contributors of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Because of the stage of the cycle at which they operate, in fact they withdraw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, because that is what plants do in order to grow. It might be argued that, at a later stage, when the flowers are discarded, the carbon cycle continues, but horticulture is nevertheless a net carbon-neutral industry. It is therefore clearly different from the high energy users covered by the integrated pollution prevention and control agreements, and from some of the industries that are high energy users but are not currently covered by any of the negotiated settlements. Therefore, an industry that is international in scope and earnings potential and, net, carbon-neutral faces the imposition of the new tax, albeit at a reduced rate.
<P>
A further point has been put to me by horticultural growers. In order to make their plants grow more robustly, the more sophisticated operations recycle some of the carbon dioxide produced in combusting fuel to blow over the plants to increase absorption of carbon. By doing so, they participate in cleansing by using the carbon dioxide produced when they burn fossil fuels. Therefore, it is not always practical for them to use renewable sources of energy. In some cases it may be, and I encourage them to do so. In other cases, however, the emission of carbon dioxide by the burning of fossil fuels is beneficial. It is, in effect, a fertilizer, provided as a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels.
<P>
The horticultural sector, which operates in an international market, produces a net carbon-neutral emission and can make beneficial use of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, faces the levy and all its associated difficulties. No doubt the right hon. Member for Fylde will make some additional points and provide further particulars on the matter.
<P>
Welcome as the half rate is in principle, it does not go far enough to guarantee and secure the continuance of that international industry. Its time-limited nature is a problem, too, because unless horticulturalists in the United Kingdom make significant investments in the next five years, they will be knocked for six by the imposition of the full rate when the end of the temporary rebate period arrives. There will not be a viable investment climate for horticulturalists to install new equipment over the next five years if they take a tax hit while having to fight vigorously in an international market in which the valuation of the pound provides additional difficulties. I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond sympathetically to all three amendments in the set, and to amendment. No. 77 in particular, which would reduce the current rebate so that horticulturalists pay not one half but one third of the levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I join the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) in thanking the Government for listening carefully to the representations that the horticulture industry has made about the matter that we are discussing. I speak as someone who made his living in the horticulture industry before coming to Parliament. The company that I worked for was—
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Scrumpy Jack.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Not Scrumpy Jack, but a company that made its living by selling fresh produce to major supermarkets as well as being a grower in its own right. Part of that operation produced glasshouse tomatoes. I want to work through a case not so much to support my amendment, which suggests a 100 per cent. reduction in the effect of the climate change levy on the horticulture industry, as to make an appeal on behalf of such producers.
<P>
I appreciate that it is not in the gift of the Financial Secretary to admit that he wishes that he could adopt my arguments and agree with my proposal. Part of the measure that I seek to amend, which the Government negotiated with the industry, has come about—as paragraph 6.32 in the Red Book rightly counsels us—as a result of discussions with the EU about the state aid rules. However, there might be more flexibility in those rules and in their application to the industry, and I want to pray in aid the comparative position of the United Kingdom industry and that of our European competitors. It would be fair to ensure that United Kingdom growers are no worse off than our principal horticultural competitors after the application of the climate change levy in Europe.
<P>
Traditionally, United Kingdom growers of glasshouse tomatoes or cucumbers could expect to have the United Kingdom marketplace to themselves between March and the end of October. However, improved growing techniques in Portugal and Spain mean that the so-called English season is reducing, so that the period over which horticulturalists—especially protected growers—can make a living is more constrained. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, the horticultural business is a world business. With the advent of relatively low-cost air freight, produce can be imported from all over the world. For many years, it has been the tradition that in March, April and early May we enjoy tomatoes from the Canary islands—which have no problems with climate change or energy.
<P>
<H5>1.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When mainland Spain extends its season, starting earlier or finishing later, our glasshouse producers face a hitherto unknown form of competition. In the case of tomatoes, for example, many producers are using their ingenuity and plant-breeding techniques to develop new varieties that are grown especially for flavour and which, in certain cases, incorporate properties that help fight cancer. Such are the efforts that our industry is making to survive in the competitive world of horticulture. However, if it has to bear the additional expense occasioned by the climate change levy, its struggle to survive will be all the more difficult. I shall develop that point later by giving some real-world examples of how the climate change levy impacts on the horticultural industry.
<P>
The other factor in the European context that bears heavily on our growers is the current level of the pound against the euro. This means, for example, that last season tomato growers faced some of the worst prices that they have experienced for many seasons. Until the rate of exchange between the pound and the euro becomes more balanced, our industry will continue to struggle through no fault of its own. It has to bear additional costs and its long-term survival is put at risk.
<P>
Why should we be bothered about the survival of our horticulture industry? In parts of the country where its presence is significant, it employs a disproportionately large number of people. The Minister will be aware that part of Merseyside—one of the few remaining objective 1 areas—covers part of the west Lancashire plain, in which some of the protected growers that I have mentioned carry out their business. The Minister needs no lessons from me in explaining how important it is to sustain high levels of employment in the Merseyside area.
<P>
Beyond the boundary of the objective 1 area, many activities in horticulture provide, as I know from my experience in the industry, employment opportunities for people who live in areas of comparatively high unemployment. The industry's survivability is therefore important, not just to the north-west but to places like East Anglia and parts of the south, which have significant areas of protected cropping.
<P>
To sum up, the length of the season, competitive forces, the exchange rate of the pound versus the euro, and the employment situation all affect the industry. There is one other crucial factor. The forces of competition in the marketplaces into which the horticultural industry sells have mounted and will continue to do so. It is a market-based industry, which can easily negotiate price increases. The only way in which additional revenues can be recouped is, as I said earlier, through the use of technology and skill in developing products that enable our industry to find its place on the supermarket shelves. Even with the discount of 50 per cent. in the climate change levy, the horticultural industry still faces a cost that is irrecoverable in the short term.
<P>
I say ``short term'' because while my amendment would effectively give the industry a 100 per cent. discount, I recognise that, as paragraph 6.32 of the Red Book reminds us, the Government understandably seek to maintain their discount for a five-year period.
<P>
That was partly to be compatible with state aid rules and partly to recognise the fact that they have offered further financial assistance to the horticultural industry so that it can improve its energy efficiency by using the energy efficiency fund. I welcome that as a pragmatic and sensible way to acknowledge the difficulty with the industry. I also acknowledge the capital allowance help on thermal screens.
<P>
From my discussions with growers who were my colleagues and from considering the financial state of the industry I know that there is a little financial room for manoeuvre, especially among smaller and medium-„sized growers. Their ability to take advantage of investment opportunities is restricted, but the Van Heynigen brothers, with a massive 200 acres plus a glasshouse production unit on the south coast, can work with electricity providers to use combined heat and power systems, which go some way towards mitigating the burden of the levy.
<P>
Our earlier debate showed that there are limitations on what types of holdings can use combined heat and power, and that some interesting and important questions are being asked about the rate of return to be gained from that approach to energy saving. Many growers do not have an obvious way out of the problem, and they will have to consider other techniques.
<P>
I shall give some real-world examples to show the financial burden that the climate change levy will place on growers, even at the current 50 per cent. discount. Flavourfresh has approximately 20 acres of glasshouse production in Lancashire, and its gas costs associated with growing amount to £363,000. Even with the discount, its gas costs alone will be £50,000 extra. The climate change levy would cost the company a further £3,000 on electricity, so the bill would be £53,000. Netting off the national insurance rebate would subtract £5,416 from the bill, leaving that enterprise with a net bill of £47,584. How will it meet that cost? It cannot instantaneously introduce energy-saving techniques that will immediately deliver that saving.
<P>
Donaldson's is a flower grower in the south of England. It has a turnover of £882,000. Its energy costs are £92,180 from gas and electricity and £49,523 from oil. The levy on Donaldson's bill would be £5,873. Perhaps the Committee thinks that that is not a substantial sum, but I am advised that the profit on the enterprise was £40,000 last year. In terms of its total energy cost for this year, it predicts a lowering to £24,827. I am not talking about companies with an awful lot of financial muscle. It is a real burden on that relatively small flower producer to find that its profitability is being reduced, even by a little less than £6,000.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Is my right hon. Friend aware that matters are worse than he suggests? If the climate change levy applied to profits, there would merely be a charge on profits such as he describes. However, because it is a marginal cost, it affects the marginal cost of sales and therefore impacts directly on the competitiveness of the product.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's observation. I ask for the Committee's indulgence, as some growers have been kind enough to indicate that they do not mind their name being quoted while others have craved confidentiality. If it helps the Minister, even at this late stage, to discuss the matter with his colleagues, I am happy to let him see the relevant information in the privacy of his office. He will therefore see that it is valid testimony.
<P>
In the case of another substantial tomato grower, who has a turnover of £4 million and profitability of £75,000—tomatoes and cucumbers require much higher energy input than flowers—the climate change levy bill would be £50,000. If I have understood those simple figures properly, that enterprise's profitability would be lowered to £25,000. Any taxation should be underpinned by proper consideration of whether the taxpayer can bear the burden. It strikes me that, at this stage, the levy is a burden too far. The industry has been candid enough to acknowledge that there might be opportunities in the future for further energy saving. However, the examples that I have given of the application of the tax bear out my point that it is a difficult burden.
<P>
I shall refer to another east Yorkshire grower, who has a turnover of £976,000 and gross profit of £151,00. However, because of the circumstances of his business, he is making a loss of £90,000. His climate change levy bill would be £22,000.
<P>
The horticulture industry has a remarkable record—it is a bit like a man who climbs the north face of the Eiger with long fingernails and a pair of plimsolls and somehow gets to the top. It has tenaciously clung on and survived through difficult times. I am not saying that it cannot do so again, but is it right to burden such enterprises with an additional cost that it is not of their making?
<P>
A small enterprise in Bedfordshire, with a profitability of £20,000 and energy costs of £16,787, tells me that it would have to pay a climate change levy of £1,219. That may only be another £1,000, but the profit of the business is only £20,000—the levy would therefore reduce profitability by 5 per cent. That small grower may be supporting his family. If his income drops, he may become a burden on the working families tax credit. As the national insurance offset in many such enterprises is very small, the apparent revenue gain would not make a great difference. The man concerned might be forced to seek state help, which is not what the Government want.
<P>
I have made my point by referring to real-world examples—of which many more exist—rather than through a broad-brush appeal. Real businesses, with real figures, show the real impact.
<P>
Why is this important? I shall put my remarks in the context of the international competitiveness of United Kingdom horticulture. I want to look carefully at how other European Union countries are facing up to the climate change levy. Spain, which, as a competitor, is squeezing our season, has no climate change levy. Belgium, which has a protected horticulture sector, currently has no climate change levy, but is devising one along the lines of the Dutch. The Portuguese have no levy. The Irish, who are glasshouse competitors of ours, have no levy. The Dutch, who are our principal competitors, recently made changes—as the Minister said during Treasury questions. The latest information shows that the Dutch horticultural industry is exempt, but that is in exchange for an agreement on emissions that requires growers to make a further 15 per cent. increase in energy efficiency between 2000 and 2010, on top of the 50 per cent. increase that took place between 1980 and 2000.
<P>
<H5>1.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is worth recording that we would not be debating the horticultural industry if it had not been an energy-saving industry for the past 25 years. Ever since the Dutch have had the advantage of cheap natural gas, the only way in which our growers have survived is by continually pushing down the energy content as a cost of their operation. Governments recognise that more could be done, but growers need more breathing space than is allowed. In Germany, all firms must be charged the full levy, but interestingly, I understand that the German Government have recruited more civil servants—which I am sure will be music to the ears of some in this Room—to ensure that the climate change levy is revenue-neutral at the level of the enterprise. That is not so in the United Kingdom. France is exempting agriculture from the tax and the French Government are working with agriculturalists on a package of measures—including grants—to reduce emissions.
<P>
I realise that there are constraints in all those areas because of the state aid rules. The key word in the state aid rules that may, even at this stage, give the Minister some room for manoeuvre is ``degressive''. A 50 per cent. discount over five years has been adopted—an aid that be will phased out. We have also prayed in aid other measures to save energy. There may be a further opportunity, in discussion with Community officials, to see whether the boundaries of degressivity can be pushed wider in the light of that information. I pay tribute to Ministers at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for listening to the horticulture industry and for—as is obvious communicating what they have heard to the Financial Secretary and his Treasury colleagues. Were it not for that, we would not be having a debate about a 50 per cent. rebate; there might have been no rebate at all.
<P>
Even if the Financial Secretary cannot agree instantaneously to my proposal, the industry still clings to the hope that he will be very sympathetic to further representations with a view to seeing whether anything—even in the short term—can be done to ameliorate the burden on the industry. He would then have the wholehearted support of Opposition Members and the undying thanks of Britain's horticulturalists. The hon. Gentleman would certainly be playing his part in safeguarding employment in many of Britain's rural economies.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> The amendment would solve one problem, but more important, it illustrates yet another flaw in the Bill. I am not happy with a tax that requires constant new exemptions and rebates to make it fair or workable. There is a wider problem with the entire tax. Nevertheless, it is worth while for the Committee to dwell on the example of horticulture because it shows up several flaws in the Government's proposals.
<P>
I, too, have a horticulture industry in my constituency. The Cheddar valley was well known for the growing of early strawberries. Unfortunately, that has declined in recent years, chiefly as a result of foreign competition. That process will be accelerated if the industry is taxed in any way under the proposals. A horticulture industry is still based on the south-facing slopes of the Mendip hills. In addition, a number of farmers elsewhere in my constituency are diversifying out of traditional agriculture into things like horticulture, as the Ministry of Agriculture has urged them. The Government should help rather than hinder those firms.
<P>
To reinforce a point made by my right hon. Friend, many of the firms are small and are typically run by owner-managers with some part-time help. They will not benefit from the offsetting cut in national insurance contributions. The Financial Secretary regularly repeats the mantra about the tax being neutral. In a sense, all taxes are neutral because the revenue raised is returned in some way to other parts of the economy. However, the knowledge that they are being taxed while other people receive the offsetting benefits is no consolation to those firms. That point was made by the Association of Convenience Stores, which has written to us all. It states that the energy bills of convenience stores will rise, but that the stores will not be eligible for a discount because they, too, are mainly run by owners and employ part-time staff, who fall below the lower earnings threshold. The association reckons that each of its members will bear a direct net cost of £800 per store. They support the amendments to remove the climate change levy from the Finance Bill altogether. The horticulture industry is not alone in being badly treated by the present proposals.
<P>
I emphasise that horticulture uses up carbon dioxide. It does not add to the global warming problem, but actually helps to solve it. We will all remember from our school science that photosynthesis is a process that combines carbon with water in the presence of sunlight to produce complicated substances such as sugars, which enable plants to grow. The carbon is obtained from the carbon dioxide in the air. Therefore, a growing tree provides one of the best ways of reversing the threat of global warming because it removes carbon dioxide from the air and locks it into solid form.
<P>
The environmental lobby made a mistake a few years ago by criticising the use of wood, particularly hardwoods. It was a mistake because if a tree is harvested and made into furniture, it permanently locks the carbon up in solid form, whereas if a tree falls over and rots on the forest floor, the carbon will be returned more quickly to the atmosphere. The desks and chairs that we are using at present contain carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere. Therefore, forestry is in many ways an environmental industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): I know, Mr. Cook, that you will keep me strictly to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> I am listening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I wanted to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he would accept that the environmental lobby's argument against harvesting trees, particularly hardwood trees, was correct in that trees were not being replaced. That was the issue of concern to that lobby.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. He will know that the quantity of trees in the world is increasing. For every tree that is cut down, several are planted. The process is under way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May we return to the subject?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I just wanted to answer the absolutely valid intervention made by the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner).
<P>
I would add to the question of the recycling of carbon only that, in some cases, solid carbon eventually forms coal. When that coal is burned, the cycle is repeated. The horticulture industry does not produce plants for furniture or, we hope, for eventual coal production. The cycle is shorter, but it still operates. Carbon dioxide is extracted from the atmosphere rather than released. That should be encouraged and so exempted.
<P>
I end by returning to my first point. It is wrong to single out one problem industry and give it special treatment. We might exempt horticulture entirely, but what about the rest of farming or the forestry industry? I hope that I was in order when I mentioned that forestry aided the reversal of global warming, although in a slightly different way. Why not extend the exemption to forestry? Difficult borderlines would be created if a complete exemption was granted to horticulture. It would be better to do what the Association of Convenience Stores recommended and to use the paradoxes and anomalies to give the Government a reason for abolishing or for not proceeding with the tax.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I am surprised by the right hon. Gentleman's renewal of his attack on the environmental movement. Real issues about the future of the rainforests and their destruction are at stake. He is wrong to criticise the movement's campaign on the issue. I notice your censorious look, Mr. Cook, so I will not respond further to those points. However, I want to respond in full to the points made on the amendment by the right hon. Member for Fylde and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove and I agree that the horticulture sector should pay the levy. The difference between us is what the sum should be. By contrast, the right hon. Member for Fylde believes that it should not pay the levy at all. I shall explain why it should pay. The difference between the two amendments is whether we should have a zero per cent. rate or a one third rate, compared with the 50 per cent. rate that the Government propose.
<P>
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Fylde for what he said. We have been listening carefully to the representations made to us about the climate change levy. They have helped us to from a view on the right treatment of the sector. With my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright), I visited a horticultural establishment in his constituency and had a useful discussion with its proprietor.
<P>
The horticulture sector is in a unique position. It is highly energy intensive, but because it is not polluting, the IPPC directive does not cover it. It faces heavy international competition—a point well made by the right hon. Member for Fylde—and is treated separately and specially in the taxation regimes of other EU countries. That is the basis for the special treatment that we have given to it in terms of the levy. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that the sector should pay the levy. However, we have taken the view that there should be an additional incentive for all business users to save energy at the margin and that every sector should play its part in helping to meet our climate change targets. That opinion goes back to the advice that we received from Lord Marshall in his original report on the subject. That is why we have ruled out introducing complete exemptions for any sector.
<P>
Although it is true that, in terms of carbon dioxide, horticulture is a relatively benign activity—the hon. Member for Hazel Grove made this point—energy saving in horticulture contributes to meeting our climate change objectives just as much as energy saving in any other sector. We believe that there should be an additional incentive for firms in the horticulture sector to save energy so that they have the same incentives as people in other industries.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): The Financial Secretary has just said that horticulture is a relatively benign activity. That phrase goes to the heart of what is wrong with the idea that it is the responsibility of the tax system to distinguish between benign and malign activities. What exactly are the characteristics of a benign activity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove made the point that one must balance the substantial use of energy in the horticulture sector against the fact that growing plants withdraws carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. My point is that the horticulture sector, along with every other sector, can contribute to meeting our climate change objectives by reducing its energy use. In that sense, there is no distinction. Horticulture is in the same position as every other business and, by saving energy, it contributes towards achieving our Kyoto targets. Horticulture should play its part and should not be exempt from the additional incentives that will apply to every other area of the economy. Certainly, the advice that I have received—the right hon. Member for Fylde hinted that he agreed with this—is that there is significant scope for energy saving in the horticulture sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does that mean, in English, that the horticulture sector is energy intensive, but the Minister approves of it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, the point that I am making is the same point that was made by the right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. Growing plants absorbs carbon dioxide. That is how it is helpful to the environment. My point is that by saving energy, horticulture can contribute to our climate change objectives in the same way as any other business that saves energy. There is scope for energy saving in glasshouses The right hon. Member for Fylde suggested that people would need more time, but the climate change levy was announced just over a year ago and will not take effect for almost another year, so there is time for people to make the necessary adjustments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> On that point, what calculations have the Treasury, MAFF, the Department of Trade and Industry or any other part of government done to examine the investment potential of the horticulture industry to achieve the objective that the hon. Gentleman has outlined?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have announced a package of help for investment in energy efficiency measures, which is part of the levy package. Precisely what scope there is for that package to be taken up by the commercial sector is a matter for the players to determine. However, the right hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that there will be a ring-fenced element to the package to ensure that help is available to the horticulture sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> But does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is no use having a package of help if the industry cannot match it with corresponding funding? What assurances has he received from the industry or from individual enterprises that the help offered will be taken up and will deliver the energy saving required to meet the climate change agreement in the time scale that he has outlined?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is for individual firms to decide what use they make of the extra help available. I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that it is my impression that there is investment in the horticulture sector. I accept that some parts of that sector are doing better than others and that, therefore, the amount of investment being made in different parts of the sector varies. However, it would not be right to expect Departments to carry out the sort of arithmetical exercise that the right hon. Gentleman described. We are ensuring that help is available for improvements in energy efficiency to be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, in the context of state aid from the Department of Trade and Industry to Airbus Industries through BAe Systems, the Government would want to assure themselves before offering help that there was an appropriate environment in which that help could be used and a real investment project that could be assisted by public moneys?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> One of the features of the horticulture sector is that it is extremely fragmented. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, there are lots of small players in all parts of the country, as well as a few larger ones, and we would not attempt to forecast what each of those individual firms will do.
<P>
Let me remind the Committee what we are offering the horticulture sector. In addition to the temporary 50 per cent. reduction in the rate of the levy, there is a special package of support allocated from the £50 million energy efficiency fund. We are extending the list of investments that qualify for enhanced capital allowances to include the thermal screens used in glasshouses. I had the opportunity to see one when I visited Great Yarmouth. They are enormous screens that cover the side walls of glasshouses. Finally, there is the levy discount itself.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would change the word ``intends'' to ``would have intended''. The right hon. Gentleman did not explain his purpose, but it might have been to ensure that business did not have to pay back levy if they used electricity or gas for another purpose. The precise administrative arrangements will be covered in regulations, but either the horticulturalist will be able to claim back the levy or the supplier will charge only 50 per cent. in the first place. Customs and Excise is still considering which of those alternatives offers the best option. Either way, the provision is based on an existing measure for heating gas and oil, which has worked well for about half a century. I am sure that Customs and Excise will adopt a sensible approach and that the circumstances that the amendment was designed to remedy will not arise.
<P>
Amendment No. 77, tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, raises the question of what is the right rate for the levy, given that a payment should be made. Should it be 50 per cent. or 33 per cent? We believe that 50 per cent. strikes the right balance between protecting the competitiveness of UK firms and maintaining an added incentive to save energy. We can be optimistic that it will also be consistent with the EU's state aid rules. I shall say a little more about that in a moment and pick up on some of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Fylde. We have offered an 80 per cent. discount for firms in the negotiated agreements. That reflects the additional requirements imposed on them arising from the IPPC directive and the fact that those firms will have to implement all cost effective energy-saving measures in order to qualify for a discount. In contrast, the discount for horticulture is unconditional. It is appropriate that there should be a margin between the 50 per cent. figure that we have set and the 80 per cent. figure in the negotiated agreements. I suggest that the balance between those two figures is about right.
<P>
European Union state aid approval is important. As I said, we have applied for the 50 per cent. reduction for five years. The Netherlands case is important because competition between the Dutch horticulture sector and ours is intense. I believe that the Netherlands applied for 100 per cent. exemption for agriculture when its tax started in 1996, which was eventually approved to the end of 1999, but that the Netherlands increased its tax rates in January 2000. My understanding, which is different from that of the right hon. Member for Fylde, is that horticulture firms will have to pay that increase, but I shall have to check whether that it so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Can the Minister say what percentage that increase is?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No; when I have checked whether my understanding of events is accurate, I shall confirm it in writing and include the figures in my letter.
<P>
I believe that the European Union will be taking an increasingly careful look at applications for 100 per cent. exemptions for such measures. It will be right to do so, because it takes the view, as we do, that everyone should have the incentive to reduce energy and so contribute to meeting the climate change objectives. On those grounds, too, it is right that the horticulture sector should make a levy payment.
<P>
It is important that the subject is considered in the context of other changes. The United Kingdom has a low rate of business taxation, and our rate of corporation tax is the lowest in the EU. Firms in the horticulture sector can take advantage of the exemptions for renewable energy or combined heat and power. The horticulture sector uses a significant amount of the latter. The new electricity trading arrangements mean that there are likely to be significant reductions in the cost of electricity All those factors must be taken into account in providing a broad picture of what will happen in the horticulture sector in the months ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> What is the principal source of energy heat for the horticulture sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Gentleman quoted an example in which the principal fuel was gas. I am aware of the sector's substantial use of gas and fuels other than electricity.
<P>
It is important to take a broad, overall view of the changes that are about to take place in the horticulture sector. In the light of that broad consideration, we have taken the view that it is right to offer a special rate for horticulture and that 50 per cent. is the right rate at which to set the levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for his remarks, which, as always, were thoughtful and considered. The right hon. Member for Fylde put the point cogently on behalf of individual horticulturalists about the impact of the levy on their profitability, their capacity to invest to overcome or bypass the problems of energy consumption and—more dramatically—the whole future of the industry, including employment.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the horticulture sector declines and we have to resort to imports, that will scarcely benefit the Treasury and its calculations. Horticulture is the only profitable sector of agriculture. It has an international market in which there are international ramifications. The competition comes not solely from other members of the European Union but from other continents.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood asked about benign industries and malign industries. Fortunately, there is no list in the schedule of what those are. However, the net impact on the environment of the horticulture sector is substantially less grave than the net impact of many industrial and commercial sectors. The fastest growing sector of energy use is the commercial sector. We are hitching up more computers, fax machines and fancy bits of electronic equipment in our hitherto steam-driven offices.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the 50:50 balance—the 50 per cent. discount—was intended to provide a balance between competitiveness and the incentive to change. I agree with that underlying idea. I also agree that taxation is needed to drive that process forward, which is why I moved an amendment to introduce a carbon tax as a substitute for the levy. I do not dispute the need to balance competitiveness and incentives to change, but the Financial Secretary has got the balance wrong. The right hon. Member for Fylde gave some straightforward practical explanations of why that might be the case, and I hope that my comments and those of the right hon. Member for Wells have added weight to his argument.
<P>
The Financial Secretary argued that there was a 100 per cent. rate, a 50 per cent. rate for horticulturalists and a 20 per cent. rate for IPPC-exempt groups, and that the 50 per cent. rate for horticulturalists was in the middle and must be about right. That rough and ready calculation takes little account of the vastly different circumstances and impacts of the high energy users who qualify for the 20 per cent. payment rate and the horticulturalists who have to pay the 50 per cent. rate. If high energy users can get into an IPPC category, they can take advantage of the 20 per cent. rate—an 80 per cent. discount. However, a benign industry such as horticulture has to be content with a 50 per cent. discount. That is not the right way forward. The basis of the amendment is sound.
<P>
The Financial Secretary made a point about the opportunities for horticulture to swap to alternative sources of energy. He seemed at one point to imagine that the primary fuel used by the horticulture sector was electricity. Of course, that is not true. Indeed, in some cases the excess carbon dioxide is a benefit to the producers. There are opportunities to swap to alternative technologies; let us hope that in the five year transition period the balance is sufficiently in their favour to allow that investment to proceed.
<P>
One of the things that the Financial Secretary offered as a way out of the difficulties was combined heat and power. In a point of order earlier, I mentioned that the Opposition were still unclear about the types of schemes that would be included as good quality CHP and therefore exempt from the levy. A prime example of an allegedly bad quality CHP scheme, which is at present excluded, is the one operated by British Sugar, which is fuelled to a considerable extent by agricultural by-products, but which at other times of the year must rely on gas. That appears to fall foul of the good quality rules.
<P>
At a quarter to one, 15 minutes before the Committee met, I obtained from the Library a copy of the information about what will be considered good quality CHP, but the Committee has not had a chance to evaluate it, and the horticultural sector certainly has not. I do not mind guessing that, when we come to consider good and not-so-good CHP, many horticulturalists' schemes will not qualify. The Financial Secretary acknowledged the basic arguments, about the need for a balance between competitiveness and incentives and about the need for a discount for horticulturalists, but he has taken too bland and complacent a view about the impact of the proposed tax. He is too glib about the alternatives available to horticulture and I hope that even at this late stage he and his colleagues will agree to amendment No. 77.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I was grateful to the Financial Secretary for his remarks in response to my representations on behalf of horticulture. I want to examine the principle that he prayed in aid when he contrasted my amendments with those tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that industries of all types should pay some form of levy. In debating earlier amendments, I have discussed my reservations about the approach. However, if we assume that the climate change levy will be imposed, we need to think about mitigating circumstances affecting industries with particular requirements.
<P>
I said at the outset—I am sorry if I did not make things entirely clear—that I accepted that the black and white terms of my amendment might not be entirely acceptable to the Financial Secretary. I was interested when he said that we had effectively negotiated our five-year 50 per cent. discount. I almost had the feeling that a decision had been made to put that package forward. It was not necessarily a matter of where it could have gone. If the number was not 50 and could not be 100, could it have been something in between? Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee, even in theory, how far he might have gone with respect to the percentage discount? Did he rehearse any numbers bigger than 50 before alighting on that? As always, 50 is a neat number. It is half way between zero and 100. It sounds good; half price—take the trick. However, it will still visit great expense on the industry.
<P>
I remind the Financial Secretary of the real-world effects of what he has been talking about. The owner of a large-scale salad and tomato enterprise with a turnover of £5.4 million told me that the levy on its business is an extra cost of £80,000. Another plant-raising and tomato business, whose turnover is £2.4 million and whose profit is £42,000, has levy costs, even with the 50 per cent. rebate, of £13,000—straight off the bottom line.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the industry will have had two years to get ready: the year that has gone since the announcement of the measure and the year that is to come between now and when it is introduced. Could not the Government have galvanised themselves into a frenzy of investment in energy saving so that everything would be all right? I have given five or six examples of the level of profitability in the industry. Although the hon. Member for Hazel Grove rightly says that some horticultural sectors are still profitable, it is not an area in which you, Mr. Cook, would put your money. Perhaps I presume too much; you might be a generous spirited investor, but I doubt that the Financial Secretary would part with his money and invest in horticulture at the present time.
<P>
I shall re-emphasise why I believe that, even at this late stage, a case can be made for a figure greater than 50 per cent.—even if it cannot be 100 per cent.—as the rate of discount. Price pressure and pressure on returns mean that the industry is not flush with funds. It receives no support from the common agricultural policy. No state money goes into horticulture; it has always survived by its own abilities. At present, it is hanging on in there, and the request that underpins the amendment is to ask the Financial Secretary to be a little more generous with the transitional period. I acknowledge that he wants the industry to pay something towards energy saving and, notwithstanding the Government's track record, something is better than nothing.
<P>
Not unnaturally, the Financial Secretary landed on the Netherlands in his response to my comments. I am grateful for his acceptance that there may be a difference. He said that the Netherlands has enjoyed a 100 per cent. reduction—a non-climate change levy—from 1996 to 1999. By his own admission, the hon. Gentleman does not yet know, but it may have to pay something towards tax. We do not know what the tax is nor do we know what the something is, but it seems that the Netherlands is not being asked to pay all of it. I do not know at this juncture where that leaves the relative positions of our principal glasshouse competitor and our industry.
<P>
Perhaps in the cause of brevity, the Financial Secretary chose not to refer to the position in Spain and Portugal. I stress that the Spanish and the Portuguese are squeezing our season. There is no levy in Spain or Portugal, and those countries have the advantages of natural climatic gain in energy. Some people may say, ``So what. Our industry can die. We can buy the goods from Spain or Portugal,'' but that emphasises my arguments about employment. If the industry is to survive, there are times when it needs a little more help. Notwithstanding the Financial Secretary's correct explanation of the 80 per cent. discount in the context of companies affected by IPPC, many horticulturalists still do not fully understand why the horticulture industry cannot have a higher level of discount, even for a limited five-year period. It would be degressive, which was another matter to which the hon. Gentleman did not refer in his remarks.
<P>
It seems ironic that we impose a tax on ourselves, but have to go to the European Union to renegotiate whatever discounts we may think are appropriate. If those are the rules that must be followed, I should have thought that for what it would cost to require the industry to give even a binding undertaking over that period to make percentage savings, the Financial Secretary could have safeguarded his intellectual and practical position that the industry should make a contribution while giving it a genuine opportunity.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Why has the industry not made those investments in the past year? The answer is that it is struggling to hang on in there. It is not an industry of high profitability and it must invest in other factors, including new structures such as glasshouses to increase light transmission. The Financial Secretary was right about thermal screens. Some of those investments have already been made. Therefore, the scope for the industry to make quantum leaps in energy-saving investment is limited. Imposing the tax will make it more difficult for the industry to catch up and reach the stage that the Government want it to reach in saving energy.
<P>
I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, but I want to make these points on behalf of the industry because its survival is near and dear to my heart. I would be letting the horticultural industry down if I did not ensure that we examine the facts that those who work in the industry have put to me in praying in aid their case. I want to ensure that when they read the report of the debate in the Grower magazine they understand what was said on their behalf. They will want to know why they now seem to be going into battle in a relatively uncompetitive position versus foreign horticulturalists.
<P>
The Financial Secretary also prayed in aid enhanced capital allowances. However, capital allowances benefit only those who are making a profit. If the industry is struggling with profitability, capital allowances will not at this juncture generate the levels of investment that he intends. If the Financial Secretary will not, as I sense, agree to my amendment or that tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, I hope that he might at least give us a crumb of comfort that even at this late stage the industry might have one last opportunity to make its case for a more relaxed regime between now and when we discuss the Bill on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that I can give the right hon. Gentleman what he asks for. We have already introduced a substantial and significant package of support for the horticultural sector and I cannot hold out the prospect that we shall move any further.
<P>
I respect the strength of feeling that the right hon. Gentleman has expressed on the matter and his knowledge of the sector. We felt that a figure of 50 per cent. struck the right balance. He asked whether I had proposed several figures, tried them out in Brussels and decided that 50 per cent. was the one that I would be allowed to introduce. That was not how it worked. The figure of 50 per cent. was the one that we concluded was right, as it represented a balance of all the considerations that we have discussed.
<P>
I hope that I did not give the impression that I was claiming that we had already been given the go-ahead, or a green light, from those responsible for EU state aid rules, because we have not yet received approval. However, I am optimistic that we shall.
<P>
I realise that a wide of range of differences exist in the fiscal environment and in other aspects between the UK and Spain and Portugal. As the right hon. Member for Fylde said, the horticultural sector in Spain and Portugal benefits a great deal from the climate compared with the horticultural sector in the UK. Equally, however, the UK has the attraction of a wider business tax environment that is good in comparison with elsewhere in the EU. Given the range of considerations involved, the 50 per cent. rate that we propose for horticulture amply recognises the special considerations and circumstances that apply to the sector. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 157, leave out lines 13 to 19.
<P>
The amendment is on a short but important point. Paragraphs 45 to 47 give a wide discretion to the Secretary of State to mitigate the application of the climate change levy. As we are only too well aware, wherever the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has a discretion, he exposes himself to judicial review. In our opinion, it is important that the discretion is exercised fairly and that an unfair exercise of it can be challenged.
<P>
I am indebted to the Institute of Directors for making that point, and have to express its concern that paragraph 47(6), which the amendment would remove, might be relied on to excuse the Secretary of State from entering into or approving an agreement when he had already entered into or approved another agreement with a party who had no better grounds for seeking one. It gives almost a statutory defence to the Secretary of State. We would be grateful for the Financial Secretary's reply to this probing amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining the thinking behind the amendment. Paragraph 47(6) is needed to ensure that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has control over the climate change agreements process. Without its provisions, he would be required to enter into any agreement at the request of any person. That would be unreasonable, as it would remove his discretion. It would be administratively impractical as well. If the power were not in place, that could lead to thousands of company-specific agreements instead of the much more sensible and planned sector agreements that are being developed, each of which may cover scores of sites in a given sector. The power is necessary and helpful, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be content to leave it in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) made it clear that it is a probing amendment. It gives the Financial Secretary the opportunity to be more forthcoming than some of the Government's material on the criteria that the Secretary of State will use in determining whether to enter into an agreement. The Financial Secretary said that the paragraph is necessary to establish the principle that the Secretary of State has the discretion to decide, under the terms of the relevant paragraphs, whether to do so.
<P>
I accept that a negotiation process is intended and that the Secretary of State must be free to reach a judgment about whether his policy objectives are met before signing an agreement that gives certain taxpayers an 80 per cent. discount on the tax. However, before Parliament gives the Secretary of State such discretion we should at least have some understanding of the policy objectives that he will pursue in using it. Unless another paragraph that I have not spotted gives the Financial Secretary a more appropriate opportunity to tell us what the policy objectives would be, will he now outline the scope of the discretion that the Secretary of State seeks? In order to know where the limits lie, we need to understand what agreements would fall outside the limit—what would be ultra vires—and in what circumstances the discretion of the Secretary of State would be in danger of being successfully challenged in court. Although he is given discretion under the legislation, he could stray outside the scope of the policy objectives for which the discretion was designed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The intention is to focus relief on energy-intensive sectors that are subject to international competition. We set out some of the aims that we would need to take into account in responding to alternative propositions that people might make. Those entering into agreements will have to pass the tests of eligibility, which are intended to target relief in the way that I have described. Such people will receive a discount if they meet the Government's demanding energy efficiency or carbon-saving targets set out in the agreements.
<P>
Participating sectors will be required to agree to targets that require the installation of all cost-effective energy efficiency measures by 2010, although it will be for them to decide how to achieve their targets. Participants will not be required to agree to targets that are not cost-effective in their own right. Any decision on entering to agreements would be subject to the usual test of whether the Secretary of State had behaved reasonably the Wednesbury test. The discretion given to the Secretary of State should stay in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Financial Secretary is addressing himself to my question but not allaying my concerns. He said that the reason, and the starting point, for the discretionary agreements for big energy users is the forces of international competition. That is why we have the provisions in the Bill. He then said that the Secretary of State would allow an 80 per cent. discount for companies with whom he made an agreement.
<P>
The key phrase in the Financial Secretary's response was that the taxpayer must agree to ``demanding targets''. It is envisaged that, in the absence of an agreement, the taxpayer will pay the full climate change levy. The taxpayer is subject to international competition; otherwise he would not be in the frame for one of the agreements. His competitor agrees targets with the Secretary of State, which gives that competitor an 80 per cent. discount from the tax. The taxpayer in question is still in competition, but he is paying 500 per cent. more tax than his competitor because the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has concluded that the target that the first taxpayer is willing to agree to is not sufficiently demanding. Both taxpayers are in international competition.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Committee needs to pause a little on the almost unqualified discretion of the Secretary of State. The Bill makes a distinction between two taxpayers—it requires one taxpayer to pay a full tax rate and the other to pay only 20 per cent. What are the confines of the Secretary of State's discretion, or is the Committee simply to delegate the most fundamental principle of the purse strings, around which the authority of the House at Commons has been built for centuries, to the private, virtually unqualified discretion of the Secretary of State? Unless he says otherwise, the Financial Secretary must be asking us to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I hope that I can allay the right hon. Gentleman's concerns. The agreements are being taken forward on a sector-wide basis, not firm by firm. Usually, the negotiations are with established sector trade organisations, so the position that he fears will not arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That will be so provided that the Government's understanding of a sector is exactly the same as that of the taxpayer and that the concept of a sector does not change as the economy changes. One of the basic principles of tax law is that we cannot define economic activity too accurately in advance, because, by its nature, it changes all the time.
<P>
I remain anxious that the Government are delegating the power to set tax to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, with almost no confines to his discretion. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will approach the matter from a different angle and consider what would happen if an industry organisation said, hand on heart, to the Secretary of State: ``This is all that we can do. This is all that our competitors do in Holland.'' We have excellent officials in the civil service, but not all of them are up to the minute in understanding what is going on in individual marketplaces. They could have been told that more was possible and say: ``These people are pulling the wool over your eyes, Minister. Stick out for it.'' If the Secretary of State did that, the sector would have to pay 100 per cent. tax instead of 20 per cent. and would lose out on international competition because of his discretion. Is the Financial Secretary asking us to support that proposition?

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> What is a sector? We are working with existing sector organisations. For example, one of the negotiations is with the Paper Federation, which is the industry's own organisation. Companies have formed a host of organisations that are involved in the negotiations. As for the fear that the Secretary of State might be badly advised or make unrealistic demands, technical support is being provided by the energy technology support unit of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which is a well supported organisation. It has not been difficult to determine what is reasonable and cost-effective during the lifetime of such agreements—it is a well-established technical decision, not a controversial one. I hope that I have reassured the right hon. Gentleman that, on this occasion, his fears are without foundation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It is for my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to respond to the debate on his probing amendment. Were the amendment pressed, the Financial Secretary would no doubt secure enough votes, but he has allayed none of my fears—indeed, he has fed a number of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am deeply indebted to my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood for adding flesh to the arguments that I advanced. I started by thinking that this was an important probing amendment, but he has raised considerable additional concerns. I have learnt today that the test of the reasonable man, for the purposes of judicial review, is no longer provided by the man on the Clapham omnibus; instead, the Wednesbury test is used. Perhaps, on another occasion, the Financial Secretary will tell me what that is.
<P>
Important points have been raised, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will reflect on them. Hon. Members may want to return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(34) Sites where the total annual energy costs exceed £100,000 and energy costs represent more than two per cent. of the total revenue costs of the site.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendments in the group deal with rebates that may be granted to energy-intensive industries. Those industries will be at least permitted to enter into negotiations with a view to receiving a rebate of up to 80 per cent. Our amendments seek, in different ways, to allow additional industries to qualify for those rebates, and to iron out arbitrary distinctions between those sectors that qualify and those that do not.
<P>
The schedule contains a table of qualifying energy-intensive installations. The problem is that it is based on a completely separate European Union directive—the integrated pollution prevention and control directive—which was issued on 24 September 1996. As its name suggests, it deals with pollution matters, not energy efficiency matters. Because of that, and because the Government have more or less adopted the same list of industrial sectors, a large number of curious anomalies exist. Landfill sites will qualify for rebates, but not aircraft production. However, landfill sites do not face international competition. The aircraft industry does, and is a large user of energy and extremely vulnerable to competition from other countries that have no intention of introducing an energy tax. That tax will render uncompetitive large sections of British industry that do not fall within the definitions under the IPPC directive.
<P>
The list of other qualifying sites includes installations for:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the disposal or recycling of animal carcases,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the production of food products by the treatment and processing of—
<P>
(i) animal raw materials<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the incineration of municipal waste—
<P>
</UL></FONT>although one might have thought that incinerators produced more energy than they used. All those sites are included because they are potentially polluting; that flows naturally from adoption of the categorisation under the directive. Meanwhile, however, large sections of industry are excluded that are substantial users of energy and wish to enter into negotiations to qualify for rebate.
<P>
Another exclusion is vehicle manufacturing, which has recently been in the news. The Confederation of British Industry has sent all members of the Committee a parliamentary brief saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>individual vehicle manufacturers in the UK will have to pay annually in excess of £1 million net energy tax.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a curious way of helping our vehicle manufacturers when at least one of them faces ferocious competition from abroad and may shut down. The CBI notes that vehicle and component manufacturers are being taxed despite reducing their CO2 emissions by 25 per cent. over the past 10 years. They have made themselves more energy efficient, but they do not qualify for a rebate under the tax.
<P>
There are many other anomalies. BOC, a group that has been mentioned previously, is not covered by the IPPC regulations because it is in the non-polluting business of air separation. Most or all of that group's sites will have to pay the energy tax in full, which will amount to £8.4 million a year. That is a curious way of helping an industry in an international market. There is nothing that BOC can do about the price of the gases, which is set internationally, but the Government are deliberately adding to the costs, which are incurred nationally.
<P>
There is another smaller but striking anomaly in the metal forging industry. In that industry there are two types of equipment—the hammer and the press. Sites employing the hammer-based process alone are covered under the IPPC directive, and they alone will qualify for rebates. The hammer-based process is less energy efficient than the press-based process, but the section of the industry that uses a press will not be eligible for rebate. The Government are creating an Alice in Wonderland scenario by penalising the sector that uses the more energy-efficient process.
<P>
The CBI reports that one firm in Worcestershire called UEF will have an annual net energy tax bill of about £1 million, which represents an increase of about 20 per cent. on its energy bill. The Prime Minister has lectured British industry this week on the need to raise its game, improve its competitiveness and become more productive. In the same week as he says that, the Committee is debating a new imposition on to industry's costs, which it cannot avoid because it cannot even negotiate a rebate with the Government based on reduced energy use.
<P>
I would like the Minister to comment on the fact that internationally vulnerable businesses anxious to cut their energy bills and enter into negotiations are unable to do so because of the arbitrary way in which the table—which is based on a different concept of pollution control—was drawn up.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Engineering Employers Federation has sent us correspondence, which endorses what the Confederation of British Industry has said. I believe it has written to all hon. Members. Given that fact, the silence of Labour Members—at least the Back Benchers—is surprising. Labour Members used to pride themselves on their attachment to manufacturing industry. They used to evince, publicly at least, some concern for the manufacturing work force. However, if these jobs are exported because of this misconceived tax, it will be that very work force who will suffer. The EEF has given us the example of a member company engaged in the heat treatment of metals. It is excluded from seeking any negotiated agreement. It faces a tax bill of an extra £900,000 a year, which will take out some 15 per cent. of its profit. It expects to have to cut back on capital expenditure and on the very furnaces and new motors that would have made it more energy efficient. The tax will damage a firm's ability to comply with the Government's attempts to cut carbon dioxide emissions.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 would add to the qualifying sites those whose total energy costs exceed £100,000 and are more than 2 per cent. of the total revenue cost of the site. That would add a category, and therefore help the firm that I have just mentioned.
<P>
The other point I want to raise with the Minister relates to state aid. If I am right about these anomalies and distinctions, which make no industrial sense, they could fall foul of the European Union strictures against state aid. We have received advice that draft guidelines have been issued by the European Commission on state aid for environmental protection. We are not discussing the generality of state aid and the legislation governing it, but a specific European Union initiative to stop the environment being used as a cover for state aid, Industry is extremely worried that the rebate negotiated by certain privileged industries will fall foul of the guidelines.
<P>
We know that the Government have discussed the matter with the European Commission, We would like to know what the outcome of those talks has been so far. We particularly want to know when the issue will be settled. As the tax is due to be introduced next April, the industry is eager to know whether the rebates will be granted and whether it is worth negotiating with the Government. A huge amount of time and effort will be wasted if the rebates are classified as illegal state aids at the last minute. Can the Minister give us some idea of when the issue will be settled?
<P>
Can the Minister also tell us what will happen if the rebates are classified as illegal? Will the Government withdraw the tax, or at least postpone it?
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I draw the attention of my right hon. Friend to the fact that when the Financial Secretary defined the purpose of the exemptions—the 20 per cent. class that he offered—he explicitly said that the motivation was to allow firms to compete more effectively in the open market. That was how he answered the question that I asked 20 minutes ago. Surely that explicitly contravenes the state aid legislation. The serious risk is that it will lead to precisely the eventuality that my right hon. Friend is asking about. If the Government acknowledge that those firms are the subject of competitive threat, how will they react if the European Union declares it illegal for them to protect those companies, given that they acknowledge that to be necessary and desirable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend is right. Indeed, the amendments build on our previous debate, to which the Financial Secretary gave a most unsatisfactory answer. We want to know what is likely to be the attitude of the European Commission. The Minister has discussed the matter with the Commission. What are the draft guidelines? How likely are they to meet my right hon. Friend's point? What will the Government do if they are declared to have acted in breach of those guidelines? Will we insist on modifying the European Union's position? If so, shall we have allies in other member states? Are we likely to succeed? If those guidelines are insisted upon, what will happen to the firms concerned, which, in good faith, have not only negotiated those agreements but will have incurred the necessary expenditure and are likely to have started installing the necessary equipment to comply with the energy consumption reductions?
<P>
Those are serious matters. I hope that the Minister can give a proper and full reply. The Committee and industry generally are most anxious to have those questions answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I support the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, but from another point of view. I have been reflecting on what the Financial Secretary said at our previous sitting about fiscal neutrality, which is one of the Government's great claims for the measure. That led me to think about economic neutrality. Has the Treasury asked its economists to consider the tax in detail, especially in relation to the firms that my right hon. Friend mentioned?
<P>
One of the examples used by my right hon. Friend was British Oxygen Company. The Financial Secretary's claim is that the tax is fiscally neutral; he was aware that we would debate the point, but I leave it to one side for the moment. It is supposed to be fiscally neutral because the increase in tax borne by industry will be offset by a decrease in national insurance contributions. I ignore also the fact that the distributional impact of that so-called fiscal neutrality is uneven.
<P>
Let us suppose that BOC's national insurance decrease exactly compensated for the increase in its tax bill caused by the climate change levy. The companies that my right hon. Friend described would still have an enormous problem, because the decrease in national insurance contributions is a decrease in a fixed cost, whereas, for the industries that my right hon. Friend has described, the increase in the climate change levy is either partly or, for a process industry such as BOC, almost entirely a variable cost.
<P>
When Ramsey pricing obtains in such industries, firms are able to charge a large proportion of their less price-resistant customers above the marginal cost of production because of a lack of over-supply in the industry. There would be a problem for an industry situated in the UK, such as BOC, if its variable cost of production rose at the most price-sensitive end of the range due to the climate change levy. Such conditions are familiar and are occurring in another of the industries that my right hon. Friend mentioned—the car industry. They occur systemically and cyclically in ammonia production and in almost all large-scale industrial processes in BOC's business. I cannot recall offhand whether I have an interest in the matter, so for the sake of avoiding doubt I declare that I might have an interest.
<P>
In the case of an over-supply, Ramsey pricing breaks down, both in the UK and in our competitor countries. Plants such as those of Rover and BOC must be able to compete with the producer in its industrial sphere that has the lowest marginal cost of production. Otherwise it will not be able to sell the next car or litre of gas.
<P>
On reflection, I find what the Financial Secretary has told the Committee genuinely astonishing because it shows economic illiteracy. He is proud of the fact that he has managed to construct the tax so that, even supposing we admit his fiscal neutrality argument, he has shifted a burden of tax for the industries under discussion from a fixed cost base to a variable cost base. He has made it more likely that firms will be forced by market pressure to diminish production or to shut down when they go through systemic and cyclical occurrences of over-supply in their industry sector.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells denoted as a class industries that do not get into the energy-intensive category; he gave reasons for that. The energy component in those industries is a variable rather than fixed cost, by contrast with a corner-shop, for example, which my right hon. Friend said would also be affected, but which would not have to pay more for energy when it sold an extra stamp or tube of toothpaste. The industries to which my right hon. Friend has alluded are in the opposite position. Their economic situation will be significantly affected by the structure of the tax.
<P>
I have been trying to work out how the situation could have arisen. The Treasury has not consulted its economists properly on the matter. It has not defined the categories so as to exempt industries for which the input energy cost is largely a variable cost of production. Rather, it has taken a completely different defining characteristic, as my right hon. Friend said. It has consequently not exempted a group of firms that will suffer greatly and disproportionately from the taxes. We are not considering an immediate effect on their pocket or the loss of money to the taxman, but the geared effect of the firms' loss of market share, especially in times of over production. As we all know, that can have a long-run effect on the structure of the British industrial and manufacturing base.
<P>
It might be that I am wrong and that the Financial Secretary has consulted Treasury economists on the matter in great detail, that he understands entirely the variable cost structures of the industries that my right hon. Friend spoke about and that he has a good explanation of how he achieved not only so-called fiscal neutrality but economic neutrality for the industries. I look forward to hearing from the Financial Secretary if that is the case. He would be able to tell us what component of the variable costs of those industries, especially short-run marginal costs, was associated with energy. He could say what effect the climate change levy would have on those marginal costs. Further, he could tell us what production function had been assessed using the Treasury model to determine the level of overcapacity or undercapacity in those sectors as a result of the climate change levy. It is the role of economists to go through those simulations and examine the effect of the climate change levy in different economic circumstances on given industry sectors. As the Department of Trade and Industry has teams of economists that are devoted to such analysis, the analysis should be available. If I am quite wrong, and there is an analysis to prove that I am wrong, I hope that the Financial Secretary will put it in the Library or send it to Committee members. In the absence of such a document, we can only assume that, for the industries identified by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, the tax is, although fiscally neutral, economically illiterate.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The list of energy-intensive installations in paragraph 49 is, as the right hon. Member for Wells said, based on the list of processes in the IPPC directive. Installations that are covered by the directive will have a regulatory requirement to use energy efficiently. That will not apply to sites in other sectors. It is a significant additional regulatory requirement, and it is appropriate and fair for those sectors to be treated differently for the purposes of the climate change levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Can the Financial Secretary help me? The IPPC was not designed to deal with energy matters. Why did the Government adopt that mechanism to be the identifier of industries with high energy usage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It has a number of important benefits. It covers the main energy-intensive sectors of industry, entails a requirement to use energy efficiently and provides legal certainty for determining who is eligible to enter into negotiated agreements. There are important virtues in using the IPPC basis that is set out in paragraph 49.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde asked exactly the right question. We want a list of companies that are energy intensive, but we have a list of companies that are polluters. What is the connection between them? In November's pre-Budget report, the Government said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government remains willing to consider suggestions for alternative definitions which would target the relief on energy intensive sectors exposed to international competition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As that is apparently still the Government's policy, are they still willing to consider alternative suggestions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have certainly been willing to consider alternative suggestions, one of which is contained in the amendment. The energy intensity threshold that it proposes would add considerably to the complexity of the arrangement. It would be necessary to define energy intensity, although I am not sure what definition would be used; to specify the threshold; to set out procedures for measuring energy intensity and for assessing energy costs and other costs of each installation before it is allowed into an agreement; to measure those costs in each subsequent year to ensure that an installation remains eligible; and to design procedures for new installations for which there are no historic data.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde referred—correctly, I think—to the fact that hundreds of extra civil servants were taken on in Germany to administer the arrangement there. The proposed arrangement in the amendment would be complex and bureaucratically difficult to implement. That is not an attractive feature for a well-designed tax, and the climate change levy is a well-designed tax. [Laughter.] The amendment would introduce a serious design flaw into the levy. Using a threshold such as that which is proposed would, perversely, penalise installations that improve their energy efficiency and then find that they are below the threshold. Such companies would then find that they are suddenly no longer entitled to the rebate. Equally, firms that are currently just above the threshold would have no incentive to improve their energy efficiency, as they would fall below the threshold and lose the rebate by doing so. In addition, firms that have done the right thing and made energy efficiency improvements that place them below the threshold would be penalised, while firms that are just above the threshold would benefit from a more advantageous regime.
<P>
The change proposed by the Opposition would, therefore, introduce a serious design flaw into a well-„designed tax.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Financial Secretary confirm that, because the Opposition have not supplied a foolproof definition of energy-intensive industry, the Government policy is merely to offer in its place a definition according to which an energy-intensive industry is a polluter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that the proposition advanced by his right hon. Friend the Member for Wells is not foolproof and is deeply flawed. That is certainly correct. I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment and that the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who has acknowledged its failings, will not support it either. There is a good match between energy-intensive firms that are subject to international competition and those in the IPPC list. In addition, the IPPC basis has the substantial practical benefits that I have listed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Financial Secretary's defence is that we have one concept and another concept; there happens to be an overlap, and as there is no other list we should take the existing one, which has a high overlap. What is the scale of the overlap? Are 90 per cent. of polluters energy intensive or 85 per cent.? If the latter is the case, how does the Financial Secretary defend the imposition of the tax on the 15 per cent. that should not have to pay it? How does he defend prevention of the 15 per cent. on the other side of the Venn diagram from having access to the discount?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have been working closely with the CBI. Lord Marshall was its president when he started work on this matter, and he advised that we should introduce a tax such as that which I have outlined. The CBI has pointed out that 60 per cent. of manufacturing energy will be covered by the negotiated agreements. In addition, bearing in mind that the levy will be broadly revenue-neutral for the manufacturing sector, many manufacturing firms will gain from the levy package as it currently stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that I shall give the right hon. Member for Fylde a go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The hon. Gentleman will regret that. Is he aware of the observation made on IPPC coverage by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in its ninth report, which was published on 19 July of last year and which is entitled ``Impact on Industry of the Climate Change Levy''? The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Administrative convenience would seem to be the only reason why the Government has chosen to use IPPC coverage to define energy intensive industries.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does the hon. Gentleman respond to that argument, which is central to the line of questioning by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is certainly true that the approach is administratively convenient. It is also legally watertight and there is a good match between the firms that we are targeting and the firms on the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that the Financial Secretary will in due course answer the question whether sheer energy intensiveness is a good idea in the first place for defining the companies. If he were to discover, or if we were to discover on his behalf, that the consumption level of bananas by chief executives gave a good match with energy intensity in the industry—better than the IPPC—would he be happy for that measure to be in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will pass over that intervention, I think.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No; I will make further headway in explaining to the Committee why it would not be sensible to agree to the amendment.
<P>
Another feature of the amendment, which was mentioned in passing by the right hon. Member for Wells but the reason for which I am not sure about, was a £100,000-a-year energy cost threshold. Firms that spent less than £100,000 a year on energy would not qualify for the rebate, whereas those spending just over that figure would do so, although the firms might be identical in other respects. That would introduce another serious flaw into the design of the levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It would save time if the Financial Secretary would read the full panoply of our amendment, which provides an additional category. Industries could qualify under the existing list or there would be that additional option. It is not an alternative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The point that I am making is that, under the right hon. Gentleman's proposal, those that happened to be spending £100,001 would be eligible for a reduction, whereas those spending £99,999 would not. That sort of arbitrary distinction would not make sense and I suspect that it would also run into serious difficulties with the EU state aids rules that we have discussed.
<P>
Amendment No. 105 deals with car manufacturing, which is not a particularly energy-intensive process. Energy intensity relates to a figure of about 3 per cent. on average. Car manufacturers will gain significantly from the 0.3 percentage point reduction in employers' national insurance contributions. They will also be able to take advantage of the proposed enhanced capital allowances for energy-efficiency equipment, such as combined heat and power—boilers, motors and lighting are relevant—and any such savings in energy will immediately reduce the figure of £1 million that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. Electricity prices will fall as a result of the new electricity trading arrangements and that will have an effect in reducing the figure.
<P>
Concern was expressed by Opposition Members about the EU state aids rules and whether we would obtain approval for the arrangement of negotiated agreements. I point out to the right hon. Member for Charnwood that the rules explicitly refer to international competitiveness and the need for transitional relief. That is the point of the guidelines, so his fundamental point is not a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This is a genuine question, because I did not understand what the Financial Secretary just said. Presumably, the problem with the proposals from a state aids point of view is that they could be seen to result in a new discrimination that could become illegal, because it would constitute an aid to one competitor as against another. If a new state aid is to be proposed—and it is to that extent that there would be risk—I do not see where the transitional machinery would become involved. The new state aid would be held to be illegal and the tax would be introduced for everybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> But the guidelines reflect the likelihood of a need for transitional protection, given the introduction of an arrangement of the kind envisaged, for the 10-year-period that we have applied for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> If the Government are going to argue that the rebate is legitimate under the rules as a transition, they will presumably be telling the energy-intensive industries that qualify for the 80 per cent. rebate that it is only transitional. They will also have to set out a timetable within which the tax rate will rise from 20 to 100 per cent. We have not heard anything on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is why we have been negotiating on the basis of 10-year agreements. We informed all the interested parties of that at the beginning of the process. We applied for a 10-year period for the agreements because they will be transitional arrangements only.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It will not be remotely credible as a transitional mechanism if it is an exemption for 10 years with a cliff edge at the end. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> What happens beyond the 10 years is a matter for future discussions. We have made it absolutely clear to everyone involved in the process that we want a 10-year state aids permission. That has been the basis for the negotiated agreements. We are working to secure the agreement of the European Commission to the arrangements. 
<P>
The reduction counts as operating aid and is the subject of a current state aid notification. We have linked the availability of the aid to assistance in achieving an important environmental policy objective, which the Commission shares—the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. All the parties taking part in the negotiated agreements are signing up to objectives to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Let me make a little more headway and then I will give way again.
<P>
The Government have prepared a robust and balanced case that will deliver significant environmental benefits while also helping to safeguard the international competitiveness of UK firms. In parallel with that, the European Commission's draft revised guidelines on state aids for environmental protection are being discussed with member states. We are playing a full part in the discussions. The present draft is being revised further in the light of the comments of member states. The discussions are progressing well. We have applied for approval for 10 years. There is no reason to believe that that will be denied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary clarify a point? Could a company owned by a company based in another member state that was outside the arrangements take an action in the European Court on the basis that it was unable to obtain aid in the United Kingdom and was therefore being discriminated against? Would it have a case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Having secured the European Commission's agreement to proceed on the basis of the negotiated agreements, we would be protected. However, we need to obtain that permission, which is why we are in negotiations with European Commission officials.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Leturin) said that he was genuinely astonished—I think that that was his expression. I expected him to use the phrase, ``This defies rationality'', along with other of his usual phrases. What we are doing here is an example of our strategy of shifting the burden of taxation from good things such as employment to bad things such as pollution. That is the principle that has been built in across the range of our environmental tax reforms. It is particularly clear here. I will defend that principle robustly because it is right and because it will promote employment as it reduces the level of employers' national insurance contributions, which will act as a boost for employment.
<P>
From time to time, the Government are accused of not consulting one interest group or another. This is the first time that I have been accused of not consulting Treasury economists. I assure the hon. Member for West Dorset that his fears on that front are misplaced.

<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): My hon. Friend has given the Committee several welcome assurances. He referred to consultation and I am sure that he is aware of some of the concerns of the aluminium industry about not being eligible to make negotiated agreements. Will he reassure me that he is aware of such concerns and that he is listening to the industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The Aluminium Federation is in discussion with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions about a negotiated agreement. It has written in the past few days to the Department raising some concerns and I am confident that they will receive due attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Financial Secretary let it slip that 60 per cent. of all the energy used by British industry is in sectors that are eligible for the lower rate tax. It is a pretty basic principle of good tax policy that, if we want tax levied at a reasonable rate, it must have a broad base. On his own admission, we are talking about a tax that starts life applying to only 40 per cent. of its base at its full rate. The hon. Gentleman volunteered that statistic and the Committee should bear it in mind when considering the tax. It will apply to only 40 per cent. of the base, even before the accumulations of time are built on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is not quite right. It is the CBI's figure and it refers to 60 per cent. of the energy consumed by the manufacturing industry, not business as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Select Committee report stated that the DTI is updating its 10-year-old figures on energy used by the UK industry. If that is the base of the information that has informed the choices of the Financial Secretary and Treasury Ministers about which industries will be in and which will be out, I am deeply worried. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could let the Committee into the secret about what information has driven the choice.
<P>
The hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) referred to the aluminium industry, in response to which the Financial Secretary graciously nodded in her direction. The hon. Lady got more out of him than I did on horticulture earlier. He told her that such a representation would be treated with proper courtesy. The question received the answer that it deserved. It raised in my mind the question why such an highly energy-intensive industry was not included in the first place. It focuses sharply on the analysis of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood that showed that the IPPC, as a proxy arrangement, is but a crude way in which to decide which industry is in, and which is out and why we were right to table the amendment.
<P>
Will the hon. Gentleman explain how up to date the energy figures are and say whether the Treasury received a full list of energy usage by industry in the United Kingdom that was based on the latest data? After all the meticulous activity with the IPPC, why was aluminium missed out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should like to pick up the Minister on some of his points. He has not convincingly answered the debate. He began by saying that the table of industries covered most energy intensive sectors, but we have given him specific examples of those sectors that are not so covered. He has not referred to the BOC problem. That international company uses huge amounts of energy but, because it is not classified as a polluting industry, it will not qualify for the rebate.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the tax was well designed and that our amendments would add complexity to it. Coming from a Government who have introduced a schedule that covers more than 80 pages, that is a bit rich. This is only the tip of the iceberg, given that the secondary legislation, regulations and tertiary legislation from Customs and Excise have not been published yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that an intriguing observation about the design of this tax is that the Government started off with a tax and then immediately said, ``Ah, but, negotiated agreements are okay''? Why did they not do that in the first place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend is unanswerably right. The Minister said that one of our suggested categories—industries using more than a certain amount of energy—was arbitrary. The whole IPPC category is arbitrary, as it is based on entirely the wrong concept—pollution, rather than energy efficiency. In any case, the Minister's schedule includes arbitrary measurements. Power stations will be included only if they exceed 50 MW, so there is a threshold and a dividing line. Our suggestion makes more sense than his. We must get away from the idea that pollution—an entirely separate and irrelevant consideration—should define who can qualify.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Will my right hon. Friend forgive me for not giving way? My eyes are ever on the clock. The Minister was at his weakest when he said that the definition included firms facing international competition. It includes landfill sites, which do not face international competition, yet it excludes motor and aircraft manufacturing, which do. We gave him an example of where he was incorrect, but he persisted in ignoring our point, as though he were certain that the table included all the necessary sectors.
<P>
The Financial Secretary invited industry to have no anxieties about state aid. We need a little more detail rather than that bald assertion. Finally, he asserted that his tax would promote employment. That is no comfort to international industries, which may well migrate. Investment decisions are taking place even now. If we build up a cost base that is out of line with those of our international competitors, businesses will either not come here or will migrate to countries with lower environmental standards, so the global environment will suffer.
<P>
It may not be economists that we need to consult, but industry. An economist is a useful person, but he is someone who, if you have forgotten your telephone number, will estimate it for you.

<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): Is that a joke?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Financial Secretary tried a joke, so I tried one. Unless he can miraculously pull something out of a hat, we will be pressing the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Aluminium has not been omitted. It is in sub-paragraph 9 of paragraph 49(6) of the schedule. The amendment would introduce a major design flaw to the levy. The right hon. Gentleman referred to it, tactfully, as not foolproof. That is certainly true, but it would be a major design flaw and I urge the Committee to reject it.
