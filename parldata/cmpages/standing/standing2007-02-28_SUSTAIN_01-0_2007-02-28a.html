						The
sittings motion reflects two things. The first is that the Bill
deserves proper scrutiny. It is striking the degree to which it enjoys
support in breadth and depth, both in and outside the House. That is
largely because it is recognised as an honest attempt to tackle a
serious problem&#151;the social cost and impact of the loss of so
many local services from communities across the country. That has
consequences on quality of life, particularly for the elderly, on the
strength of local economies, on the environment, owing to the
increasing need to travel by car, and on people&#146;s sense of
engagement and civic participation&#151;their sense of being able to
shape the quality of their environment.</div>
					<a name="07022854000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The second
reason that the sittings motion has set aside good time for scrutiny is
that we recognise, as sponsors of the Bill, that it is honest but not
perfect.It can be improved. It is in that spirit that I
lookforward to a reasonable, good-humoured and open-minded
debate.</div>

different circumstances from those to which I am accustomed. I find
that quite liberating because when I first sat on a Standing Committee,
I listened to the Minister reading out the word &#147;resist&#148;
on many occasions. I now find myself in the privileged position of
deciding whether we shall resist. I say &#147;we&#148;, looking at
my Parliamentary Private Secretary, to whom I am very grateful for

it.</div>
					<a name="07022854000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate
sincerely the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood for taking the Bill
through the House with substantial support on both sides and in the
country for what it is trying to achieve. I have tabled the amendment
to facilitate the debate and to give the Government the opportunity the
put forward their view on clause 1. It is not a wrecking amendment, but
an opportunity for us to respond to the Bill. I am particularly
grateful to him for conducting himself during the proceedings on the
Bill with a good deal of sense and courtesy. I thank him for that and
hope that it is reciprocated. I am sure that he has many years as a
parliamentarian ahead of him and I wish him well in whatever might
happen during his time in the
House.</div>
					<a name="07022854000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
O&#146;Hara, you would not expect any Government to subscribe to a
Bill or campaign that describes the country as a ghost town. That
phrase resonates with me because of the 1980s pop single by The
Specials. I am probably showing my age because some Members are looking
puzzled, either because they are at the older or the younger end of
that generation. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I assure my right hon. Friend
the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras that The Specials were from the
early 1980s. The serious point is that the message about a ghost town
resonated then with my generation in a different context.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div>
					<a name="07022854000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree strongly with part of
the thrust of the Bill: in some communities, small businesses have been
put out of business by competition. I think that the local works
campaign refers to cloning and homogenous communities and argues that
some towns have lost some character and that villages in parts of the
country have suffered, sometimes as a result of increasing numbers of
second homes, which is, of course, a problem of success and prosperity,
although not, I suspect, for residents in such a village who are unable
to find a school for their child. However, other parts of the country
might have suffered for different
reasons.</div>
					<a name="07022854000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Bill addresses, as do the Government, policies such as planning and
asks the question, &#147;Are such policies making this process more
difficult to handle?&#148; The Bill, therefore, asks the same
question as the Government are asking: &#147;What can public policy
do to help to ensure that our communities are sustainable?&#148; The
Government claim authorship of the phrase &#147;sustainable
community&#148;. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime
Minister made it the logo for his Department. In a debate about eight
years ago, I remember being chided by Opposition Members for using what
was claimed by one Member in particular to be a &#147;meaningless
load of waffle&#148;. I took the point; I knew what he meant. It is
difficult to define &#147;sustainable community&#148;, but over the
years, I believe an understanding has grown of what that simple phrase
has come to
mean.</div>
					
					<a name="07022854000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022854000211"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con):
						I
have been listening to the Minister&#146;s words with great interest.
How is he helping to define a sustainable community by getting rid of
clause 1, which attempts to put in the Bill a definition that would
help us all? I put it to the Minister that the major plank of the
Government&#146;s sustainable communities housing expansion programme
is to build sustainable communities in new developments across the
country at the same time as the lack of co-ordinated government policy
is undermining villages that have been sustainable communities over
hundreds of years across the country.</div>
					
					<a name="07022854000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000212"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I do not accept the logic of the argument that,
because I have tabled an amendment to delete a subsection containing a
title, I am therefore against the meaning of the title. However, logic
apart, the hon. Gentleman has made an accusation, and it is incumbent
on the Government to try to respond to it. In the development of
housing&#151;just as it was for the Macmillan Government in the 1950s
and the new towns Acts that followed under Governments of both
parties&#151;Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition normally oppose
housing growth. If one reads the <i class="I">Hansard</i> on the housing Act from
the 1950s, one will see the Labour Opposition at the time making the
same accusation against the then Conservative Government.</div>
					<a name="07022854000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The point of
housing growth is to ensure that communities are sustainable, because
housing growth represents changes in demography that have an impact
across not just the region but the whole country. The test that the
hon. Gentleman is laying down is fair. Is the growth in housing in new
areas contributing towards the sustainability of those areas or not?
That is why the question on infrastructure, which he has asked on many
occasions and that he and I have debated before, is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div>important and fair. It is one that any hon. Member would ask about his
own constituency. I recognise that the planning gains supplement is
subject to debate and to testing as well, but the measures that we have
put in place, and are putting in place, on infrastructure and,
importantly, on funding policies, funding formula and the funding
mechanism, and the desirability to join up such policies, funding
streams and formulas between Departments and agencies, are one of the
biggest tests for public policy.</div>
					<a name="07022854000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea of a local area
agreement, with pooled funding across Government agencies, greater
flexibility and a statutory duty on agencies to
co-operate&#151;things that are strongly supported by the cross-party
Local Government Association and which are reflected in Government
policies, including the Local Government and Public Involvement in
Health Bill, which is being debated in Committee&#151;is in part to
meet the point that the hon. Gentleman and others have been
consistently making over the past months. That is why the agreement is
getting support, and there is a strong connection between the goals of
this Bill and the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health
Bill, and the policies that are already in place. That is why the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second point is unfair</div>

sustainability. Their website

							<a name="07022854000214"></a>
								Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Government&#146;s definition of sustainable
communities, as the hon. Lady found on the website, has been put into
practice&#151;into the real world&#151;by a number of important
measures that the Bill might jeopardise without proper consideration.
There is a danger that it might add unnecessary processes to those that
already exist and may result from a misunderstanding of Government
policies. Those policies are recent developments, so I make no
criticism of hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="07022854000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Local
Government Act 2000 requires local authorities to prepare sustainable
community strategies, and the idea of sustainable development is at the
heart of that policy. Members of the Committee will know of councils in
their constituencies that have prepared sustainable communities plans.
The council in my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div>constituency produced an extremely powerful document. It is a statutory
requirement of the council that it produces such a
plan.</div>
					
					<a name="07022854000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000215"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> My local authority has also produced a
sustainable community strategy, but I spoke to it about the extent of
consultation that it undertook and it turned out to be far short of
what the Bill proposes.</div>
					
					<a name="07022854000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000216"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Lady refers to the consultation by the
local council with local people, which raises two important
philosophical questions that this Bill and the Local Government and
Public Involvement in Health Bill try to address. If we take a more
devolutionary approach than we have done, we have to answer the
question of how far we prescribe and to what level we devolve powers.
If we dictate how local councils should consult, rather than say that
they should consult, we confuse issues of centralisation,
decentralisation and devolution. Indeed, for the reason given by the
hon. Lady, clause 106 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in
Health Bill contains a statutory duty to inform, consult and involve
local representatives. Should Parliament pass that Bill, that statutory
duty will be backed up by the levers and tools of the performance
regime and the new accountability measures.</div>
					<a name="07022854000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the hon. Lady in
principle: it is almost contradictory to have a sustainable communities
plan that has not involved the community that it is trying to sustain.
I agree philosophically with her and I will be interested to hear what
Opposition Members think. To be fair, the right hon. Member for West
Dorset made that point on Second
Reading.</div>
					<a name="07022854000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I am
outlining on behalf of the Government is not a problem of principle
with the clause&#151;it would be difficult for anybody to disagree
with subsection (2)(a) to (e), and some would say it is motherhood and
apple pie. One might question how free-market economics and the
subsection are compatible. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am being accused of
being against motherhood and apple pie, and I understand the point, but
the electorate send us here to scrutinise legislation, not just for its
coherence and consistency, but to see whether it will
work.</div>

							<a name="07022854000217"></a>Jeremy
Corbyn:
						</b>
						Is the Minister aware that one
problem is that a local plan is developed in consultation with the
local community, which comes up with a lot of good ideas, but a large
developer then arrives, backed by a large supermarket chain, and
proposes some huge development and announces that it will be
unsustainable unless the building is a certain height, bulk and size?
Local residents are then faced with a battery of corporate lawyers and
huge amounts of money spent on newspaper advertising and other things.
The local authority either collapses in the face of that problem or
goes to the Secretary of State, who feels unable to intervene because
of the battery of powers against him and the arguments used about the
survival of a whole area. In a short time all the powers of the
community simply disappear into the hands of powerful corporate

							<a name="07022854000218"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> My hon. Friend puts his finger on why the debate
on the Bill is attracting such attention, and it is important that we
analyse his argument. The answer to his question is yes, I am very much
aware of the problem. I gave evidence to a public inquiry in my
constituency against a supermarket development in one of the villages
of Saddleworth, backed up by evidence from the New Economics
Foundation. Local authorities often find themselves in a situation
whereby their decisions whether to appeal against a planning decision
are based not on the sustainability of the community or purely on
planning policy and law, but on the cost, and risked cost, of making
such an appeal. That is an important
point.</div>
					<a name="07022854000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">On my hon.
Friend&#146;s second point, the Secretary of State, and particularly
the Deputy Prime Minister, have successfully changed planning policy to
promote the sustainability of town centres. Significant decisions have
been taken in the past seven or eight years, including those relating
to the Ikea Group. If hon. Members who represent the Stockport area
were here they would be able to tell the Committee about the
consequences of that change in policy, which has been recognised by
town centre managers, councils and the British Council of Shopping
Centres, with which I shared a platform at its conference. The British
Council of Shopping Centres welcomes the changes in planning policy,
which have gone a long way to addressing my hon. Friend&#146;s
concerns about town
centres.</div>
					<a name="07022854000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
only last week public opinion, which is an objective criterion in
planning policy, caused the decision to develop a major superstore in
the London borough of Kingston to be changed. I will not mention the
name of the supermarket because I would imagine that my hon. Friend
knows what it is.</div>
					<a name="07022854000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
issues arise from my hon. Friend&#146;s point, which I think he has
recognised. Developers would probably make one of them. If a proposal
is within the law, then a developer has a right to make suggestions for
its development. The rights of developers, companies and individuals to
put forward ideas for businesses, commerce and trade, which are an
essential part of a prosperous economy, have to be balanced
againstthe sustainability of a community. That argument
expresses itself in public debate in a very important way. If the
community does not want a Tesco, it will not shop in it. However, the
truth is that people do want such a store, and that includes my
constituents.</div>
					<a name="07022854000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question that the Committee is being asked to consider is how we ensure
that planning and development policies are in the long-term interests
of a community as well as in its short-term
interests.</div>

which defines sustainable local communities. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>That definition is almost entirely drawn from a document from his own
Department, or rather his predecessor&#146;s Department under the

Friend talked about supermarkets and people having a choice. He said
that if they do not want the supermarkets, they should not shop there.
What he ought to recognise is that when a supermarket comes into a
community, it undercuts the prices in the local shops, forcing them to
close. It is no use saying that people can choose not to shop there
because, unfortunately, people end up in the supermarket because it
operates a policy of stealth whereby it takes over a community and
forces every shop out. That is not good for local communities. It
certainly is not sustainable. Does the Minister agree that it is the
power of the supermarket that needs to be controlled to ensure that we
have
communities?</div>

							<a name="07022854000229"></a>Mr.

						</b> On the power of the supermarkets, one can, of
course, argue that the Competition Commission and competition laws
should properly address those concerns. I have been given examples of
supermarkets&#151;I shall not name them&#151;where some pretty bad
practices have gone on. A local wine shop was put out of business by a
supermarket whose managers made a note of the shop&#146;s special
offers and undercut them with loss leaders. They placed bottles of wine
with a 50 per cent. discount by the till to pull in business from the
local shop. One may legitimately argue that the competition laws need
toughening.</div>

						Two
philosophical approaches are coming together. One, which is shared by

monopolies and duopolies. The other approach, which is not
contradictory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div>and is shared by Labour Members, is that the planning and development
laws of local authorities need to be toughened to level the playing
field and make communities sustainable. Not many hon. Members would
argue that that takes away from the fact that a shop, whether small,
medium or large, is free to compete. That has driven our economy

what we mean by sustainable communities and to seek some sort of

existing Government definitions.</div>

&#147;Securing the Future&#148;, the Government&#146;s
sustainable community strategy in its action plan&#151;action plan is
a phrase that is used in this campaign&#151;that was published last
year. Planning policy statement 1, &#147;Delivering Sustainable
Development&#148;, set out the Government&#146;s overarching policy
on the delivery of sustainable development through the planning system.
As I said, the relevant clauses in the Local Government and Public

central and local government. The Local Government Act 2000 gives local

However, I would go back to that power of well-being and I, for one, am
happy to examine the link with the current Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Bill, which the Minister is steering through
Parliament. I would examine the power of well-being and come up with an
exact form of words. However, we all know that the five points in
subsection (2) are what we are already asking local authorities to do,
and many of us who used to sit on local strategic partnerships will be
engaging in that process. So, in that spirit of engagement, I hope that
the Minister will work with us to get an exact form of words if he does
not like what is there at the moment.</div>

to produce a sustainable communities plan&#151;I acknowledge the
point that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne made, when she

the important local area agreement financial process, which is under

sustainable communities.</div>

litigation, which always happens when law is loosely drawn up. I ask

something that I see when I walk down the street in one of the towns in
my constituency. It is a town where six shops have closed in the last
six months and it is probably the case that in the next six months to a
year, unless some action is taken, that town will effectively become a
ghost town. It has a small number of independent retailers, no
multiples, but it is very likely to lose those retailers very soon,
simply because they are unable to compete on a level playing field with
some of the out-of-town shopping centres that are being developed in
the area.</div>
					<a name="07022854000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
&#147;ghost town&#148; also means to me is a definition by the New

been underlined by parliamentary groups such as the all-party group on
small shops, which produced a report, &#147;High Street 2005&#148;.

						</b> I had the privilege to serve on the all-party
parliamentary group on small shops. The report was called &#147;High
Street Britain 2015&#148;. Its point was that unless urgent
Government action is taken, particularly on the independent supply
chain for independent retailers, we could well face the prospect of
there being no independent retailers on Britain&#146;s high streets
within the next eight years. The point was as serious as
that.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The
Minister&#146;s comments about the need to create a level playing
field between the independent retailers and some of the larger
supermarket chains were very pertinent. The problem is that there is
very often not that level playing field. The Bill would introduce a
mechanism allowing for those issues to be addressed. One of the key
issues, which has been raised at many public meetings across the
country, is that out-of-town shopping centres do not pay business rates
on their car parking, whereas independent retailers that provide car
parking do. At the moment, there is no clear mechanism for trying to
address changes of that
kind.</div>
					<a name="07022854000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday, I was
talking to someone involved in local government, who explained the
processes he had been through simply to allow recruitment in, I think,
legal services, rather than going through the Legal Services
Commission. He has been trying for three years to come to an agreement
with the relevant Department. Everyone thinks it is a good idea, but it
has taken three years to happen. That is the problem. There is no
mechanism for primary legislative changes to take place that are
recognised at local level. The chain of due process for national
Government to put that through seems to be very lengthy. There is no
mechanism for it to happen. That is one of the key reasons for the Bill
being so
important.</div>
					<a name="07022854000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
already been debate about the Government definition of
&#147;sustainable community&#148;. Subsection (2) clearly outlines
that in plain English, as the right hon. Member for Holborn and St.
Pancras said. The Minister might be concerned about the loose wording
of &#147;protecting or reviving&#148;, but he has had the
opportunity to table amendments providing for a clearer
definition.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000257"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> I want to amplify a point that the Minister did
not allow me to elaborate. As the Bill is meant as guidance to public
authorities, it should rightly roughly reflect the guidance that the
Government have adopted. The Government already engage in a wide range
of activities that, potentially, are judicially reviewable. They would
have to resort to their own definitions in defending their actions. As
the definitions in the Bill are drawn from Government definitions, does
the hon. Lady agree that it is wholly inconsistent for the Minister to
reject
them?</div>
					
					<a name="07022854000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000258"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> It is wholly inconsistent. If the Minister
pressed the amendment to a vote, its effect would, essentially, open
the Government up to even more litigation, because there would be no
definition at all. The amendment would take the guts out of the Bill
right at the outset, which is very concerning. On Second Reading, the
Minister was very keen to reassure the House that the issues would be
taken seriously. He gave an undertaking that he would engage in the
debate in all seriousness, but I am concerned that that has not
happened.</div>
					<a name="07022854000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Action has
been taken outside the formal procedures of the House that goes against
what the Minister said within it. I understand that, for six months,
people supporting this campaign have been trying to speak to the
Secretary of State; eventually, a meeting was arranged for 17 January,
when Second Reading was on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>19 January. The Department wrote to other Members of Parliament stating
its opposition to the Bill. Briefings from the Department have been
issued to hon. Members, opposing the Bill. Labour Members were asked to
attend the House on Friday 19 January to oppose Second Reading. My
concern is that there has been a
mismatch.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000260"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification,
but that is not my understanding. Although this is the first private
Member&#146;s Bill in which I have participated, other people key to
its progress who have much experience of private Members&#146; Bills
have spoken about their frustration. Never before have they encountered
such reluctance to engage on an issue. The Bill is almost unprecedented
in its amountof support. I hope that in tabling his probing
amendments, he is agreeing to undertake a constructive debate, but I
still have concerns that will be allayed only as we go through the Bill
in Committee.</div>
					<a name="07022854000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also spoke about the sustainable communities strategy,
accepting that perhaps there had been weaknesses in that process. He
also spoke of other mechanisms by which the issue of sustainable
communities could be raised by local government, such as the local
development framework. Again, that draws me back to my point. If there
is no definition in law, surely those processes would be improved by
having a clear
definition?</div>
					<a name="07022854000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
met with my local authority to discuss the Bill, as well as with the
LGA, as other Members have. One of the interesting things to come out
of that meeting was that there is a clear understanding of the
definition of a Sustainable Communities Bill. As the right hon. Member
for Holborn and St. Pancras said, it is accepted. The five key areas
have been outlined, and it is understood to be public policy. However,
the Bill goes further by encouraging local authorities to look beyond
their own remit and to comment on other issues affecting the
sustainability of their local communities, things that are currently
beyond their decision-making power. For example, the closure of a local
post office can have a huge impact on the sustainability of a
community, but local authorities cannot make a meaningful contribution
or take action to prevent it.</div>

Dan Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD):
						To
return to the Minister&#146;s comments on his amendment, he seemed
concerned that the drafting was not tight enough and might disadvantage
communities represented by local authorities in battles with larger
developers. However, local authorities&#146; great support for the
Bill&#146;s provisions seems to imply that they are happy with what
the Bill offers them and would welcome the opportunity to have those
powers and to take on the
fight.</div>

							<a name="07022854000262"></a>Julia

of parish councils have signed up to the Bill, authorities have signed
up to it and the Local Government Association clearly feel that the
principles behind it are to be welcomed.</div>

					<a name="07022854000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						When I talked
to my local authority, we spoke in great detail of the other mechanisms
in place. What came out of that meeting is that some excellent practice
has taken place in many local authorities. Cornwall particularly has
been developing a sustainable communities strategy. We talked about the
effectiveness of consultation and participation in that process. In
other initiatives, such as the market and coastal towns initiative,
consultation with the local community is also excellent. The problem is
that it is patchy and does not draw everything together. That is what
the Bill seeks to
do.</div>
					<a name="07022854000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the
amendment. Essentially, the entire Bill hangs on this definition, which
is based on the Government&#146;s own policy. It would fundamentally
undermine the rest of the Bill if the amendment were withdrawn. If the
Minister has serious reservations about the definitions used or about
the tightness or phrasing, I am disappointed that he did not feel able
to table amendments to provide that clarity. The hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood has always made it clear that he does not feel that
it is a perfect Bill. We are happy to see improvements where necessary,
so it is disappointing that the amendment has not followed through in
that tone of
constructiveness.</div>

is inappropriate to return to them, even though you have been very
generous, Mr. O&#146;Hara, in liberally interpreting this

points that need to be advanced to make the Bill
meaningful.</div>
					
					<a name="07022854000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
hope that the Minister agrees that, if we do not like the Bill, it will
behove him to do something, given that no other Committee members have
tabled amendments. I presume that other Committee members, including
Labour Members, are reasonably happy with what is in the Bill. We may,
in subsequent sittings, wish to change 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>some elements of the Bill and improve it. I hope that the Minister will
assure Committee members that there will be detailed
considerations.</div>

must be clear what we mean by a sustainable community, although that is
not easy. I am happy to return to the Government&#146;s definition,
as the right hon. Member for West Dorset said, which would be a good
starting point. We have the power of well-being and local area
agreements, which need to be defined clearly in terms of what a
sustainable community is, and the local development framework, which
the Minister has also mentioned, and other legislation. It is right
that he mentioned those, because he is the common factor, presumably,
along with the parliamentary secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for

right. We must trust local communities to define&#151;in his
words&#151;what &#147;prudent&#148; or &#147;protecting the
local environment&#148; mean to a degree that they feel answers their
concerns. There is a provision under clause 2 for the Secretary of

&#147;That is not what we understand by &#145;sustainable
community&#146;&#148;. That could happen in due course. It is wrong
to get hung up on something that will not be in the Bill. We cannot
have a Sustainable Communities Bill where we do not try to define what
a sustainable community is.</div>
					<a name="07022854000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In a previous
incarnation, when we discussed the Commons Bill, we changed the maiden
notion of the body that would oversee commons administration. We spent
an entire sitting trying to define what a commoners association would
be. It can be done in legislation, but it was not a helpful period
because we went off at tangents. As my right hon. Friend says, the
ordinary person in the street wants us to introduce simple legislation

this is not right, let us have detailed discussions outside this place

define what sustainable community is. It has to relate to other pieces
of legislation, because it is no good if it just sits on a shelf. It
has to be a meaningful piece of legislation that relates to what else
the Government have done and other parties in the House want them to
do. This is a consensual Bill. Nobody should have ownership, because it
is far too important for that. As long as the Minister agrees to that,
I will not say anything other than I hope he will not push this to a
vote. It could be an interesting result if he did. In the spirit of his
remarks so far, and with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>help that we will all give him, he knows where we want to take this and

								Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b>
						I entirely concur with the
hon. Member for Stroud. The Minister started by saying that he
recognised the popular support for this Bill across the country, but he
has misjudged the popular mood today. His approach to the very start of
the debate on the Committee stage of the Bill has been wrong. I
contrast it with another piece of private Member&#146;s legislation
in the last session. I had the privilege to sit on the Committee on the
Bill on international development and the transparency of the
Government&#146;s aid budget. It was promoted by the right hon.
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)
and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International
Development had an extremely constructive approach to getting that Bill
right. He worked with the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee stage
was extremely probing. Many of the complicated issues were analysed in
detail. At the end a very good piece of private Member&#146;s
legislation made its way on to the statute book.</div>
					<a name="07022854000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am
disappointed that today, we have a Government amendment that could
prevent a definition of sustainable communities when in the course of
the debate the Minister has admitted that there are already definitions
in legislation and there are also definitions on all sorts of
Government websites. The official shakes his head, but I am sure that
during the course of his remarks&#151;I shall be delighted to check

						The interchange between by my

reflecting on this rather weird debate, I wonder whether perhaps the
Government do not want to have a definition of sustainable communities
in any legislation. They want only to have the flexibility of guidance
on their own websites. That could be to prevent legal action by someone
in planning, for example, who seeks a judicial review on the basis that
the Government are not adhering to a particular definition that would
enter legislation if it were in the Bill. I wonder whether we should
take this opportunity to try to get to the point where the Government
accept that, sooner or later in some piece of legislation, there will
have to be a definition of sustainable communities if it is to be a
meaningful policy.</div>

Hoyle:
						</b>
						Thank you, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, for giving us the opportunity to speak to a valuable
Bill with all-party support. If we start from that point, we can
recognise where we ought to be going. It is interesting that
Chorley&#146;s local authority had a discussion about supporting the
Bill because it feels that the Bill is important. The authority
recognises the importance of a Bill that will instruct it on the best
way forward to ensure that it can adapt what it needs to do as a local
authority to empower the community to be sustainable in the future.
That is so important and we ought not to lose sight of it. The reason
that the authority wanted to do that was that it felt the concerns
about the future of local post offices&#151;urban and
rural&#151;banking and farming. There are many reasons why the
authority wishes to ensure that the Bill is supported.</div>
					<a name="07022854000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somehow, the Minister must not
be listening; local authorities, the people out there and Members of
this House united. Surely he ought to be recognising that we should
work together to deliver the Bill. The Minister has a great reputation,
but his reputation is like a bar of soap in the bath: every time he
thinks he has got it, it shoots out of his hand and whizzes round the
bath again. I do not want him to have that reputation; I want him to
have a reputation for being conciliatory, for working together and for
uniting with us.</div>
					<a name="07022854000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That is what
we need to see today, and I would like to think that he is going to do
that. It is so important that we pursue the line that was brought up by
the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. She touched on part of the
problem, and the Minister touched on it too. We do not really want to
knock supermarkets because they could be our friends in government, but
we have to be honest and, at times, stand up and say what we actually
feel. What we feel is that the supermarkets&#146; power is very
strong, and is killing communities. It is not an even playing field
because of business rates, which we have touched on. Never mind the car
park; that fact that the little village shop pays the same business
rate as Harrods per square metre is the problem that puts pressure on
local communities. That pressure is beginning to kill businesses, which
is why line 1 of clause 1 is so important; it sets the agenda and the
tone. That is what we hope the Minister will take on board.</div>
					<a name="07022854000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We must
ensure that the community understands why the local library is there
and what will happen if people do not use it. It is about joining up
the local authority and the community to ensure that if people do not
use it, they will lose it. That message has to be all joined up; it is
about ensuring that the community will exist. It is about
Mr. Bowan. I know that the Minister will not know who
Mr. Bowan is, but I shall explain: he is the local village
butcher in the village I live in. He is a quality butcher who served
his time at Smithfield, and everyone recognises how good he is. The
problem is that he is under the cosh. He is opening only four days a
week now because it is not worth opening the other three. That pressure
has been put on him by supermarkets. We need the community to recognise
the role that he can play.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>
					<a name="07022854000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider post offices,
which we do not like to talk about, but which are part of a sustainable
community. They provide a valuable service to villages and urban areas
and we should not allow them to be lost. We are losing the plot if we
allow services to be withdrawn. The fact is that post offices are
responsible operations. Pensioners can trust them and get help and
advice from them. Local post offices, not the Minister, assist
pensioners with the complicated forms that we generate, and which often
ensure that they do not get the benefits to which they are entitled.
That is why I think that post offices are so
important.</div>

							<a name="07022854000278"></a>Mr.
Hoyle:
						</b> I am trying to set the picture and establish the
landscape around clause 1. It is important to be aware of what we will
lose if we alter the title, which we believe ought to remain. That is
why I am trying to demonstrate its importance. The Minister understands
that; his is a semi-rural community. Our constituencies are very
similar. We have urban and rural areas. It is around that that we want
to draw the landscape. I know that he understands rural areas and
sustainable communities because he has told us about the advantage of
what his council has done. However, he does not recognise that councils
across the country are not replicating that. That is why subsection (1)
will set the scene portrayed in my
comments.</div>
					<a name="07022854000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Farming, of
course, plays an important part too. The price of milk is dictated by
the supermarkets, which, too, have a role to play in the community.
They ought to be joining in with sustainable communities by buying
locally and reducing food miles. Local farmers ought to be paid
directly and with farm-gate prices to ensure that sustainable farming
continues in rural areas. Supermarkets should not be pushing down
prices, because that means that farmers cannot produce with a profit
and so lose out. That is why we are seeing a major reduction in dairy
farming and beef production. Local beef is produced very close to these
supermarkets, but do the supermarkets buy from them? Absolutely not!
They insist on food miles, which are not sustainable. That is why
subsection (1) is so important and why I am concerned about
farming.</div>
					<a name="07022854000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see
that I am testing your patience, Mr. O&#146;Hara so I

you allowed the Minister, Mr. O&#146;Hara, we feel rightly
that we should address similar points. But I understand what you are

					<a name="07022854000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Community radio has an important
role to play as well. Believe it or not, in Chorley we have the local
community radio station, Chorley FM, coming in our ears. It is so
important to our community because it allows us to put across what is
happening in our area. That is why the Bill is important to the
sustainability of our communities. We can use community radio to let
people know what is going on and to empower
them.</div>
					<a name="07022854000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the Minister is listening very carefully and wants to be more
sympathetic. He recognises the importance of the Bill, but he should
also recognise that no one in this Room disagrees with it&#151;I
believe&#151;except for him and maybe his PPS, but that is just for
the purposes of promotion.</div>
					<a name="07022854000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The message for the Government
is this; listen to what is being said on both sides of the Committee,
take it on board, be sympathetic, be conciliatory and let us work
together.</div>

							<a name="07022854000284"></a>Nia
Griffith:
						</b>
						I stand corrected. The issue
is the sustainability of local communities. It is extremely difficult
to define either &#147;local community&#148; or &#147;sustainable
community&#148;. It is also difficult to pinpoint all the levels of
decision making that go in to providing jobs and protecting local
economies and
environments.</div>

							<a name="07022854000285"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> We all accept that there are difficulties in
defining sustainable communities, but the Government are asking local
authorities to undertake work relating to the sustainability of their
local communities. It seems strange that they can require local
authorities to take on a sustainable community strategy without having
set down in law what that means.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022854000286"></a>Nia
Griffith:
						</b> I beg to differ. The object of involving local
communities is not to patronise them or to set out in advance a
top-down model, but rather to get involvement from the bottom
up.</div>
					<a name="07022854000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real issue is
the sense of alienation among people who feel that decisions are made
by large organisations miles away, and that they have no power over
them and cannot have much input. Coupled with that is our tendency to
have smaller families and to live longer, so there are fewer people
walking about in villages than there used to be. There is also a
tendency to travel further to work, leading to a &#147;come home,
shut the door, be inside my house&#148; mentality and less
opportunity for people to engage in what is going on it their local
town or community.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>
					<a name="07022854000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There are many
factors, and it would be invidious to lay the blame at any one door.
What is important now is the wake-up call contained in the report
&#147;High Street Britain 2015&#148;, produced by the all-party
group on small shops, of which I am a member, and the opportunity that
it offers to debate the underlying causes. If we cannot sort those out,
we will not do anything towards promoting the activities listed in
paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection
(2).</div>
					<a name="07022854000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
erosion of town centres did not happen yesterday. It has been going on
for a number of years. The most important thing to come out of the
report is the fact that the Competition Commission is now
lookinginto the power of the big supermarkets and the effects
of big out-of-town developments; the encroachment by supermarkets into
the corner shop market; and the immense purchasing power of the
supermarkets, which is driving down the prices of products such as milk
and meat.</div>
					<a name="07022854000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
very much like to encourage farmers to give evidence to the Commission.
Clearly if they do not get a fair price&#151;a living wage&#151;for
their produce, they will go out of business, and that will lead to a
decline in economic activity in the countryside. Indeed, it will be
difficult to encourage young farmers to carry on their traditions. If
we are to build local economic blocks, we have to ascertain which
factors affect those blocks and how we can encourage the growth of
local economic activity.</div>
					<a name="07022854000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
subsection refers to a number of issues such as protecting the local
environment and the prudent use of natural resources. Those matters
have to be considered in the context of a range of levels of
government. Some things, such as combating climate change, might be
decided by EU regulation. Others might be decided by a local group of
prospective residents discussing with a co-operative housing
association how they want the lay-out of their housing to be. Decisions
at all levels interlock, so it is about not just empowering local
communities but ensuring that they are part of joined-up government
thinking.</div>
					<a name="07022854000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
been positive feeling about devolution in Wales. Initially, people were
quite nervous and did not know how the Welsh Assembly would work out.
Over the eight years it has been in existence, the Assembly has come to
be very much respected. It gives us the opportunity to have a more
direct relationship with a much nearer organisation than if we had to
go directly to the Secretary of State. It is helpful to have the
Assembly
Government.</div>
					<a name="07022854000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Back in
1995 there was a more difficult reorganisation, when we took on the
idea of unitary authorities. That had a partly positive and partly
negative impact. Some people feel closer to their unitary authority
than they did to their previous county or borough, but some feel more
alienated. We must sort that out at a local level. Mechanisms do exist
for county councils to have close consultation with town and community
councils. The question is how effective they are at using those
mechanisms. While the possibility is in the letter of the law, we need
a new spirit in how we encourage such involvement.</div>
					<a name="07022854000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not easy. We say to
people, &#147;Oh, come and tell me all your wonderful ideas,&#148;
and how many turn up? How many actually bring an idea? If we are not
careful, it is easy to let community involvement turn 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>into the dominance of a few determined individuals with a particular
agenda. We need to ensure that the Bill offers truly democratic
guidelines for approaching the matter and does not leave the door open
to pressure groups that try to misuse
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07022854000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
all now understand what we mean by wanting a community in which people
speak to each other rather than walk past each other and have the
opportunity to use local services. We also have an idea of what we mean
by &#147;sustainable&#148;. We do not want people to waste things
and use resources inappropriately. Working out what mechanisms will
produce those things is much more complex and needs a great deal of
debate and Government action at all
levels.</div>
