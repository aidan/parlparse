Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I am
grateful for the chance to make a few final points in support of my
argument that the Bill needs to be clear about the purposes of the
sentencing council and about who should be on it and why. My main
concern about a judge-dominated council is that the appeals process
already allows judges to clarify the law. In considering whether to
change or amend a specific sentence, senior judges comment on that
sentence, which is what drives the lower courts.</div>
<a name="0903119000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
remembering that judges can get it wrong. The number of appeals by the
Attorney-General against unduly lenient sentences is one half of that
equation; the other half is the appeals granted in the opposite
direction. It seems to me that the driver for the sentencing council
must be different&#151;namely, what works. Earlier, I undertook to
give an example. I pray in aid the work funded by the Esm√(c)e
Fairbairn Foundation, whereby judges went to see what actually happens
with community sentences. That produced significant evidence that many
judges were unaware of what such sentences mean in practice and what
happens to the offenders given them. The work demonstrated the benefits
of such knowledge. I also pray in aid remarks made by the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough about the value of a degree of oversight
of what happens after the sentencing
decision.</div><a name="0903119000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Courts
are still slow to use restorative justice, but there is considerable
evidence that the experience of facing up to the damage done to victims
is salutary in triggering reform in offenders. It is life-changing in a
way that reduces reoffending, and thus the likelihood of new victims
being created. However, the impact on victims is also massive: quite
apart from the effect of having been able to give the offender a piece
of their mind, some 73 per cent. of victims felt safer as a result of a
restorative justice event. That is significant. We heard evidence from
victim support groups and asked what victims wanted from the criminal
justice system. Apart from the ideal situation of the offence not
happening in the first place, they wanted to be certain that it would
never happen again. That certainty is what good sentencing, the reform
of offenders and the prevention of reoffending is all about.</div>
<a name="0903119000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Justice
Committee&#146;s report on the Bill built on the recent consideration
that it had given to sentencing. As a member of that Committee, I found
its hearings extremely productive. In commenting on the sentencing part
of the Bill, the Committee expressed a number of concerns. I say gently
to the Minister that I fear that the Bill follows too closely the
findings of the review undertaken by Lord Carter&#151;not the Lord
Carter who is currently doing an excellent job in developing broadband
Britain, but Lord Carter of Coles, who undertook a review of the impact
of sentencing on prisons. I am sure that it was not intentional, but
unfortunately his review was very poor and the evidence that he gave to
the Justice Committee was probably the poorest that we received. We
ended up with the impression that the report was rushed and not
evidence-based. The concern is that the piece about the sentencing
council as drafted follows the brief that he was given and the
conclusions that he reached&#151;that is, phrasing about reducing the
number of people in prisons. That is of benefit because if there are
fewer people in prison they can be dealt with properly and
rehabilitation can be more effective. I have no difficulty with that.
However, it is the effectiveness of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 629</div>the sentencing that ought to be the driver, and the reduction in prison
numbers ought to be a consequence of a better and more focused
sentencing
process.</div><a name="0903119000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Select Committee respected the fact
that</div><a name="0903119000744"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
the very heart of the debate is a consensus that the prison population
is growing too fast and that custody, especially short sentences, is
not an effective approach for many offenders in terms of achieving
rehabilitation or reform; with prison often characterised as &#145;an
expensive way of making bad people
worse.&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee argued that the study to which I have referred was undertaken
at high speed and perhaps that left flaws in it. Finally, the Committee
expressed a
concern</div><a name="0903119000745"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
an over-ambitious timetable had been set for the working group on a
sentencing commission and recommended that &#145;the Government
should not seek to implement major changes in this area without
effective evaluation of the potential consequences and the resources
required to make such changes effective.&#146; We remain of this
opinion. Accordingly, we recommend the most careful consideration of
those provisions of the Coroners and Justice Bill relating to the remit
of the new Sentencing Council
for...Wales.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
took that seriously and have listened to the evidence that we had in
advance of the line-by-line scrutiny, which is why I have come up with
these suggestions.</div>
<a name="0903119000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Marrying the
focus on what works and is effective in reducing offending with the
experience of the judges is a way of getting the right conclusion and a
sentencing council that will improve the outcomes from sentencing and
not just the logic of sentencing itself. It means a change to the Bill
and I hope that Ministers, if they cannot accept my amendments today,
will take away these thoughts and consider amending the Bill so as to
deliver the objectives in a way that is more practical, more focused,
and based on clear principles. I will not delay the Committee further,
but I very much hope that by making these suggestions I have not sought
to roll back what Ministers are doing but sought to make the sentencing
council more focused, more effective and more successful in ensuring
that the guidance given to courts is based on what will reduce
reoffending, rather than on the particulars which, although important
themselves, are not what the criminal justice system should be
about.</div><a name="0903119000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000841"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): The right hon.
Gentleman has done us a service in setting out, as a critical friend of
the Government, the issues that need to be considered when talking
about the Sentencing Guidelines Council. I know that the right hon.
Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East has served on the Gage
committee, so he brings with him&#151;albeit that he was not able to
hear this morning&#146;s opening of the debate&#151;a considerable
detailed knowledge of the workings of a sentencing council. He very
kindly invited me to a meeting with Lord Justice Gage to look at his
findings last summer, so he will know that what Lord Justice Gage and
the right hon. Gentlemen and their colleagues are proposing&#151;what
the Government are not proposing&#151;is an American grid system, so
let us put that aside and concentrate on what we are doing.</div>
<a name="0903119000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clauses 100
to 118, I can see that the Government are proposing evolution of the
current state of play rather than a hugely revolutionary system, but
there are pinchpoints that will divide the Committee in the way that
evolution is taking place. I will describe them briefly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 630</div><a name="0903119000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
from the official Opposition&#146;s point of view&#151;I will leave
the hon. Member for Cambridge to set out his stall&#151;we do not
accept that the new sentencing council should have the power to require
sentences to follow its guidelines, as opposed to taking them into
account. As the Committee will know, the current Sentencing Guidelines
Council sets out its stall and guidelines and the courts are required
to take those into account and explain themselves if they do not follow
them. The Government propose that as a matter of compulsion, the
sentences in the courts&#151;be they in the summary jurisdiction or
the Crown court&#151;must follow them, unless there is an overriding
reason for not doing
so.</div><a name="0903119000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the difference between us and the Government&#151;I think that the
Liberal Democrats are closer to the Government&#146;s position on
this than we are&#151;relates to the influence of resources on the
sentencing process. We see the assessment of resources&#151;the way
in which the available space in the prison estate and capacity in the
non-custodial criminal justice system are deployed in terms of how they
are provided and paid for&#151;as essentially a matter for the
Executive: the Ministry of Justice and those who advise Parliament.
However, those factors should not impinge on the sentencing in any
given
case.</div><a name="0903119000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be true that legislation may follow an assessment made by the
Sentencing Guidelines Council. Let us say, for example, that putting
every burglar into custody would require 100,000 prison places. That is
information the Government must digest, and which, if they agree with
it, they must supply to Parliament, so that Parliament, advised by the
Government, can reach a conclusion about what to spend on prisons; but
when it comes to sentencing in particular cases, or in generic types of
case, the sentencer must be free to give the sentence that he or she
finds appropriate as a matter of justice, bearing in mind all the usual
factors, such as the facts of the particular offence, the impact on the
victim or society in general and the circumstances of the defendant.
However, it should not, in our view, influence the sentence in a
particular case, that a magistrate in, say, Exeter should be told that
there is a shortage of prison places in a particular area of the
country or across the country. That is a matter for the Government to
sort out, rather than individual sentencers. It is simply not possible
for a sentencer to have regard to the available resources across the
whole country&#151;or even across the
region.</div><a name="0903119000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing
in mind the guillotine that we are under, it will not be possible for
us to express our concerns about clauses 100 to 118 individually. I
therefore propose, subject to your advice and direction, Mr.
Cook, to call three symbolic votes. I make no secret of that, and I am
giving the hon. Member for Wrexham notice so that he can deploy his
resources, having assessed whom he has available. I do not expect to
win any of the votes, but it is important that we mark the difference
between the Opposition and the Government sides of the Committee, so
that nobody can be under any misapprehension. I will ask the
Committee&#146;s opinion on one clause stand part. The most sensible
way to do that is to pick the first clause from the 18 clauses that we
have to deal with in relation to the clause stand part debates. I shall
then ask your permission, Mr. Cook, for a Division under
clause 102 on amendment 244, which I shall move formally at
the appropriate time. That will enable the Conservative party to
express its concern about what I headline
&#147;resource assessment&#148;. After that, I
shall then ask the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 631</div>Committee, with your permission, to divide on
amendment 248 under clause 107, which deals with the
&#147;follow/have regard to&#148; point that I have
outlined.</div><a name="0903119000796"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="0903119000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the Divisions on amendments 244 and 248 may not happen
until later in our proceedings, but it is important that I set out my
stall now because I am not in the business of making clever-clever
points about catching the Government by surprise. That would be
unproductive and have no huge value. It is important that we put our
concern on the record and, it is fair to say, that we explain those
points on which we share the concerns of not only the right hon. Member
for Cardiff, South and Penarth, but other members of the
Committee.</div><a name="0903119000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am beginning to sound like a retired colonel from somewhere or other,
but in my experience, sentencing is the most difficult part of the
criminal justice process. Those who have been a magistrate and thus a
sentencer, as the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has,
and those who have been an advocate in front of the Crown court as well
as the magistrates court and have had to mitigate on behalf of their
clients who are up for sentencing, as has my hon. Friend the Member for
Rugby and Kenilworth, will agree that it is not easy. When we read some
of the intemperate criticism of judges and magistrates in the tabloid
press, I am sure that we in Committee all agree as reasonable people
that, in large part, that criticism is unfair. Clearly, from time to
time, things go wrong, but the unduly lenient sentence appeal system
that the Attorney-General can operate, which the right hon. Gentleman
mentioned&#151;although he would be the first to admit that such
sentences are a tiny proportion of the number handed out during a given
year&#151;provides a correctional device. It also enables the Court
of Appeal criminal division to gather up either individual cases or
groups of cases so that it can give thematic judgments on particular
types of
sentence.</div><a name="0903119000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000842"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I intervene on the hon. and learned Gentleman
simply to say that he underestimates the importance and significance of
the success of appeals against unduly lenient sentence, given that the
threshold is high and they have to be not only unduly lenient, but
unreasonably so. Several hundred cases have reached that threshold. It
is not a big point, but it is more significant that he is
suggesting.</div>
<a name="0903119000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000843"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I do not need to have a long argument about the
matter. Statistically, the number of cases is tiny compared with the
number of sentences passed each year. Let us just leave the matter
there and allow the Committee to make a bit more
progress.</div><a name="0903119000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the wider points, I draw attention to some concerns that have been
expressed to all of us by the Bar Council, which sent us a brief on
such aspects of the Bill. On the &#147;have regard&#148; as opposed
to &#147;follow&#148; point, it says that the stricter approach
that the Government
advocate,</div><a name="0903119000746"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a)
will involve an artificial exercise of comparing the facts of an
individual case with an abstract list of criteria (when having to
decide the most comparable category), which may simply generate more
argument and appellate
activity;</div><a name="0903119000747"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
may make it more difficult for a judge to exercise independent judgment
in a particular case if it seems that there is a burden on the
defendant to demonstrate that a guideline sentence would not be in the
interests of justice;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 632</div><a name="0903119000748"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
could consequently have the effect of increasing the prison population
if judges are constrained to pass longer sentences than they might
otherwise pass or feel that they may be criticised or appealed when
showing
leniency.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, unduly lenient sentences can be and are appealed&#151;that
was the point I discussed with the right hon. Gentleman&#151;so that
if a judge is overly generous, the sentence can be increased. That
neatly describes my concerns about amendment 248, so when we come to
discuss it, I will not go beyond what I have already said.
</div><a name="0903119000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a useful report produced
last year by the Prison Reform Trust entitled, &#147;Creating a
Sentencing Commission for England and Wales: an opportunity to address
the prisons crisis.&#148; I am not going to read out everything in
it, but it contains a number of interesting suggestions, some of which
are more in line with the Government&#146;s proposals than mine. None
the less, it is a useful resource document that describes the issues
that we need to consider. We do not have time today to consider those
matters at length or in the detail used by the Prison Reform Trust in
its report; instead, I will pick out one or two salient points with a
view to helping our deliberations.</div>
<a name="0903119000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
undeniable, and I hope uncontroversial, that there is a prison capacity
crisis. The figures speak for themselves: when the Government came to
power in 1997, there were 60,000 to 61,000 people in prison; there are
now approximately 83,000&#151;the figure goes up and down around that
point. Whatever one thinks of people who commit crimes and what they do
or do not deserve, the prison population has grown in an uncontrolled
way for almost two decades.</div>
<a name="0903119000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prison
Reform Trust says that there is &#147;extensive sentencing
disparity&#148;. That is debateable, but it is what a lot of people
think. The opening remarks made by the right hon. Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth suggest that he agrees with the Prison Reform Trust.
I suggest&#151;I might be wrong as I have not done any research into
this&#151;that the disparity may be greater in the magistrates courts
than in the Crown courts. However, I have no evidence for that, it is
just a hunch.</div>
<a name="0903119000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prison
Reform Trust
says:</div><a name="0903119000749"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
effective response to these problems needs to take into account all the
factors that are driving up the prison population and leading to
disparity.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a sensible and uncontroversial suggestion.</div>
<a name="0903119000750"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
quality of media coverage of law and order issues, public opinion about
crime and punishment, and the associated penal populism which
characterises political debate all need to be factored into any
strategy for containing the prison population.&#148;</div>
<a name="0903119000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Criminal justice policy
and sometimes individual sentences are matters of huge interest to the
public; they are also matters of &#147;public interest&#148;. I
hope that the Government are sufficiently self-confident to resist
knee-jerk reactions from newspapers that want stories to fit their
headlines, rather than allow them to design or have too great an
influence on criminal justice policy. The public unquestionably have a
proper interest in participating in public debates about the shape of
our criminal justice and sentencing
policies.</div>
<a name="0903119000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prison
Reform Trust goes on to
note:</div><a name="0903119000751"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Simply
constraining sentencers&#146; discretion, without addressing the
underlying pressures for tougher sentencing, is not a viable, long-term
solution to the prisons
crisis.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wholly agree with that. It
continues:</div><a name="0903119000752"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
long-term solution needs to have both political and technical
dimensions to it.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div><a name="0903119000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that is not controversial.</div>
<a name="0903119000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">How can a
sentencing commission address the crisis? The report
continues:</div><a name="0903119000753"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
sentencing commission can serve three main functions: providing
guidance to sentencers; gathering and providing information and
statistics for monitoring, planning and policy
development;&#148;</div><a name="0903119000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not mind either of those, but I am concerned that the information
should influence the Ministry of Justice and the Executive, not the
sentencer.</div>
<a name="0903119000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000844"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab):
The proposals in the Bill, and those of the Gage committee, are that we
specifically reject the use of the word &#147;commission&#148; in
favour of the phrase &#147;sentencing council&#148;, which builds
on the experience that already
exists.</div><a name="0903119000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000845"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am referring to the Prison Reform Trust report
that came out in 2008. It does not matter, for our purposes, whether it
is a commission or a council, but we are in the business of deciding
what it should do and what its powers should be.</div>
<a name="0903119000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the
Prison Reform Trust says that a commission or council should
provide</div><a name="0903119000754"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;community
engagement&#151;to inform and to consult with the
public.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that seems to be wholly outside the realm of the courts; such matters
are for the Government and academics and are wholly disconnected from
the court system.</div>
<a name="0903119000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">On guidance
for sentencers&#151;this takes us back to my point about &#147;have
regard to&#148; and &#147;follow&#148;&#151;I am concerned that
under the Bill, the sentencing council, armed with its resource
assessments, will issue instructions, which is what they will
essentially be, to sentencers in both the Crown and magistrates courts.
Those will&#151;if not expressly, at least by implication&#151;say,
&#147;We can no longer provide custodial or non-custodial resources
for the following types of offence.&#148; Therefore, although in the
past one might have thought it appropriate to give a custodial offence
to a persistent burglar, or to give a particular type of community
sentence to a less serious offender, one could not do so now, because
we cannot afford it.</div>

all.</div><a name="0903119000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000847"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The Minister says that, but if one looks at how
the clauses are constructed, it is clear that clause 109,
which deals with resource implications of the guidelines, will feed
into the guidelines, which must be followed, rather than simply be
taken account of. We can have a perfectly friendly argument on whether
that is a good idea, but it seems to me, after reading the relevant
clauses under discussion this afternoon, that as night follows day, the
guidelines published and promulgated by the council will have that
effect.</div><a name="0903119000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Government and the Liberal Democrats think that that is a
good thing, and so does Mr. Martin Narey, who used the
analogy of rationing in the health service. I did not think that that
was a true analogy, but none the less, the Labour and Liberal Democrat
parties, and no doubt many others, think that this is a good idea. I do
not happen to agree.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000849"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The Minister shakes her head and says that I have
got it all wrong. But that is what seems to come out of the Bill, given
the way in which it has been spun. She can tell me why I am talking
nonsense in a minute, either from a sedentary position or on her feet.
Either way, I shall listen with interest, but either way we are right
to be deeply concerned. We are not engaged in some student union
activity. We are right to be concerned and to warn the Government that,
if they interfere with the discretion of sentencers to adjust their
sentences to fit with Government resources, although that is sensible
in many ways, in this sphere of public policy it is ill
advised.</div><a name="0903119000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not go through the Prison Reform Trust&#146;s research and
monitoring or community engagement recommendation for a sentencing
council, because time does not permit and those matters are not
strictly relevant to my amendments. What I shall
do&#151;briefly&#151;is discuss some of its key recommendations, to
see how they fit within the proposals that are coming from the
Government and that came from the Gage
committee.</div><a name="0903119000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prison Reform Trust
recommended:</div><a name="0903119000755"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
well-resourced, unitary sentencing commission should be set up to
replace
the&#148;</div><a name="0903119000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sentencing
Advisory Panel and the Sentencing Guidelines Council. In the current
recession, it will be interesting to see how well resourced that is,
but if the Bill is passed we shall get a unitary sentencing
commission.</div><a name="0903119000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the trust recommended that the
commission</div><a name="0903119000756"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should
have a wide range of functions&#151;principally the provision of
sentencing guidance, research and monitoring, and community
engagement&#148;,</div><a name="0903119000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">although
I worry about the real definition of &#147;guidance&#148; in
relation to
sentencing.</div><a name="0903119000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the trust
says:</div><a name="0903119000757"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
sentencing guidance produced by the commission should be based on the
existing SGC guidance and should thus permit sentencers to give due
weight to offender-related factors in passing sentence. Parliament
should consider restricting the scope for departure from the
guidance&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0903119000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">an
area of disagreement, where the Government with their
&#147;follow&#148; and we with our &#147;take account&#148;
part
company.</div><a name="0903119000758"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
commission should monitor compliance with the guidelines, contribute to
government forecasts of prison population trends, assess the impact of
proposed reforms to sentencing policy, and conduct original
research.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no issue with that fourth recommendation, which is sensible.
However, its impact on sentences concerns
us.</div><a name="0903119000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fifth recommendation is
that</div><a name="0903119000759"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Community
engagement should be seen as a core function of the commission; this
would entail both informing and educating the public about sentencing,
and undertaking public
consultation.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I have no objection, but that does not seem to be something that should
impinge on the activities of sentencers without the intervention of
legislation on particular types of
offence.</div><a name="0903119000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sixthly,
the trust states
that</div><a name="0903119000760"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
commission should aim to be an authoritative and trusted source of
non-partisan information and guidance on sentencing practice and
policy.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div><a name="0903119000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need not get hung up about that. Our real issue is with the effect that
resource assessments will have on the sentencing guidelines and the
requirement under the Bill for sentencers to follow strictly the
guidelines of the
commission.</div><a name="0903119000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to clauses 100 to 118, I have described a number of matters in
particular amendments, but subject to the discussion that we had right
at the beginning, perhaps before the Committee officially started, I
had better wrap up my remarks as I have, without asking the Committee
to permit me to discuss each separate set of amendments,
seriatim.</div><a name="0903119000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000850"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> I apologise that I was not here for the
start of the debate. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on
one&#146;s point of view, I had to attend a meeting of the
Intelligence and Security Committee this morning, at which we were
interviewing the Foreign Secretary about one of the cases mentioned in
this Committee last week. My presence there was, unfortunately,
necessary.</div><a name="0903119000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make a couple of brief points in response to the hon. and
learned Gentleman. He mentioned the Gage report and generously said
that I was a member of that group&#151;on which I sat throughout its
proceedings&#151;and briefed him. We offered to brief the hon. Member
for Cambridge, but unfortunately he was unable to attend and sent a
researcher along at the time. I am not saying that as a criticism; he
had the opportunity but was unfortunately unable to take
it.</div><a name="0903119000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to enlighten the hon. and learned Member for Harborough on one
point. He said that we carried out a courts survey. We did that because
we were alarmed, at the beginning of our inquiries, that there was a
complete lack of data on sentencing. In fact, we covered that in
chapter five of the report. The hon. and learned Gentleman speculated
about whether the departures from guidelines might have been greater in
the case of magistrates courts compared with Crown courts. I am unable
to answer his question because we only surveyed Crown courts&#151;10
of them over one month, with 229 returns. I will not go into the
statistics, but there was a significant departure from the guidelines
in a number of cases. If the hon. and learned Gentleman has the time to
read the document before we get to Report stage, he might find the
direction of travel of those departures surprising, but now is not the
appropriate time for me to get bogged down in that
detail.</div><a name="0903119000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I characterise the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s concerns? First,
he is concerned that the procedure laid down in the Bill, which to a
large extent follows closely the recommendation of the Gage report, is
likely to be too prescriptive and therefore would fetter the
courts&#146; discretion. I think that he is being overly cautious in
his interpretation of what is intended to happen under the Bill and
what the Gage committee intended. The senior members of the judiciary
on that committee&#151;magistrates were represented as
well&#151;defended their corner well against people like me who would
have fettered the freedom of the courts a lot more, had I had my own
way. However, I am here to represent what they said rather than
my personal opinion. Those people explicitly set out in the report the
ways in which the court needs to have discretion and those are repeated
in the Bill. For example, clause 103(3) mentions mitigation. I will not

<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div>go into the definition of that, but it is one of the
discretions available to the court in determining specifically the
circumstances that may soften the sentence as a result of mitigating
factors. The courts are also able to decide whether a particular
offence in particular circumstances was so bad that that aggravation
should also be reflected in the
sentence.</div><a name="0903119000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
103 also mentions sentencing ranges. The hon. and learned Gentleman is
right to say that we rejected as overly prescriptive the grid system
that was studied in North Carolina and Minnesota. The direction that we
went in, echoing what already happens in the Sentencing Guidelines
Council, was to give ranges so that there will be some certainty,
predictability and consistency in sentencing, because there is
widespread concern that, currently, there is not always consistency in
sentencing. Indeed, the data that we collected from our survey bore out
that
concern.</div><a name="0903119000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s first concern about the discretion
of the courts being fettered is overstated. I hope that when he has had
the opportunity to consider this matter more fully, he will realise
that what we have recommended, and what is set out in the clauses, will
allow considerable judicial discretion. I do not think that they will
have the effect that he
fears.</div><a name="0903119000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman fears that we are tying resources too
closely to sentencing. The working group debated this issue a great
deal, and it was clear to us that there should not be a direct
relationship. However, we also thought that if we can collect
sufficient data to enable some prediction of the size of the prison
population and the demand for community sentences and probation orders,
it ought to be possible to predict what resources are likely to be
available. That is not to say that sentences should be determined and
guidelines produced with that in mind.</div>
<a name="0903119000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman thinks that the Executive has such a role, but, last
night, Parliament considered estimates. There was no Division, but
nevertheless Parliament decides what resources are to be made available
for every area of public expenditure, including prison places,
custodial places, community sentences and probation. Although such
estimates may go through on the nod without a Division, it is
Parliament&#146;s responsibility to be aware of the relationship
between sentencing and what we can predict about what might happen in
the future, as well as the resources that will be
needed.</div><a name="0903119000152"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000851"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The right hon. Gentleman enables me to put to him
amendment 257, which
says:</div><a name="0903119000761"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
the courts may have regard to the availability of correctional
resources, for the avoidance of doubt the courts must not pass a
sentence that is wholly determined by resource assessments which are
expressly intended for the guidance of the Secretary of State in
planning for and providing such custodial or community sentences as he
advises Parliament, and it considers, necessary in the light of such
assessments.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
does that fit his response to my case? Let me make it clear that it is
amendment 257 that I wish to press, not amendment 244; I may have
misled him and others by referring to it
wrongly.</div>
<a name="0903119000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000852"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> The amendment that the hon. and learned
Gentleman has just read out is unnecessary, but I expect that my hon.
Friend the Minister will make that point better
than me when she replies to the debate. The clauses follow closely what
the working group 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div>thought appropriate, and his amendment, on which we
will presumably be voting, is based on an overly cautious
interpretation of what the clauses intend. However, it is probably
better that my hon. Friend responds to that point, as I have risen
purely to defend my committee&#146;s
recommendations.</div><a name="0903119000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing
in mind that my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham said to me earlier
that silence is golden&#151;I seem to remember that that was a pop
song in the &#146;60s by the Tremeloes, and I shall not sing it to
the committee&#151;I shall conclude now.</div>
<a name="0903119000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
however, let me repeat a point that I made on Second Reading. If we do
not have a regard for resources or a means by which either the
Executive or Parliament and sentencers know what is needed and ensure
that it is provided, we will get a misalignment, which we have had in
the past. Unless one provides a massive amount over and above what is
needed to ensure that whatever sentence comes up, it can be
accommodated, there will be periods of peaks and troughs. When we get
peaks, what will inevitably happen is that the Government of the
day&#151;whoever they are and all of them have done it&#151;will
bring in early release schemes. Such schemes are the most
unsatisfactory way of dealing with the problem. They are completely
arbitrary and result in a loss of alignment between the sentence
intended by the courts and what actually
happens.</div><a name="0903119000798"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0903119000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the hon. and learned Gentleman makes his points in good faith, they are
based on a misinterpretation of what the working group said and how
such a clause would work in
practice.</div><a name="0903119000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000853"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I want to come back to the
amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth because they are the crucial amendments in this debate. My
attitude to many of the other clauses depends on the
Government&#146;s attitude towards his amendments. If the Government
looked kindly on his amendments and said that they want to see policy
moving in that direction, I would be far more inclined to support what
is in the Bill now than if the Government were to be hostile to them. I
shall try to explain that in a few minutes.</div>
<a name="0903119000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his
amendments, the right hon. Gentleman is trying to focus what the
sentencing council does on what works to reduce reoffending. That is
the central issue. If we can reduce the risk of reoffending, we end up
protecting the public. If we do that, we put the victim at the heart of
the criminal justice system because we are ensuring that we have fewer
victims in the future. The resource issue, about which the right hon.
Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East was talking, is part of
that. If we spend public resources on sentences that do not work as
opposed to spending them on sentences that do, we are, by that very
fact, allowing more crime than would have been the case had we used
public resources in the best possible way. We have a duty to ensure
that public resources are used in the best possible way to reduce
reoffending and crime to the extent that we
can.</div><a name="0903119000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, we know
quite a lot about what works and what does not, and we should use such
information. Obviously, we do not know everything. There are great
acres of ignorance in criminology because it is not a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>field that has benefited from a vast amount of
research money. None the less, we know some things, and we should work
with them. For example, the right hon. Gentleman mentioned restorative
justice. The evidence in favour of restorative justice is striking. It
was done using randomised control trials and in a way that is
comparable to medical research, using meta-analysis across a large
number of small-scale trials. Each of those trials would not, in
itself, show the effect, but when they are all added together the
effect is striking. I am talking about not only the important effect on
victims that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, but the big effect on
the number of crimes committed by offenders who have undergone that
process. We are talking about big numbers here&#151;reductions of a
quarter, compared with the other disposals that might have been used in
those cases.</div>
<a name="0903119000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that
certain forms of drug and alcohol treatment work. We know also that,
for the most part, alcohol treatments work with violent offenders and
drug treatments work with other offenders to reduce the amount of
reoffending. Furthermore, we know that those treatments tend to work
better in the community than in prison. There was some controversy in
the press over the weekend about that point, but the press, as usual,
missed out the point that what works to reduce reoffending is what
protects the public in the longer term. On resource use, drug and
alcohol treatment inside prison is not just less effective but
massively more expensive than it is outside.</div>
<a name="0903119000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know other
things, such as how prison can work better and that education, training
and work is the way to organise our prison system. If sentencers knew
that such activity was not likely to be included in the prison
sentence, they would understand what the sentence meant rather better
than they do
now.</div><a name="0903119000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know what does not work, too. Before the break, I mentioned the
research on short, sharp shocks, and it simply shows that they do not
work. Some senior judges are wrong and believe the opposite, however,
so external guidance needs to be given to them on that point.
Policymakers do not know it either, and we keep returning to programmes
that are proven not to work. In fact, we know that &#147;scared
straight&#148; programmes not only do not work, but make things
worse: they increase the reoffending rate. All that social scientific
evidence must be fed into the system, but as the right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth said, if we just leave it to lawyers and
judges, it will not be; it will just be treated as an external matter
to be thought about theoretically and to cause external criticism now
and then, but not to be built into the system. I fully support his
attempt to build such social scientific thinking into the system and
not just leave it on the outside.</div>
<a name="0903119000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, I
would go further and set up a national institute for criminal justice
excellence, giving it the job of testing what works, using existing
research and its own commissioned research, including studies into the
effectiveness of existing sentences. We tend to evaluate new ideas,
which is fine, but not old ones. We need to do so, however: we need to
be able to compare old and new ideas. We know, as the right hon.
Gentleman said, that short prison sentences do not work, but we need to
know more and to compare new and old ideas
systematically, so that we can allocate public
resources in a way that works for the system and for future victims of
crime.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div><a name="0903119000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East made the point
about how we keep sentencing policy in line with Government
resource-allocation decisions. What we have done in the past, and what
we might be trying to do with this legislation, is to resolve the issue
either by allowing the sentencers to do what they want&#151;so that
the Government have to guess what they are doing and provide resources
for whatever they guess, creating the immense problem, as the right
hon. Gentleman said, of having to provide for over-capacity and,
effectively, wasting resources&#151;or by allowing the Executive
branch to tell the judicial branch what to do and how to sentence
people. We do not want either, but that is what the sentencing
guidelines and sentencing council proposal tries to do.</div>
<a name="0903119000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would go
even further. If we had something like a national institute for
criminal justice excellence, it could feed into both the sentencing
guidelines and Executive policy. Because both systems would be reading
off the same hymn sheet, there might automatically be more
co-ordination. They would be using the same
evidence.</div><a name="0903119000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be obvious from what I have just said that I am not as
sympathetic as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to the
argument that judicial discretion should never be narrowed. I think
that there is a case for saying that judges should be required to take
into account the evidence on effectiveness of sentencing. My main worry
about the provisions is that they do not adequately take into account
effectiveness, which is the purpose of the amendments of the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. However, even if the amendments
were to be accepted, how would they work in
practice?</div><a name="0903119000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, how would clause 103 work for a sentencer who is faced with a
particular offender and is told to sentence according to the
guidelines? The guidelines seem to tell the sentencer to start with a
mechanistic view of retribution and then to move away from retribution
if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The question then is how
effectiveness gets built in. How does what we know about what works get
built into such a system? That does not happen at
present.</div><a name="0903119000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000854"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I do not disagree with much of what the hon.
Gentleman is suggesting, including a better structure of research,
examination and comparison of outcomes across sentences. However, I
think that it shows great ambition on his part to try to make that much
further leap at the Committee stage of a Bill, when we are part way
through. If we made the start that is contained in my amendments, we
would be moving in the right direction and building on what has been
done in the past that has been right; it is not a bad thing to have
regard to things that have worked. It might well be that some of his
more ambitious ideas would be a natural consequence a year or two down
the line, but they would take time. Making what we are about clear
would be an immediate step that would set us in the right
direction.</div><a name="0903119000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000855"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right and anticipates
my conclusion. The provisions are not perfect and they are not what I
would do&#151;obviously, the two are not always the same&#151;but
they are a move in the right direction.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column640" />Column number: 640</div><a name="0903119000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I am
worried about how clause 103 works. If the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s suggestions were looked on kindly by the Government,
they would raise a problem that would need to be thought about
regarding building effectiveness into the design of the ranges. The
ranges seem to be designed so that retribution is the first step, and
effectiveness and everything else comes second, but we need to think
about how to do it the other way
round.</div><a name="0903119000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some concerns about other clauses, as well, such as clause 105,
which is about revised and urgent guidelines. Obviously, revision is
fine, but I am slightly worried about making it too easy to pass urgent
guidelines, because they are liable to be headline-driven, not
evidence-driven. We need to be careful about allowing the system to
work too quickly in some
circumstances.</div><a name="0903119000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also slightly worried by clause 108, which deals with imprisonment
for public protection, but perhaps I have misunderstood it. IPPs are
part of the problem with the prison population&#151;they are a big
part of the crisis of rising prison numbers&#151;and I would like the
Minister to describe exactly how clause 108, which is about the
application of the sentencing guidelines to IPPs and similar kinds of
sentence, will work. As I read it, it seems that the guidelines apply
to the notion of determinate sentencing in relation to IPP, but not to
the decision of whether to impose an IPP in the first place. I hope
that that is not right because if it is, the guidelines are being
applied the wrong way round. They ought to be applied to the decision
on whether to have an IPP at all. This is contrary to what the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough was talking about, but I think that such
a situation gives the judiciary too much discretion and will lead to a
further expansion of the prison population in a way that we do not want
to
see.</div><a name="0903119000799"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0903119000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I shall mention resources, to which the hon. and learned Gentleman
referred. In a big way, the issue of resources is connected to the
Government&#146;s attitude towards the effectiveness question. It
seems that if effectiveness is built into the guidelines&#151;in a
real, not just symbolic, way&#151;it is perfectly sensible to build
resource use into the same pattern, because the use of public funds
needs to be as effective as possible, given what we have got. However,
if that is not to be the case and the sentencing guidelines are really
going to be about retributiveness&#151;for example, in relation to
clause 103 and the ranges&#151;with effectiveness as a kind of
ill-defined back stop relating to ill-defined cases, I cannot see how
resources are relevant. Resources are not particularly relevant to the
harm caused by the defendant, the defence intention or the defence
culpability, which is what clause 103 refers to.</div>
<a name="0903119000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am in a bit
of a dilemma. In a world in which the amendments of the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth are incorporated into the
legislation in a coherent way, I would be fully in favour of allowing
the sentencing guidelines to be built up using resources as a starting
point and, in fact, designing them in a strict way and saying that they
must be followed by the judiciary. However, if that is not the case and
retributiveness still rules the roost, I am not entirely clear why
resources are in the guidelines or why judges have to follow them,
because judges seem to me to be almost as good at working out
retributiveness questions as sentencing councils.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div><a name="0903119000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the end, the question is what do the sentencing council&#146;s
guidelines bring to the table? I think that they can bring evidence of
effectiveness from the outside to the table&#151;the kind of
information and arguments that would not naturally occur to judges and
lawyers in courts. That is why I said at the start that my attitude to
much of the rest of the debate depends on the Government&#146;s
attitude towards the crucial amendments tabled by the right hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="0903119000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000856"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain briefly what he
meant by his reference to the kind of factors that would not
necessarily or naturally occur to a judge? I did not quite follow that
point.</div><a name="0903119000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000857"></a>David
Howarth:</b> They are the factors of the relative
effectiveness of sentences given the social scientific evidence. I do
not think that that naturally occurs to lawyers&#151;it ought to
perhaps, but it does not. Lawyers tend to put such matters to one side
and say, &#147;That&#146;s very interesting, but the real stuff is
how culpable the defendant was and how much harm the defendant intended
or caused.&#148; That is the stuff referred to in clause 103 in
relation to sentencing ranges.</div>
<a name="0903119000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000858"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I wonder whether
there is another problem that relates to clause 102. The hon. Gentleman
will see that clause 102(11)(d) refers to the cost of
different sentences when the sentencing council comes to construct the
sentencing guidelines in the first place. In clause 102(11), there are
a list of things to which the council must have regard, and subsection
(d)
links</div><a name="0903119000762"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in
preventing
reoffending&#148;.</div><a name="0903119000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is that they might not be the same thing. The most costly
sentence might also be the most effective in preventing reoffending. Is
there a problem there, and how would he resolve
it?</div><a name="0903119000181"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000859"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Technically, one could multiply the two together,
or divide one by the other, depending on how one wants to do it.
However, the hon. Gentleman is right that that linking seems to put
cost first and relative effectiveness second. The right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth has made that point in certain of his
amendments, which would move the reference to &#147;relative
effectiveness&#148; to the top of the list in clause 102. That was
the whole point of some of the
amendments.</div><a name="0903119000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Member for Harborough referred several times to
amendment 257. It could be argued that the amendment is not needed
because it is implied already in the Bill and generally in practice,
but it would be helpful to state that under the current
system&#151;this is what the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth said&#151;individual judges are not required to take into
account the availability of prison places in individual cases. That is
not at all intended; and it is very important to rule it out. Resource
allocation questions should be built into the construction of the
guidelines. After that, the application of the guidelines should be a
matter of legal interpretation, not of getting judges to carry out
economic assessments of the effects of particular sentences. That would
be quite wrong, which is why, if the hon. and learned Gentleman
presses his amendment 257, I shall support
him.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column642" />Column number: 642</div><a name="0903119000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000860"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I shall do my best to deal with this wide-ranging
debate, which is now a stand part debate on the whole of part 4,
chapter 1. I shall also deal with the amendments tabled by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and those
referred to by the hon. Member for Cambridge, which come slightly
later.</div><a name="0903119000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments raise a number of basic issues. First and foremost, I would
like to make it clear that this part of the Bill establishes a new
body&#151;the sentencing council for England and Wales&#151;and in
doing so implements the recommendations of the working group chaired by
Lord Justice Gage, on which my right hon. Friend the Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East sat. He provided us with a very useful
run-through of the working group&#146;s intentions, and I agree with
his points, although I shall not repeat them because he set them out
very
well.</div><a name="0903119000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention is not to fetter the proper sentencing discretion exercised
by the independent judiciary; nor is it to tie sentencing decisions to
the wider issue of the availability of prison places or of any other
type of sentence, despite the fears that have been raised by the hon.
and learned Member for Harborough and others during the evidence-giving
sessions. I want to make it very clear that that is not the
Government&#146;s intention. As I think that he accepted at the
beginning of our remarks, ours is an evolutionary approach, as
recommended by the working group. It builds on the good work of both
the Sentencing Advisory Panel and the Sentencing Guidelines Council,
which will have completed most of the major guidelines by the time that
the new council starts work. Their work will be used as a foundation on
which to develop a better understanding of sentencing practice, and
will increase our ability to predict the impact of guidelines and
inform the wider role of the new council.</div>
<a name="0903119000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The working
group consulted widely on its recommendations, to which we are now
giving effect, and there was strong support for an evolutionary
approach, despite one or two of the revolutionary things that the hon.
Member for Cambridge was edging his way towards in his remarks. We have
not had a major falling out on that evolutionary approach. Nobody is in
favour of the US-style sentencing grid, whether it is from South
Carolina or Minnesota, and we all want to build on the good practice in
respect of what is there, because we believe that guidelines help
sentences. It is intended that the sentencing council will enhance
consistency, make sentencing more open, ensure that the public
understand and have confidence in sentencing, and generally be an
improvement on the current arrangements. However, there will be a
requirement on the council to prepare guidelines on the reduction of a
sentence for a guilty plea on the application of the totality
principle, which is necessary for the council to meet its duty to
monitor the operation of guidelines under clause
110.</div><a name="0903119000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested that what we are trying to do is unduly
prescriptive: that clause 102 causes resources to be taken into
account, that clause 103 has too rigid a sense of an arrangement for
setting out the format of guidelines, and that clause 107, with its
duty to follow guidelines, completes the coup d'√(c)tat of the
destruction of the independence of sentencers. I am exaggerating only
slightly some of the concerns that have been expressed. That is not the
intention. When it draws up guidelines, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column643" />Column number: 643</div>the council must have regard to current sentencing practice, to the
needs to promote consistency in sentencing and public confidence in the
criminal justice system, to the cost of different sentences, to their
effectiveness in reducing reoffending and to the council&#146;s
monitoring of the application of its
guidelines.</div><a name="0903119000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East set
out how little information was available to the working group when it
started its work, so we can all see the sense of the monitoring that we
are trying to get the new sentencing council to do. Apart from the
monitoring, all the other arrangements are already there. There is not
a requirement on the council to have regard to resources when drawing
up or revising guidelines. As well as my saying that, my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Justice has made that clear on Second
Reading. We do not resile from
that.</div><a name="0903119000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me deal with the question of whether the format of the guidelines is
too prescriptive, and other matters to do with clause 103. The clause
provides that where a sentencing guideline relates to a particular
offence, such as robbery, it must divide the offence into levels of
seriousness based on the offender&#146;s culpability and on the harm
caused. That clause sets out the format of offence-specific guidelines.
It does so because clause 107, about which some concern has also been
expressed, places a duty on a sentencer to follow the guidelines. So
clause 107 makes it clear that a sentencer must indicate how he has
followed the guidelines by reference to the ranges. Courts need to know
that they have to follow the guideline range for the seriousness of the
offence before them. That is necessary to meet the principle of
promoting consistency and predictability, which was highlighted in the
Gage
report.</div><a name="0903119000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
format also reflects the way in which the offence-specific guidelines
are currently framed by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, so there
will not be an enormous departure from the practice in respect of the
current arrangements. All the current offence-specific guidelines
issued by the SGC already comply with the format set out in clause 103.
However, because concern has been expressed about these matters, and
because we have a record in this Committee of listening to concerns
expressed by all Committee members, we are willing to look at clause
103 to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility in circumstances
where this format might not be practicable. I give that undertaking to
the Committee and hope that that might allay some of the concerns that
have been
expressed.</div><a name="0903119000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concern
was expressed about clause 107 and the duty to follow guidelines. Of
course, that is a central provision of this part of the Bill, which
sets out that the court must, in sentencing an offender, follow any
relevant guidelines unless it is satisfied that it would be contrary to
the interests of justice to do so. That provision attempts to give
effect to the Gage report recommendation to enhance the current
departure from guidelines test from a duty to have regard to guidelines
to a duty to follow guidelines, unless it is in the interests of
justice not to do so. However, again, the Government are willing to
consider any amendments that might improve that clause or allay the
concerns that have been expressed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div><a name="0903119000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">We certainly
thought that having the ability to depart from guidelines in the
interests of justice would guarantee judicial discretion in individual
cases. We do not believe that the clause limits discretion, but we are
willing to go away and think about this, and if members of the
Committee, or others, want to suggest something that they think would
be better, we will consider
it.</div><a name="0903119000800"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="0903119000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000861"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is extremely helpful, but we heard from
magistrates in the evidence session, and I know from my conversations
with judges, that they are concerned about the way in which clause 107
is phrased. Are the Government looking for further amendments to those
that we have tabled, or will they, of their own initiative, be tabling
revisions to clause
107?</div><a name="0903119000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000862"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> We will be looking to come up with better
formulations, but we are perfectly willing to listen to and meet anyone
who has any ideas. Indeed, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my
hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East, and I met magistrates before
the Bill progressed to this stage, and I think that they left her room
rather more reassured than when they entered it. None the less, we are
willing to continue considering how best to ensure a balance between
consistency and judicial discretion, because that is the prize that we
all seek. We do not want to end up just with what we have, because it
can be improved, and we are not trying to fetter discretion on
sentencing in individual cases. Nor are we trying to do more than was
set out in the report of the Gage working group, which we seek to
implement. I am not going to argue that we have got it all completely
correct.</div><a name="0903119000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000863"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> My hon. Friend is being very thoughtful in
her response, but does she agree that, regardless of any amendments
that she might consider making at a later stage, the phrase</div>
<a name="0903119000763"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contrary to the
interests of justice&#148;</div>
<a name="0903119000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">in clause 107(1) gives
quite wide
discretion?</div><a name="0903119000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000864"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Yes, it does give wide discretion, but there is
clearly some concern about that wording and concern that the
clause&#146;s overall impact, in connection with the perceived impact
of other clauses, will be to fetter discretion too much, but that is
not our
intention.</div><a name="0903119000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000865"></a>David
Howarth:</b> For those of us who think that the effective
prevention of reoffending is the crucial issue, another concern is that
the wording &#147;the interests of justice&#148; does not seem apt
to cover what we are worried about. We could have a phrase about it
being &#147;in the interests of society&#148; instead. The Minister
is right to reconsider that
wording.</div><a name="0903119000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000866"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I think that the wording &#147;the interests of
justice&#148; will cover an awful lot of territory in a courtroom
setting.</div>
<a name="0903119000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me close
my general remarks on the stand part debate by making it clear that the
new duties on the council to assess impact are not intended to mean
that it has to take account of resources in drafting or revising its
guidelines. This is about the council providing additional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 645</div>information that can be used by Government to plan for the demand on
prison places, community orders and new justice
services.</div><a name="0903119000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000867"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> The Minister has said twice now that there is
nothing in the Bill to suggest that the sentencing council should take
resources into account, but surely, clause 102(11)(d) must mean that
when the council is setting sentencing guidelines for the judiciary to
follow, unless it is in the interests of justice for it not to do so,
it must consider the &#147;cost of different sentences&#148;.
Surely, we cannot divorce that concept from the concept of having
regard to resources.</div>
<a name="0903119000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000868"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> There is nothing wrong with having an understanding
of the cost of different sentences, but that does not imply that we
should start setting guidelines that use only the cheaper sentences,
which is obviously what the concern is. It is not the intention of the
Government to try to fetter the work of the council in that
way.</div>
<a name="0903119000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000869"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I read that as saying that the sentencing council
should look at cost and effectiveness and balance the two. That is not
unreasonable at that stage of consideration. My problem is that the
effectiveness of sentencing only comes in as a balancing factor with
cost, rather than being the prime thing about which the council needs
to be
concerned.</div><a name="0903119000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000870"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Yes, and the point that my right hon. Friend makes
brings me neatly to dealing with&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge
is now going to throw me
off.</div><a name="0903119000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000871"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I hope not. The way I read paragraph
(d)&#151;in fact, the whole of clause 11&#151;is that the relative
costs and effectiveness of different disposals are relevant. What the
sentencing council is not taking into account is the budget&#151;the
estimate&#151;for the Ministry of Justice. It does not take into
account the total. It just takes into account the relative
effectiveness and costs of different kinds of sentence, which seems
eminently
reasonable.</div><a name="0903119000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000872"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman, after all of that.
I now regret being unpleasant to him
earlier.</div><a name="0903119000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to move on to the points that my right hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth made about his amendments. It
seems some time ago that he moved them. Briefly, there are, in effect,
two groups within the amendments, which, as he said, are designed to
give greater prominence to the role of reducing reoffending in the
creation of sentencing guidelines. The first set, which includes
amendments 150 to 153, deals with the role of reducing reoffending in
the creation of guidelines, and the second set, which includes
amendments 158 and 160 to 162, aims to make experience of reducing
reoffending a significant factor in the recruitment of members of the
council. That is just to remind members of the Committee what he
said.</div>
<a name="0903119000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">First and
foremost, I have a great deal of sympathy with what my right hon.
Friend and the hon. Member for Cambridge have been saying about the
impetus and motivation for the amendments, which is that some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 646</div>expertise in and understanding of what reduces reoffending is important
when considering sentencing guidelines. I do not disagree with that at
all. However, I am not convinced that the amendments are the best way
of injecting that into our system. To answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the Government&#146;s approach to the
amendments, I do not think that we are at all apart on the importance
of that in the overall scheme of things, but I am a bit concerned about
the impact that the amendments would have on the work of the council. I
shall briefly explain
why.</div><a name="0903119000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
150 would add a statutory purpose for the sentencing council to issue
guidance to sentencers and would place a requirement on it to have
particular regard to the effectiveness of sentences. It suggests that
the primary role of the council should be to issue sentencing
guidelines, but that is not its only purpose, of course. It has other
purposes, and all its functions are important. I have some concern
about the impact of trying to specify in statute that one is more
important than
another.</div><a name="0903119000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
151 would put the need to have regard to the effectiveness of reducing
reoffending at the head of the list of factors that the council must
have regard to when drawing up the guidelines, but there is no order of
precedence in the factors at present. It must have regard to all of
them. I think that it could create an imbalance and confusion if we
start saying that it must think of one as more important than another.
That is another worry that I have about the formulations used by my
right hon. Friend. To say that there must be specific regard to one of
the factors when other factors need to be considered might cause
confusion and unduly downgrade some of the factors that have to be
thought about. We do not want to do
that.</div><a name="0903119000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not to say that we do not accept and understand my right hon.
Friend&#146;s point about the importance of having an understanding
of what reduces reoffending injected into the system, as he and the
hon. Member for Cambridge have both explained. Section 142 of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires a court that is dealing with an
offender to have regard to the reform and rehabilitation of offenders,
as well as to punishment, crime reduction, public protection and
reparation. There is a general requirement on all sentencers to have
regard to such matters, and we need to build on that, rather than skew
the way in which the new sentencing council is to
work.</div><a name="0903119000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
153 requires the council to have specific regard to the effectiveness
of reducing reoffending and to indicate the evidence on which it relied
in producing its guidance. However, if evidence is not available or if
its relevance to sentencing for a particular offence under
consideration is dubious, it could prevent the council from issuing
guidelines, which we would not necessarily want to
do.</div><a name="0903119000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we want the council to have regard to evidence-based information that
is available and relevant in order to inform its
guidelines&#151;including comparative research materials from other
jurisdictions, for example&#151;we do not see it as the
council&#146;s role to commission its own research into the
effectiveness of different sentencing outcomes, because that simply is
not one of its functions. That is the responsibility of the Government,
and it is not something that we were planning on transferring to the
council under the Bill. The Government are committed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column647" />Column number: 647</div>to reducing reoffending, and their responsibility
for building up a knowledge base on what works for
reduced reoffending remains and will be implemented under our own
research programmes.</div>
<a name="0903119000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
on the composition of the council would probably introduce more
confusion that we would like. I understand my right hon.
Friend&#146;s thinking behind them, in that he is trying to make sure
that the personnel doing the job have sufficient knowledge of what
works and what can be done to reduce reoffending. However, having
independent members appointed by the Prime Minister or members approved
by resolution of the House, and overturning what is currently a planned
judicial majority, would give us cause for
concern.</div><a name="0903119000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Twenty
members might be a little unwieldy. The current Sentencing Guidelines
Council has 12 members; the Sentencing Advisory Panel has 15 and the
current plan under the Bill is that the new council should have a
judicial majority, albeit small. My right hon. Friend&#146;s
amendment would make the majority non-judicial and would increase the
number of members of the council. It is important to have the benefit
of non-judicial members, but it is also important to have the
confidence of the judiciary in the sentencing council. On that basis,
we have decided that, albeit small, there should be a majority of
sentencers on the council. That is the best way in which to retain the
confidence of sentencers while enabling the proper reflection of the
wider views of the
public.</div><a name="0903119000216"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000873"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Does my hon. Friend think it a good idea to have
confidence in sentencers, as well as having the confidence of
sentencers?</div><a name="0903119000801"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0903119000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000874"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Certainly. One of the main purposes of asking the
Gage working group to do its job was to see how we could increase the
confidence of the public in sentencers, which is particularly
important. I am not saying that I do not understand the fact that there
might be different views about whether there should be a judicial
majority or a non-judicial majority, but we have settled on a small
judicial majority rather than a larger
imbalance.</div><a name="0903119000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that my right hon. Friend and other members of the Committee
might have a slightly different view about whether that balance is
correct. However, we do not want to suggest to sentencers&#151;who do
a difficult job, as a number of hon. Members have mentioned&#151;that
the sentencing council is intended to undermine their independence or
impinge wrongly on individual decision-making powers in respect of
individual sentences. We believe that a small judicial majority on the
sentencing council sends the right signal while allowing plenty of
opportunity for people with the kind of expertise that the amendments
tabled by my right hon. Friend and supported by the hon. Member for
Cambridge seek to introduce.</div>
<a name="0903119000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not in a
position to accept my right hon. Friend&#146;s amendments as
currently drafted, because some of the disadvantages that would be
introduced would outweigh the advantages. However, several members of
the Committee certainly have sympathy with his aim, which is to
introduce relevant expertise that goes beyond 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column648" />Column number: 648</div>the law on sentencing and encompasses measures that
work and employs a wider range of research about
what reduces reoffending. We can do that by ensuring that those
appointed have the right characteristics. I cannot accept the
amendments as currently set out, but I hope that from what I have said,
my right hon. Friend will understand the sympathy with which we view
them. On that basis, I hope that he will agree to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0903119000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to mention amendments 244 and 257, as they were specifically
referred to by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. I think that
we are to have a vote on amendment 257. Amendment 244 seeks to remove
subsection (11)(d) from clause 102. That was referred to by the hon.
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. It seeks to address the concern that
the council and the courts will be required to have regard to resources
when drawing up guidelines on sentencing.</div>
<a name="0903119000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make
it clear that that does not represent any change in the current
arrangements&#151;it reflects existing practice. During the passage
of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which established the Sentencing
Advisory Panel, and throughout its operation, no concerns have arisen.
The council must have regard to the cost of different sentences and
their relative effectiveness in preventing reoffending. Therefore, when
drawing up guidelines and considering ranges and starting points, the
council should, among other things, consider the cost effectiveness of
different sentences in reducing reoffending. That does not mean that
the guidelines should be influenced by the availability of resources,
and I hope that members of the Committee will accept that.</div>
<a name="0903119000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 257
is meant to clarify clause
109</div><a name="0903119000764"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
the avoidance of
doubt&#148;</div><a name="0903119000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;that
wonderful phrase that we all love in legislation. However, I suggest
that it does not achieve its goal. Clause 109 places a duty on the
council to assess the resource implications of its sentencing
guidelines. The council will be required to publish an assessment of
the impact of a new guideline, or a revision to a guideline on prison,
probation and youth justice services. The assessment does not and
should not influence the drafting of a guideline. At no stage in the
process of creating or amending guidelines is the council required to
take account of available resources&#151;it just needs to produce an
impact assessment. It is not about having regard to resources; it is
about transparency.</div>
<a name="0903119000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
council produces a draft guideline, it will also produce an assessment
of the impact. However, there is no requirement for it to reconsider a
guideline simply because the assessment is considered by one party to
be unaffordable. I want to make it clear that the council does not need
to have regard to the availability of resources in drafting or amending
guidelines.</div><a name="0903119000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned about the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Cambridge, because it introduces the suggestion that the court can, or
should, have regard to resources in sentencing in an individual case.
It goes on to say that no sentence should be wholly determined by
regard for resource, which suggests that some of it should be. The
amendment seems to seek to introduce the very thing that the hon.
Gentleman is trying to
prevent.</div><a name="0903119000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues are technical ones about statutory interpretation, but I have
made the Government&#146;s position clear in that respect. I have
tried to deal with the points 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 649</div>raised in all the stand part debates. I hope that my
right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth will
consent to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="0903119000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000875"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Minister will
help me. In her remarks, she said that she has sympathy with what I am
trying to do in clarifying and focusing the work of the sentencing
council. However, she went on to say that she could not accept the
amendments as drafted. I take full responsibility for the drafting, and
accept that my amendments are capable of improvement. Is the Minister
sufficiently sympathetic to what I argued at the beginning of the
debate to offer the opportunity to discuss those purposes and perhaps
to consider whether the Government should come forward with amendments
on Report to further improve the
Bill?</div><a name="0903119000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000876"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I am happy to offer my right hon. Friend a
discussion. On the basis of how that discussion goes, I might be happy
to offer him the second thing that he asked for. However, I am not
committing myself to that at this
stage.</div><a name="0903119000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000877"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The Minister, in refusing to commit herself at
this stage, shows great wisdom, which I respect. Briefly, my concern
about her response is that Ministers are in some difficulties, because
having offered a judicial majority, taking it back might give them all
sorts of problems with the judges. I would encourage them to be brave
and not to feel intimidated. If numbers are of such great relevance,
reducing the numbers of judges in order to achieve balance might be the
way
forward.</div><a name="0903119000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept what the Minister said about the sentencing council having other
purposes. Yes, but the problem is that the whole criminal justice
system is confused about the council&#146;s purpose and is often
unclear about what it is for. I do not think that adding to that
confusion is possible, nor that my amendments would do that. Only the
youth justice system was provided with clarity of purpose in the 1998
Act, which I look back on with some pride, and that has been the part
of the criminal justice system that over the past 10 years has
delivered most
effectively.</div><a name="0903119000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister has said, I do not want to inject into the system a focus
on what works; I want what works&#151;I want the effectiveness of
sentencing in reducing reoffending to be right at the heart. That will
not skew the council, unless the council is in danger of regarding
reducing reoffending as an irrelevant sideshow, which it is
not.</div><a name="0903119000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the membership, I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging that
there is some value in getting people with knowledge and experience of
what works, but I also want to see people with analytic capacity, who
can question the system and demand evidence. As she has said, the
Government are committed to reducing reoffending and, for that reason,
they need to require their agencies and instruments to focus on
reducing
reoffending.</div><a name="0903119000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
heard that the Minister is sympathetic to what I am trying to do, I
accept that there is difficulty for the Government in accepting
amendments as drafted. If our discussions are as exciting and positive
as she has suggested, the Government might possibly move, otherwise I
shall bring back further amendments on Report. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0903119000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

effect of the amendment would be to reduce the council to producing

council to consult the Select Committee on Justice when drafting
sentencing and allocation guidelines. Under current arrangements, both
the Sentencing Advisory Panel and the Sentencing Guidelines Council
routinely consult the Justice Committee on proposals, and the Committee
tends to be consulted at the same time as Ministers and other
interested parties. The Committee has provided comments on guidelines,
and it has called witnesses to gather evidence relating to the contents
of draft
guidelines.</div><a name="0903119000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor said on Second Reading, the
Government are keen for the Select Committee to continue to have that
important role in scrutinising guidelines. To make that clear, these
amendments put in the Bill a duty on the sentencing council to consult
the Select Committee, which we think better reflects the Select
Committee&#146;s importance in scrutinising the guidelines and, given
the expanded duties of the council, the need to ensure that scrutiny
applies to the additional

Garnier:</b> The amendments would delete subsection
(4)(b) and (c). I simply want to know whom the Government intend the
sentencing council should consult as directed by the Lord Chancellor
or</div> <a name="0903119000766"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
the Council considers

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000910"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The effect of the amendments on allocation
guidelines would be that the sentencing council would be obliged under
the clause to consult only the Lord Chancellor. The Bill, like the
provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, requires the sentencing
council to
consult</div><a name="0903119000767"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Lord Chancellor...such persons as the Lord Chancellor may
direct...such persons as the Council considers
appropriate.&#148;</div>
<a name="0903119000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sentencing council
may choose to consult any other persons on the draft allocation
guidelines. The answer to the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
question is that anyone who might have an interest in what the
guidelines say about where cases should be allocated in the court could
be consulted. It will be for the sentencing council and/or the Lord
Chancellor to come up with a list. There is no intention, as far as I
am aware, to depart from existing practice, which is to consult
magistrates&#146; clerks, and those who have a view about and
expertise in the allocation of cases. That is our intention, but under
the amendment only the Lord Chancellor would be
consulted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000911"></a>Mr.

probing amendment. It is just that the clause is so vague and unclear.

include Uncle Tom Cobleigh. Nevertheless, I think that the Government
need to provide a bit more detail on occasions. I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000950"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The amendments are all identical, except that
they deal with the different jurisdictions of England and Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Essentially, they have the same wording.
We are considering the power under clause 119 for courts to provide for
the extension of disqualification from holding or retaining a driving
licence in certain circumstances. When a person is sentenced to a term
of imprisonment, from time to time, if not invariably, by virtue of the
nature of their offence under sentencing powers available to the court,
they will be disqualified from driving for period. The period coincides
with, or is shorter than, the period of imprisonment, however, so many
members of the public think&#151;and the Government appear to
agree&#151;that that is no punishment at all. The driving part of the
offence, while it may be dealt with by a custodial sentence, is not
effectively dealt with through the loss of the driving
licence.</div>
<a name="0903119000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
understand the logic behind the argument, in my role as shadow Justice
Minister I am increasingly concerned that we are getting rehabilitation
wrong, and we are getting most wrong the measures on enabling those who
leave prison to find employment. One of the many things that reduce
re-offending is the prospect of holding down a job. In addition to
that, accommodation, coming off and staying off drugs and a stable
relationship must be considered because they represent a bridge between
inside and outside. Many people leaving prison fall off it and back
into crime.</div>
<a name="0903119000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must be
very careful before agreeing to the powers in the schedule because we
may be cutting off our nose to spite our face. In earlier discussions,
we talked about the effectiveness of sentencing and the need for the
Sentencing Guidelines Council to take that into account. Here we have a
classic example of our rushing ahead but achieving nothing. I have
visited a number of prisons. If one goes to open prisons, or to HMP
Latchmere House in Richmond upon Thames, one will find that prisoners
coming to the end of quite long custodial sentences leave prison daily
to carry out work. Many of those jobs are either driving jobs or
require the prisoners to get to the place of work using their own
transport. Prisoners at several open prisons that I have visited use
their own cars to travel from the prison to their place of
work&#151;in shops, offices, charities and so on.</div>
<a name="0903119000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
people I met at HMP Latchmere House in Richmond were going off to do
labouring jobs for British Gas or other public utilities, including
Transport for London. Sometimes they go by public transport because
Richmond is accessible by public transport, but it is not always
possible for the offender to get to work on time and get back before
the curfew at the end of the working day. That is clear enough while
prisoners are in open prisons or in halfway houses, but it is less
clear, although equally true, in respect of those who have left prison
having completed their sentences and need to maintain a connection with
employment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 657</div><a name="0903119000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
tabled amendment 455 and the others in the group to ensure that we do
not prevent people who need to rehabilitate and to remain in touch with
work from doing so. I hope that the way in which we have drafted the
amendment allows the court to take account of the interests of justice
as well as the needs of the individual defendant to go to
work.</div><a name="0903119000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000951"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The Bill places a duty on the courts to impose an
extension period to any driving disqualification imposed at the same
time as a custodial sentence. That is to ensure that time spent in
prison does not erode the impact of the driving ban. The provisions
will ensure that offenders are treated consistently and fairly and that
they will face the full impact of their driving
ban.</div><a name="0903119000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would replace the duty on the courts to impose an extended
period where a custodial sentence is also imposed at the same time and
leave the matter to the discretion of the courts. I hope to reassure
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, who will know that the
courts already take some account of time to be served in custody when
determining the length of a driving ban. The proposal in the Bill will
require the courts to act consistently in that regard, but when the
court is determining the discretionary period of the ban that is
appropriate to the offence committed it is guided by Court of Appeal
guidance. As the hon. and learned Gentleman will know, it is well
established sentencing practice that a long period of disqualification
may be counter-productive and contrary to public
interest.</div><a name="0903119000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be cases where long driving bans are justified by the
circumstances of a particular offence and if the offender&#146;s
record shows an irresponsible attitude to the use of vehicles. In such
circumstances, the courts can and do impose long bans. But the Court of
Appeal has discouraged disproportionately long periods of
disqualification for the reasons that the hon. and learned Gentleman
mentioned when moving his amendment. For example, the prospect of
losing a licence for a long time or of never being able to drive again
lawfully may only increase the temptation for offenders to ignore the
ban and drive illegally and may present just the kind of barriers that
he mentioned in respect of rehabilitation, particularly if they affect
job
prospects.</div><a name="0903119000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the points that the hon. and learned Gentleman makes, but
the courts already take into account the factors identified in the
amendments when determining the appropriate length of the driving
disqualification. We are seeking to ensure that that disqualification
period, when set by the courts, is served. On that basis, the hon. and
learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment is unnecessary and I ask him to
withdraw
it.</div><a name="0903119000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000952"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I wish that I had the Minister&#146;s
confidence. It is that early period, post-release, that is so
difficult. That is when most prisoners who leave prison and commit
suicide do so and when most of them turn to crime&#151;probably in
that first fortnight. The first 24 hours is important and
the first fortnight is almost as important. It takes some time for
people who have been inside for quite some time to get used to being on
the outside again. We are not very good at helping offenders bridge
that gap, which I have
described.</div><a name="0903119000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not going to press the amendment to a Division. I will ask the
Committee&#146;s permission to withdraw amendment 455, but the issue
is not just some debating 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 658</div>point; it is a matter of huge and pressing importance. Anyone who has
studied our prisons or participated in the criminal justice system as
an advocate or as a judge will realise that the matter must be taken
account of. As I said, although I will not press the amendment to a
Division, I would not want anyone to brush this aside as an
early-evening debating point because it is a matter of huge importance.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

The discretionary disqualification period is the period for which, in
the absence of this section, the court would have disqualified the

under section 34 or 35, and still being served, less any period already
served.&#148;.&#146;.</div><a name="0903119000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment concerns a different point from that raised by the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough. I will start with the story of a recent
case that came up in a magistrates court in south Wales. A gentleman
had been disqualified for dangerous driving and had been given the
maximum disqualification period, which was 12 months. He was back in
the magistrates court a month later in front of the same bench when he
was charged with driving while disqualified. As I understand it, the
maximum period for which he could then be disqualified as a result of
driving while disqualified was a further three months. However, the
three months had to run concurrently with the one year driving
ban.</div>
<a name="0903119000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
amendment, I am proposing to make it possible for magistrates who have
such a case to be able to add an extension period, so that a further
period of disqualification would start at the end of the previous
period of disqualification. The amendment would enable magistrates to
do that, but it would not mean that they have to, because there are
circumstances in which they clearly would not wish to do so. The
gentleman I mentioned in the example has no incentive for the first
nine months of his driving ban to abide by that ban because whatever
disqualification period he gets on top of that is up to a maximum of
three months and runs
concurrently.</div><a name="0903119000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point was raised with me by a magistrate who was concerned about the
case and the fact that there was nothing that they were able to do
despite the strength of feeling on the bench. The amendment would give
discretion to the magistrates and would mean that they are able to add
an extension period when they are making a decision in such cases. The
amendment would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 659</div>mean that the same common sense that applies to the original proposals
that the Minister has laid out in relation to adding on to a period of
imprisonment would apply to a period of
disqualification.</div><a name="0903119000379"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000954"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Subject to the points that I made in our previous
short debate about the Court of Appeal guidelines and the interests of
justice in not imposing too extensive a ban going far into the future,
I have some sympathy for the points that the hon. Lady is making.
However, I do not want her to press her amendment to a Division for a
couple of reasons.</div>
<a name="0903119000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consideration
is currently being given to whether further provision on driving bans
should be made for repeat offenders, who I think are the people about
whom she is interested. If further provision should be made, what is
the best way forward? We still have legal and administrative issues to
deal with in respect of how that kind of extra provision might work,
and there are potentially difficult issues that we must
consider.</div>
<a name="0903119000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
currently looking at some transitional provisions, and some Road Safety
Act 2006 provisions are due to come into force in the not-too-distant
future, which will permit reductions in disqualification periods for
offenders who, for example, attend specified driving courses. We must
ensure that we dove-tail any arrangements that we make here with those
provisions because we do not want to end up with a mess. On that basis,
I hope that the hon. Lady will understand when I say that, while I have
some sympathy, I am not yet in a position either to table Government
amendments or to accept the one that she has tabled. However, we
realise that it is a point, and we are considering it further. Once the
issues have been solved, we hope to introduce a provision dealing with
the point that she has made. On that basis, I hope that she will
withdraw her

<a name="0903119000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000956"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have a brief question about the imprisonment
for public protection offences that clauses 120 and 121 relate
to. The key element is that an offender must prove to the authorities
that he or she is fit for release; that is done through special classes
and intensive supervision. Given the categories of offences that are
included in those two clauses, what sort of classes would be seen to be
appropriate, and what would such offenders be expected to undertake in
order to prove to the authorities that they were fit for release? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 660</div>How will that dovetail with ensuring that somebody is no longer a threat
to the public? How will the process be seen to
work?</div><a name="0903119000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000957"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The hon. Lady is quite right that clause
120 inserts into schedule 15 of the Criminal Justice Act
2003, into a list of offences that are suitable for indeterminate
public protection sentences, some offences that relate to a wider range
of terrorist-related offences. In doing so, we are amending part 1 of
the schedule, which specifies violent offences.</div>
<a name="0903119000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
particular terrorist-related offences in the clause are appropriate for
inclusion in the schedule, because they demonstrate a sufficiently
direct risk of harm, in that they relate to the planning and/or
commission of violent crimes, and carry maximum custodial sentences of
10 years or more. In that sense, it has perhaps been a bit anomalous
that they have not been there already. Public protection is, of course,
paramount, and it is important to take the opportunity to update the
schedule to keep pace with changes in public risk. Some of the offences
were introduced only in the Terrorism Act 2006, which is why
they are not already in the schedule.</div>
<a name="0903119000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
is right, however, to say that as part of the regime IPP prisoners are
expected to show that their dangerousness has reduced, and there will
be a suite of arrangements to assist them in indicating that. Clearly,
it is important that, particularly, motivated violent offenders have
suitable courses. I am not in a position today to give her a list of
precisely what they will be in respect of each of the offences, but it
is certainly the case that the types of offences in the clause are
completely within the area of the offences that Parliament has said are
suitable for indeterminate sentences for public protection. Certainly,
before we start operating them as such, and before such sentences start
being given, arrangements must be made for courses that will enable the
individuals concerned to show that they are fit to be released. We
would not expect such sentences to be imposed without there being a
regime of that kind, through which people can seek to be released after
the expiry of their tariff. Indeed, we have come across one or two
legal problems in respect of that before. Therefore, I can assure the
hon. Lady that we would not use such sentences, or have them available
for use by the court, without there being arrangements to deal with the
points that she has made.</div>
<a name="0903119000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would seem
anomalous not to have violent offences of such a nature included in the
regime for indeterminate sentences for public protection. We think that
they are suitable, and we are taking the opportunity to update the
list.</div><a name="0903119000391"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000960"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I shall focus primarily on new clause
18, which contains the essence of my proposals, which would assist
Ministers in making a reality of the concept of the commissioner for
victims and witnesses in a way that would command widespread
support.</div>
<a name="0903119000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
involved in witness issues for many years. Indeed, I was involved in
setting up a very early victim support group in Cardiff, along with
Jonathan Evans, who went on to become a Conservative MP some years
later, and is now a Member of the European Parliament, but who was then
responsible for defending people in Cardiff within the court system. So
I have followed these issues for many years.</div>
<a name="0903119000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">During my time
as the deputy Home Secretary, and during my many years in opposition, I
worked closely with Victim Support, which I found to be a constructive
organisation concerned with practical issues that would be of real
benefit to victims, rather than with representative or
headline-catching issues. I was therefore very concerned to read its
evidence to the Committee about the amendments to the commissioner
idea. It had originally supported the concept of having such a
commissioner when the idea was proposed five years ago, but it said in
its comments on the
Bill:</div><a name="0903119000770"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
then, the Victims Code Of Practice has brought about many of the basic
improvements in the system that would have fallen to the Commissioner,
so the rationale for the role is now much weaker. Further improvements
could be better delivered through proper monitoring of the Code and
regular increases in its service
standards.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went on to
say:</div><a name="0903119000771"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
addition, the real voice for victims lies with organisations such as
Victim Support and others in the voluntary sector who help victims of
crime. The Commissioner will duplicate that role and waste valuable
resources.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
that be the case, there would be some sense in the conclusion that
Victim Support reached. It
stated:</div><a name="0903119000772"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are therefore calling on the Government to set out a clear argument for
why it thinks the Commissioner is still needed after
five years have passed and, unless it is able to do
so, to repeal the Commissioner provisions and redirect its funding
towards front line services instead.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column662" />Column number: 662</div><a name="0903119000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has clearly given the Government the opportunity to say, &#147;No,
there is a focused piece of work that the commissioner could
undertake.&#148;</div>
<a name="0903119000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence that
has been heard by this Committee and by the Select Committee on Justice
has raised the concerns of victims and others about making complaints
about and getting redress within the criminal justice system. We heard
that there are 10 different agencies and organisations. The list that
shows how complaints are dealt with, in relation to different aspects
of the criminal justice system, shows that the methods are varied and
inconsistent. They might be suitable for the work of the relevant
agencies, but they certainly do not hang together if anyone has a
complaint about what the criminal justice system as a whole has done.
Hon. Members might share my experience that when one is trying to get
redress for a constituent, when something has gone wrong, it is often
difficult to know whether it went wrong because of the police, the
Crown Prosecution Service or the courts&#146; administration. Until
one can answer that, one cannot get into those separate silos of
complaint.</div><a name="0903119000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could take away the burden currently on the victim, if they have a
complaint, of knowing where to address it and of having to understand
the criminal justice system in order to make a complaint. I therefore
suggest that the commissioner should be given a clear but very simple
and inexpensive responsibility, which is to be the point of
co-ordination. Victims and witnesses would make their complaint to the
commissioner, who would then ensure that the right silo of complaint
examination dealt with it, or, if the issue was clearly not for one
agency rather than another, that agencies co-ordinated their activities
to ensure that the focus was on giving the right answer to the victim
and dealing with the complaint, rather than playing games across the
silos, going right down the practical depths of individual
organisations.</div><a name="0903119000406"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000961"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): The right hon. Gentleman is

<a name="0903119000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000962"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> It is a one-stop shop, but the shop does not have
to have all the goods for sale within it. The point is not to take away
the responsibility for existing agencies and existing complaints
systems to deal with complaints. The new clause would take away the
burden on the victim to understand the criminal justice system to be
able to make a complaint
effectively.</div><a name="0903119000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the new clause would also be a great help to Members of
Parliament, who currently have to try to understand the criminal
justice system. I believe that even those of us who have been involved
in it for many years would agree that that is not the simplest thing to
do.</div><a name="0903119000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
proposal in new clause 18 is that we insert a clause to allow the
commissioner to</div> <a name="09031146000003"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;receive
complaints from victims and witnesses about the workings of the
criminal justice
system&#148;.</div><a name="0903119000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
responsibility then would be either
to</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;indicate the appropriate body
to deal with the complaint or co-ordinate consideration of two or more
bodies where there is shared responsibility or a lack of clarity about
who is responsible for the issues about which the complaint is
made.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two other elements of the new clause. One is that the
commissioner</div><a name="09031146000004"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall be
supplied with a copy of the response of any such body or bodies and may
request that the findings be re-considered.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 663</div><a name="0903119000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, the
activity of the cost remains with those organisations, but the
commissioner is able to act in the interests of the
victims.</div><a name="0903119000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the Lord Chancellor</div><a name="09031146000005"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
issue guidance to the relevant bodies in the Criminal Justice System
setting out how they should co-operate with the Commission and with
each other in order to provide an appropriate response to victims and
witnesses.&#148;</div><a name="0903119000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am certain that any Lord Chancellor would see that as an opportunity to
tidy up some of the operations of the
system.</div><a name="0903119000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">Giving
the commissioner this role in respect of complaints would enable him to
change the culture of the criminal justice system without increasing
costs. The costs to the commission would be minimal, and the benefits
would be standard-setting rather than having to intervene directly. It
would be a major and positive
development.</div><a name="0903119000416"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000963"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): For clarification, a couple
of constituents recently told me that false allegations made against
them were investigated by the criminal justice system and disposed of
without any prosecution. There is no stain on their character, but the
investigation has been disclosed to employers in enhanced Criminal
Records Bureau checks. Would the system that my right hon. Friend
describes extend to those people as
victims?</div><a name="0903119000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000964"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Very simply, if as victims they were complaining
about how they had been dealt with in the system, they would currently
be able to use one of 10 different complaint systems. My
proposal would enable the commissioner to help them to address their
complaint to the right organisation, or to ensure that there was
co-operation across boundaries. It might not deal with some of the more
complex areas of false accusation&#151;some of them would fall
outwith the nature of the complaint system&#151;but it would assist
somebody who had a complaint such as that against the
system.</div><a name="0903119000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now explain the three amendments, including the one that I moved,
amendment 156, which would omit line 35. I do not understand why the
Government want to stop the commissioner being able in law to carry out
research. Whether the commissioner is able to carry out research or not
would depend on what resources are provided by the Lord Chancellor, so
the Government would control any expansion in research activity. It
seems unwise to remove from the Bill something that might never be used
but that might need to be used in the
future.</div>
<a name="0903119000805"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0903119000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
163 is about the Government&#146;s attempt to omit subsection (3)(b)
which is about the laying of reports before Parliament. The Government
have proposed a new system of reporting in which reports would be made
to the Secretary of State for Justice, the Attorney-General and the
Home Secretary. I am perfectly happy for them to receive reports, but
it seems rather odd that a report should not be laid before Parliament.
In that regard, I have made a further suggestion, which is that the
Government would be supported in deleting the existing provision if the
three Ministers who receive the report have the responsibility of
laying it before Parliament. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 664</div>It seems that the report of the commissioner should
end up before Parliament, but the way in which the clause is worded
suggests that that would not be the case.</div>
<a name="0903119000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
fairly simple points aimed at assisting the Government in addressing
the concerns raised by Victim Support and enabling them with very
little pain or cost to do something really useful. I hope, therefore,
that the proposals in new clause 18 will be accepted by my hon.
Friend.</div>
<a name="0903119000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000965"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The principles behind new clause 18 are something
that we broadly share. The right hon. Gentleman can correct me if I am
wrong, but I suspect that they are drawn from the Victim Support
manifesto from earlier in this
decade.</div><a name="0903119000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000966"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> They arise from looking at the concerns that have
been expressed by Victim Support, which I quoted, and from the evidence
about how difficult it is to find one&#146;s way through the
complaints system. It is as simple as
that.</div><a name="0903119000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000967"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> It is a coincidental invention, but none the
worse for all that. In the Victim Support manifesto 2001, it stated
that the role of the victims commissioner should be to ensure that
agencies implement changes to their policies or procedures where these
have proved not to have taken full account of the interests and needs
of victims; advise victims on how to seek redress, giving assistance in
important test cases and initiating proceedings in the
Commissioner&#146;s own name; deal with individual complaints where
resolution at an earlier stage has not been successful; scrutinise
proposed legislation which will affect victims of crime; conduct
inquiries into issues of public concern that would not be resolved
through the outcome of individual cases; and seek to reduce secondary
victimisation. Those are all reasonable aims to try to
achieve.</div>
<a name="0903119000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">The one thing
that puzzles me about the Government&#146;s approach is how slow they
have been. Six years ago&#151;probably longer&#151;they heralded
the establishment of the victims commissioner. In 2002, the post was
proposed in their document &#147;Justice for All&#148;. It was
legislated for in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
The post was advertised, but they never appointed anyone to fill the
job. Then the Prime Minister announced it yet again in his speech to
the Labour party conference last year. Now under this clause, we get
provision to pay for his salary and pension and allowances and
gratuity. The whole process has taken far too long.</div>
<a name="0903119000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have appointed an interim victims champion, and at last we are seeing
the Government moving toward doing something practical about making it
possible for the victims commissioner to carry out his functions. None
the less, it has taken seven years, and the Government must explain why
they have taken so long to achieve what must not be a party political
or a controversial matter, but something that so many of us think is
appropriate.</div><a name="0903119000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000968"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I am glad that the right hon. Member for Cardiff,
South and Penarth has tabled these amendments. I share his views about
the value of Victim Support and the job that it does. I declare an
interest as a former employee of Victim Support in the area in which
the right hon. Gentleman worked. The right hon. Gentleman makes a
valuable point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column665" />Column number: 665</div><a name="0903119000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the
concerns of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough about the delay
in implementing the victims commissioner. Given that it has been such a
long time since the measure was originally proposed, a bit of a
stocktake as to how the situation has changed and what powers are
needed seems sensible. With the implementation of the victims code of
practice, things have improved. There is a feeling from organisations
such as Victim Support that things have got better in a number of ways,
so it makes sense to re-evaluate the powers of the victims
commissioner. However, the concern about the clause, which would be put
right by the amendments tabled by the right hon. Gentleman, is that the
Bill as drafted waters down massively the powers of the victims
commissioner without giving it any real role. The role is not one that
has been put in place before, so to take away pretty much all its teeth
before it has had a chance seems completely
daft.</div><a name="0903119000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
me, the key issues are around transparency and reporting to Parliament,
which I find difficult to understand&#151;I shall be grateful if the
Minister will clarify why that has been removed and why the
commissioner is only reporting to Ministers. The role of Parliament in
such issues is important. It is also important that the commissioner
has the ability to do something. The proposals in new clause 18 are a
sensible way forward, but I have real concerns about the powers being
removed by the clause. I fully support the amendments tabled by the
right hon. Gentleman to reinstate some of the powers and
responsibilities of the commissioner, so that when we finally see a
full-blown victims commissioner, they are in a position to do
something. It is a crucial role and removing the ability of the
commissioner to do anything is just kicking their legs out from
underneath them before they even start, so I wholeheartedly support the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments.</div>
<a name="0903119000429"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000969"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I shall try to deal with the points raised. We are
making changes to the legal framework, which as the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough said was in the Domestic Violence, Crime and
Victims Act 2004, for a number of reasons. One is that, as
he said, we were unable to get the right level of applications to
appoint. As the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central was saying, things
have changed and improved a lot in the interim. While not having been
able to appoint at the time of the first advert, for the post as
originally envisaged, we carried on and now fund Victim Support with a
core grant of &#163;30 million a year, plus an additional
&#163;12.5 million since 2007-08, to provide a national
network of support and engagement with victims and witnesses. So,
Victim Support is now a national organisation, with a central policy
function. We do not now believe that there is good value in
establishing a separate office for the commissioner with roles that are
effectively carried out by Victim Support as a national
organisation.</div><a name="0903119000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have, as the hon. Lady mentioned, introduced the code of practice for
victims of crime, which sets out standards of service that victims can
accept. We have developed witness care units, to provide information
and support for witnesses to attend court and give their best evidence.
I have already mentioned the development in Victim Support, which
included a lot of financial support from the Government, and the 42
local criminal justice boards, which bring together criminal justice
agencies at a local level to work in partnership, with a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 666</div>primary responsibility of supporting victims and witnesses. There is
also much more availability of special measures to help vulnerable and
intimidated witnesses. In fact, the landscape has been transformed and
it is for that reason that we want to change the functions that the
victims commissioner should undertake, to take account of that changed
circumstance. That is why we are bringing forward our suggested changes
in the Bill. I hope that the Committee will accept
that.</div><a name="0903119000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe that there is a necessity for an elaborate statutory
support structure for the commissioner. It would distract the focus of
the commissioner&#146;s work, which should primarily be about
understanding the needs of victims and witnesses and promoting their
interests. The commissioner can effectively be supported by a core
office of civil servants or other seconded professionals from criminal
justice agencies and take advice, and work with other important experts
such as Victim Support. That is why we no longer consider it
appropriate for the commissioner to have the power to undertake
research.</div>
<a name="0903119000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure my
right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that we
remain fully committed to research. For example, last year the
Department published research papers exploring victims&#146; and
witnesses&#146; experiences of the criminal justice system and an
evaluation of the victims advocate scheme. We want such valuable
research to continue. We want the commissioner to have access to it,
but we do not believe that it is necessary for him or her to have their
own research capability. In planning our own research programmes, we
would expect to enter into discussions with the commissioner about
priorities and to take his or her views into
account.</div><a name="0903119000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
157 and 163 relate to reports by the commissioner. Amendment 163 would
retain the duty on the Justice Secretary to lay before Parliament a
copy of any ad hoc report issued by the commissioner, while amendment
157 would require the Justice Secretary to lay the
commissioner&#146;s annual report before Parliament. I completely
understand the reasons for the amendments, but we are not seeking to
downgrade the importance of the reports issued by the commissioner.
There is great value in laying reports by statutory bodies and office
holders before
Parliament.</div><a name="0903119000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
future, the commissioner will chair the victims advisory panel. Section
55 of the 2004 Act requires the panel to produce an annual report for
any year in which it has been asked to provide advice by the
Justice Secretary. Under section 55, the Justice Secretary is required
to publish those reports and lay them before Parliament and it is in
that way and to avoid duplication that the commissioner&#146;s work
will be laid before Parliament.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000970"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> What is not clear from what my hon. Friend has
just said, and which was extremely helpful, is whether the
commissioner&#146;s report will be laid&#151;or is she saying that
it will only be assimilated within the panel&#146;s
report?</div><a name="0903119000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000971"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> It seems sensible to have one report instead of
two, given that the commissioner will be chairing the victims advisory
panel. The victims advisory panel&#146;s report will be subsumed
within the one that the commissioner will be producing. It is sensible
to have one report, not two. That is my central point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column667" />Column number: 667</div><a name="0903119000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I have been a Minister for many years, I do not quite have the
confidence of my right hon. Friend and others that dealing with
complaints from any victim in the country would not be
resource-intensive. Even a one-stop shop can have a lot of bits of
paper coming in and out of it. My right hon. Friend said that such a
system would not be very costly, resource-intensive or
people-intensive, but I am not convinced that that would end up being
accurate. While it is absolutely true that there is a much increased
level of victim satisfaction, partly as a result of the work in respect
of the developments in support of witnesses, that is not to say that a
new portal for complaints will not be inundated with complaints from
various people who think that it is another way to get their point
across. Many of us in Committee will realise from our constituency work
that we are often seen ourselves as appeals against court cases that
went wrong. Whether or not there is anything that we can do about such
matters, we end up hearing from constituents who wish us to agree that
something ought to be
done.</div><a name="0903119000438"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000972"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am sure that the Minister will be relieved to
know that I describe myself as either a one-stop shop or even, possibly
in dramatic terms, as a bit of joined-up government. We have an
integrating function. Will she at least concede in respect of the
comments by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that,
while there may be some abuse, there is nevertheless the need for some
facility&#151;either at local or national level&#151;so that people
who are distressed about their handling and are confused by the
circumstances such as someone who has been falsely accused, which has
happened to one of my constituents recently, know and have reassurance
that they will receive proper advice and get the thing dealt
with?</div>
<a name="0903119000439"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000973"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
There are complaints procedures in all public authorities, and I accept
the argument by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth that there are many different agencies in the criminal justice
system, but we have done a lot more locally and nationally to join up
the agencies and make them talk to each
other.</div>
<a name="0903119000806"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div>
<a name="0903119000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
nationwide victim support body that is funded generously by central
Government to give advice. There are citizens advice bureaux and, I
hesitate to say, local Members, although we do end up being one place
where people seek advice. At the end of the day, however, the criminal
justice agencies have to, and ought to, deal with complaints properly.
There is a series of ombudsmen thereafter. Of course, one cannot take
judicial decisions to them, but criminal justice agencies do certain
things that one might. We do not want to impose or create some other
portal that may or may not help, however.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000974"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the Minister at least consider encouraging
the various agencies to pick up and run with the so-called &#147;no
wrong door&#148; concept that the Government developed a few years
ago, although we have not heard about it recently, so that, if somebody
makes an application to the wrong people, they&#151;that
agency&#151;will refer them to the right
people?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000975"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> It sounds so simple, but administratively these
things often end up being much more complicated than such simple,
sensible-sounding ideas that we all can and do come up with, and which
my right hon. Friend has come up with in his new clause. Although I
understand his points, I am not convinced that we would envisage such a
role for the commissioner. There is no doubt that the commissioner will
be in receipt of complaints, but I am not convinced that they should
become a clearing house for them. I hope that my right hon. Friend will
not press his new clause, because we do not envisage conferring on the
commissioner&#146;s role a statutory complaints function. However,
the criminal justice agencies need to improve their performance, and we
would seek to make them do so, as would the other victim support
infrastructure, which did not exist in 2004 when the original
legislation was passed.</div>
<a name="0903119000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have been able to deal with my right hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. He
may not be quite so happy with what I have said about his new clause,
but I hope that he will withdraw his amendment and not press to a
Division his new clause.</div>
<a name="0903119000444"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000976"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her response,
as far as it goes. On the report to Parliament, she has gone some way
to providing reassurance, and if, in effect, the commissioner&#146;s
report will incorporate the panel&#146;s report, that is
satisfactory. However, I urge my hon. Friend to consider whether that
point ought to be clarified in some formal embodiment of what she has
told us today, because it is reassuring.</div>
<a name="0903119000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am less
happy about what my hon. Friend said on complaints, because she missed
the point that I underlined: at the beginning of the Committee, we took
evidence on the existence of 10 different ways of dealing with
complaints from the 10 different agencies that operate in the criminal
justice system. Indeed, the 10 agencies may be the tip of the iceberg,
because when we sub-divide things, the issue may be more complex. I
accept my hon. Friend&#146;s point that it is complicated for
Ministers to find a way through the undergrowth of improving the
performance of different parts of the criminal justice system to make
it more receptive to the interests of the individuals. However, we
should think what it is like, therefore, for a victim who has to decide
which door to knock at. We should think also about the complexity of
making complaints to the ombudsmen, some of which have to be made
directly to the people who will have administered the problem, even if
the complainant can work out which agency is responsible.</div>
<a name="0903119000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge my hon.
Friend to consider the matter further, and whether there should be a
capacity not to undertake the investigation of complaints but, where
necessary, to knock heads together. The success of the commissioner
will be judged on their saying, &#147;I no longer have to do this,
because it is clear where people should go with their complaints and
that the &#145;no wrong door&#146; principle&#148;&#151;to
which the hon. Member for Daventry referred and I know Ministers
aspire&#151;&#147;happens in practice.&#148; That is my hope, and
I ask my hon. Friend as gently as I can to reconsider her rejection of
the new clause. I appreciate that it is not a totally worked through
suggestion, but it could be. I urge her to give it further thought and
I hope that we will see Government amendments coming forward, or
perhaps it would be appropriate to make further 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column669" />Column number: 669</div>suggestions on Report. I do not wish to detain the Committee any further

Amendments 301 to 304, 313 and 314 are minor and technical in that they

convictions covered by these provisions. In respect of section 103 of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with bad character evidence,
the amendments include all foreign service offences. This is in line
with both the current position in case law and the changes being
introduced in the Bill. All these amendments are consistent with how
previous UK service offences are used in domestic criminal

<a name="0903119000457"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000980"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I do not quarrel with the Government amendments.
I just want to be sure that when a defendant has been convicted of an
offence under the law of any country outside England and Wales, a
provision will enable the English courts to inquire into the process by
which the overseas conviction was arrived at. Obviously, within the
European Union and other countries in which we are confident about
their criminal justice system, we can be reasonably sure that a
conviction has been arrived at fairly. There may be other jurisdictions
where we are not so sure, and I want us to be clear that the Government
have taken that into account before the amendments become part of the
Bill.</div><a name="0903119000458"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000981"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I hope to convince the hon. and learned Gentleman
that we have taken that into account. The schedule implements the
Council framework decision of 24 July 2008 on taking account of
convictions in EU member states in the course of new criminal
proceedings. It will require the courts to give the same weight to
previous convictions whether the offence occurred in the UK or
elsewhere in the EU and will strengthen public protection.</div>
<a name="0903119000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
convictions would only be taken into account by the courts subject to
the same safeguards as apply to taking into account domestic
convictions. This would include the need for the courts to be satisfied
that such convictions are proved. In addition, such convictions could
only be taken into account if they concern offences having equivalent
domestic
offences.</div><a name="0903119000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s question, it is
ultimately a matter for the courts to decide whether they are satisfied
that any criteria for admissibility are met. We will consider what
measures might be necessary to assist courts in that task before we

share information on a regular basis, and previous convictions from
other member states are already adduced in evidence. On that basis, I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000988"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b><b class="B"> </b>The amendments in this group would
reduce the pilot scheme period from a maximum of three years to two
years. It might be helpful if I provide some background. I cannot think
of a larger misnomer than the Access to Justice Act 1999, because it
should be the removal of justice Act or, as my hon. and learned Friend
christened it, the denial of access to justice Act. The Act took an axe
to civil legal aid, and whole areas of civil litigation were basically
completely taken out of the legal aid system. This brutal Act was
pushed through by the right hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr.
Hoon), and nobly opposed by my hon. and learned Friend.</div>
<a name="0903119000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Act
contains a power to pilot schemes in relation to the criminal defence
service, but there is no express power to pilot schemes under the
community legal service, which obviously covers civil legal aid. How
many pilot schemes have been launched under the criminal defence
service since the Act was enacted? How much have those schemes cost?
Paragraph 621 of the explanatory notes, written by the Department,
justifies extending the power to civil legal aid
so:</div><a name="0903119000775"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
the LSC continuously monitors, reviews and enhances the services being
provided through the CLS, it will occasionally need
to explore or pilot new ways of delivering
specialist service so that the costs and benefits can be judged in
practice.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column675" />Column number: 675</div><a name="0903119000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">We certainly support
that, but the scheme needs proper focus, real concentration, efficiency
and attention to detail. I would have thought it incumbent upon
providers of the proposed specialist
services&#151;</div><a name="0903119000499"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000989"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Order.</div><a name="0903119000807"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000990"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The amendments would reduce the maximum period
for the pilot schemes from three years to two. The Minister will be
aware that the legal aid budget, both civil and criminal, has several
serious problems, and that there are severe budgetary restraints. We
support the principle of the pilot schemes, but surely the longer the
pilot, the greater the cost.</div>
<a name="0903119000503"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0903119000991"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b><b class="B">:</b> I will be brief. It seems clear from the
clause that the purpose of the pilots is to cut overall legal aid
expenditure by reducing access for certain groups and by tightening up
the means-testing. I want to put on the record our concern about the
impact of that on access to justice, particularly for low-income
groups. There is already a lot of concern about the level of
means-testing for legal aid, and we are worried about a further
reduction of access.</div>
<a name="0903119000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the Conservative amendments to reduce the period for the pilots. Three
years is a long time for a pilot and could be detrimental, particularly
if it is not working well and is causing harm. Most Government pilots
run for between one and two years, so it is unusual to have one running
for three years, and I should be grateful if the Minister clarified why
the Government decided on three years. It should be easy to decide
within two years whether a pilot is good or bad, and that should become
obvious much sooner than three years. I should be grateful if the
Minister commented on
that.</div><a name="0903119000505"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000992"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> I agree with both the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk and the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central that we
want to protect legal aid for the most vulnerable as far as possible.
The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there is great pressure on
the legal aid budget, but the pilots are not about cutting access. If
anything, they will allow us to extend
eligibility.</div><a name="0903119000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proper
questions were asked about the length of the pilots. They are normally
shorter than two years, but civil cases generally take longer than
criminal cases, and that is why we decided on three years. If the
period were reduced to two years, the hon. Gentleman would
inadvertently allow only those who got into the pilot at the very
beginning to see their case go all the way through the system. That is
why we extended the period for civil cases from two years to three.

because the clause excludes from the scope of legal aid cases that

many such cases would fall into that category every year? Since the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000998"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The clause covers the recovery of defence
costs orders that can be issued in certain circumstances. I should be
grateful if the Minister explained why she feels that it is necessary
to enable these overdue sums to be recovered by way of a summary action
through the magistrates courts. That is the essence of amendments 501
and
503.</div><a name="0903119000527"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about potentially quite vulnerable people. We are concerned
about the inclusion in clause 131(2)(b)
of</div><a name="0903119000776"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recoverable
summarily as a civil
debt&#148;,</div><a name="0903119000528"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is repeated in subsection (3). It is perfectly adequate to continue
with the current system that is in place. The clause would give the
Government too much power. We are all in favour of recovering overdue
sums that are owed, but we are talking about people who are vulnerable
in respect of some categories in this area. These are litigants who,
for whatever reason, have got themselves into all sorts of trouble.
Some will be able to afford to pay up in respect of recovery of defence
costs, but others will find that difficult. Why is it necessary to
extend the powers in such a significant
direction?</div><a name="0903119000529"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
do we need to have subsection (3)(b), which would include proposed new
subsection (2A)(b), under which the Government are asking for
enforcement regulations that
may</div><a name="0903119000777"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
for the withdrawal of an individual&#146;s right to representation in
certain
circumstances&#148;?</div><a name="0903119000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not prepared to just let that go by on the nod, because that is a
significant step. We are talking about withdrawing an
individual&#146;s right to representation. Why is it necessary to do
that? The substance of our amendment would take that provision out. It
is a probing amendment and I put it to the Minister in that spirit,
because we do not want to wreck the clause. However, although she might
tell me that most of the people involved could well afford to pay
overdue costs, some will find it difficult. To withdraw from them the
right to representation is a step too
far.</div><a name="0903119000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
502, 504 and 506 deal with the part of the clause that enables the
court effectively to issue vehicle sale orders. They are probing
amendments that withdraw from the clause all references to
vehicle sale orders, motor sale orders and all the
business about motor vehicles being clamped, sold or otherwise
disposed of.</div>
<a name="0903119000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough mentioned how important it is
that offenders are rehabilitated. He spoke eloquently about how a
person&#146;s car is often the critical requirement for them to find
a job and get their life back on track. Is it fair to go after the cars
of the most vulnerable people in society? Often, we will be talking not
about Aston Martins but about clapped-out Astras or Peugeots. To have
them clamped and taken away to recover costs&#151;albeit overdue
ones&#151;is a power too far that could be abused. I would like the
Minister to justify that to the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column678" />Column number: 678</div><a name="0903119000533"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119000999"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns, in
particular on two issues&#151;the withdrawal of the right to
representation and the removal of a car. He has already made eloquent
comments on the need for a car, particularly for purposes of work. The
measure relates to repayment of a debt, but if the car is taken away it
will become almost impossible for that person to get a job,
particularly since, by dint of being under these provisions, they will
already have a criminal conviction. They will be doubly disadvantaged
in the job market.</div>
<a name="0903119000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
states that the value of the car must be at least half the value of the
debt. If a vehicle is someone&#146;s main asset and their only way of
getting work, how can they be expected to repay the other half of the
debt if the vehicle has been sold and they do not have it? It seems a
short-sighted measure. I understand why it looks like an attractive
prospect, but I share the concerns outlined by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="0903119000535"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001000"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Obviously, we are committed to the
principle&#151;shared, I hope, by the rest of the
Committee&#151;that those who can genuinely afford to pay towards
their defence costs in criminal proceedings should do so. That was
underpinned by the introduction of means-testing in magistrates courts
in 2006. Our recent consultation extended that to the Crown court. It
is essential that the proposed scheme for means-testing in the Crown
court, under which certain defendants would be required to contribute
from their disposable income throughout the life of the case, is backed
up by an effective and efficient system for collecting and enforcing
contributions. We often get criticised for not ensuring that we collect
those contributions as speedily as we ought to, and we have a clear
responsibility to ensure that contributions are paid in a fast,
effective and firm way. The sanctions will include the existing
measures of attachment of earnings, distress warrants, freezing
injunctions, third party debt orders and charging orders, as well as
the new powers set out in the clause and schedule 16.</div>
<a name="0903119000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk asks why we need this measure, but it is
nothing new. It simply repeats the provision in the Access to Justice
Act. I recognise that it might appear to be drawn widely. If it is, I
will look at it again to ensure that it is not too wide. However, we do
not intend to withdraw the right to representation except where the
applicant asks for it. It will not be a decision for the court or
anyone else; it will be a decision for the applicant if they feel that
they do not need representation and can proceed with the situation as
it stands.</div>
<a name="0903119000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 501
and 503 remove the provision that contribution orders and recovery of
defence costs orders be enforceable summarily as civil debts in the
magistrates court. The effect would be that the Legal Services
Commission had to go to the county court or the High Court to have the
orders enforced, which would remove the flexibility provided by the
system put forward here. Magistrates courts are well suited to
collecting unpaid sums from a defendant&#146;s income, whereas the
county court and the High Court enforce debts by the seizure of bank
accounts, stocks, shares and other property. Enabling enforcement to
take place in any of the courts will speed up the process and maximise
savings from the scheme. The amendments would undermine the swiftness
and the focus on debt recovery at the earliest possible
stage.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column679" />Column number: 679</div><a name="0903119000809"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15
pm</div><a name="0903119000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
504 to 506 concern removing the power to seek vehicle clamping orders
following non-payment in limited circumstances. The proposed Crown
court scheme includes a generous and fair assessment process, which can
accurately calculate the defendant&#146;s liability to pay towards
the representation, and a hardship unit will act as an additional
safeguard for those who are judged able to contribute but who feel that
they cannot meet the terms of their payment plan. Where a defendant can
genuinely pay a contribution but wilfully neglects to do so, it is
essential that the Government can take effective action to recover the
debt. It is equally important that, before the enforcement action is
taken, every effort has been made by the Legal Services Commission to
encourage voluntary compliance and to offer support if necessary to
those who need assistance in paying the debt.</div>
<a name="0903119000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress that
the application to the court for a clamping order and/or an order for
sale would only be made in appropriate cases, when all other avenues
had been explored but the defendant had still wilfully failed to comply
with the contribution
order.</div><a name="0903119000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go down the road of arguing that a car is needed to get
employment, because I personally do not think that a car is a necessity
to find employment. We have a public transport system that people can
use. So that argument should not be used as the be-all and end-all in
considering the
clause.</div><a name="0903119000541"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001001"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Will the Minister confirm whether the provision
of public transport will be taken into account when deciding on an
order under part 6? There are certainly parts of the country where
using public transport is simply not a viable way for someone to hold
down a job. Would that be taken into
account?</div><a name="0903119000542"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001002"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have just said that the court, in making a
decision, would only make it appropriately and when all other avenues
have been explored. I assume that the court would take into account all
of the defendant&#146;s concerns and needs before deciding to make
the clamping order. Schedule 16 makes it clear that any regulations
made for the detailed operation of motor vehicle orders would offer
protection to defendants: first, the court must be satisfied that
failure to pay is a result of wilful refusal or culpable neglect and
that the amount raised by the sale would exceed half the amount due;
secondly, by specifying that a disabled person&#146;s vehicle may
never be the subject of an order; and thirdly, by specifying that, once
a vehicle has been clamped, it may not be sold until after a specified
period.</div><a name="0903119000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers set out in clause 131 and schedule 16 add to existing measures,
ensuring that the defendant who can afford to but nevertheless fails to
comply will face a speedy, effective but proportionate sanction. On
that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0903119000544"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001004"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> We have supported the Government&#146;s
policy of including part 7 on criminal memoirs in the Bill and have
taken the view for some time that people who commit heinous crimes
should not benefit financially from them after their release or, as in
some cases, while they are in prison. Will the Minister give us a
two-minute thumbnail sketch, which will be a challenge for her, of how
the clause will
work?</div><a name="0903119000551"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001005"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Like the hon. Gentleman, I have no objection to
the general principle&#151;indeed, I support it&#151;that people
should not benefit from their own wrong. Civil remedies in this area
are more difficult to obtain than and are not as extensive as some
academic commentators would have us believe. I have two points,
however, one of which applies to the whole of part 7, while the other,
which I would like the Minister to address, relates specifically to
clause
133.</div><a name="0903119000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the general point, there is rightly very little sympathy for a
criminal&#146;s right to express themselves and gain from writing
about or exploiting their criminal career. Nevertheless, freedom of
speech is not only about the rights of people to share information, but
about the rights of other people to receive it. I am slightly concerned
that the rights of the general public, who might view certain
information or opinions as useful, have not entirely been taken into
account. I will talk about that in slightly more detail when we get to
clause 140.</div>
<a name="0903119000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">In certain
cases, someone taking part in a protest might be found guilty of
criminal trespass or some other offence related to direct action, or
someone might be found guilty of an offence under the Official Secrets
Act, whereby the person expressing their views and telling their story
should not particularly have any rights. We should not worry about
that, but we should worry about the fact that we as citizens might be
denied the opportunity to hear what happened to such people and to
judge the authorities&#146; actions in the light of
that.</div><a name="0903119000554"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001006"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I may have misunderstood the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point and the clause under discussion, but the
contents of clause 140 may be of use to him. As I understand it, clause
133 confiscates the profit, but it does not prevent the
publication.</div><a name="0903119000555"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001007"></a>David
Howarth:</b> As the hon. and learned Gentleman says, we will
get to the detail of the issue in clause 140. However, if all profits
are taken from certain activities, that will result in less information
on those activities being available in the public domain in the long
run.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column681" />Column number: 681</div><a name="0903119000556"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001008"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> That depends whether an offence has been
committed.</div><a name="0903119000557"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001009"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Well, there might also be further information of
interest to the public. I have no interest in, or brief for, the
offender, but the public&#146;s interest in hearing about certain
activities is affected to some degree.<i class="I"> </i>We will come back to the
details in clause 140.</div>
<a name="0903119000558"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about where the money goes. Under clause 133, the money will
go to the Consolidated Fund. In other words, it will go to the
Government. Surely, if the concern is mainly with the victims of the
crime, the money should go to the victims, or if not to the particular
victim, to victims in general.</div>
<a name="0903119000559"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001010"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I am happy to deal with the points raised, although
the first point that the hon. Member for Cambridge made was somewhat
esoteric. I am not going to argue about why we should have the scheme,
as everybody seems to agree that we should have it, and it has been
quite a long process to decide what balance to strike and how it ought
to be done.</div>
<a name="0903119000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)
will provide a relevant court with the power to make an exploitation
proceeds order against qualifying offenders who have obtained a benefit
from exploiting material pertaining to a relevant offence under
subsection (3). The order will require the offender to pay a sum of
money&#151;the recoverable amount&#151;in respect of the proceeds
obtained to the relevant enforcement authority. The order will specify
the recoverable amount and identify the benefits to which the order
relates. It is intended to make sure that it deters, by way of removing
profit, the convicted person from producing their book, memoir, film or
whatever if the sole interest is in making a profit for the
offender.</div>
<a name="0903119000561"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (6)
explains that, if a respondent fails to pay the recoverable amount, he
or she must pay interest at an appropriate rate. The appropriate rate
is defined in subsection (8)(a). Payment itself, including any
interest, is made to the Consolidated Fund, although the intention is
that it should then be divided up between the enforcement agencies to
assist them in carrying out further operations.</div>
<a name="0903119000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge is right in saying that the recovery money is not
intended to go directly back to victims. Victims of crime can, of
course, claim criminal injuries compensation. That is the intention and
the purpose of the scheme. As the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough said in his intervention, it is not an attempt to prevent
freedom of speech or to stop people from publishing; it is an attempt
to remove profit from any such publication.</div>
<a name="0903119000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge, in his somewhat esoteric first point, was really
asking whether there was a public interest test. Enforcement
authorities, when deciding whether to apply for a court order, will
decide whether there is any public interest in doing so. One expects
them to be rather less inclined to take out, or apply for, such an
order against a protester who has been locked up than against a triple
murderer who is seeking to exploit his notoriety by producing lurid
publications to the evident distress of his victims. Those who are
responsible for deciding whether to apply for such an
order&#151;whether the Attorney-General or the Serious Organised
Crime Agency&#151;will be perfectly capable of making a proper
distinction between those two examples.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column682" />Column number: 682</div><a name="0903119000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 133 is
the first of a number of clauses in part 7 that will implement the
civil recovery scheme and are intended not to prevent publication but,
with a public interest test, to protect the fact that there are certain
circumstances&#151;for example, academic research&#151;where it
would be perfectly sensible to publish and not to remove profits from
publications. There will be a small number of cases, perhaps one or two
a year at most, where that might deter someone convicted of a serious
offence from exploiting the notoriety of their offence for personal and
monetary gain.</div>
<a name="0903119000565"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001011"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> A publishing company that publishes books, as
opposed to newspapers, will presumably not enter into a contract to
publish if it feels that the book will fall foul of the provision; or
will the book publisher be able to make a profit even if the
author&#151;the
criminal&#151;cannot?</div>
<a name="0903119000810"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001012"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The answer to that is probably yes, because we are
not intending to chase the publisher or to try to prevent publication.
We are trying to prevent the thing that upsets victims and relatives of
victims in these instances: the criminals&#151;the notorious
offender&#151;making a profit from their
crime.</div><a name="0903119000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman has had a close look at the
Bill. He will know that we do not intend to pursue publishers for any
money that they make, but we would expect them to co-operate by telling
us of any arrangements that have been made with the individual against
whom the order will be made. The intention is to prevent the offender
from profiting, not to chase any kind of profit that might result from
publication.</div><a name="0903119000568"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Howarth:</b> I want to ask about clause 134(3), which is about
foreign offences. Could the Minister explain why they are covered?
Surely the country that should have jurisdiction over offences
committed in another country is that country itself. What will happen
if the country also has a scheme similar to the one in the
Bill?</div><a name="0903119000572"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001014"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> The intention is that for an application to succeed
in respect of a case where the offence has occurred on foreign soil,
the individual must have been found guilty of an offence that would
have constituted an offence had it been committed in the UK, and must
be a UK national or resident, or a person who was resident in the UK at
the time of the offence. The Bill will catch the individual who goes
abroad to commit a heinous offence, which would have been an offence in
the UK, is convicted abroad, but then comes back and exploits his crime
for profit.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001018"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The heart of the scheme is in the clause, because
it tells the court how to determine applications for the orders. I want
to query whether subsection (3)(d) was broad enough. It states that the
courts should take into
account:</div><a name="0903119000778"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
social, cultural or educational value of the activity or
product&#148;.</div><a name="0903119000585"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister mentioned during the debate on clause 133,
there is, as far as I can tell, no general public interest test. What
we have instead is a kind of implied public interest test, with various
elements of such tests taken individually. What strikes me about
&#147;social, cultural and educational&#148; is that it does not
include political&#151;the function of holding the Government to
account: for example, the case that I mentioned earlier about a
protestor.</div><a name="0903119000586"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is public interest in information coming out about the activity or
authority surrounding a conviction of a protestor for a criminal
offence&#151;as all criminal offences are covered&#151;where the
offender might have something useful to say to the public about holding
the Government to account. The Minister said that there was a great
deal of discretion surrounding that, and that those cases might not be
proceeded with, but I would prefer to have some assurance in the
Bill.</div><a name="0903119000587"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue is raised by subsection (3)(f), which seems to be fine until it
gets to the general public. To the extent to which any victim and
family of the victim are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column684" />Column number: 684</div>offended, I can see why that is highly relevant. But how is the court to
judge offence to the general public? Is it to do an opinion poll, or
simply to read the headlines of the popular newspapers to judge whether
the public have been
offended?</div><a name="0903119000588"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001019"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have just a bit&#151;not a great
deal&#151;of sympathy for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments, which
seem to be moving too much towards an undergraduate essay question,
rather than looking at what the clause does. It is not for me to
respond on behalf of the Government, but I comfort myself&#151;even
if I cannot comfort the hon. Gentleman&#151;by looking at clause 139,
which states
that</div><a name="0903119000779"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
enforcement authority...may make such an application only with the
consent of&#148;</div>
<a name="0903119000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Attorney-General in
relation to the High Court in England and Wales, and the
Advocate-General in Northern Ireland. I would imagine that those office
holders would assess the public interest in relation to subsection
(3)(f) when looking at whether the general public are being offended. I
cannot imagine that there will be a whimsical application made to the
court; it will only be in utterly and obviously offensive cases. I do
not imagine&#151;I certainly hope not&#151;that an Attorney-General
would permit such an application. For example, under the legislation,
the lady we mentioned who read out the names on the Cenotaph will be
prohibited from selling a pamphlet about her arrest and
detention.</div>

am slightly worried about, given that the people the lady would be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001021"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is the whole point about having an
Attorney-General who is an independent law officer, and not as
political as, perhaps, some Attorneys-General have been in the recent
past. The scheme is there and I can see that, even in notorious and
obviously offensive cases, there will be all sorts of arguments about
articles 8 and 10 of the convention, and that is what judges
are there to arbitrate. However, I do not share the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns in relation to the application. I hope that
it will be dealt with as a matter of common sense, that those cases
that clearly offend will be dealt with and that exploitation orders
will be made so that those, such as the lady about whom we spoke and
others of a similar nature, will be left alone.</div>
<a name="0903119000592"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
will have to work out whether, in future, there will be demands from
tabloid newspapers&#151;not only from television, but from newspapers
generally. They make money predominantly on the serialisation of such
publications. The book publishers are not making the money; it is the
author who makes the most money, up front, from serialisation in the
Sunday papers. That is where the money will come from to resist these
applications; and the Government will have to apply their minds to
picking the right case rather than taking a scattergun
approach.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001022"></a>Maria

wrong when he said that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column685" />Column number: 685</div>lady reading out the names on the Cenotaph might be prevented from

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001024"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> She would not be prevented from selling it; she
would be prevented from making a profit if such a case were to become
part of the scheme, which it patently will not.</div>
<a name="0903119000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall answer
the hon. Member for Cambridge. The hon. and learned Member for
Harborough was right to say that enforcement authorities, when deciding
whether to apply for a court order, would have to take account of
whether there was a public interest in doing so. In turn, an
application having been made, the court is to consider the factors.
Clause 140(3)(c) states that it must consider:</div>
<a name="0903119000780"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the extent to
which the carrying out of the activity or the supplying of the product

Eagle:</b> Clause 144 deals with circumstances in which an
offender&#146;s conviction for a relevant offence to which an
exploitation proceeds order relates is subsequently quashed. As
drafted, the clause provides that the exploitation proceeds order will
cease to have effect if the offender&#146;s conviction for the
relevant offence is quashed. In such circumstances, and on the
offender&#146;s application to the court, the court will order the
offender to be reimbursed with interest. It also provides that if the
exploitation proceeds order relates to more than one relevant offence
and some but not all are subsequently quashed, the court has the
discretion to reduce accordingly the amount specified in the
order.</div>

pm</div><a name="0903119000611"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
323, 324, 326 and 328 ensure that the clause also makes suitable
provision in respect of quashed convictions where the relevant offence
to which the exploitation order relates is an offence taken into
consideration or the associated conviction of another person. The
overall effect of the amendments is that if the conviction&#151;or if
there was more than one, all the convictions&#151;that brought the
offender within the scheme as a qualified offender is subsequently
quashed, the order will cease to have effect. Where one but not all
such convictions are quashed, or where an associated conviction of
another person is quashed on application by the offender, the court has
the discretion to decide that the order should cease to have effect, to
reduce the recoverable amount, as is just and reasonable in the
circumstances, or to leave the order in place unaltered. The amendments
deal with a logically possible, but unlikely, situation&#151;we are
talking about one or two cases a year, at most&#151;in which action
is taken and the conviction of the individual whose money has been
removed is subsequently quashed. They are there for

new clause 31&#151;<i class="I">Transfer to Parole Board of certain functions

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001036"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> With one exception, these amendments deal with
various minor and technical issues. The exception relates to new clause
31 and amendments 351, 352 and 353, which seek to amend the provisions
in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 relating to the early release of
long-term prisoners whose offences were committed before 4 April 2005.
It affects prisoners serving determinate sentences of four years or
more under the 1991 Act whose release between the halfway and
two-thirds point of the sentence falls to be considered by the Parole
Board.</div>
<a name="0903119000638"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responsibility
for making the release decision in the case of those serving 15 years
or more will effectively be transferred from the Secretary of State to
the Parole Board. In other words, when the Parole Board makes the
decision to release a prisoner on parole, it will set the licence
conditions, but where the Secretary of State has a duty to release
automatically because the prisoner has reached the point in his
sentence where he must be released, the Secretary of State will be
responsible for licence conditions. That will bring the licence-setting
arrangements for long-term 1991 Act prisoners into line with those that
apply to all other categories of prisoner. If their release is
automatic, the Secretary of State sets the
conditions.</div><a name="0903119000639"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing provisions were highlighted and tested in a judicial review
brought by Wayne Black, a prisoner who was serving more than 15 years
and who argued that it contravened article 5 of the European convention
on human rights for the Secretary of State to make the decision about
his release, rather than the Parole Board. In its judgment the House of
Lords found that it was not unlawful, nor a contravention of the ECHR,
for the Secretary of State to have the power to decide on the release
of determinate sentence prisoners, as their detention is covered by the
decision of the original sentencing court. But it was strongly critical
of the fact that the release of this particular category of prisoner
remains a decision for the Secretary of State rather than the Parole
Board. These amendments therefore respond to that criticism. I hope
that that is sufficient to satisfy members of the Committee on these
changes. If hon. Members have other questions, I am happy to try to
answer
them.</div><a name="0903119000640"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001055"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0903119000700"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause, which stands in my name and those of my hon. Friend the
Member for North-West Norfolk, was suggested to me by a number of Crown
court judges who have had cases in front of them where people have been
convicted of offences of violence, particularly against family members
and often against their wives or female partners; but the court is not
permitted under the current law, even where there has been a conviction
of common assault, actual bodily harm or one of the other offences
listed in the new clause, to order that the defendant or the respondent
be subjected to a restraining order under sections 5 or 5A of the
Protection from Harassment Act 1997. They tell me that it would be a
useful addition to their powers to be able not only to deal with a
defendant under the substantive defence, but to issue an order
restraining them from molesting or otherwise interfering with or
harming the victim. That would be a sensible addition to the Crown
court&#146;s
powers.</div><a name="0903119000701"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause
says:</div><a name="0903119000792"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
court sentencing or otherwise dealing with a person...convicted or
acquitted of an
offence&#148;.</div><a name="0903119000702"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
wording is used because there may often be evidence insufficient to
convict a defendant on the substantive offence of violence but which
none the less persuades the judge that that person ought to be
injuncted from harassing or molesting or otherwise interfering with the
victim. That is why it
says,</div><a name="0903119000793"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;convicted
or acquitted of an
offence&#148;</div><a name="0903119000703"></a><div class="hs_Para">under
the relevant statutes. Based on the representations that I have had
from a number of Crown court judges, I urge the Committee to consider
the good sense of new clause 34.</div>
<a name="0903119000704"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001056"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman
for giving us the opportunity to discuss the 1997 Act, but I hope that
I will be able to convince him with a few short comments that the new
clause is now unnecessary. It is unnecessary because once section 12 of
the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column696" />Column number: 696</div>is commenced, orders under sections 5 and 5A&#151;the restraining
orders&#151;can be made in respect of any offence where a person is
convicted or acquitted. There is no need to list the particular
offences, as is done in the new
clause.</div><a name="0903119000705"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would also require section 12 of the 2004 Act to have been
brought into force, but until that is so there is no section 5A of the
1997 Act, so no order could be made under that section in relation to a
person acquitted of an offence. Once section 12 is in force the new
clause is not
needed.</div><a name="0903119000706"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coincidentally,
the Home Secretary yesterday launched the consultation paper,
&#147;Together we can end violence against women and girls&#148;,
in which she announced that section 12 will be implemented from
September. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to ask leave to
withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="0903119000707"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001057"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I will withdraw it on the basis that the
Government have at last implemented a clause from a 2004 Act. It is
absurd that we have a Government who spew out headlines saying,
&#147;We are protecting women; we are doing this, that and the
other,&#148; but do absolutely nothing about it. It is no wonder that
Crown court judges have been contacting me to say, &#147;Would you
please table a new clause that provides us with powers under the
Protection from Harassment Act, so that we can use them?&#148; I
would accept criticism if section 12 had come into force in 2004, 2005,
2006, 2007 or 2008 and I had failed to spot that. But it is not in
force and it will not be in force until September.</div>
<a name="0903119000708"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
outrageous that women are being left vulnerable in the absence of the
protection orders and the Home Secretary swans around saying,
&#147;Here is another consultation; we will do something about it by
September.&#148; It really is not good enough. I am sorry to end my
formal deliberations on that point. It just illustrates the way in
which the Government approach the making of legislation. It is not good
enough, but I will ask the Committee not to do whatever it does with
new clause 34. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0903119000709"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001058"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0903119000712"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause was suggested to me by Professor John Spencer, and since his
name has been taken in vain so many times in the Committee, although
not quite as many times as that of David Thomas, I thought it only fair
that it be given an
airing.</div><a name="0903119000713"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rule in Hollington <i class="I">v</i>. Hewthorn is a nuisance that keeps cropping
up from time to time in the courts and it usually has to be dealt with
in a fairly ad hoc way. Hollington <i class="I">v</i>. Hewthorn was a case in
1943 that purportedly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column697" />Column number: 697</div>laid down the rule that a finding of fact by a court
in one case was not admissible in evidence, let alone conclusive proof
of the existence of that fact in another case in which either or both
the parties were different. It is rather extraordinary that this rule
came into existence, but it has caused trouble ever since. I should
stress that the rule says that the previous case is not even admissible
as evidence about the fact. It is nothing to do with proving the fact.
It cannot even be mentioned as
evidence.</div><a name="0903119000714"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
73 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 made a major
exception to the rule by creating a rebuttable presumption that the
person convicted of an offence actually committed it. It did not
abolish the rule; it merely made an exception to it in respect of
convictions imposed by UK courts. At that point it seemed that the
Hollington <i class="I">v</i>. Hewthorn rule would survive as regards foreign
convictions. Then a case called Kordasinski came to the Court of Appeal
and the court managed to get round Hollington <i class="I">v</i>. Hewthorn by
claiming that they had been abolished to some extent by section 99 of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and so in that particular case evidence
of a foreign conviction was admitted as evidence of the underlying
facts of that case. Kordasinski was a bit of a strained interpretation,
and the Court of Appeal followed that up with another strained
interpretation on the other issue of whether one could use findings of
fact in civil cases in subsequent criminal
proceedings.</div>
<a name="0903119000813"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
pm</div><a name="0903119000715"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a case called Hogart in 2007 this issue arose, where the Court of
Appeal again got around Hollington v. Hewthorn by claiming that in that
particular case it was displaced by section 117 of the Criminal Justice
Act 2003, which is about the hearsay rule, and it was able
to say that the evidence was admissible because it came within the
category of a document. The rule is generally reviled, and whenever the
matter comes up in a new context the Court of Appeal tries to get round
it, but the arguments by which it does that are strained and not
logical. They are simply a means to an end.</div>
<a name="0903119000716"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people
think the simplest thing to do is to abolish the rule formally by
statute. The arguments against doing so are, first, that it is not
necessary because the rule has already been abolished, but the trouble
is that it has not been abolished. Parts of it have been abolished, but
parts of it remain, and it is never entirely clear where it might pop
up next to cause yet more trouble. Secondly, one could say that
although it has not been abolished the courts usually manage to get
round it when it comes up; but that is not always so. In Conlon and
Another <i class="I">v.</i> Simms last year that did not happen, and the rule was
said to prevail. When people manage to get round the rule, they do so
only after going to the Court of Appeal, which is time-consuming and
expensive. The best thing is to avoid difficulty in future, and to
accept the new clause saying that the rule is
abolished.</div><a name="0903119000717"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001059"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> I agree with some of what the hon. Gentleman says,
but I would have to scurry back to the texts to see whether I agree
with all that he says. I certainly agree that Hollington <i class="I">v.</i>
Hewthorn is a Court of Appeal case from 1943, which established a rule
that previous judgments and verdicts are inadmissible as evidence of a
fact on which they are based, at least as far as proceedings involving
different parties are concerned.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column698" />Column number: 698</div><a name="0903119000718"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as
previous convictions are concerned, the rule was abolished for civil
proceedings by section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 and for
criminal proceedings by sections 74 and 75 of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984. Clause 124 and schedule 15 of the Bill extend
section 74 of the 1984 Act to allow previous convictions in other
member states to be admitted for this purpose. I am not entirely
convinced that new clause 38 would not cause at least as many problems
as the hon. Gentleman seeks to avoid, because the wording would take
the provision considerably further and allow any court or tribunal to
accept as a fact anything that has been accepted as a fact in any
previous proceedings, whatever they
were.</div><a name="0903119000719"></a>

court &#147;may accept as a fact&#148;; it simply says that it
&#147;may accept as admissible in evidence&#148;. It does not have
to accept the fact; it can just take it into
account.</div><a name="0903119000720"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001061"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> There are some difficulties in expecting or telling
a court that it can accept a finding on a factual matter in civil
proceedings in any country, whether in the UK or elsewhere in Europe or
the world, and that that may be admissible as evidence of that fact in
criminal
proceedings.</div><a name="0903119000721"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause goes a long way, and a fundamental feature of the law in
this country is that not all evidence is admissible. The new clause
would create a significant and anomalous exception to that principle,
and might cause more problems than the ones that the hon. Gentleman
seeks to get rid of. I am not convinced that we should accept it, but I
am happy to ask departmental lawyers to see whether they agree with the
points that are being made. I am not in a position to accept such a new
clause at the moment, and I believe that it would cause more problems
than it would
solve.</div><a name="0903119000722"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001062"></a>David
Howarth:</b> All I can say is that the debate has shown yet
again not only how clear thinking Professor Spencer is, but how
prophetic he is about ministerial replies to debates in parliamentary
Committees.</div><a name="0903119000723"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad that the Minister has undertaken to go away and think about
this issue some more. I do not accept what she says about the
consequences. The consequences are merely to abolish the rule in
Hollington <i class="I">v.</i> Hewthorn, which has been a nonsensical rule and
causes more trouble than it is worth. However, on the basis that she
has undertaken to think about this issue a little more and perhaps will
read the textbooks, which, as far as I can tell, have mainly been
written by Professor Spencer himself, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
motion.</div><a name="0903119000724"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="0903119000725"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,</i></div>
<a name="0903119000794"></a><div class="hs_brev">That certain
written evidence already reported to the House be appended to the
proceedings of the Committee.<i class="I">&#151;(Bridget
Prentice.)</i></div><a name="0903119000726"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001063"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I just
wanted to make a point of order in relation to the completion of the
Committee stage of the Bill. First, I want to say on behalf of the
Committee that we are indebted to you, Mr. Cook, and to your
co-Chair, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column699" />Column number: 699</div>Mr. Gale, for the patient and expeditious way in which you
have ensured that the Bill has had a fair hearing and that proper
scrutiny of a very large and disparate Bill has taken place. It is
certainly thanks to your leadership that we were able to scrutinise it
properly, so much so that, as the Committee has seen, we have already
made major changes, not least the withdrawal of clause
152.</div><a name="0903119000727"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to add our thanks to the Clerks and the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
writers. I thank the former for their wise counsel and the latter for
reminding us, and the press, that they are the guardians of accuracy,
and yet they are far speedier than anyone else at making such a report
widely
available.</div><a name="0903119000728"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank the officials. There are probably more teams of officials on
this Bill than I have ever come across; there are probably more teams
of officials than there are teams in the Champions League at the
moment, possibly in all European competitions. We are grateful to them
for the comprehensive notes that they have provided. Also, of course,
on behalf of my fellow Minister, I offer our thanks to our private
offices, who have given us excellent support. I also thank the Bill
manager, who I think has been the only official who has stayed on the
field while others were being substituted at a rate of knots. That is a
feat worthy of a medal in
itself.</div><a name="0903119000729"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to thank all members of the Committee, from all parties, who
have participated in this debate in good spirit, with constructive and
very knowledgeable views and interventions. I think that it is the
first time for a long time that I have been on a Committee in which
every single member has made a contribution at some point, apart
perhaps from the Scottish National party MP, the hon. Member for Moray,
who has not turned up yet.</div>
<a name="0903119000730"></a><div class="hs_Para">In particular,
I would like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham, who has
gained a few grey hairs in the past few weeks. However, he has firmly
but gently ensured that we have kept to a reasonable timetable, with,
of course, the support of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. If
the Whips Office had kept up the tradition that was started when I was
in the Whips Office, my hon. Friend would be Whip of the week, as a
result of his efforts on this Bill.</div>
<a name="0903119000731"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
want to pay special thanks to the Under-Secretary of State for Justice,
my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston. She is not known to
take prisoners, but she has steered us through some of the very
detailed, technical and often controversial parts of the Bill, with her
usual professionalism and deep knowledge of her area of work. Our
thanks go to our Parliamentary Private Secretary, who has been here
handing us notes as and when it has been
needed.</div><a name="0903119000732"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result, we have ended up with a better Bill than the one we started
with and that is as it should be. It is a recognition of the importance
and strength of scrutiny, and that also is as it should be. We now have
a Bill that, although it will change in the course of its progress
through the House and elsewhere, puts witnesses, victims and the
bereaved at the heart of the judicial system, and that too is as it
should be.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column700" />Column number: 700</div><a name="0903119000733"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001064"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Cook. I do not want to upset you, but merely to thank you for your
chairmanship of the Committee, along with Mr. Gale. It has
been a pleasure to serve with
you.</div><a name="0903119000734"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot say that I think the Bill is quite so splendid as the Minister
claims it is. She said candidly that it is a large and disparate Bill,
as I dare say it will remain. I wonder whether it will be implemented
before an eight-year gap.</div>
<a name="0903119000735"></a><div class="hs_Para">I join her in
thanking the staff of the House, particularly from the Public Bill
Office under the leadership, in this Committee, of Mr. Alan
Sandall. I am grateful to him and his colleagues for the help and
assistance that we get from them in the absence of civil service
officials, whom the Minister properly thanked. I also thank the police
officers and Doorkeepers who have helped us in the past few
weeks.</div>
<a name="0903119000736"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly
thank my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Norfolk and for Rugby
and Kenilworth, who have had to listen to my feeble remarks and even
feebler jokes from time to time. I also thank my hon. Friends the
Members for North Wiltshire and for Daventry for their contributions to
the Committee.</div>
<a name="0903119000737"></a><div class="hs_Para">This has been
a pretty happy Committee, at least in the relations that we have had in
the room and between ourselves as individuals. I hope that the Bill is
given a thorough grilling when it gets to the other place and I look
forward to considering Lords amendments in due
course.</div>
<a name="0903119000738"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001065"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Cook. If I could try your patience for a minute, I should like to add
my thanks to you and Mr. Gale for your extraordinary
patience throughout the Committee&#146;s proceedings, which seem to
have gone on for a very long time. It has been very exhausting for all
concerned.</div>
<a name="0903119000739"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
the Clerks, <i class="I">Hansard</i> and other House staff. I especially thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central, who has taken on major
parts of the Bill in what is, I believe, her first major Bill
Committee. She did so with great aplomb.</div>
<a name="0903119000740"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been major changes as a result of the Committee. This stage of the
Bill&#146;s passage has been unusually effective, even if it has been
very long. The removal of clause 152 is a major change and a major
achievement. The undertakings to make changes to the jurors and
coroners part of the Bill are equally important. I hope that the
Government take some time to think about what they will do next with
the Bill, and that they do not rush into the next stages too quickly.
If they do, they might find the Bill going rather more slowly through
the House of Lords than otherwise.</div>
<a name="0903119000741"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0903119001066"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Points of order require a ruling. In the nearly
27 years that I have been in the House, that is the lengthiest point of
order I have ever heard, and probably the most spurious. Nevertheless,
I thank you for your kind remarks on behalf of myself and my
co-Chairman.</div>
