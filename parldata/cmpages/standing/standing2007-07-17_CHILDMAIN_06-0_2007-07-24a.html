							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor.</div>
					<a name="070724105000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just before
the break, I was talking about amendments Nos. 10 and 11 and I shall
continue. The Minister said, when we were talking about contracting
out, that it was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>highly likely that other Departments may be involved in dealing with
some of the work. I took it from that that he was talking about Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, particularly in respect of some
of the assessments and collecting the money. If HMRC is to be involved
in that process, and if other private agencies are to be involved in
collecting debt or third sector bodies in providing information, it is
important that information about how they are progressing and dealing
with the case forms part of the annual
report.</div>
					<a name="070724105000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
previously, we have so little information in the Bill&#151;we do not
even have draft regulations in front of us&#151;and we do not know
how different the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission&#146;s
ways of working will be from those of the Child Support Agency. It is
therefore important that what the annual report will deliver is written
down and agreed early on. It is of major importance to the House and
the public that the new agency gets off on the right foot, sets itself
clear objectives and is held accountable to the House for the progress
that is being
made.</div>
					<a name="070724105000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
9, which we support, seeks more detail about the numbers of children
that will be dealt with&#151;the numbers receiving
payments&#151;and the type of arrangements. Because we are talking
about a shift and a move back to more private arrangements, I should
think that the Select Committee on Work and Pensions would want to
scrutinise the operation of the new systems. Again, we would support
that.</div>
					<a name="070724105000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
69, tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, reiterates that we will not
let the issue of historic debt go away. As we heard in the evidence
presented by One Parent Families last week, the information about the
current historic debt is extremely flaky. It is important that, in the
interim, before CMEC is set up, we ensure that that information is
firmed up. As I said last week, there is more than &#163;1 billion of
historic arrears, but the current targets for the CSA only deal with
&#163;213 million. We need some clear assurances and clear
information about what is happening to that old, historic debt. That
needs to be dealt with and we need to know how it is to be
done.</div>
					<a name="070724105000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
disappointed with the Minister&#146;s response to me
that,</div>
					<a name="070724105000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the debt has
arisen because of the lack of co-operation of non-resident parents, who
simply have not faced up to their responsibility....That is
ultimately where the fault of the situation
lies.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Child Maintenance and
Other Payments Public Bill Committee, </i>19 July 2007; c.
116.]</div>
					<a name="070724105000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the Minister to go
back, pre-CSA, and look at why the CSA was brought into being. I am
sure that the hon. Member for Daventry is in a better position than me
to comment on that. Nevertheless, the CSA was brought into being
because the court system, as it then existed, was not working for the
same reason that the Minister now gives for the CSA not working, and it
is important that we understand and accept that point when we consider
the arrangements for the operation of CMEC.</div>
					<a name="070724105000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my experience as a teacher,
one accepted that certain children were always going to be naughty. One
was not surprised if they were, but one planned one&#146;s lessons to
ensure that they did not disrupt what was happening. When dealing with
non-resident, non-paying parents, we must accept and understand that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div>many will try every trick in the book to avoid paying. The systems that
we set up must be robust enough to ensure that they cannot do
so.</div>
					<a name="070724105000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
Bill&#146;s greater teeth and tougher powers. It will enable CMEC to
get stuck in, which is fine with the new arrangements. I said last week
that we do not want the agency to use this clean break as an excuse to
wash its hands of that difficult debt, which has sat there for years
and not been addressed. We want to ensure that Parliament holds the new
body to account, because as I said last week, the Government made a
different decision from that in the Henshaw report. Henshaw&#146;s
recommendation was not that the historic debt should move over to CMEC,
but that it should sit elsewhere. The Government have not taken that
decision; they have said that the historic debt will go with the new
body.</div>
					<a name="070724105000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070724105000391"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for giving way, particularly as he gave me a slightly
back-handed compliment a while ago. He is making an entirely sensible
set of remarks. Does not he remember that, even in those days of
intervening revolutions, with Boxer bonds or Chinese sovereign debt,
countries that wished to re-borrow on the world market had to be seen
to make some effort before they could restore their credibility?
Although one is business, or possibly politics, and the other is
domestic, is that not a principle worth
sustaining?</div>
					<a name="070724105000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000392"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
comment. Yes, of course, that principle is worth sustaining; it is
hugely important to the credibility of the new organisation. We have
lost a generation of children who have not received the child
maintenance, and therefore the start in life, to which they were
entitled. There are still people who look to Parliament and to the
Government to restore their confidence and ensure that the money that
they are owed is paid. That must be the new agency&#146;s overriding
target. It must address that issue, and I hope that the Minister will
deal with that point. The Bill is all very well and good, but it
contains warm words and it is not specific. The amendments are an
attempt to be specific.</div>
					<a name="070724105000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 82 deals with
the details of complaints. Many Members will say that the way in which
complaints are dealt with is absolutely disgraceful. I have not been in
this place as long as many other Members, but when somebody gets a
&#163;25&#151;I hesitate to say&#151;book token or whatever as a
fob-off for a significant period of considerable emotional distress, I
find that it is an insult to people&#146;s intelligence. At the end
of a long process, during which they have had to fight for every penny
and make the CSA admit that the mistake lies with how it has handled
the case, not with the case itself, that is an insult.</div>
					<a name="070724105000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the new agency has
a much better way of handling complaints, and that it will pay
compensation. We had a debate about these matters earlier in the
Committee; the fact that people are not prepared to admit that they are
liable is not acceptable. We want to see in place a really strong
system that will handle complaints and ensure that redress is dealt
with and delivered speedily, and not with the insult that occurs at
present. We want to see some of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>complaints listed in the annual report and a general picture of what has
happened, and we will need to know how complaints were dealt
with.</div>
					<a name="070724105000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would also
support amendment No. 13, which is about ensuring that the House has an
opportunity to debate the report. It ought to be automatic that CMEC,
at least in its early stages, reports to the House annually to
demonstrate why it is a fresh start, and how it is dealing with some of
the historic
problems.</div>
					<a name="070724105000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000393"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> It is a pleasure to have
you chair our proceedings, Mr. Taylor.
</div>
					<a name="070724105000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">All but one of the
amendments would require the commission to report on additional matters
in the annual report. However, the clause contains a wide-ranging
provision that requires the commission to report on all the activities
it has undertaken in the preceding financial year. Such provisions are
entirely standard in the founding legislation for non-departmental
public bodies; almost identical clauses can be found in respect of the
Environment Agency, the Pensions Regulator and the Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service. The clause goes further, however,
than the standard for non-departmental public bodies because it
highlights in addition four particular areas on which the commission
must focus in its annual report.</div>
					<a name="070724105000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, following our
debate last week, there might be some confusion about where the
specifics of the annual report will be detailed. To clarify, the
specifics of the annual report will be in clause 9, and not, as I said
last week, in
regulations.</div>
					<a name="070724105000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The four
specific areas on which the commission will focus are: first, the
strategic direction of the commission and how that is kept under
review; secondly, the steps it takes to meet its objectives and targets
and the extent to which they have been met; thirdly, how the commission
has monitored its performance in respect of carrying out its functions
effectively and efficiently; and fourthly, the commission will report
on the extent to which it has considered the contracting out of any of
its functions. Substantially more weight is therefore placed on the
annual report than would normally be the case, which underlines the
importance that we will place on the annual
report.</div>
					<a name="070724105000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
morning&#146;s sitting, the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
asked whether we expect quarterly performance reports to continue. The
answer is that I do.</div>
					<a name="070724105000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070724105000394"></a>
							<b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): Will the Minister comment on the extent to which he
expects CMEC to publish its annual reports in a timely way? A written
statement today states that publication of the CSA&#146;s annual
report, which would, according to normal practice, occur before the
recess, has been delayed until after. I hope that the Minister would
not wish to see CMEC get into such
practices.</div>
					<a name="070724105000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000395"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I do not see that as some sort of precedent and
I expect the annual report to come out on a regular basis.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>
					<a name="070724105000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments Nos. 9 and 69, we
believe that clause 9 already places sufficiently comprehensive
reporting requirements on the commission. Of particular importance is
the requirement to report against its objectives and targets.</div>
					<a name="070724105000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all know, the
commission&#146;s main objective is to maximise the number of
effective maintenance arrangements. In order to report against that,
the commission will need to establish a range of measures similar to
those proposed by amendment No. 9. The measures will be drawn from
studies and surveys such as the family resources survey and the family
and children study. We do not want to define the measures in the Bill
because, among other things, we would be concerned that the measures
may not be available in the exact form stipulated by
legislation.</div>
				
					<a name="070724105000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 69 would specifically require the commission&#146;s annual report
to cover its progress in collecting arrears. Again, the commission will
be required to report against its objectives, so that is already
covered. As hon. Members know, one of the objectives is to secure
compliance with parental obligations&#151;in other words, to get
parents to pay all, and I stress all, that is owing, which includes
debt. The commission must report on its progress on debt
collections.</div>
					<a name="070724105000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="070724105000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale wanted me to acknowledge the continued importance
that we place on collecting debt. It is one reason why we did not
pursue Sir David&#146;s recommendation, but the responsibility
carries on. Far from being downgraded or overlooked, it is as important
as it ever was. The historic debt built up for a variety of reasons,
only one of which is, unfortunately, the persistent non-compliance of a
large number of non-resident parents. In introducing the commission and
setting out its operational framework, we have to learn lessons from
the Child Support Agency.</div>
					<a name="070724105000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that some of the debt
arose because of the extraordinary complexity of the calculations that
had to be made to come up with the maintenance assessments in the first
place. In turn, that led to a lot of interim maintenance assessments
that were rather wide of the mark, which added to the problems. We are
learning as we go, and we have certainly learnt from the CSA experience
what should not be repeated in the operation of the commission.
However, that is not to downgrade the importance of continuing to
pursue the debt. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have recently given
the existing agency additional measures to go after some of that long
outstanding debt, and early indications are that they are proving quite
successful.</div>
					<a name="070724105000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070724105000396"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I would like the
Minister to say something about a matter that arose in an earlier
sitting: how debt is treated after six years. I think there is a legal
change, which worries me greatly, as I have in the past told my
constituents not to worry because their ex-husband or partner has a
lifetime liability to pay the money to their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>children, even if he is still doing so when he approaches retirement. I
hope I was honest and accurate in saying
that.</div>
					<a name="070724105000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000397"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman has given sound
advice to his constituents. My recollection is that in recent cases the
agency has been successful in collecting debt that is more than six
years old, deploying some of the new methods that we have given to
it.</div>
					<a name="070724105000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 82
would insert the requirement to report the details of any complaints
received and how they are dealt with. The reasons behind the amendment
are completely understandable, but the clause as drafted requires that
the commission reports the steps taken to monitor its performance in
ensuring that all its functions are exercised effectively and
efficiently.</div>
					<a name="070724105000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Customer service including
complaints handling is an important function of any public body and it
is our full intention that the commission will report on the standards
achieved against any complaints targets within the annual report, much
as the Child Support Agency does, without the need for it to be
specified in legislation.</div>
					<a name="070724105000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The independent case examiner
will also continue to produce an annual report on complaints received
about child support, with any recommendations taken fully into
consideration by the commission. In addition, the commission is
required under schedule 7 to report on the standards achieved in
decisions relating to child support
appeals.</div>
					<a name="070724105000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 10 would require the commission to report on the extent to which it
has relied on the provision for agency arrangements in clause 7(1).
That would bring it into parallel with clause 8(1)&#151;the provision
for contracting out. We have included the specific requirement to
report in clause 8(1) because of the emphasis that Sir David Henshaw
placed on contracting out in his report. We therefore thought it
sensible to include an explicit provision covering the extent to which
the commission contracts out its
services.</div>
					<a name="070724105000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7(1)
provides for the commission to enter into arrangements with other
public bodies and Departments. That is not exceptional; the provision
is used, for example, by the Welsh Assembly to allow a variety of joint
working across Government. It will also allow for a continuation of the
existing arrangements with Northern Ireland, to which I referred
earlier. There was no case for making explicit provision for reporting
on it. However, it is likely that the commission would report on any
such arrangements in reporting on its activities in the previous
financial
year.</div>
					<a name="070724105000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000398"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I asked the Minister whether he could give the
Committee an idea of who those relevant authorities would be. I should
like to see the widest possible co-operation with CMEC across
Government, but I am still a little hazy as to which organisations we
are talking
about.</div>
					<a name="070724105000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000399"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> A relevant authority in this clause would be any
Minister of the Crown or Government Department, or any public body
specified in the regulations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>
					<a name="070724105000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 11 would force
the commission to give details of the bodies to whom the functions of
the commission have been delegated and their performance in
contributing to the commission&#146;s objectives. To do so in line
with the amendment could cause problems. It would be very difficult to
report on the performance of any third party against the
commission&#146;s objectives. There is no single function carried out
in isolation that can achieve the objectives, so it would be impossible
to measure the impact of any one organisation on the
commission&#146;s
objectives.</div>
					<a name="070724105000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission may include similar details in fulfilling the existing
requirements to report on all its business activities and the extent to
which they were contracted out. Clearly, if a large number of functions
were contracted to a single organisation, it would be possible to
comment on the contribution made by that organisation as part of the
overall reporting
process.</div>
					<a name="070724105000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000400"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Will the Minister comment on a hypothetical
circumstance where the performance of the organisation to which the
work was contracted out changed? It might start very well and then
deteriorate for reasons for which it may not be entirely blameworthy.
If that were to happen, it would seem entirely reasonable for the
commission to draw the public&#146;s attention to
it.</div>
					<a name="070724105000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000401"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The commission may want to do so. More
importantly, I hope that it would take action to
correct the problem. We will ensure that contracts
are sufficiently tightly and rigorously drawn. The commission has the
right to step quickly into a situation like that and arrest the
problem. That is the most important thing to achieve in those
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="070724105000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me lastly to amendment to No. 13, which would place an
additional statutory requirement for the annual report to be debated
once laid in Parliament. Of course, we want to ensure that there is
proper parliamentary scrutiny. However, we find it difficult to
understand what the amendment would add; it would certainly be very
unusual for a non-departmental public body&#146;s annual report to be
debated in Parliament as a matter of course. I think there will
continue to be such interest in how CMEC performs right across the
House that we can guarantee that it will remain under very close
parliamentary scrutiny. That will quite conceivably be on the Floor of
the House, certainly in Adjournment debates and most certainly by the
work of the Select Committee. There will be such interest that there
will be no requirement to force a debate as it will come about anyway.
To accept the amendment would take the commission right out of line
with any other non-departmental public body for which there is not the
requirement to hold a compulsory debate. There is also the slight
problem that if it happens just once, hon. Members may find their
applications for debates refused because they will be referred to the
annual debate. Parliament may want to debate that more than once a
year.</div>
					<a name="070724105000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000402"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am disappointed that the Minister does not like
amendment No. 13. Will he give the Committee some assurance that
Department for Work and Pensions Ministers will make a regular path to
the door of the Leader of the House to keep this subject 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>well to the fore so that it is debated in the Chamber? There was a CSA
debate in Westminster Hall this morning. That is all well and good, but
it rather made by point. I want to see these matters debated in the
Chamber so that everyone can take
part.</div>
					<a name="070724105000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000403"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I shall repeat what I said before: I do not
think that I or any Minister will have to force the pace. There is
already a quite sufficient body of interest and concern among hon.
Members on behalf of their constituents, and the whole matter will be
kept under close scrutiny anyway at Question Time and through any other
avenue of debate and means open through the usual channels. I do not
think that there will be any shortage of parliamentary scrutiny of the
process, and I welcome the fact that there will be such detailed
scrutiny, which is right and proper.</div>
					<a name="070724105000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070724105000404"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): The particular
significance of my hon. Friend&#146;s point is that, while we hope
that things will go well, they may not, and a debate on a motion on the
Floor of the House of Commons has the advantage of providing an
opportunity for Members to vote on the motion and express a view on the
performance of the agency. Other forms of debate&#151;in Westminster
Hall, for example, on a motion for the Adjournment&#151;do not,
except in extreme situations of adjourning the House, afford hon.
Members that opportunity.</div>
					<a name="070724105000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000405"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I do not think that I would devalue those other
means as the hon. Gentleman suggests. They are extremely important, and
I know that I and all my ministerial colleagues in the Department take
very seriously any form of accountability, whether we are made
accountable in Select Committees, Adjournment debates or elsewhere. The
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has not managed to persuade me
that there is a need for the provision. It is not that I do not like
it, as he puts it. I just think that it is not necessary to bring about
the parliamentary scrutiny that he and I want. I hope that the
amendment will not be pressed to a vote.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I must have misread the way in which the debate
was going, because I thought that I would have the opportunity to
respond to the earlier debate, given that amendment No. 10 was the lead
amendment. </div>
					<a name="070724105000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are
now having a stand part debate, I want to refer to a number of points
raised by the Minister in his summing up. I am grateful for the
assurance that quarterly performance statistics will be provided. That
is essential because such statistics provide important and detailed
data on the performance of the CSA at the moment, and CMEC in the
future.</div>
					<a name="070724105000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also felt
reassured when the Minister said that debt that was more than six years
old would remain a debt or a liability, and could be pursued on behalf
of parents with care from non-resident parents. However, I was
disappointed that the Minister did not agree to amendment No. 9. I
believe that clause 9(3)(a) to (d), which we are putting into law, is
much too high-level and much too broad-brush. It does not reach down to
the nuts and bolts of the day-to-day operation of the CSA. I am
particularly disappointed, because we are setting up a non-departmental
public body, which, as the Minister said at the start of our third
sitting, is deliberately going to be at arm&#146;s length from the
Department. I wonder whether this is our last chance as
parliamentarians to have an influence on exactly what CMEC will and
will not put into the public
domain.</div>
					<a name="070724105000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
extremely concerned by the Minister&#146;s response, when he said
that the information required by the amendments &#147;may not be
available&#148;&#151;I think that those were his exact words.
Amendment No. 9, on which we just voted, contains fairly basic,
straightforward
stuff:</div>

paid&#148;;</div>
					<a name="070724105000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the type
of arrangement&#151;whether voluntary or under the statutory
scheme&#148;;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>

					<a name="070724105000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where
child maintenance has been paid, details of the amount; the
frequency&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070724105000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, if
that sort of information may not be available, my concerns over the
adequacy of the computer system are escalating rather than
decreasing.</div>
					<a name="070724105000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled a new clause on the computer systems, which we will debate
towards the end of our time in Committee. Given the litany of failures
on computer matters within the CSA, and, indeed, across Government,
which goes back some time, the Minister&#146;s remark worries me very
much. I am grateful, Mr. Taylor, for the opportunity to make
those brief further remarks on clause
9.</div>
					<a name="070724105000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000470"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman is at least
reassured on some of my early points. We now return to the nub of his
disagreement with clause 9. His argument is, in essence, that it is too
broadly drawn; it is too &#147;broad-brush&#148;, as he put it. I
say to him again that the clause goes much further in specifying what
we want the annual report to cover than is the case for reports
published by any other non-departmental public body. I hope that it
will reassure him that with the stipulation in clause 9 and the
overriding objectives set for the commission in earlier clauses, the
annual report is quite a testing requirement and will oblige the
commission to report in
detail.</div>
					<a name="070724105000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will not be able to satisfy the requirements under the four
additional specifications, unless it provides a fair amount of detail.
I discourage him from putting the detailed requirements in the Bill, as
he has attempted to do, because we have already gone much further.
Taking the four additional requirements against the general requirement
and the objectives that have been set down, I am confident that the
annual report will be a thorough document, giving us a very good
reading of how the commission is performing. I also believe that
perfectly adequate requirements are in place for further parliamentary
scrutiny of the annual report and further opportunities to ask
additional questions of the commission and Ministers. I hope,
therefore, that the clause will be accepted to stand part of the
Bill.</div>

Alexander:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in
clause 10, page 5, line 8, at
end insert &#145;and laid before
Parliament&#146;.</div>
					<a name="070724105000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure, Mr. Taylor, to serve under your chairmanship
for the first time, but by no means the last&#151;although it will be
the last time for several
months.</div>
					<a name="070724105000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer to
what the Minister said in his closing remarks on clause 9, which is
about parliamentary accountability. A feature of the Committee&#146;s
proceedings has been that a number of amendments have been tabled
seeking to strengthen parliamentary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>accountability, in recognition of the fact that the new body is to be
further removed from Parliament than the Child Support
Agency.</div>
					<a name="070724105000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale tabled an
amendment that would have required parliamentary
approval for the appointment of the chair of the commission, and
further amendments were tabled on the subject of Parliament debating
the annual report. I am sad to say that a feature of the
Government&#146;s response so far has been that, despite the rhetoric
of the new Prime Minister about strengthening the role of Parliament
and parliamentary accountability, Ministers have chosen to reject the
amendments. I hope that we will see a change in that pattern in
relation to this amendment, and I look to the Minister for a
response.</div>
					<a name="070724105000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 10
relates to the link that will continue to exist between the will of the
Secretary of State and the activities of the commission, an
arm&#146;s length body or a non-departmental public body. The clause
quite rightly gives the Secretary of State the power to provide
guidance on how the commission should carry out its work, which is not
binding, and to issue directions, which are binding as I understand it.
In other words, he may give instructions that the commission will have
no option but to follow. It is right and proper that he should have
those powers because, although it is at arm&#146;s length, the new
body is still a Government
one.</div>
					<a name="070724105000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendment is to ensure that, when the Secretary of State chooses to
exercise the powers, giving guidance or directions to the new body,
Parliament should be made aware that he has done so. That relates to
several broader matters. It would ensure that the lines of
accountability between the Secretary of State and the commission are
clear and can be seen clearly. A degree of openness in the relationship
would be healthy&#151;many hon. Members are still supporters of the
Freedom of Information Act 2000; I certainly am&#151;as it would
allow ongoing scrutiny of the exercise of those functions.</div>
					<a name="070724105000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The risk, when governmental
functions are transferred to arm&#146;s length bodies, is that a
mechanism may come about that detaches responsibility
somewhat&#151;it is not the Minister&#146;s fault; it is the
commission&#146;s. The commission is being given a degree of
responsibility and, therefore, it must accept that blame sometimes
comes with that.</div>
					<a name="070724105000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately,
the commission must be answerable both to Parliament and to the
Secretary of State. If that information were laid before Parliament, it
would aid the public&#146;s and Parliament&#146;s understanding of
the way in which the Secretary of State is exercising his functions in
relation to guiding and directing the activity of the commission. I
suspect that if this were a private organisation, we would be hearing
shouts from defenders of commercial confidentiality on not putting the
information before Parliament. However, the body will be a public one,
not a private one, so I do not see that that objection should apply.
The Minister may wish to respond that at least some of the directions
may apply to particular cases and that there may therefore be data
protection reasons for objecting to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="070724105000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="070724105000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister will give a view on how he expects the powers to be used in
practice. One suspects that the vast majority of the guidance will be
general 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>guidance about the policies and practices of the organisation, and that
directions may relate to specific matters. Perhaps they will relate to
legislation or to issues that have become live in the public domain,
when the Minister sees fit to act in order to show that something has
been done or to make a change that is required by public opinion or
other reasons. In all those cases, I see no reason why the information
should not be made available to Parliament as a matter of course. With
those brief words, I hope that the Minister will accept those arguments
and see fit to welcome and adopt the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="070724105000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000472"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr.
Taylor. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
clearly identified that the clause is about what might be termed the
private dialogue that Ministers and the Secretary of State will have
with the chairman, the chief executive and the officials of the new
commission. That is a relationship with which I have had some
experience, and if I may use the occasion of the amendment to speak on
one or two related points as they occur to me, that might be helpful,
although I shall not do so at great
length.</div>
					<a name="070724105000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
point is one that the Minister has made a number of times. It is
inconceivable that the affairs of the new commission will wither and
cease to be of interest in this place&#151;clearly, they will not. I
can tell the Minister, if he is not already painfully aware of it, that
however much he may put the commission&#146;s functions at
arm&#146;s length and however much he may distance himself and say,
&#147;This is a purely administrative battle,&#148; all the dirt
will land on his desk, even if he does not deserve it. In that sense, I
sympathise with him&#151;it is difficult to do that for Ministers,
but I shall. To put it in English, our constituents have suffered from
failures with the CSA, and if CMEC were to be as unsuccessful, we would
all be on his back to do something about
it.</div>
					<a name="070724105000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no sense, except a purely formal one, in which Ministers absolve
themselves of their responsibility by seeking to create some clear
space. On the other hand, if they are to do things sensibly, they would
want to give a measured management freedom. The Minister has referred
to that a number of times. He has sought to resist our amendments when
we have apparently, if only for debate, sought to fetter the discretion
of the commission or to make it too prescriptive.</div>
					<a name="070724105000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to the new
Government, which has been in place for some three weeks, my
impressions are that in rhetoric at least, some healthy changes are
taking place. We seem to be having a retreat from targets, for example
in local government, which I think is quite helpful. I do not believe
that people respond best to being ordered, pushed around or told
precisely what to do. If people have a clear remit because the
objectives are clear, and a degree of management discretion to effect
it, the last thing that people want&#151;and the last thing that they
deserve&#151;is Ministers digging them up by the roots every ten
minutes and saying, &#147;Why didn&#146;t you do this or
otherwise?&#148;</div>
					<a name="070724105000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
respect to party or individuals, the Committee will know that that is a
relationship or a set of constraints that has shot through the whole
process of government ever since the emergence of the concept of next
steps agencies and the separate evolution of non-departmental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>public bodies, which have been in place for almost a generation. One has
to go back to Nye Bevan, to the days when he said that a dropped
bed-pan would be a matter for debate in the House of Commons. We have
rightly moved on from that, but the Minister therefore owes the
Committee some indication of his thoughts on guidance and directions,
and how he wants to conduct the relationship.</div>
					<a name="070724105000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall add a coda before I
sit down. My remarks could be construed as being rather sinister. They
could almost imply, for example, that the relationship had broken down
quite badly and that Ministers, having lost confidence in the body,
were issuing instructions to it, rather in the way that a permanent
secretary can distance himself from ministerial decisions by writing a
permanent secretary minute saying, &#147;Not mine&#148;, although
he would not be so impertinent as to say so. Ministers are accountable
here, so, quite rightly, they can take decisions against official
advice. They do that from time to time, and sometimes they are right to
do so, but it is not helpful if it happens all the
time.</div>
					<a name="070724105000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the spirit
of my comments on targeting, I should like the Minister to reflect on
the possibility of issuing annual guidance, which he may be minded to
do, or, in the context of a comprehensive spending review, to have a
dialogue that is enshrined in a formal letter and could well be
published. He should tell us. I have experience of running the two most
expensive non-departmental public bodies, in the shape of the Higher
Education Funding Council and the then Further Education Funding
Council. My role was to write them an annual remit letter in the
context of their funding arrangements and then to let them get on with
it. Both formally and in practice, that is the wisest course of
action.</div>
					<a name="070724105000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
transition, there is a danger that Ministers might become too
prescriptive, as happened when the Further Education Funding Council
became the Learning and Skills Council. I well remember a remit letter
from the early days of the LSC that listed 76 urgent requirements. The
Committee needs to reflect on that for only a moment. If I were to say
to my secretary that there were 76 urgent pieces of work for her to do,
she would tell me where to put them. The only purpose of specifying 76
requirements is to enable one to take a forensic approach and say,
&#147;You left out that one. You failed on that.&#148; That does
not lead to a healthy relationship.</div>
					<a name="070724105000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the Minister that we
need to get a flavour of what guidance there will be, whether it will
be given regularly and the circumstances in which Ministers might feel
that it is appropriate. Above all, we need to know whether the
directions will reflect a particular need of Ministers, some points
that they think particularly important or something that has gone wrong
that they wish to
redress.</div>
					<a name="070724105000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I promised a
quick conclusion and I shall deliver one. I hope that Ministers and the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, who moved
the amendment, will not take it amiss when I say that the prescriptions
in the clause and the amendment slightly miss the point. Whatever is
specified in private and said, or not said, in public, it is important
that Ministers should have a dialogue with their non-departmental
public body that is not based on instruction, but that takes the form
of a regular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>conversation. There needs to be a degree of
confidence, dare I say, that the chairman and chief executive are
encouraged to come in and talk, and that Ministers will not make
accusatory inquiries and perform press release-type stunts, but will
say, &#147;Have you thought about this?&#148; and &#147;How are
you getting on with that?&#148; A wise Minister does that all the
time and somehow contrives to do it without interfering. It is a
delicate
relationship.</div>
					<a name="070724105000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point concerns information. My hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Bedfordshire talked about the need for quarterly reporting.
As a Minister, the only time when I ever had such difficulty and was
not happy with the chief executive in question was when something was
bounced on me. We had an administrative problem and, although it was on
nothing like the scale of those of the CSA, I did not enjoy having
35,000 unpaid student loans on Christmas eve. Indeed, I even threatened
to go to Glasgow to sign a few cheques to get something done about it.
It could all have been averted if we had had enough notice of the
problem. We would have put additional staff in a couple of months
earlier and found people in the Department to deal with
it.</div>
					<a name="070724105000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all
seriousness, Ministers will need to give regard, as I am sure they will
wish to, to the nature of their private dialogue with such
organisations. That is a perfectly proper thing to do&#151;it is not
subverting the will of Parliament. Equally, they need to tell us here
and now, in response to the amendment, on which subjects they propose
to give guidance and direction, in what circumstances, how frequently
and to what effect. If the Minister will reflect on that, it would be
helpful.</div>

					<a name="070724105000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have sympathy with amendment
No. 63, and I agree with the remarks of the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. It is a short amendment to what seems
to be a relatively brief and innocuous clause, but our debate shows
that within even the most anodyne clauses deeper and more significant
issues can lie, as was ably illustrated by my hon. Friend the Member
for Daventry.</div>
					<a name="070724105000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
our third sitting, the Minister said about CMEC that</div>
					<a name="070724105000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It will operate at
arm&#146;s length from Ministers and the
Department&#148;,</div>
					<a name="070724105000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">and a
little later, he said that the</div>
					<a name="070724105000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;autonomy that goes with a
non-departmental body is crucial&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official

					<a name="070724105000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand the Department&#146;s reasoning for that, given what has
happened up to this point, but when we come to clause 10, it will raise
questions as to where the balance lies, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Daventry and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey have pointed out. It would be good to get a feeling on what
the Minister thinks of the in-extremis powers that he is giving himself
and the Secretary of State as a reserve. How frequently, if at all,
does he imagine them being put into action?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>
					<a name="070724105000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the points on
transparency were well made, and they have been made frequently today
in respect of other amendments. My hon. Friend certainly did the
Committee a service when he spoke of the role of targets in general,
and he was absolutely right to do so. During my relatively brief six
years in the House, I have often had the sense that public servants,
both local and national, spend more time looking up towards Whitehall
targets than looking at&#151;I do not mean looking down
on&#151;customers, people, local residents, people of this country
and those whom they serve. The intention is that targets will achieve
good delivery. We all understand that, but the reality is often not
what Ministers
intend.</div>
					<a name="070724105000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in the distinction between guidance and general or specific
directions. I do not know about the experience of
other hon. Members, but in my constituency guidance in the education
system seems to have the status of holy writ to teachers. It seems that
guidance is put on a pedestal and no one dare do anything else. I know
that is not the case legally, and the helpful explanatory notes to the
Bill point out that the commission should &#147;have regard&#148;
to guidance but that it must &#147;comply&#148; with directions, as
provided for under subsection (2).</div>

						</b> I am grateful for your guidance,
Mr. Taylor. It was certainly not my intention to start a
stand part debate. If I strayed a little wide, I shall redirect myself
to amendment No. 63. The central question is, why should there be
secrecy? Why should these matters, this guidance and these directions
not be made public? I cannot think of a good reason. As was said
earlier, the commission is not a private organisation. In the spirit of
openness and transparency that has been urged on the Minister so
frequently in the course of our deliberations, I hope that he will look
favourably on the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000476"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Daventry
and for South-West Bedfordshire for their contribution to the debate
prompted by the amendment. I am particularly grateful to the hon.
Member for Daventry for having shared his experience with the
Committee. We all appreciate having had the advantage of witnessing his
graceful glide-path, to which he referred this morning, and I hope that
it will result in a smooth landing for him.</div>
					<a name="070724105000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Daventry
and for South-West Bedfordshire both want me to expand a little on the
use of guidance and directions, but the hon. Member for Daventry has
the answer to his own question. As he has said, there will have to be
well-established dialogue between Ministers and the senior staff of the
commission. Of course, that is right. I suspect that out of that will
come the judgment as to how much guidance is needed&#151;there might
well be more of it at the onset of the commission than there is later, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>although I shall not try to specify how much, because it will rightly
come out of that dialogue. We anticipate using directions only in
emergencies.</div>
					<a name="070724105000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate was prompted by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey, who moved the amendment, and I intend to smile on
him&#151;a bit. Because it is a non-departmental public body,
ultimate accountability for the commission&#146;s performance and
actions remains with the Secretary of State, and supervision for
direction and guidance is therefore provided for in this clause. It is
not unusual to have such provisions in the founding legislation of
non-departmental public bodies, and similar legislation can be found in
the Environment Act 1995 and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act
2005.</div>
					<a name="070724105000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power of
direction will be used only in exceptional and time-critical
circumstances&#151;states of crisis such as that which occurred in
1999 when the Passport Agency failed to process applications within
agreed deadlines. The agency agreed a recovery plan with Ministers, who
in turn authorised the recruitment of additional staff. Ministers also
facilitated arrangements for emergency extensions of passports at post
offices, and reversed a decision taken by the agency to reduce security
checks.</div>
					<a name="070724105000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">In less
time-critical situations, the Secretary of State can use the power of
guidance to assist the commission. Unlike the power of direction, under
which the Secretary of State&#146;s instructions must be followed by
the commission, any guidance, notwithstanding what has been said in the
course of debate, provided by the commission must be taken into
account, but it does not have to be followed to the letter in every
case. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
uses that power and provides guidance to the Environment Agency on, for
example, the collection of waste in ways designed to protect human
health. However, it is for the Environment Agency to determine how it
exercises that function and to ensure that the power of guidance does
not impede its ability to use its judgment in particular
cases.</div>
					<a name="070724105000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would require that any guidance or directions provided to the
commission should be laid down in Parliament. I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s desire to ensure even greater openness with regard
to the operation of the commission and agree with him about that. I
must highlight the fact that we see a distinction between the power of
direction and that of guidance. The provision to give guidance to a
non-departmental public body is nothing exceptional. It would be
unusual to publish such guidance and therefore
unnecessary&#151;indeed, inappropriate&#151;to lay guidance notes
before Parliament. However, with regard to the Secretary of State
providing direction to the commission, I am happy to give further
consideration to the amendment.</div>
					<a name="070724105000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the summer, I want to
look at other examples of how similar powers are used across the
Government, and specifically at whether such directions are laid before
the House. I will return to the matter once I have considered it
further. I want to give positive consideration to the idea that the
hon. Gentleman has put before us in respective directions in light of
the amendment.</div>

Committee.</div>
					<a name="070724105000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we
are bagging at least one assurance that the Minister will look at
something, I have one further point. If he is in formal correspondence
with the commission, perhaps on an annual basis or in the context of
its annual report or the financial settlement, will he reflect on
whether, either as a matter of practice or by using guidance in some
other way, he might consider the possibility of publishing that kind of
dialogue? I fully understand that if he has some internal
guidance&#151;something that perhaps reflects operational factors,
starting factors or otherwise&#151;that he does not wish to disclose.
There may be cases, matters of staffing and otherwise, in which that
might be inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="070724105000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be good practice for
the Minister to consider some sort of an annual &#147;remit&#148;

continuing work of CMEC.</div>

to adopt what has been proposed in respect of laying directions before

Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw his amendment, on the understanding
that I will give it serious further consideration and come back to the

directions, and I understand what he is saying about guidance. If he is
in a reflective mood, perhaps he will consider whether, in the run of
things although not necessarily in every case, there are ways in which
such guidance could be put in the public domain that fall short of
laying it before
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="070724105000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, is it a matter that could be published on
the website of the Department for Work and Pensions or of CMEC? I
suppose that the commissioner will have his own plans for making such

Selous:
						</b> This being a clause stand part debate, we can
range reasonably widely round it, although I am conscious of your
guidance in our last
debate.</div>
					<a name="070724105000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face
of it, clause 11 looks like another short, innocuous clause that
introduces supplementary provisions and does not warrant too much
attention, as it contains no great issues. Subsection (1) mentions the
definition of &#147;child&#148;. Further on, clause 37 deals with
the meaning of &#147;child&#148;. Just for wider understanding,
beyond this Committee&#151;perhaps even for Committee
members&#151;I would be grateful if the Minister assured the
Committee that the meaning of &#147;child&#148; in clause 11 is the
same as that in clause 37, which in general terms refers to children
under 16 or children under 20 who are in full-time education or other
circumstances that meet with the conditions prescribed in clause
37(1)(b).</div>
					<a name="070724105000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) contains the much wider issue of share of care, which I am sensing,
increasingly strongly, is a large issue that is not sufficiently
addressed in the Bill. It
says:</div>
					<a name="070724105000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about when a child
is, or is not, to be regarded for the purposes of this Part as living
apart from a parent.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070724105000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
put it on the record, I understand that under the current definition of
what we are talking about, children living apart from one of their
parents spend more than 260 nights away from their other
parent&#146;s home. If I have understood that correctly, a contention
exists between parents on occasions in respect of shared care
arrangements when the non-resident parent has their child for
approaching 104 or more nights. Understandably, the parent with care
might say, &#147;No, you&#146;re not having our children for more
than 104 nights, because I don&#146;t want to lose any money.&#148;
I have a lot of sympathy with that. I understand the concern of the
parent with care about a possible reduction in her maintenance as a
result of the child spending 104 nights or more with their father. That
is a source of great concern and contention, and it comes back to the
general issue, which we discussed in respect of clause 2, about the
welfare of the
child.</div>

							<a name="070724105000483"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I have two quick comments on which I would value
my hon. Friend&#146;s opinion. First, 104 days neatly coincides with
weekends, which must be a typical pattern of shared care. Secondly, the
overheads continue for somebody who loses only a few nights of care.
That must be a factor in their view of whether the arrangement is
equitable.</div>

							<a name="070724105000484"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> As always, the Committee is indebted to my hon.
Friend for his wise remarks. On his first point, he is right: 104 days
is 52 weekends of two nights. The question of school holidays also
comes into that. Parents might have their child every weekend during
term time, but they might want them for a bit longer over the summer
holiday or the Christmas holiday. Are the maintenance calculations then
brought into question because of
that?</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="070724105000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
my hon. Friend&#146;s second point, the costs of maintaining a
certain size of house to accommodate a child during a whole
year&#151;even though they are not there every night&#151;are fixed
and utilities and rent for a house large enough to have the appropriate
number of bedrooms are
expensive.</div>
					<a name="070724105000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect
of my hon. Friend&#146;s second point, the costs of maintaining a
certain size of house to accommodate a child during a whole
year&#151;even though the child is not there each night&#151;are
fixed. Utilities and rent for a house large enough to have the
appropriate number of bedrooms are expensive. Looking at matters the
other way round brings me neatly to the need to recognise the
contribution that non-resident parents often make in respect of meals,
food and clothes, even though their child is classed as living away
from them as parents. The huge concern felt about that by many
parents&#151;mainly, but not exclusively, fathers&#151;is
justified.</div>
					<a name="070724105000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s aspiration in clause 2(2)(a) is to cover as many children
as possible of divorced or separated parents. Incidentally, the phrase
&#147;children of divorced or separated parents&#148; is greatly
preferred by many non-resident parents, who deeply resent the term that
we have slipped into using, because it is quick and easy. We have to be
careful to think of the effect that anachronisms and terms have on
people who care deeply for their children and who are greatly involved
in their lives. Given that we are discussing a new start or new
organisation, perhaps CMEC will think about using new phraseology. It
is not really a matter for the Minister to give a detailed response to
now, but perhaps it will be considered in the
future.</div>
					<a name="070724105000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause
2(2)(a), the overriding objective that relates to clause 11 is for CMEC
to encourage and support the making and keeping by parents of
appropriate voluntary arrangements for their children. The Minister
hopes that the definition in clause 11(2) will not have to apply to the
greatest number of children. In his ideal world, it would not apply to
any children, because the arrangements would be voluntary and therefore
it would not be the business of the state, CMEC or any organ of
government to look at the regulation and see how many nights here and
how many nights there. Parents will have the flexibility to make their
own arrangements to have a certain amount of money flowing forward, and
the children can come and go without financial consequences. I greatly
welcome that aspect of the Bill. It is excellent that more parents will
not have to go through nasty weekly conundrums in respect of the
split.</div>
					<a name="070724105000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
expect the Minister to have fully worked out answers now, but the issue
is serious. He has said that he will go away and consider a specific
amendment from the previous group that we considered. In all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>seriousness, I say to him that the matter is of justified and genuine
concern. It can be dealt with slightly more equitably than it is at
present without requiring the him to take sides between parents with
care and non-resident parents. I should be grateful if he could give us
clues about his thinking or that of the Department and say whether he
is prepared to have the period of summer reflection that he has assured
us he will embark
on.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): May I add my words of welcome to
you, Mr. Taylor? I wish to follow on from what was said by
the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire. He referred to the
definition of a child under the Child Support Act 1991, to which clause
11 refers. He said that a child was someone under the age of 16 or
under the age of 20 in full-time education. I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that that is not quite correct
under Scots law. Under section 1 of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985,
both parents can be obliged to pay aliment to a child in full-time
education to the age of 25, and I will move an amendment to clause 37
in that respect. Will the Minister confirm whether clause 11 refers to
the Child Support Act 1991? Presumably it will be referred to as
amended, if I am successful in my later efforts on clause
37.</div>

care.</div>

other than the arrangements that already exist. That is why it is
sensible to carry over those arrangements into
CMEC.</div>

provision for the Secretary of State to regulate when a child is to be

the Child Support Act 1991 is to be amended by clause 37. Following the
amendment, a child will be defined as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>person who is under the age of 16, or under the age of 20 under certain
conditions. Clause 11 ensures that that meaning is used by the
commission not only in the statutory maintenance service, but in
information and support services and throughout the child maintenance

children have different

Alexander:
						</b> I have a few brief questions to put to the
Minister. Because clause 12 relates to the transfer of functions from
the Child Support Act 1991, and therefore, in many cases, effectively
from the CSA to CMEC, this is a good opportunity to ask some questions
about the nature of, and planning for, the transition between the two
organisations, although there may be further opportunities to raise
such issues.</div>
					<a name="070724105000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause cuts to the heart of questions about the administration of the
transition. It will transfer a substantial number of functions under
the 1991 Act to CMEC, except those listed in subsection (2)&#151;the
exceptions are dealt with clearly in the explanatory notes. I note in
passing that the Work and Pensions Committee, in a report in March this
year,
stated:</div>
					<a name="070724105000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
CSA has an unfavourable history regarding transition between
systems.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070724105000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">If transitions
from the old to the new within the CSA have proved to be such a
problem, what consideration has the Minister given to the framing of
the clause to deal with the potential pitfalls in transferring
functions from the CSA to the new body? In his report, Sir David
Henshaw stated:</div>
					<a name="070724105000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I believe there are
strong reasons to justify making a clean break from the current Agency
and creating a new body with a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>mandate to deliver a &#145;fresh start&#146; for child support. This
body should be separate from the task of dealing with legacy issues
from the current system, including the management of existing
debt.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070724105000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
probing the Minister to go a little further on the matter. Perhaps he
has not had an opportunity so far in the Committee to explain why the
Government have chosen not to follow up that recommendation to keep the
functions separate and to use the CSA to wind up historic debt and so
on and to deal with other issues under the old system. That would allow
CMEC to make a fresh start with future
applications.</div>
					<a name="070724105000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a question of the extent to which the creation of CMEC is delivering
the clean break that Henshaw recommended and which the Committee wants
to see. Two members of the Select Committee are here: the hon. Member
for Weston-super-Mare and the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire.
Although one must remain silent, we hope to hear from the other in our
debates. As they will remember, in its evidence to the Committee, One
Parent Families stated
that</div>
					<a name="070724105000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it would appear
that the CSA (its staff and computer system) will simply be re-branded
as C-MEC from 2008
onwards.&#148;</div>

						</b> The hon. Lady shakes her head: I am sorry that
we shall not be hearing from her any more.</div>
					<a name="070724105000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is that if the
previous functions under the 1991 Act are to be transferred nem. con.,
with the exceptions of the six listed items in subsection (2), to what
extent is the measure really a clean break? That is open to question. I
invite the Minister to explain how he sees the issue. The Select
Committee also expressed concern that CMEC will run three different
systems in parallel for a time. Again, that seems not to represent the
clean break proposed by
Henshaw.</div>
					<a name="070724105000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
context, it is worth referring briefly to the issue of public confusion
and misunderstanding about what is happening. CMEC will take over roles
from the previous system. There has been talk in the press of the
abolition of the CSA and a clean break, which has rightly reflected the
Government&#146;s own line on the matter, but it has given rise to a
great deal of confusion in the general public and among the base of
people who make use of the CSA and who may in future make use of
CMEC.</div>
				
					<a name="070724105000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply
lumping everything in with the new agency is perhaps not the best way
to make things clear. I hope, therefore, that as well as the points
that the Minister will undoubtedly wish to make, he will also respond
to the important issues of the public&#146;s understanding of what is
going on and whether the Bill really is the fundamental change that my
party wishes to
see.</div>

							<a name="070724105000492"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I have a couple of brief points to make. On the
point that the hon. Gentleman has just raised, when reviewing Sir David
Henshaw&#146;s report I looked at some of the work on transition
between organisations. I would appreciate it if the
Minister outlined the thinking within the Department about how the
transition from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>the existing organisation to the new one might be managed. Many hon.
Members, including the Minister and his colleagues, talk about a clean
break. Sir David&#146;s report said that there are a number of
successful business models in the private sector for making a success
of a clean break and on how to deal with a new business, a new model
and the old arrangements. A key lesson from successful operations of
that type was that the two different activities require different
skills, organisational cultures and performance
management.</div>
					<a name="070724105000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said, we have
not heard a great deal about how transferring all of the functions and
all of the people, as proposed by the next clause, will create a new
organisation with a new mindset, a new culture, and&#151;most
importantly for the outside world&#151;a new image. By that I do not
mean just a new brand or identity, but a difference in performance that
people can see as a real change. Persuading people that there has been
a real change and a break with the past when they see effectively the
same processes, the same people and very little difference, is going to
be quite
difficult.</div>
					<a name="070724105000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be
encouraging for the Committee if the Minister outlines some of the
thinking in the Department because the commission will have to hit the
ground running. If that culture change does not succeed right at the
beginning, I am afraid that it will be too late. If the new
organisation starts working without successfully doing that, it will
not be possible to do it later. Will the Minister run through that for
the benefit of the
Committee?</div>
					<a name="070724105000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000493"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I shall begin with the points raised by the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean and work back to the others. In a sense,
there are real problems with what he is asking. On the one hand he
wants to ensure a clean break and is raising questions about whether
that can be achieved by transferring functions. The implication, as I
hear it, is that he wants to achieve a clean break by completely
bringing all the functions of the CSA to a full stop somehow, as if it
were possible to switch off one system, pack it up, put it away and
then switch on another one and start again with something new. With
respect to him, that cannot be done because there are at least 650,000
children involved for whom the most critical thing is
that we ensure an uninterrupted and steady flow of maintenance. It is
therefore extremely important to have as smooth as possible a glide
path, if I might use the phrase again, from the existing cases within
the agency into the new commission. Let me put it this way: despite all
the problems that we are familiar with in the context of the agency, I
would hope that those parents for whom the system currently
works&#151;and there are many for whom it does work&#151;will not
notice the difference. It is important that smoothly running flows of
child maintenance should continue. For that reason, it is not possible
simply to switch off one agency and start another. The carry-over from
one to the other is critical.</div>
					<a name="070724105000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000494"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> For the avoidance of doubt, I was not suggesting
that. That is not what is happening; the commission is going to pick up
the responsibility for those cases that do work. However, given that we
know that the CSA has not been the most successful of organisations,
how can we be sure that we are going to get a successful commission
that works across the piece 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>both for its new customers and for those who have not been very well
treated, as well as for collecting the historical
debt?</div>
					<a name="070724105000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000495"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Remember that it will not happen all in one big
bang. As we set out in the White Paper, it will take a number of years
to achieve the transition from the state that things are in now to the
state in which the commission is fully up and running and is
responsible for every aspect of child maintenance. It will be about
2013 before that happens, and we will apply the lessons learned from
the CSA about the importance of taking time to get a complex transition
such as this right. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="070724105000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked why we had
not proceeded with David Henshaw&#146;s recommendation to have, in
effect, two bodies: a legacy body and a new commission. We thought
carefully about that but did not accept it because we want to go down
what we believe to be the more efficient route. It is our firm view
that it is crucial to have a single controlling team overseeing all
aspects of the legacy cases as well as the new ones. The process needs
to be as seamless as possible for all the clients who are involved in
it. I am sure that if we were to move to a two-body situation, that
would add confusion for clients. In dealing with matters relating to
their family, they might find themselves working with one organisation
handling legacy cases while also having to have a relationship with
another body dealing with subsequent cases. There are many complex
cases, and that would not be a satisfactory state of affairs. For those
reasons, it was much more sensible to go for a single body overseeing
all the legacy work as well as the new
cases.</div>
					<a name="070724105000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000496"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s position.
However, given that at least two systems run side by side in the CSA,
the unfairness felt by many parents will be made worse by the fact that
there will be a third system in CMEC, that one organisation will be
running all three, and that it will be several years before all cases
get on to the new system. The public perception is that it is a new
organisation with a new system. Many of us fear that the fact that
there are three different systems will undermine that perception and
might institutionalise in CMEC the problems that exist in the
CSA.</div>
					<a name="070724105000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000497"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I do not share that concern. There is a
difference between a transition between institutions&#151;such as
moving from the agency to CMEC&#151;which is what we are talking
about, and a transition between formulae, which is what happened within
the agency after the 2003 change. Those are not the same thing. In
fact, the formula change that came in as a result of the Child Support,
Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 has been widely accepted and is
supported as being a clearer way of arriving at maintenance assessments
than was the previous model.</div>
					<a name="070724105000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000498"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Does the Minister agree that it will be important
to give consideration to the right kind of communication to service
users? It would be possible to drown them with too much information, or
the wrong kind, or to stir up or alarm them unnecessarily about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>destabilising changes in the arrangements. He wants a seamless
transition of institutions, which is sensible, but at the same time
there will be words on the street and people will jump to conclusions.
Will he think long and hard, in conjunction with the new management, to
ensure that this is got right and explained both passively, on websites
and so forth, and by active communication as
well?</div>
					<a name="070724105000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000499"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Yes, it has to be seamless for
clients. That is the bottom line. We are trying to ensure that we are
providing the best possible level of service to clients. The smooth
transition from one service to the other is of critical importance and
will, of course, inform us as we think about how we deal with the
detail of the switch, over time, from agency to
commission.</div>

							<a name="070724105000500"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> Hearing the Minister&#146;s response to the
intervention from the hon. Member for Angus led me to feel rather sorry
for the staff of the CSA, about whom we will talk more under clause 13.
However, it is appropriate to mention that, because we have already
debated how staff numbers are dwindling. The Minister has answered that
point&#151;not to my satisfaction&#151;but it now seems, from the
way he did so, that staff in the same teams will, potentially, be
dealing with three different systems for a while and there will still
be a limited number of staff. That is a critical issue. What are the
Minister&#146;s intentions in terms of staff training, so that people
can manage the substantially increased work that it sounds as though
they will have? If necessary, is he prepared to make the resources
available, so that the commission can employ the additional people that
may be necessary to handle this transfer of
functions?</div>
					<a name="070724105000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000501"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is taking me into the next
debate. Suffice it to say it will be for the commission to devise the
necessary transitional arrangements and for it, as I have said to him
before, to determine the appropriate staffing level. There will be a
constant dialogue on the resources between the commission&#146;s
senior officials and my Department. I think that his points are
covered, but I will have more to say about staffing when we get to
clause 13.</div>
					<a name="070724105000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
currently dealing with clause 12, which is a key element of the Bill
and transfers to the commission those functions that
the CSA currently carries out on behalf of the Secretary of State. For
example, from the day appointed for the transfer, the commission will
have responsibility for functions relating to the assessment,
collection and enforcement of maintenance and to the duty to have
regard to the welfare of the child. To be precise, the clause transfers
the statutory child support functions as amended by the Bill. The
transfer of staff and of property, rights and liabilities are provided
for in subsequent clauses. The clause also gives effect to
schedules 2 and 3. A few functions are excepted
from transfer, as set out in subsection (2): some are retained solely
by the Secretary of State, while others are both retained and
transferred to the commission. I would like to mention each of those
briefly and explain why they are
excepted.</div>
					<a name="070724105000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
of appeal will be both conferred on the commission and retained by the
Secretary of State. Although the commission will be a non-departmental
public body, the policy that it operates is still ultimately the
responsibility of the Secretary of State. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>therefore essential that the Secretary of State is still party to the
proceedings for any appeal to the child support commissioner or a
higher court, so that he can challenge legal interpretations that might
undermine the
policy.</div>
					<a name="070724105000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Functions
under section 46 of the 1991 Act relate to decisions on the amount of
benefit a person is to receive. They do not relate to child support,
and are therefore not transferred to the commission. The power to
authorise a responsible person for the disclosure of information will
be both conferred on the commission and retained by the Secretary of
State. It is important that the Secretary of State retains that
function, as he will continue to have some child support functions,
such as making legislation, and his work may involve handling
information. However, it will also be necessary for the function to be
exercised by the commission, and paragraph 16 of schedule 7 makes the
necessary amendment to ensure that that is
so.</div>
					<a name="070724105000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legislative
functions&#151;that is, commencement powers, powers to make
consequential amendments and the power to make secondary legislation
under the 1991 Act&#151;will also remain solely with the Secretary of
State, because it is he or she who is ultimately responsible for
legislation.</div>
					<a name="070724105000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the provisions of the 1991 Act which provide for the Secretary of State
for Scotland to pay travel expenses for a person attending proceedings
before a child support commissioner in Scotland, will remain with that
Secretary of State and will not be transferred.

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in
schedule 3, page 61, line 31, leave
out paragraph
51.</div>
					<a name="070724105000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing
amendment. Paragraph 51 inserts a new section, 50A, which
states:</div>
					<a name="070724105000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
decision falling to be made under or by virtue of this Act by the
Commission may be made, not only by a person authorised to exercise the
Commission&#146;s decision-making function, but also by a computer
for whose operation such a person is
responsible.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070724105000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
interested to hear from the Minister whether it is a standard insertion
in Acts that apply where computers may have a role in the
administration of facilities. I make no apologies for repeating a point
that was made earlier: the failure of computers to operate properly is
one of the principal reasons why the CSA 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>has such a bad reputation for making the wrong decisions in the wrong
way at the wrong time and coming up with the wrong answer. The Minister
admitted as much this morning when he referred to the internal audit of
the CSA&#146;s computer system, which he said had found 506 problems,
which is not a small number, of which 219 have been fixed, leaving 287
remaining. He was frank about the problem, for which I commend
him.</div>
					<a name="070724105000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that
the Minister thinks that the problems will be fixed and that by the
time CMEC comes into existence its computer system will be up and
running and carrying out its functions. If it is not, the clause seems
rather a sweeping measure, as it provides that a decision made by
computer is to be regarded as a decision of the Secretary of State, or,
in future, of the commission. The fact that it is a standard provision
should in no way be taken to undermine my concerns about the idea,
because unless the Minister can offer reassurances that the IT problems
will be sorted out, the concept behind the proposal will not engender
public confidence or the confidence of Members of Parliament in the
operation of the new
system.</div>
					<a name="070724105000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
provides a good opportunity for the Minister to say a little about the
IT systems that CMEC intends to use, how the Government intend it to
operate those systems and in what respect it will be different from how
the CSA operated its IT systems, which the Minister admitted were beset
by problems from the start.</div>
					<a name="070724105000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government seem to have
rejected the idea of a completely new IT system, so the proposed
insertion in the schedule provides new responsibilities for those
computers, if only legally, in name. The Minister will correct me if I
am wrong, but at the same time it seems that CMEC will take over the
legacy computer system of the CSA, albeit, one hopes, with the
remaining 287 faults corrected. No doubt a number of new IT releases
will be brought in to allow the new formula and the new rules set out
in the Bill and in the regulations to be applied.</div>
					<a name="070724105000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report by the Work and
Pensions Committee referred to the Child Support Agency&#146;s record
of serial IT failures and made the point that there is no evidence that
a new system will be any more effective than the last two. The National
Audit Office report on IT projects, &#147;Delivering successful
IT-enabled business change&#148;, which I am sure is familiar to
every member of the Committee, highlighted the complexities of the
technical problems encountered when joining new and old systems in a
variety of settings.</div>
					<a name="070724105000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">In responding to this brief
debate, perhaps the Minister will explain his strategy for
CMEC&#146;s computer system. If it is a final decision, will he say
why he has decided that the legacy computer system will be improved
rather than having a new system? If that is the case, how does he
intend to address the issues that were highlighted by the National
Audit Office about the problems that exist in transitions between IT
systems when patches and new releases have to be put in place? I would
guess that in part the failure of that process in the past has been the
cause of many of the problems that our constituents have experienced
with the CSA. If a similar process is to be entered
into again, what steps will the Minister take to ensure that it does
not result in the same lack of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>effectiveness, lack of competence and extreme frustration and anger on
the part of users of the
system?</div>

						</b> The Committee will be pleased to hear that I will
be brief. I am guessing that the Minister has a technical explanation
for the proposal, but I hope that he will address the philosophical
concept of computers being able to make decisions in the normal sense
of the word, which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey.</div>
					<a name="070724105000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Computers
can only implement instructions laid down for them by human beings.
Given past problems, the responsibilities of some of the software
providers and the implementation of the IT systems, it would be worth
the Minister explaining whether this part of the schedule transfers any
responsibility or if, as I suspect, it is just a technical measure to
avoid a legal challenge made by people paying maintenance to any aspect
of the process that involves an IT system. Perhaps he will explain the
use of the words &#147;decision&#148; and &#147;computer&#148;
in respect of the wider philosophical
point.</div>
					<a name="070724105000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000504"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s invitation
to get philosophical, which I will do in a moment. I always welcome
such invitations.</div>
					<a name="070724105000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want first to respond to the questions raised about IT systems by the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, who
reiterated some of the facts that I gave the Committee about the
current situation. Of course we must get the IT right, as I said.
</div>
					<a name="070724105000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
asked about future arrangements. CMEC will simply take over the
existing CSA IT systems, bearing in mind that in the meantime it will
have gone through the operational improvement plan enhancements, which
I outlined in more detail this morning. The CSA&#146;s existing IT
contract will novate to CMEC, and from that starting position it will
be open to the commission to determine its IT strategy, giving
consideration to its objectives and available
resources.</div>
					<a name="070724105000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
51 to schedule 3 inserts new paragraph 50A to the Child Support Act
1991. That simply replicates an existing provision under the Social
Security Act 1998; and section 2 of that Act stipulates that decisions
can be made or issued not just by a person acting on behalf of the
Secretary of State, but also:</div>
					<a name="070724105000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by a computer for whose
operation such an officer is
responsible&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070724105000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
applies specifically to decisions made under, among others, the Child
Support Acts of 1991 and 1995. The provision was originally introduced
to allow automated decision
making.</div>
					<a name="070724105000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Social
security and child support legislation states specifically that
decisions must be made by particular officers or the Secretary of
State, and, by extension, officials acting on his behalf. Technically,
prior to the Social Security Act 1998, no decision could be made by a
computer. At that time, many processes were automated; computers would
take relevant data and often make complex calculations, for example,
about the amount of benefit owing. However, because there needed to be
a &#147;decision maker&#148;&#151;that is a technical
term&#151;an officer would have to sign off a computer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>printout for each person affected. Section 2 of the 1998 Act did away
with the need for that laborious and bureaucratic clerical process. The
amendment would require that process to be reinstated for any decision
taken by the commission. That would, no doubt, require changes to
existing processes and IT, and would build back in inefficiencies that
were removed in
1998.</div>
					<a name="070724105000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure the
Committee, as the Committee was reassured in 1998, that staff rather
than computers will be used to make decisions requiring the exercise of
discretion or judgment. The decisions that will be automated are those
that follow set rules and processes, such as for maintenance
calculations. As the hon. Member for Forest of Dean asked me to do, I
can reassure the Committee on the general notion of computers making
decisions, which sends an Orwellian chill down the spine. We should
think of it more as computers determining an outcome, based on criteria
or rules established by the true decision makers&#151;the
commission&#146;s personnel or, indeed, us. The software applies the
law to the facts of the case. Computers are not exercising judgment
between options, which is what most of us would normally understand by
the concept of a decision. Furthermore, they are simply doing what they
are told to. The ultimate responsibility remains, of course, with those
who do the
telling.</div>
					<a name="070724105000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that with those reassurances, the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

philosophical and legal nature of the amendment. I do not want to
venture into the metaphysical territory that he explored. It was
enlightening, however, in that I had not been aware that social

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000509"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I have two points. The first we touched on briefly
in the last debate and it focuses on the people who are going to be
transferred to CMEC. Many of the problems that have been experienced by
parents and families in the maintenance process have not been caused by
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations. In
some ways, the staff of the agency are as much victims of the process.
It came up during the evidence-taking session with the Minister and the
chief executive of the agency that the morale in the agency was quite
high and the staff were looking forward to this process taking place.
It was worth getting that on the
record.</div>
					<a name="070724105000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
specific question for the Minister, in light of our debate on clause 8.
He was keen not to fetter or limit the scope and flexibility of the
commission, which is why clause 13(3)(a) amends the TUPE regulations to
change the trade union recognition procedures that are standard in TUPE
recognition, and removes the limitation that is normally there. That
seems to fetter the role of the commission slightly and make it more
difficult for it to take a different position in relation to trade
union recognition. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain
the logic behind that as TUPE regulations do not normally require that
to be the
case.</div>
					<a name="070724105000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000510"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I agree that the clause is important. I was
grateful to the Minister for agreeing this morning that the results of
staff survey would be placed in the Library. I understand why
subsections (2) and (3) are included. They modify the TUPE regulations
so that existing trade unions who represent CSA employees can continue
to do so. I am sure that most Members agree that that is a particularly
important process in that it gives certainty to those employees that
they will continue to get the same
recognition.</div>
					<a name="070724105000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to ask the Minister about subsection (5) and the circumstances in which
he envisages an order-making power to exclude some people from
transferring under the TUPE terms being used. I note that it is a
negative resolution, so there is little opportunity for debate unless
it is prayed against. Who does the Minister think would be covered by
this subsection? Clearly, if it is widely exercised, it would cause
concern to current employees of the CSA. Perhaps the Minister can tell
us which employees could be affected by this subsection and why it is
subject to a negative resolution.</div>
					<a name="070724105000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000511"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> As hon. Members know, we intend to transfer the
child support functions, which are currently the responsibility of the
Secretary of State, to the commission in 2008, at which point the CSA
will cease to exist and the commission will be made responsible for
delivering child maintenance services.</div>
					<a name="070724105000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 13 will ensure that,
when those functions are transferred, all the people employed by the
CSA will also transfer to the commission. In other words, it will
ensure that, from day one, the commission will have the people that it
needs to fulfil its responsibilities. There are exceptions, as the hon.
Member for Rochdale said, and there are good reasons for them. We
therefore expect to use clause 13(5) to exclude from the transfer those
who are working at the CSA as consultants or working there under
contract for a private sector organisation at the time of
transfer.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>
					<a name="070724105000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The people
employed by the CSA are its biggest asset. They will be critical to the
development of the modern service that needs to be put in place. Our
staff will provide the commission with a strong base on which to build.
At this point, I should like to pay tribute to the agency&#146;s
staff. Over the past few months, my fellow Ministers in the Department
and I have held question and answer discussion sessions at various CSA
offices throughout the country, because we wanted the opportunity to
discuss with staff this substantial change. Those meetings were widely
welcomed by the staff involved, who, quite understandably, had a series
of questions and some concerns about the big change that is happening
in their organisation.</div>
					<a name="070724105000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">What came out of those
meetings&#151;&#151;and continues to come out of them as we hold
them&#151;&#151;was the huge commitment of the CSA staff, not only
to their current task, to which their commitment is beyond any
question, but to making CMEC work. After all, they want to be part of a
successful child maintenance operation and they are prepared to give
their all to help us to achieve that. Many of them have worked for the
agency for a long time and have been in the difficult spot of working
with a flawed design, which has been a tough task.</div>
					<a name="070724105000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can report that the staff
are pleased with the introduction of the operational improvement plan.
They have seen the tangible benefit of that additional investment. They
see it as essential preparation of the ground, which we are going
through with their help, for a smooth transition to CMEC. We need to do
our best to look after the staff, who have worked extraordinarily hard
and with great commitment to do their best with the CSA. They want to
help us to deliver the marked improvement that CMEC will
represent.</div>
					<a name="070724105000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000512"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I want to put on record the official
Opposition&#146;s gratitude to the staff of the CSA. We all recognise
that they share our frustration that child maintenance has not been
conducted as successfully as they would have liked. I have met CSA
staff who have travelled to my constituency office to deal with
individual cases. They have been unfailingly courteous and have shared
my frustration at not being able to resolve some of the cases on which
we have worked together. I therefore echo the Minister&#146;s
remarks.</div>
					<a name="070724105000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000513"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments, as I am sure will staff throughout the
agency.</div>
					<a name="070724105000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 13
will provide much-needed assurance to staff involved in the transfer.
It will ensure that the protection offered by TUPE applies to the
transfer, which will provide a clear guarantee to staff that the
transfer will not affect their employment or their terms and
conditions. The Committee will see that we have made separate provision
to protect pensions in subsection (4).</div>
					<a name="070724105000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked why we are
amending the trade union paragraphs. TUPE regulation 6 provides for a
group of employees transferring under TUPE to retain access to their
existing trade unions. However, because of the way in which the
regulation is worded, it could be interpreted not to apply to the
transfer of people to the commission. Clause 13(3) therefore includes a
specific 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>provision to ensure that the commission must recognise independent trade
unions currently recognised by the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="070724105000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
ensures that we are entirely in line with the Cabinet Office statement
of practice on such transfers, which sets out clear guidelines on the
treatment of staff and which should be followed whenever there is
organisational change within the public sector. That is unequivocal
about the fact that staff involved in transfers of functions should be
treated fairly and consistently and their rights should be respected.
Specifically, it states that departments must</div>
					<a name="070724105000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ensure that legislation
effecting transfers of functions between public sector bodies makes
provision for staff to transfer and on a basis that follows the
principles of TUPE.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070724105000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is exactly what this clause does. A
number of provisions in the Bill should help to allay any concerns that
our staff might have. The Bill provides that people will retain their
terms and conditions on transfer, that they will continue to have
access to the principal civil service pensions scheme and, as I have
been saying, that their existing trade unions will be recognised by the
commission.</div>
					<a name="070724105000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
that there are concerns about whether terms and conditions can be
changed immediately after transfer. Let me reassure CSA staff now that
the new employer cannot lawfully impose different terms and conditions
without the agreement of the individual employee or trade union, and
even then can do so only if the new terms and conditions are more
favourable to the
employee.</div>
					<a name="070724105000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an
additional measure, we will enable staff who move to the commission to
have access to Department for Work and Pensions vacancies for at least
three years. We are also in discussion with the Cabinet Office to
secure approval for people working in the commission to apply for
inter-departmental vacancies advertised on the civil service
recruitment gateway
website.</div>
					<a name="070724105000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 13 is
critical both for the success of the commission and for the reassurance
of the people currently employed by CSA.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000514"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I want to make two brief points. The first
concerns transparency, which we have already debated at length, so I
shall not revisit the arguments. How does the Minister intend to
publish the information when the Secretary of State makes a scheme of
transfer? Will it be made available by the commission or the Minister,
or placed in the Library of the House? What has he in mind from a
transparency point of view?</div>
					<a name="070724105000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other question is on
subsection (5). That refers to the certificate confirming the transfer
to be given by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>the Secretary of State, whereas the explanatory notes say that the
certificate will be given by the commission. I suspect that it should,
indeed, be the Secretary of State, and it would be helpful if the
Minister would clarify that.</div>
					<a name="070724105000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000515"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I have a few questions to add. The clause looks
innocuous, but one or two matters could usefully be fleshed out to help
us to understand how the clause would be implemented should the Bill
become law. I appreciate that the Minister&#146;s throat is getting a
bit dry after the number of speeches that he has been making, but I
suspect that this will be his last, at least for today.</div>
					<a name="070724105000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause relates to the
transfer of property rights and liabilities from the Secretary of State
to the commission and vice versa. It would be useful if the Committee
could understand how the Minister envisages that working in practice. I
presume, although the Minister should clarify this, that the measure
applies to buildings currently occupied by the CSA, computers currently
used by them and other fixtures and fittings of their buildings.
Presumably, those things would be transferred to the commission. The
clause is needed because the CSA is an Executive agency and its
property is currently owned by the Secretary of State. A transfer would
mean that, in future, that property would belong to the
commission.</div>
					<a name="070724105000361"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div>
					<a name="070724105000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is the
case, perhaps the Minister could explain what rights or interests over
transferred property the Secretary of State may seek to retain in the
case of such a transfer of property to the commission. Would it be a
controlling interest that would give the Secretary of State a veto over
any future disposals that the commission may make? For example, if the
commission decides that it wishes to sell property, will he have the
right to veto that decision or could the money that might be raised
from the sale of property be returned to the consolidated fund, rather
than becoming additional money in CMEC&#146;s account?</div>
					<a name="070724105000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I am right in
saying that the CSA occupies seven regional centres throughout the
United Kingdom. Is it the Minister&#146;s intention for CMEC to have
initial access to all those centres and that the commission will take
decisions about its property needs in due course or might he be
inclined to dispose of some of that property to raise funds for the
Exchequer before the commission is set up?</div>
					<a name="070724105000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, is the Minister
considering any disposals or alternative uses for the property?
Reduction of staffing has been a constant feature of these debates, so
that may be an issue in that there may be a need for less property and
fewer centres. Under this Government as under previous Governments,
there has been a tendency to centralise services, core centres and so
on. Does he predict that that is likely to happen in the future, with
relation to property, computer systems and other goods and
chattels?</div>
					<a name="070724105000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
stray slightly to talk briefly about property disposals that may take
place. There have been several debates about the future use of property
that is owned by the public sector in relation to meeting housing
needs. If the Minister were to give directions to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>commission, would he advise it about how it might seek to dispose of
property should it wish to do so? That property could be used, for
example, by housing associations or other housing providers to provide
affordable housing. I am sure that that would satisfy the Opposition
and meet demands for brownfield
sites.</div>
					<a name="070724105000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
clause enable the Minister to give such directions to the commission to
ensure that, if it is disposing of property, it will be done in a way
that could meet other Government objectives? The point that I have just
made would be one such relevant objective and, with that in mind, I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
					<a name="070724105000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070724105000516"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> First, I shall try to deal with the points that
have been raised about property. In general terms, the CSA has access
to property via existing contracts under TUPE. All rights under those
contracts will transfer to the commission. Long-term decisions about
estate strategy will be a matter for the commission, which will review
the situation as it evolves.</div>
					<a name="070724105000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14 concerns the
transfer of property rights and liabilities to the commission. The
commission will need to operate from day one to enable those existing
contracts and assets to be transferred from the CSA to the commission.
It will benefit significantly by accessing the current contract, rather
than being obliged to renegotiate afresh. First, most of the contracts
are Department-wide and therefore make extensive savings through
economies of scale. Secondly, many of them have been entered into on a
long-term basis to achieve maximum efficiency. It is therefore in the
commission&#146;s interests that rights and liabilities are
transferred under these contracts. Most contracts in which the
commission has a partial or total interest will contain provisions
allowing them to be novated or assigned&#151;that is, allowing the
straightforward transfer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>of the contractual rights and liabilities from the Department to the
commission&#151;and ownership of both assets can then simply be
transferred. For example, if the supplier had contracted with the DWP
to supply stationery to the CSA centre, the contract would be amended
so that it should instead supply stationery to the commission. In a few
specific cases that may not be possible. For instance, if the
provisions in the contract are not extensive enough to allow for
transfer to the commission, the power will simply allow the Secretary
of State to transfer the property rights or liabilities in question
through a scheme. Similarly, if it proves necessary for the commission
to make use of property owned by the Department, the scheme could be
created to provide for exactly that. It is not unusual for the transfer
of property rights and liabilities to be provided for in this way. The
clause echoes closely the provisions of section 41 of the Food
Standards Act
1999.</div>
					<a name="070724105000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">On liabilities,
the clause is intended to allow us to transfer contractual rights and
liabilities and not to transfer the Secretary of State&#146;s
liability for previous actions. For example, the Secretary of State
will retain liability for cases of maladministration that occurred
before the
handover.</div>
					<a name="070724105000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
straightforward measures simply ensure that the commission is provided
with the tools and capabilities it will need to function effectively as
an organisation from the first day that it is set up.</div>
