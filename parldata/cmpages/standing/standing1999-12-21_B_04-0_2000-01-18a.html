</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the first speaker, I should like to make a short statement. At the beginning of our sitting last Tuesday morning, the Minister made some remarks about the Bill's applicability to Northern Ireland and the Government's intention to await the outcome of debate in the Northern Ireland Executive Committee on the subject of legislating for freedom of information in respect of Northern Ireland, which is a devolved matter. He said that it would be inappropriate for the Committee to amend the Bill in respect of Northern Ireland and that any amendments that might be needed to reflect decisions taken by the Northern Ireland Assembly about the coverage of Northern Ireland bodies would be debated on Report.
<P>
The Procedure Committee has reported on the procedural consequences of devolution. Its report supported the Government's expectation that in respect of public Bills—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a convention would be adopted that Westminster would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the devolved body.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The House has debated that report, but it has not reached any decision that affects the constitutional fact that the House and its Committees retain power to legislate for all parts of the United Kingdom, even on devolved matters, until the House makes any such decision.
<P>
I have no power to rule that amendments relating to devolved matters should not be debated if they are otherwise in order. That applies to amendments dealing with devolved matters relating to Scotland and Wales as well as to Northern Ireland. It is not for me to encourage or discourage hon. Members from tabling such amendments, but I felt that I should explain that they can do so if they wish. I hope that my remarks have clarified the constitutional situation.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 5, line 6, after `(1)', insert `(b)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 29, in page 5, line 8, after `(1)', insert `(b)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The amendment contains a simple proposition: if somebody requests information but the authority to which that request is made has no intention of providing it, either because it does not have it or because it says that it is exempt, it is inappropriate for a fee to be charged. Most hon. Members would consider it a rather poor business to be told that a requested commodity is out of stock but still to be required to pay the going price for it. The Bill appears to enable authorities to make such charges, and I suggest to the Minister that it would be fairer for them not to be applicable if requested information cannot be provided. My proposition is simple: no say, no pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): This issue will arise in other amendments. The Opposition have approached the same point in a slightly different way. The Committee will consider an amendment later tabled in my name and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends, as well as those of the Liberal Democrat Committee members. Perhaps this was a matter of who visited the Vote Office or Clerks' Office first. It is highly questionable that a public authority should charge a fee for telling someone who seeks information that it has that information but is not prepared to release it. We entertain similar concerns to those of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath).
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has put forward a simple proposition for which we probably all have much sympathy. I do not accept the amendment but there may be another way of achieving what the hon. Gentleman wants.
<P>
The Government are sympathetic to the aim of the amendment and recognise that in some cases it would be inappropriate to charge the applicant a fee. However, they do not believe that it would always be inappropriate for an authority to make a charge— for example, if it had done a great deal of work to confirm that it held the information. It would at least need to be able to recoup some of the marginal costs. After all, the knowledge that it held the information might be of value to the applicant.
<P>
The matter is one of detail—the sort of work involved and how much, and the appropriate charge for different circumstances—which should be dealt with in the regulations that clause 8(3) commits the Secretary of State to making. The Government are considering the detail of those regulations and plan to publicise their proposals soon. Any regulations made under the Bill will, under clause 81, be exercisable by statutory instrument. The regulations in question will be laid before Parliament under the negative resolution procedure. Hon. Members will then have an opportunity, if there is sufficient support, to debate the issue.
<P>
I have some sympathy for the views of the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). We will consider how to give effect to their idea, bearing in mind, first, my view that, at least if a great deal of work has been done, it should be possible to charge to cover the marginal costs, and, secondly, that some of the requests made under the Bill may come not from individuals but from legal persons in the sense of quite large companies. We are sympathetic to the concept behind the amendment, but if we examine the matter we may later be able to attend to its details in regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, who has clearly understood our point. I am concerned about his suggested course of action, because he will run into difficulties of definition if he attempts to qualify the right to charge by reference to the difficulty of acquiring or collating the information, or the amount of information involved. It would be exceedingly difficult to prevent acquisitive or obstructive authorities from using such a regulation to provide obstacles to genuine questioners. I shall carefully examine any regulations that he presents. A simple yes or no solution, such as that provided by the amendment, might prove easier for the Government in the long term. If the door is left open, someone will try to go through it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In the interests of good progress I point out that we shall debate the regulations issue shortly, but I am also concerned by the Minister's response. We shall be able to return to the matter on clause 14, to which the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment. Clause 14 refers to the ability to charge fees for the provision of information when the information exists but is not available. We should be able to press the Minister on that later in our proceedings. Regulations are fine, but if we are unhappy that public authorities think that they can charge for information, we should remove the ability to do that from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I are at one on this issue.
<P>
I intend to withdraw the amendment, but it would be helpful to receive a draft of the regulations before we finish our consideration of the Bill. That might allay the fears about the proposed drafting and how it will encompass some of the issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, there are problems with definition, which is why we need time to consider them properly. The detail of proposals will be examined by organisations such as the Campaign for Freedom of Information. The hon. Gentleman suggests that it might be simpler not to charge. We will consider that, but it may cause difficulties for some organisations. We must also be aware that, if the applicant does not pay for what could be a great deal of work, the taxpayer will pay. We need to be careful how we balance the needs of the applicant with those of taxpayer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I take it that that was an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> We have had two fairly lengthy interventions on what was intended to be a brief contribution, but I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his helpful response. I hope that he will not take it amiss if I suggest that scrutiny by outside organisations, however eminent, is no substitute for scrutiny of the Government's intentions by the Committee. However, he has clearly taken my suggestion on board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): Will the Under-Secretary tell us a little more about the regulations? When does he plan to table them? What is their status? Although my Committee work is rather rusty, I recall that regulations are not amendable.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not referring to the amendment. Perhaps he can return to this issue in a later debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I shall come to the amendment, with which I have great sympathy. I intend to support it by questioning my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on his response. He said that everything will be okay because the detail will be in the regulations. Can he give us greater certainty and clarity on that? Will the regulations be debatable and amendable? His response confused me a little. He said that he has sympathy with the amendment. Therefore, he must accept in principle the natural justice that people should not be charged for something that they do not get. However, the rest of his response was at odds with that. I am not sure that a different definition will address that concern. My hon. Friend said that it would be ridiculous not to charge a large corporation or a wealthy applicant if a public body had been put to great trouble. However, the public body would not be giving information. Behind my hon. Friend's response appears to be another example of—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must remain in order. He is anticipating amendment No. 14 and should restrict his remarks specifically to this amendment and to the Under-Secretary's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> It is difficult to keep to the amendment because there are so many and because they crosshatch, as it were. The Under-Secretary has my drift; I do not wish to prolong or to delay proceedings, but I urge him to go with his sympathy for the matter. Concern lies not only with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and the hon. Member for Ryedale, the Opposition spokesman; there is a general concern that, in natural justice, to be charged for a nil response is unusual. I hope that the proposal does not commend itself to the House.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I said that I sympathise with the broad principle. When people apply for ordinary information and receive a negative response such as that being considered, we ought at least to consider whether they should be charged, and I am happy to do so. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) obviously did not follow my other point, I shall reiterate it: the taxpayer would end up paying perhaps a substantial sum if much work had to be done. The interests of the taxpayer must be balanced against those of the individual applicant, and much work may have to be done sometimes. The applicant may be a large corporation, able to pay some of the marginal costs.
<P>
My second point was that, although I might have sympathy with some of the argument, the matters were best dealt with in regulations rather than in the Bill. It is appropriate to include in the Bill the ability to charge in certain circumstances and I have clearly noted that we may wish so to act.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale says that we are asking him just to trust us: we are not doing so at all. We are saying that parliamentary procedures, well known to him, are capable of dealing with the issues. They have long been used in similar circumstances and neither he nor anyone else has found them to be wanting. Such procedures can apply. The matter is not one of trusting us but of trusting the procedures of Parliament, and one of ensuring that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues trust themselves and those who choose to advise them. My officials are working on the regulations and we hope to have them ready, in draft form at least, while the Bill is still in Committee. The matters will be dealt with under the negative resolution procedure.
<P>
It has been claimed that it would not be fair for the authority to charge if no information was communicated. That is not so: an applicant receives information whether the authority confirms or denies that information is held, albeit not necessarily of the sort requested. The knowledge of whether the authority holds the information may well be valuable in itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> It will not be valuable if one wants the information. If a person seeking information is told that it exists but that he is not allowed to see it, he will not be much better off. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tell us again when the regulations will be available? My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner), who is sitting behind my hon. Friend, coughed at the vital moment, so I was unable to hear the crucial phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk will refrain from coughing for a moment, I shall answer. We hope that the draft regulations will be available before the end of the Committee stage of the Bill's passage so that they can be discussed and examined, and so that points within them can be brought to the attention of my hon. Friend and of other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> We have been brought a little further by the contributions that have been made. I am, however, encouraged but not satisfied by the Under-Secretary's remarks. I still believe that it would be difficult to draft effective regulations in the terms that he described. I may be wrong, but he seemed to suggest that the requirement to pay may be predicated on the perceived wealth of the legal person making the inquiry. That seems to be an extension of market economics into the display of information that I am not sure is entirely appropriate. The Committee will return to the matter during debate of later clauses and when we have had the chance to see the draft regulations that the Minister has now promised us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 5, line 11, leave out `subsection (5)' and insert `subsections (5) or (6)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 31, in page 5, line 22, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) No fee for complying with section 1 may be charged for disclosure of information—
<P>
(a) which prior to the commencement of this Act was provided to applicants without charge; or
<P>
(b) the disclosure of which is in the public interest.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The amendments deal with related but distinct matters. Amendment No. 30 is designed to ensure an arrangement whereby fees for information previously available would be waived to make it free of charge. Amendment No. 31 deals with disclosure in the public interest. In respect of information that is currently available, it would be anomalous if a Bill designed to open up information were to impose a charge which meant that less information was available. What does the Under-Secretary have to say about that? In parenthesis, I acknowledge that it may be regarded as unusual to deal with such matters other than in regulation. The amendment is, however, particularly significant, as it relates to ensuring that the principle of the Bill is not abrogated in practice. That principle is greater exposure, and the practice of charging could abrogate it.
<P>
There is a certain lack of clarity about the Government's intentions, so I welcome the opportunity to hear what the Under-Secretary intends. Some helpful details were contained in the Bill's explanatory notes, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is proposed that the regulations governing fees will specify that up to 10 per cent. of the reasonable marginal costs of complying with the request may be charged. This will be a maximum figure and there will be no requirement on an authority to use this formula, or indeed to charge anything. The regulations will provide that the additional costs involved in providing the information in the manner or form requested . . . may be charged in addition to any fee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The second of the amendments raises more complex issues. It is common in freedom of information laws elsewhere to allow fees to be waived in the public interest. In paragraph 5.12 of the Government White Paper ``Your Right to Know'', a similar approach is envisaged. It states that the commissioner would have the power to waive the charge
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if disclosure is considered to be in the wider public interest. For example, the commissioner might consider that there is a compelling public interest in disclosure which could go by default if the applicant could not afford to meet the charge being levied''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I understand the matter, the proposed fee regulations could stipulate that fees should not be charged in some circumstances, but it is not clear to me that that is intended to happen when disclosure is in the public interest. Indeed, there have been some suggestions that it might be thought appropriate to charge higher fees for matters in the public interest than for ordinary disclosures. My understanding is that information that is not exempt must be disclosed, and that such mandatory disclosures will be subject to a charge of no more than 10 per cent. of the actual costs, provided those do not exceed the appropriate limit under clause 11.
<P>
The second type of disclosure that is envisaged in the Bill is of exempt information that may be disclosed on a discretionary basis, where the public interest justifies it. In that instance it is clear that a higher fee may be charged. Paragraph 58 of the Home Office consultation paper states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where an authority uses its discretion, under clause 14, to disclose information, it would also have discretion under that clause to charge a fee. It is Government policy that this should be set at a level reasonable in the circumstances and not subject to the 10 per cent. ceiling that would apply to fees under clause 9.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could lead to an unacceptable and, in some ways, perverse situation in which someone from a business background, seeking commercial information, would obtain non-exempt information at the 10 per cent. rate, whereas a member of the public seeking information with the object of exposing serious misconduct by a public authority would have to pay a 100 per cent. rate. That would seem anomalous and, as a matter of policy, undesirable. If such a result is not intended, it is a matter important enough to be on the face of the Bill.
<P>
It is not entirely clear, and it seems unlikely that we shall be able to elicit the relevant information in a debate on regulation according to the normal scrutiny procedures of the House, how the 10 per cent. ceiling figure would be calculated. The consultation paper gives the costs in question as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the marginal cost of locating and disclosing the information.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It appeared when that account was published that costs were not intended to include staff time spent in assessing whether information was exempt. However, in response to question 26, in annexe 6 of the Public Administration Committee report, House of Commons paper 570-I, a Home Office note stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The costs would relate to locating the information and preparing it for disclosure, for example, any necessary editing to remove exempt material''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the cost of reading a document line by line against the exemptions is included when calculating fees, the cost of dealing with a request is more likely to reach the appropriate limit which, according to the Government, may be set at £500. Once the appropriate limit is reached, authorities can charge the full cost. That could mean a leap from a capped figure of 10 per cent. of the appropriate limit—£50—to one that is well in excess of £500. More seriously, once the limit is reached, the authorities could refuse to disclose the information altogether under clause 11(1), which provides that there is no duty to disclose information if costs exceed the appropriate limit.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be helpful to hear how that will operate. It will be undesirable if, as a consequence of a charging arrangement, authorities are empowered to refuse information. That would affect the entitlement to information. It is normal to consider these matters in regulations, but they could deny the purposes of the Bill. The principles underlying them should be established in primary legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> These matters are best dealt with in regulations and will appear, to some extent, in the detail. I accept, however, that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) raises legitimate issues.
<P>
Let me identify what we are considering. Clause 13 ensures that there will be a charge which, in some circumstances, will be 10 per cent. of the £500 limit. It remains the case that if no fee is chargeable in legislation, no fee will be charged. The Bill does not change that. However, if an application under the Bill goes beyond existing legislation, a charge might be levied. Some public authorities do not charge for information as a matter of practice, although it might be permissible under legislation, because, depending on the number of requests that a public authority receives, it may not be worth while to set up the administrative structure to charge a fee. That may be the case with freedom of information if a public authority seldom receives requests for information. To some extent, that will be a matter for the public authority.
<P>
However, we must remember that other public authorities that previously charged no fee for applications for information, although they could have done so under legislation, may decide to establish structures and to introduce a fee because of the volume of requests produced by the Bill. They may find that worth while in certain circumstances, although I cannot imagine an example of when they might. The fee may be small, but if the £500 limit causes problems when requests are made for information under clause 11, the public authority will have to balance the interests of the taxpayer with those of the applicant. When legislating, we must remember that our duty is not only to individual applicants. Applicants may be journalists, big corporations or people who are well off—we all know that journalists are well paid. We also have a duty to individuals who are not so well off. We must consider those concerns, as well as our tax-paying constituents.
<P>
The Government have made provision under clause 8 for the Secretary of State to make regulations in relation to the issues raised. Subsection (4)(a) provides for him to prescribe by regulation those cases where no fee will be payable. Our intention in making that provision is to avoid the need to include in the Act unnecessary and potentially confusing detail that might be difficult to amend except by primary legislation. We are better able to deal with the matter by regulation. We are currently considering the detail of the regulations and hope to produce some while we are still in Committee. We shall be looking especially at circumstances in which no fee may currently be charged by the authority.
<P>
However, simply because a fee is not charged now is not sufficient reason for the information to be supplied free under the Bill. The Bill will place an additional burden on authorities and it may be appropriate, when calculating the cost of providing the information under the regulations, for the cost to be borne by the applicant, possibly with the taxpayer. It could be said that a release of information was in the public interest simply because an application for its release had been made, so no fee could be charged for any disclosure of information. I cannot believe that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross wishes to go that far. The regulations will be the subject of secondary legislation. Once they have been tabled, hon. Members will have the opportunity to debate them if there is sufficient support. That would be the best time for us to consider the details.
<P>
We have decided to apply a charge equivalent to 10 per cent. of marginal costs. We shall deal with that matter later in regulations, but the right hon. Gentleman has raised points with a direct application to the amendments so I should say why we took the view that we did. We have chosen to provide by regulation that an authority may charge 10 per cent. of the marginal costs of supplying information because that is the average percentage of marginal costs under other common law freedom of information legislation. Unlike other jurisdictions, we are limiting the application to the marginal cost of locating and finding the information. The proposal is modest by international comparison and will provide a valuable subsidy from the taxpayer to the applicant—freedom of information will involve the taxpayer considerably subsidising the applicant. The question is whether we should go as far as allowing an applicant to have information for free whenever it is wanted; the right hon. Gentleman would not suggest that we went that far. A fee should be payable, and I believe that our approach and the sum proposed are reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I do not take the view that charging would never be reasonable. The Under-Secretary may be right to predict frequent commercial inquiries of considerable number. The Government's figures are reasonable in respect of such inquiries, but I am far from convinced by his attitude to disclosure in the public interest. My understanding of the seeking by a private citizen of information the disclosure of which may be of public interest is different from that of the Under-Secretary. He has conceptualised as a private matter the interest of a private citizen in the disclosure of information in the public interest and he seems to view money from the taxpayer as a subsidy to that process. As I understand it, the purpose of the Bill is to improve public availability, which means availability not only to individuals but to the citizenry of information held by public authorities. Any calculation of the balance of interests involved that ensures the imposition of a steep fee on the information seeker will be counter to the purposes of the Bill. I cannot, therefore, see how such an approach would be acceptable.
<P>
I do not want to repeat my remarks about disclosure costs far outstripping the £500 limit or about such costs leading to the withdrawal of information on the grounds that they would be excessive. We can return to those matters later.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I would be interested to hear the right hon. Gentleman's views on small public authorities such as doctors' surgeries. It is all very well to discuss such matters in terms of the Government, who can, it is implied, distribute an abundance of so-called taxpayers' money. How would a small doctor's surgery respond to repeated requests that involve a substantial amount of work for a limited number of personnel?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> A small charge would be appropriate in such cases, but it should not be set at a inhibitive level that discourages the seeking of information the disclosure of which is in the public interest. I hope that I correctly understood the Under-Secretary's argument about how the regulations should deal with such matters. They are to be subject to the negative procedure, which, as is well known, allows for only a small number of matters to be debated. The Under-Secretary was right to say that there is at least the possibility that the details can be considered if a huge outcry is made and a great deal of parliamentary interest can be stirred up. Such debate is, however, pretty unusual, and most hon. Members are familiar with the fact that such legislation is passed without effective parliamentary scrutiny. That is why the regulations, which involve big issues of principle, should be considered in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am listening carefully to the right hon. Gentleman. In some respects, he is pre-empting one of the points that I intend to make later, which also arose during debate of the previous amendments. His judgment on the passing of the regulations without scrutiny is correct, simply because they will subject to the negative rather than affirmative procedure. They would have to be prayed against and a fuss would have to be made even to ensure a debate Upstairs, let alone on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's support and agreement. It could seem pettifogging to want to consider such matters now, but they involve significant principles. The legislation should not be left so undetermined by Parliament that it will be possible to increase charges. Such provision could be a serious disincentive to the acquisition of information, which the Government want en principe. Perhaps later during our discussion of the Bill, we may establish principles on which the regulations can rest and against which they can be judged. I do not want to repeat our earlier debate about a purpose clause, but I should point out that such an approach would ensure that decisions on the regulations are not ultra vires in relation to the main principles of the Bill.
<P>
Having heard the Under-Secretary's remarks, I have no great hope that he will take the matter further. I have listened to him with great care, and it may be appropriate to approach differently the problems that he has outlined later during our consideration of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 5, line 11, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`reasonable in the circumstances and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would require any fee charged to applicants to be ``reasonable in the circumstances'' in order to comply with clause 8(3). Without such provision, the Information Commissioner will be able to uphold a complaint about fees only if they exceed the levels prescribed by regulation. The amendment seeks to give the Information Commissioner a right to intervene when a fee that complies with the regulations is none the less unreasonable. Such a power would provide a useful safeguard. It is hard to judge whether such circumstances will occur often, as the regulations are not yet available. The amendment would, however, be a helpful and prudent addition to the Bill.

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The matter covered by the amendment should be dealt with by regulation rather than by the Bill. The right hon. Gentleman's assumption seemed to be that the regulations would not achieve their purpose and that the Information Commissioner should therefore be able to intervene if a fee does not comply with them. Ensuring that the regulations work is the best way of dealing with the matter, and not placing another burden on the Information Commissioner, who will have a lot of work to do in supervising the legislation without the additional task of examining any complaint about the level of a public authority's fee. That could involve much investigative analysis in adopting a view on fees, which would unduly burden the Information Commissioner. I am not in favour of that. The best approach to the issue of ensuring that fees are reasonable—and I certainly think that they should be—is to provide regulations on how to set them. I prefer that approach, but in any event the Government's view remains that those matters should be dealt with in discussion of the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Does the Under-Secretary think that the regulations may empower the commissioner to intervene on fee questions in particular cases? That, certainly, was the implication of paragraph 5.12 of the Government's earlier White Paper, ``Your Right to Know'', which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are prepared to give the Information Commissioner wide-ranging powers to carry out these important functions effectively''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and included in those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the power to review and adjust individual charges or charging systems''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no hint in that statement that the Government thought that the commissioner would have too much on her plate to interest herself in particular charging issues. Indeed, the document continues by suggesting that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Commissioner might consider that there is a compelling public interest in disclosure which couId go by default if the applicant could not afford to meet the charge being levied''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A serious question arises as to the Government's intentions, given that the Under-Secretary's earlier reply suggested a different view.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government's view is fairly straightforward. It is that the Information Commissioner has much work to do and that we should be cautious about imposing unnecessary duties on her. There seems to be a tendency among opponents of the Bill as drafted to suggest that everything should be done by the Information Commissioner. That would be unhelpful to her.
<P>
Intervention by the Information Commissioner concerning fees should be limited to questions of whether the regulations have been properly applied. It should not include determining whether the public authority was charging a reasonable fee. That would be an entirely different duty. We must be reasonable not just about the fees but about what we expect of the Information Commissioner. She will be in a position to intervene if, after she has considered a case, it appears to her that a regulation has not been applied properly. It is our job in this House—not that of the commissioner—to get the regulations right. We cannot, by passing on our responsibilities, get around a straightforward situation. If we prove not to have drawn up workable regulations, that is our problem, not the commissioner's, and we are the ones who must make it right.
<P>
The Information Commissioner's job is to ensure that the regulations are applied properly. She will no doubt have to deal with a limited number of requests to determine whether that has happened. To have to decide the reasonableness of every fee would be a quite different matter. Tens of thousands of organisations are involved. It is utterly unreasonable for the commissioner to have to assess each fee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> If it is unreasonable for the commissioner to have to consider those problems as they arise, how much more unreasonable it is to ask us, as legislators, to consider hypothetically the vast range of circumstances that the regulations have to cover. A degree of flexibility should be introduced into the process. That is where the commissioner could help. The Under-Secretary's suggestion that she has a duty to determine whether the regulations are properly complied with is, in many ways, more difficult to achieve because of the possible vast number of cases. If it becomes common practice to challenge all decisions as a cheap way to get an answer, the commissioner could be inundated. The fee rules that are set out in regulations will be open to challenge in the courts if they are not properly applied. It is not the wrongful application of the regulations that gives us cause for anxiety, but the oppressive operation of regulations, because that could defeat the purposes of the Bill. We will make the commissioner's life incredibly difficult if we do not give her the power to act on evidence of that. By questioning her capacity to offer a remedy, we would rapidly bring her role into disrepute.
<P>
I recognise that it would be inappropriate to expect the Government to have reached a final conclusion at this stage, but I hope that they will consider the matter. In defined cases, against a background of shared objectives, it should be possible to devise a role for the commissioner that does not open the floodgates. If the regulations are unsatisfactory, or the implications of the enforcement of the regulations are oppressive, the commissioner's position should not be set at nought and the purposes of the Bill defeated.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is less between us than it might appear. I understand the thrust of what the right hon. Gentleman says about the way in which the Information Commissioner will operate. Those matters are best dealt with in regulations, the draft of which will be forthcoming within the next few weeks. I shall bear his comments in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am extremely grateful for that constructive response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 5, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) Before making regulations under subsection (3) the Secretary of State shall first publish a draft of such regulations and shall consult with such persons or bodies as appear to him to have an interest in the level of fees which may be charged under subsection (1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe some of the issues that are related to fees. The Committee has done much of that in the past hour, and I do not want to labour the points that have been raised. However, although we have some sympathy with the arguments that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome advanced, we have a slightly different perspective.
<P>
The existing code allows for fees to be charged, but there is no formal structure setting out what fees are charged. I am not aware that that has created problems and, as a huge fuss has not been made, we must assume that the code has worked reasonably well. I make that point not to suggest that the code is superior to the Bill—although I think that it is—but to make it clear that the previous Government's trust in public authorities to be reasonable when charging fees appears to have been well. That said, it would be sensible to formalise the fee-charging arrangement.
<P>
Apart from one or two minor concerns, we see nothing alarming in clause 8. It sets out a bare-bones framework, which is added to in other clauses. The regulations, which the Under-Secretary told us that the Government will introduce, will be subject to a negative resolution instead of an affirmative resolution. They will be laid before the House and it will be up to relevant Opposition Members to spot them before they can be prayed against. We shall debate whether that is the right approach later.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary set great store by the importance of regulations. I anticipated that and have much sympathy with him, but the purpose of the amendment is to flag up a little more what he thinks that the regulations will say. What fees are appropriate? We all know what the White Paper and the Select Committee report said; hon. Members have referred to the likely £500 ceiling. Nothing has caused great alarm. Indeed, while listening to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, I refreshed my memory on what the Select Committee said on the matter. It did not create much controversy.
<P>
I understand, however, that regulations can provide for some of the detail that we have debated. According to subsection (4)(a), if no fee is charged now, there will be no fee in future. It makes it clear
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that no fee is to be payable in prescribed cases''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary reserved his position by saying that it did not mean that if no fee was charged now, automatically no fee would be charged in future. There may be sense in that, but when will a fee be charged if no fee is charged at present?
<P>
There appears to be a yawning gap between subsection (4)(a), where no fee can be paid, and (4)(b), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any fee is not to exceed such maximum as may be specified''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That encourages the worry in my mind that there could be either no fee or, in the majority of cases, the maximum fee. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reassure me that the regulations will make it clear that that is not the case.
<P>
How will interested parties and people know what fees the Government have in mind for the regulations? That is a two-edged sword. Clearly, some people, such as constituents who want to find out what information is held by their family doctor—the example that the Under-Secretary used—genuinely want to obtain information. Equally, a huge number of quasi-public bodies are not over-resourced. He knows my view on that; I believe that we should return to the matter time and again. Those quasi-public bodies also need to know what they might be lumbered with when the regulations come into effect.
<P>
For those reasons, we thought that it would be more appropriate not to amend clause 8, but to add the requirement, before the regulations are laid and come into effect, that the Secretary of State should publish the draft regulations and consult persons and bodies interested in the level of fees that may be charged under the subsection. It is not that we do not trust the Minister or the Government, but there should be a clear undertaking, if not a clear mechanism, in the Bill. We are reassured a little that the Minister has suggested that he hopes to have some of the regulations in draft form before the Committee finishes. I do not know how long he thinks that we shall be entertaining ourselves in Committee Room 10, but I had expected him to say that it would be unrealistic to expect drafts of the regulations before we had finished. The position is better than my negative thinking had suggested that it might have been.
<P>
I have made all the valid points and the Minister gets our drift. The Government are not proceeding wrongly but, because of the scope of the provision, it should be made far more certain that the regulations will be available widely to interested parties long before the Minister lays the order and states the position. Matters should be kept under review. I agree that the system will work satisfactorily and that there will not be many dissatisfied people among those providing information and those wanting it—we will not need to involve the Information Commissioner to referee disputes about fees. However, unless the regulations are seen as sensible and fair to both sides, the commissioner will get disputes referred to her whether she likes it or not and there will be many disgruntled and dissatisfied people.
<P>
I hope that what I have said will encourage the Under-Secretary. We are largely supportive of the structure, but we have genuine concerns about the importance of people's knowing exactly what the Government have in mind well in advance, the need for proper consultation and the need for a response to that before Parliament is asked, either by affirmative or negative procedure, to approve the regulations.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I, too, thought that the hon. Gentleman was fair in the way in which he put his amendment and I appreciate why it was so put. It would be appropriate to describe it as a probing amendment and I shall deal with it on that basis.
<P>
I am certainly grateful for the hon. Gentleman's broad support for the concept of charging at least something and seeing whether we can get the balance right. When setting any fee, we must balance the interests of the taxpayer with those of the applicant. Hon. Members will have a view on the judgment that that involves. We should rightly canvass the broad principles now, but the detail of how we may set the balance will best be dealt with in regulations.
<P>
The interest of the taxpayer falls into two areas. First, we do not want to impose on public authorities heavy extra costs. Secondly, public authorities should have a constraint on the diversion of resources from their proper and legitimate activities to their dealing with freedom of information, and a constraint on people making frivolous or unnecessary requests. The assumption in the Bill is that there will not be such requests, but there should be protections against them because of the operations of small business such as a doctor's surgery. Although we shall consider the fees carefully, hon. Members should be aware that small businesses will not necessarily receive a lot more money to help with freedom of information requests. We hope that the costs imposed on such organisations will not be large, but the Bill and the regulations flowing from it could impose difficulties if they do not contain some protection.
<P>
Therefore we are approaching the matter carefully. We want to get the balance right, and we are willing to listen to the views not only of hon. Members but of members of the public and campaign group representatives on how that balance should be struck. Although some national journalists think only about how they may obtain information from the Government without being charged too much for it—a perfectly proper perspective—hon. Members must balance such an approach with the interests of smaller public authorities and decide what burdens, if any, we wish to impose on them, on applicants and on the taxpayers who pay for those authorities. Getting that right is a process of some detail, and I venture to suggest that it is not the sort of thing that Ministers should do. None the less, the regulations may be the subject of controversy. We will see how they work, and we will no doubt have to revisit them and refine them to ensure proper operation of the fees. As some hon. Members have suggested, it is perhaps time: we shall seek to do our best, honestly and constructively.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale said that he recognised that the Government were seeking to make the regulations available before the Committee stage is over. I hope that we will do so, but I do not give a definite undertaking. I have outlined the time scale to which we are working, and the hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that we intend to draft the regulations over the next two or three weeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for all that, but will the Under-Secretary tell us when the regulations will be laid? The consultation period will come first. Presumably, the Bill has to go through the other House before it receives Royal Assent. Even if he can publish the regulations that have been mentioned—there are more to be drafted later—in advance, there could still be several months of consultation before they are laid under the powers brought into effect by Royal Assent to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We shall draft the regulations over the next two or three weeks. They will, therefore, be published in four, five or six weeks, or within the next couple of months. We plan to consult widely on them and to make them available on the internet, which is a beneficial and easy way of making information accessible to a large number of people. We also hope to encourage people to reply using the various new technological means available to them, and to comment on how we might better draft the regulations. I cannot give a precise time for the consultation, but we shall certainly need enough to obtain a broad view on the opinions of campaign organisations and others. We shall ensure that Members of Parliament have access to the regulations through the usual procedures so that they can comment. It may be appropriate for the regulations to be discussed more properly before the refinements are dealt with in the usual way. That will, in due course, be a matter for hon. Members in general rather than just for members of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale commented that the existing code did not have a system for setting fees. That is true, and there have been very few complaints, but the reason for that may be that very few requests have been made under the code. In 1994 there were 2,600 code cases; in 1995 there were 1,353. Those figures are for the whole country, including all the organisations and public authorities affected. In 1996 there were 2,033 code cases; in 1997 there were 3,772. In 1998 the method of calculation changed, because of the view taken by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions about how some of its cases should be recorded. However, if a direct comparison were made with previous years, the total number of cases would be 2,269, although the official figure is 23,589.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There have, therefore, been a relatively low number of requests. For many public authorities, it has probably not been worth setting up the administrative structure to deal with the requests for information. The lack of complaints is therefore not surprising. Most people probably got their information for nothing.
<P>
We hope that, under FOI, the situation will change and that people's realisation that they have a statutory right to know will affect their perception of their role as citizens and their ability to question and request information. We anticipate that more people will take advantage of that right, so that a broader and more legitimate view about the fees issue can be reached. A proper discussion should take place in due course in Committee, or in dealing with the regulations, about the right balance with respect to fees.
<P>
The Bill presents us with a new situation. We need to reconsider the subject of fees. I do not think that the existing code provides a basis on which to proceed. The hon. Member for Ryedale agreed that under the Bill there should be a system for setting fees and that regulation was probably the best way to do that.
<P>
In future, both large and small public authorities may receive more requests for information and have to decide whether it will be worth their while setting up an administrative system to charge the relevant fees.
<P>
Let me deal with a couple of points that were made. The answer to the question whether fee setting will involve either no fee or a maximum is no. The basic regulations will lay down a method for calculating fees; 10 per cent. of marginal costs. I was asked how applicants will know what they should expect to pay. An applicant will be told beforehand the charge for the intended request. We expect that each public authority will have its relevant process and way of informing people. For Government Departments things will be fairly straightforward; mechanisms exist. Smaller public authorities will have to decide how they will set their fees within the regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That was a very worthwhile exchange. The Under-Secretary provided food for thought about some other matters that we shall consider. He and I are most in agreement about the need to balance the interests of people who want information and of organisations that must provide it, which will not always be Government Departments. My point about the code was really that in the past we have been able to trust public authorities to be reasonable, without the need for structure. I accept that we are now moving on and that the new arrangement is sensible. We all look forward to seeing the draft regulations. It sounds as though there may be an opportunity to consider the matter even before the Bill has been considered by both Houses of Parliament. Having succeeded in flagging up some of the issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Time for compliance with request</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 5, line 35, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`providing always that such other day shall in any event be not later than the sixtieth working day following the date of receipt.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This concerns an important point: the time in which a public authority should reasonably be expected to respond to requests for information. The code gives a period of 20 days. I do not want to labour the point about the code, but I am not aware that that created unnecessary difficulty. The draft of the Bill that was scrutinised by the Select Committee gave a period of 40 days. The Committee was very critical of that and in response the Government reduced it to 20. I expect all Committee members will agree that that is much preferable.
<P>
The difficulty arises because subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State the power to substitute another period for that of 20 days. It is not a question of arguing about trust. One does not know who might be Home Secretary in future, but that is a separate issue. However, the Government have not shown why they consider the provision necessary and what might replace the period of 20 days. In theory, an unlimited response time could be set. Ours is a probing amendment, designed to find out whether a maximum time—a ceiling—should be set under the Bill.
<P>
Another aspect of the matter is revealed in subsection (4) under which regulations may prescribe different response times for different cases. Perhaps the Minister has in mind that, while 20 days would be the norm, experience suggests that in some cases longer would be more appropriate. Indeed, one would like to think that in other cases a shorter time would be appropriate. I know from amendments yet to be considered that some Committee members are concerned about how to help people who need information quickly. I am worried about the presence in the clause of a power to prescribe an unlimited response time. Perhaps we should press the Under-Secretary to give an undertaking to the Committee that that is not proposed. What time frame does he have in mind to replace the 20 days?
<P>
Lastly, can the Under-Secretary confirm that his intention is that a 20-day response period will be the norm, and that subsection (3) is simply a residual power to enable more time to be allowed in cases where it might take longer to obtain the information? Does he intend that the power would not generally be used to divert from the 20 days that, I repeat, was in the code, which the Select Committee wanted, which now appears in the Bill and which appears to be the settled position?

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I want to support the view of the hon. Member for Ryedale and to add that a dispensing power is proposed that would enable the Secretary of State subsequently to set at nought the provisions of the primary legislation. That seems an odd way in which to approach the issue, given that there have been such deliberations about the appropriate time limits. The Government have obviously given much thought to the matter: they published a figure in the White Paper, consulted widely about it and echoed the code in their final provisions. Now they are offering a potentially huge exemption.
<P>
We very much want to know what is in the Government's mind concerning the use of the power. What is in the present Government's mind is interesting, but the Bill will no doubt survive the present Home Secretary, and its interpretation and enactment could be completely different from what he intends. We must take such a dispensing provision with great seriousness.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government's intention is for the norm not to be 20 days but for it to be less than that, with 20 days as the maximum. We have no intention at present of extending the statutory time limit under the regulations. However, we want to ensure that, were there a genuine case for doing so, we could extend the time limit if the proposal could be justified at the time.
<P>
I shall give an example of a problem that might arise. The Health and Safety Executive had a case under its current code of practice on nuclear safety. The case required the provision of information and the scrutinising of a vast amount of statistical and bureaucratic information, and that took more than 60 days. I am not aware of complaints from the applicant that it took that long: it was felt that the period was justified because of the substantial amount of information that had to be scrutinised. In extremely limited circumstances, it could be justified to say that the time limit might be extended.
<P>
We are not currently being faced by a request from any organisation to extend the limit. However, we wish to ensure that there is a residual power with appropriate safeguards, and with reassurances that we do not currently intend to extend the statutory time limits under the regulations. Our intention is to have a norm of less than 20 days and we should create a situation in which public authorities are under obligations.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross says that we should be careful with a dispensing power. It is right that we have the power, and I have suggested how we intend to use it. The situation would be exceptional: we do not have a clear situation in which we are being requested to use it. However, if a legitimate and proper request was made, the Government should rightly be able to deal with it. I hope that in such a one-off, highly exceptional situation as my example, the view of the House might be that there could be an extension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> As I said earlier, it is difficult for legislators to consider all of the circumstances that may flow from the Bill. I am therefore sympathetic to the view that provisions should be in place to deal with the matters under discussion. However, would not such matters be adequately dealt with by giving the Information Commissioner the discretion referred to in clause 9(4)(b)? Would not that be a sufficient escape provision to deal with the unforeseen circumstance in which it would be impossible or unreasonable to comply with a request for information? Should not such circumstances be dealt with by the Information Commissioner rather than by the cumbersome means of regulations, which operate in the area of the hypothetical?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point about individual, one-off cases. An authority could receive a specific request with which it wants to deal in a longer time than that expected. If the applicant is unhappy about that, it might be proper for the Information Commissioner to deal with the matter. However, if an authority were to request a longer time to deal with a series of reasonable applications, regulations might be needed to address the circumstances of the authority. The power is residuary and provides an ability to deal with a series of problems arising in a particular public authority. We do not currently intend to use it, but we think that it is necessary as a safety measure to deal with unforeseen circumstances.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the commissioner's discretion provided sufficient flexibility. It does not, and we need the ability to set time limits for particular public authorities while the commissioner will deal with one-off, individual cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary says, and I do not doubt his good intentions. I am pleased by his view that 20 days should be a maximum. The fact remains, however, that subsection (3) contains a wide power that could easily be abused. I should like to give another example of the dangers that may arise from such a provision. My hon. Friend understands the legislation well, and he knows that in considering the legislation hon. Members will always be thinking about the worst instance, and about people who act not out of goodwill but to protect information whose disclosure is inconvenient to them. When the disclosure of information is not inconvenient, there will be no problem; indeed, there is currently no problem. The whole point of the legislation is to make available information whose release is in the public interest but which causes some inconvenience to a public body.
<P>
I have two examples of the dangers of subsection (3), both of which relate to the Ministry of Defence. For years, hon. Members of all parties have been trying to get information out of the MoD, or at least a change of attitude, on service men who were at Easter island and who—rightly or wrongly—believe that they were exposed to radiation. Another such example is the MoD's attitude to the interests of constituents whose health has suffered from what is known as the Gulf war syndrome. It is no secret that the MoD, both during this Parliament and the previous one, has hardly been enthusiastic about addressing the issues. I am still dealing with requests for information on both those matters, which have been going on not for 20 days but, in the case of Easter Island, for the best part of 20 years. The information is difficult to extract because the MoD is not keen to provide it. A genuine public interest is at stake. Subsection (3) could let the MoD off the hook by putting an indefinite date on complying with a request to provide particular information. I am sure that that is not the intention of the Home Secretary or the Under-Secretary, but that is the danger. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider the matter with some urgency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It might help the Committee if I collate the views that have been expressed in this brief but important debate. Although I heal what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central says, I understand why the Under-Secretary wants a residual power to make a change. The problem is, however, that instead of using it to set a different date for exceptional cases, it could be used to set a different date for all cases. Will the Under-Secretary consider redrafting subsection (3) so that it does not give the power to change the generality? I am reassured by his assertion that the public authority has a maximum of 20 days in which to comply and that, in most cases, it will take fewer than 20 days.
<P>
The clause provides a general power that could apply to all cases if it were improperly used. That would go against the spirit of what we have agreed. We want a power that does not affect the generality, but applies to the specific case that the Under-Secretary has in mind. If such a power is forthcoming, contrary to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, I do not want to press for a maximum because it is unlikely that it would be abused.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The public authority that acts in bad faith cannot rely on clause 9(3). My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is not right to say that it could easily be abused. That is not the reality. It assumes that Parliament has no ability to intervene in the passage of regulations. Any attempt to abuse subsection (3) could easily be stopped by Parliament. My hon. Friend's fears are not justifiable. I do not see how subsection (3) is applicable to Gulf war syndrome and Easter Island, unless he thinks that the Ministry of Defence would attempt to push through regulations that would be subject to substantial discussion in the House of Commons. Those are not good examples.
<P>
Although there is parliamentary protection, I take the point that was made by the hon. Member for Ryedale. The Government aim to use the provisions in subsection (3) only in exceptional cases. I shall consider whether that can be made clear in the Bill. I hope that, in the light of the background and examples that I have given, in which health and safety rules might well have meant that more than 60 days were needed, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment. We want a residuary power. We intend that the provision should be used only in very exceptional, justifiable and, I suspect, non-controversial circumstances. I shall examine the matter and, in due course, write to the hon. Gentleman and copy in members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This has been another important and worthwhile exchange. In view of the Under-Secretary's agreement to think further about the matter, I look forward to his letter and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

(c) the applicant would be placed at a significant disadvantage in making the submission or statement within that period unless the information was supplied before the expiry of twenty working days from the date of receipt of the application;
<P>
the authority shall take all reasonable steps to comply with the request in time to prevent the applicant from being so disadvantaged.
<P>
(4B) The matters referred to in subsection (4A) are
<P>
(a) the proceedings in any particular matter of a court, tribunal or inquiry or of any investigation carried out by a public authority;
<P>
(b) the taking of a particular decision by a public authority;
<P>
(c) a consultation exercise carried out by a public authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment requires an authority to try to deal with a request in fewer than 20 working days in some circumstances. I am encouraged, in moving it, by the spirit of the Minister's response to the previous debate, which was that requests should be dealt with in fewer than 20 days. However, it would be helpful to reinforce that attitude on the face of the Bill with respect to cases in which there is good and urgent reason.
<P>
An example that comes to my mind of circumstances in which lack of information could significantly and seriously disadvantage a person or organisation is a tribunal, court case, inquiry or appeal. Hon. Members might, for instance, have constituents who were worried about elderly care beds in a hospital and want to reassure themselves that compensating provisions were in place before the beds were closed. There might be consultation on such a matter, and to establish the true position and whether their fears were justified they might want to obtain information from a hospital trust or health authority. Failure to obtain the information in time for a consultation, or an inquiry or appeal, would significantly disadvantage the person making the application.
<P>
I stress that the amendment—which I am sure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has read carefully— would not create an absolute duty. It would require the applicant to demonstrate disadvantage and the authority to take all reasonably practicable steps. I have in mind my hon. Friend's reiteration, from previous debates, that he wants the Bill to be practicable, and the wording of the amendment is in line with his understandable concerns in that regard.
<P>
In serious and important circumstances when the relevant information would cease to be of use to the applicant unless it was provided in time for a particular purpose, this cautious amendment to the Bill would prove a sensible one.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can reassure my hon. Friend that we intend the norm to be fewer than 20 days. We expect that public authorities will err on the side of caution in supplying information so that they do not cut it too fine and so that they are able to keep well within the specified time. That will require a change in the culture of public authorities—I refer especially to central Government and local authorities. Such change is a part of the key process that we will need to undertake in making freedom of information a reality. We have always taken the view that putting freedom of information on to the statute book is only part of the process. Changing the culture in the way that I have described is in many ways a much bigger and more important part of delivering on freedom of information.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would require authorities to take all practical steps to deal with requests in fewer than 20 days if a quicker response is necessary to prevent the applicant from being disadvantaged in making a submission in relation to legal proceedings or other matters. Following public consultation, the Government have already reduced the period from 40 days to 20 days. One of the most important principles in the Bill is that it is applicant blind. That is to say that it makes no provision for the giving of reasons by the applicant to justify his request. It is difficult to see how a system such as that proposed would not compromise the essential right to information provided in the Bill or how it could be effectively monitored by public authorities. The amendment therefore goes against a central principle of the Bill. It would be almost impossible properly to monitor and give effect to the proposed system and to evaluate the more marginal cases in which an applicant wants information to be provided more quickly, but a public authority does not. We must set up a mechanism for resolving such matters.
<P>
In addition, in so far as the amendment provides for legal proceedings, I remind the Committee that the disclosure of information to parties involved in court and tribunal proceedings is already governed by the rules applicable to courts and tribunals, which may be able to use their own procedures to require public authorities to provide information within a prescribed time, which could be a matter of hours. I remember being summoned before a judge and being told to get to the court immediately. Public authorities are subject to tribunals and courts, which have powers to request that information should arrive immediately. In most circumstances, they do not require freedom of information legislation to give effect to those powers.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central spoke about other public authorities and requests that do not involve tribunal or court cases. Whether a public authority is obliged to respond to a request for information will depend on circumstances. If we create the cultural change at which we are aiming, public authorities should be able to respond more quickly to applicants and to citizens in general and will be likely to hold the view that they should be as helpful as possible.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment as it goes against the principles of the Bill and would not strengthen the clause. Although it focuses on the needs of the individual, it would do little to strengthen the provisions, which already require authorities to comply with applications promptly and, in any event, not later than 20 working days after their receipt. The requirement for authorities to comply with requests promptly should make them provide the requested information well before the end of the 20-day working period whenever that is reasonably possible. They must apply promptly, and I am not sure that the audit would add much to the clause, which really does help most applicants
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has given a witty response that verges on casuistry. It is slightly ironic that he tries to turn the virtues of non-disclosure, which he rightly says is important, against an applicant and what is being sought. One would expect such an elegant response from an experienced barrister such as him.
<P>
I think that the original draft of the Bill required disclosure of reasons in certain circumstances. I am delighted not only that the Under-Secretary changed that draft but that he now clings passionately to the principle of disclosure not being a good idea. I agree that it is not, but the purpose of being sceptical is so as not to subvert a reasonable request. The lack of the ability to say that there is good reason for wanting the information within a given period seems similarly subverted. He is right that legal bodies such as courts will have the powers to order disclosure but he accepts that, in many other important circumstances, such as during consultation exercises, there will not be those powers. His resistance goes against the spirit of his reply.
<P>
He said that he wanted people to deliver in less than 20 days. We all want that, and he is right to say that, when the culture changes, people will mostly manage to achieve that and to do it well. The point of legislation is to consider the hard circumstances, the difficult cases. Without the amendment, it would be convenient for a public body that did not want to put arguments and information in the hands of bodies or individuals taking a different view of an appeal or inquiry. Admittedly, public authorities are changing generally in their cultural attitudes toward information. However, if the Minister continues to resist and does not take the proposal away for consideration, he will strengthen the hand of the public authority that still finds it convenient not to provide information that might make life more difficult for itself I would regret that, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend says. I have set out the Government's view and; I cannot take the matter much further. I can only stress that the authority would not be able to test effectively why the applicant wanted the information. One of the Bill's key aims is to ensure that people get information promptly. My hon. Friend's amendment would undermine the Bill and the principle of applicants not having to justify themselves. I suspected, and he noted that he probably was, one of those who felt that that principle was important.
<P>
A situation would be created in which the applicant might be the subject of questioning by the public authority on why he required the information so quickly. That process, in itself, would probably take more than 20 days, despite the wonders of our Post Office. The best way of dealing with the situation is to require the public authority to provide information promptly within 20 days. That is proposed in the Bill; if the courts want more, they have the power to deal with it. I cannot go further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I shall have to agree to differ—it is no good if a request for information required for a particular occasion is answered promptly but still comes too late. I hear what my hon. Friend says and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemption where cost of compliance exceeds appropriate limit</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No.32, in page 6, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Subject to subsection (1B), subsection (1) does not exempt the public authority from complying with a request if the applicant has indicated that he is willing to pay a reasonable additional fee for the information; and an authority may not refuse to comply with such a request unless it has notified the applicant of the reasonable additional fee which it requires for complying, which may not exceed the cost to the authority of providing the information to the applicant.
<P>
(1B) Subsection (1A) does not oblige an authority to comply with a request where, because of the large number or volume of records involved, to do so would interfere substantially and unreasonably with the work of an authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 11(1) allows an authority to refuse to comply with a request if the cost of compliance exceeds the appropriate limit. The authority must then consider whether to make a discretionary disclosure of the information while having regard to the circumstances of the case and the public interest. However, it cannot be compelled to disclose information. The commissioner can only recommend disclosure; she cannot require it. The amendment would make it possible to require an authority to disclose information when the appropriate limit is exceeded if the applicant is willing to pay ``a reasonable additional fee'', which would not exceed the cost to the authority of providing the information. However, we recognise that that would not be appropriate if compliance with a voluminous request interfered substantially and unreasonably with the authority's work, even if the applicant was willing to pay the additional fee.
<P>
The amendment would establish two tests: first, that interference is substantial and, secondly, that it is unreasonable. Compliance with a request could interfere substantially with an authority's work while being entirely reasonable and not inhibited by the cost. For example, if a problem with compliance arose because of the incompetence of an authority in managing its filing system, or where the issue at stake was sufficiently grave and of great public importance—perhaps involving serious misconduct by an authority—it would be reasonable to require it to locate the information and make it available. Similar arrangements have been introduced into freedom of information legislation in other countries, such as Ireland and Australia, and have not caused any difficulty. I hope that this practical and prudential amendment will commend itself to the Under-Secretary.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> To some extent, we have discussed this matter. I am concerned that a public authority might have to scrutinise and respond to a vast amount of information. Although a public authority may hold information, it might not be kept in a way that is convenient or easy to put together. We heard how information on the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear code took more than 60 days to collate. It could cost authorities tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds to provide information and I appreciate that the amendment would, to some extent, deal with that issue.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was careful to accept that people may be able to abuse a right such as that proposed and that there would be limitations on its use. To some extent, however, the amendment would give an applicant the right to determine the work priorities of a public authority. It would be inappropriate to place such a right in the hands of all potential applicants. Although the amendment contains the proviso that it would not interfere with authorities' work, it would none the less give applicants scope to do just that. Officials could be diverted from their tasks, providing that somebody was prepared to rent them. That would be the amendment's effect: officials' time would be rented to applicants and they would be diverted from other tasks. Renting might be worthwhile for large companies that want a public authority to collate information. Such companies might see renting the time of officials as a good way of obtaining that information; indeed, I suspect that ordinary individuals would not wish to pay in excess of £500 for information. The amendment confers on the rich an ability to pay to obtain a right to information that would not be available to the poor. The amendment also represents the view that public authorities are unable to use discretion and to make a judgment on how they will deploy their time and on what is reasonable. I accept that some local authorities will need pressure to respond positively to requests and that some have been slow to respond positively in the past. We must, however, draw the line somewhere; we must have some trust that public authorities will behave reasonably. Arguably, they would be subject to existing provisions on judicial review if they did not do so.
<P>
The amendment therefore goes a little too far. Under the Bill, any disclosure by an authority that exceeds the appropriate limit would be discretionary. It is right for authorities to have discretion in such matters, so I invite the right hon. Gentleman to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am extremely reluctant to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, not least in the light of the Under-Secretary's reply, which was remarkably—and surprisingly, for him—unsympathetic. He is siding heavily with the interests of information holders and speaking too much about the inconvenience of meeting the public interest through disclosure. I do not understand his claim that the safeguards spelt out in proposed new subsection (1B) are not adequate to protect authorities from abuse of power by what can be called the consumer, as it contains a wide exemption. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Subsection (1A) does not oblige an authority to comply with a request where . . . to do so would interfere substantially and unreasonably with the work of an authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision is capable of invocation by an authority with the greatest of ease. If an authority were to be challenged in court, I do not doubt that factual information, deployed in support of exemption under the provision, would be looked on sympathetically. Failure to accept the amendment will seriously limit the operative effect of the Bill when disclosure of substantial numbers of documents is required in the public interest or in particular personal or commercial interests but is stopped by a cash consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says and I do not doubt his motives, but where would he draw the line on the extent to which a rich individual or corporation can divert a public authority's attention? We should remember that the limit refers to marginal costs and that the clause applies only when they exceed £500, in which case a public authority will be able to exercise discretion. However, the actual cost would be far in excess of £500.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am surprised that the Under-Secretary asks me to draw a line taking into account the means of the applicants paying for the information. Not more than five minutes ago, he was telling the Committee that the Government viewed the Bill as ``applicant blind''. If the Bill is to be applicant blind, surely it should not deal with the content of an applicant's pocket.
<P>
I adhere to the point that I was making. The amendment offers protection against unreasonable requests and prevents an applicant from dictating the order in which a Department, authority or other organisation does its work as his request cannot interfere unreasonably with such work. It therefore covers unjustifiable reordering of an authority's priorities. If an authority or Department was taken to court by a person or commercial body with a deep pocket, it could invoke the provision as a total protection from unreasonable behaviour. That is why I find it difficult to accept the Under-Secretary's argument. I do not have the ranks of Midian rushing to my defence, so I have little prospect of making much progress with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are not entirely out of sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman's point, but some hon. Members are anxious to make progress
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I understand that, but the issue is of considerable importance. I do not think that the hon. Member for Ryedale was denying that; perhaps he was doing me the honour of saying that he thought that I was making the case adequately. In the light of the Under-Secretary's remarks, I put down a firm marker of my belief that the issue should be reconsidered.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me make one important point. Clause 11 exempts authorities only from clause 1, not from clause 13, which must be taken into account whenever a public interest is at stake. If the public interest favours disclosure, an authority could still have to disclose the information under clause 13. The right hon. Gentleman's public interest point is, therefore, already dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for drawing our attention to that; I shall contemplate, with a towel around my head, whether his argument invalidates the purpose of my amendment. I doubt that it does, but with those few thoughts, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 6, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) An authority shall not refuse, under subsection (1), to comply with a request unless it has assisted, or offered to assist, the applicant to reformulate the request, so as not to exceed the appropriate limit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is reasonable if the Bill's purpose is to be user-friendly and to help applicants.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It may assist my hon. Friend in making his case if he knows that I like the principle but not the amendment, and that I think that we should deal with the matter in a code of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary says, but he equally knows the case against covering the matter in a code of practice because we have rehearsed it in Committee. The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the existing code of practice, which many members of the Committee will recognise has been constructive and useful in many ways. However, we wish to go beyond that code and to legislate for legal powers. The code, although well intentioned and useful, was not adequate.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's saying that something that he believes to be sensible should be covered by the code of practice does not meet my point, not least because we are coming up against the situation time and again. We came up against it during the debate on clause 1, when he resisted my amendment to introduce the phrase ``all reasonable steps''. There is force in saying that the questions mostly concern attitude and that they will be adequately dealt with by the code of practice, I have sympathy with that argument. However, there is a difference between saying that and making clear that the Bill puts a duty on authorities to be proactive and helpful. Otherwise, it could be used in what I could describe only as an aggressive, passive way. Authorities would know in what way they could meet the application but be determined not to do so unless required to do so.
<P>
Someone might submit an application for X information that would cost more than the limit to supply. The public body responding might know that providing parts of that information was very expensive, that providing other parts was not, and that the parts that were not expensive to provide might meet most of the applicant's needs. It would be reasonable for it to offer the less expensive parts as a possible partial, if not totally satisfactory, solution.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. An hon. Member is—was—within the precincts of the Committee. I remind hon. Members of the relevant rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Many of would wish that the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) were part of the Committee because he knows much about the subject and would have much to offer our consideration. I am sad that his involvement was so transitory.
<P>
In my example, there would be an ideal opportunity on grounds of cost for the Government to make it clear that there are duties on authorities to be more positive and to assist an applicant to get a request into order. Instead of being aggressively passive and defying an applicant to ask the right question, they should respond to the spirit of the application, not the literal wording. My hon. Friend should think about that. It would not weaken the Bill but, in relation to reasonable and fair requests for information, make it stronger.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment in principle, although I do not accept it as it stands. The appropriate place to deal with my hon. Friend's suggestion is in the code of practice. The amendment is too vague and would not be right in primary legislation. It would have almost as much impact and effect in a code of practice, where it could be set out at greater length. That would be the best place to define what is meant by words such as ``assisted'' and ``reformulate''. If we cram everything into the Bill, we will create a complicated and unwieldy piece of legislation which has too much verbiage and unnecessary stipulations. As such, it will not be properly enforced. Definitions can be provided in regulations and codes of practice, and by issuing guidance. That is how the Government, public sector and, indeed, parts of the private sector that are governed by laws operate.
<P>
The amendment is too vague. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce, but a code of practice that enshrines the principle would be useful. Although it is right that public authorities should be required to give assistance to applicants, it would be difficult to include that requirement in legislation. The correct way to achieve that is to include it in the Secretary of State's code of practice. Given that there is no difference between us, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his reply. There is a nice and reasonable debate to be had on the virtues of using a code of practice rather than primary legislation. He knows my views on that.
<P>
I find it slightly hard to accept that the amendment is vague; it could not be more simply worded or more concrete. There is nothing vague about it; my hon. Friend just disagrees that it should be in the Bill. The principle would not be hard to enforce. If a public authority does not offer to assist, which is a clear and measurable action, it would be at fault. I accept my hon. Friend's serious intent in pressing the code of practice, but I ask him to reconsider his reasons for that. Although he wants to resist the amendment, he is in sympathy with its spirit. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 6, line 38, at end insert `substantially similar'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 34, in page 6, line 40, leave out from `person' to end of line 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> If one person makes several requests to an authority, clause 11(4) allows it to refuse them when the total cost exceeds the appropriate limit. That will bar many users from taking advantage of the Bill. The amendment would allow requests to be aggregated in that way only if they refer to ``substantially similar'' information.
<P>
There are circumstances in which an organisation that deals with an authority on a range of issues will find all its requests aggregated for cost purposes with the intention of defeating the inquiry. That problem was considered when the legislation was formulated. The White Paper proposed that authorities should be able to refuse requests that would result in disproportionate costs and the diversion of public authority resources. It suggested another restriction to deal with multiple applications from the same source for related material. That approach was aimed at requesters who deliberately wrote a single, large request in multiple smaller requests to avoid a disproportionate cost. The Bill seems to have gone beyond that. It allows all requests from one user to be aggregated. The amendment returns to the Government's approach in the White Paper. It would allow costs to be aggregated only in relation to substantially similar requests from one applicant. The Government's first thought was better than their second.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 addresses a cognate but slightly different point. It would delete clause 11(4)(b) which allows requests that are made by different people to be aggregated for cost purposes if they appear to the public authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to be acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision will prevent organisations from advising their members to use their rights under the Bill. Trade unions might want to encourage members to find out more about safety at work in their industries by making applications on their workplace hazards. To use the Under-Secretary's example of the nuclear industry, the Health and Safety Executive could combine the costs of two or more requests and refuse them as soon as the aggregate cost limit was exceeded. If his remarks about the Bill being applicant blind are to be taken at face value, he will find the provision straightforward and easy to accept because it is not far from the Government's first thoughts. I urge him to consider the merits of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Given the most recent exchange between the right hon. Gentleman and myself, it would be remiss if I did not say that we have considerable sympathy with his argument. We have approached the matter from a slightly different perspective, which we will describe when we debate amendment No. 102.
<P>
There is concern that clause 11(4) could be used not so much to discourage as to prevent people from justifiably getting hold of information, and that it could prevent the release of information to several people who happen to make requests, whether they are acting in concert, independently or as part of a campaign—although, as the right hon. Gentleman said, they would have to be substantially similar to be caught. The fees and limits that apply should also be addressed. I hope that the Under-Secretary is persuaded of the validity of the amendments' objectives, with which the Opposition have some sympathy.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 33 would limit authorities' powers under the clause to aggregate the costs of different requests made by only one person to cases in which the requests are substantially similar. Amendment No. 34 would remove subsection (4)(b), which allows authorities to aggregate the cost of different applicants who appear to the authority to be acting in concert or as part of a campaign. The amendments are intended to prevent authorities from using the clause to avoid giving information to an organisation that deals with a particular Department on a range of issues, or to campaigns conducted by, say, trade union members.
<P>
Freedom of information legislation cannot, however, prevent authorities from carrying on their proper business. Clause 11 enables public authorities to carry on their business, which is often statutory and relates to the purpose for which they were set up, whether they are schools, doctors' surgeries or other types of organisation. We must be careful in achieving the right balance between the legitimate needs of campaigners and of citizens who want their public authorities to deliver.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and the hon. Member for Ryedale have put their cases in an eminently reasonable manner. However, I note that the clause is referred to in today's edition of The Guardian as ``dirty tricks''. The article in question suggests that it is part of a conspiracy. Much of it relies on hyperbole and journalistic licence, not to say journalistic windbaggery, and it is clearly wrong and misunderstands what is going on. I note also that the paper contains a letter from Lord Woolf, who, writing from the Royal Courts of Justice, refers to an article that appeared previously in The Guardian describing him as having made an attack on the Home Secretary. Lord Woolf wishes to make it clear that he did not do so and is anxious to query the way in which The Guardian reports such matters Of course, that is a subject for The Guardian, and all hon. Members would defend the freedom of the press.
<P>
Trade unionists and others conduct perfectly proper and legitimate campaigns that should be supported, and they should be able to use the freedom of information legislation in the way that it was intended. It should enable them to obtain the information that they request and to make reasonable, but not unreasonable, demands of public authorities. Amendment No. 33 would enable applicants to chop up into smaller portions a request that would be costly to deal with to frustrate the purpose of the clause. Amendment No. 34 would mean that authorities would have to respond to every request made as part of an organised campaign with the possibility of being prevented from carrying on their other business because of freedom of information legislation obligations.
<P>
Some campaigners might seek to use freedom of information legislation to obtain information. Others could seek to use the amendments to destroy the ability of a public authority to carry out its statutory duty by clogging it up with requests—we are perfectly aware that such activities could be organised. If we assumed that all applicants were genuine, there would be no objection to the amendments, but we must accept that applicants may decide to frustrate or disrupt an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.
