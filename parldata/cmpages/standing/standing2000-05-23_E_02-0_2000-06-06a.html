<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Effect of Forfeiture Orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 22, leave out `other disposal' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`disposal by other such means as the appropriate authority may specify in regulations'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment provides that the disposal of animals that are the subject of a forfeiture order must be carried out in an appropriate way. In the overwhelming majority of cases, disposal, particularly of mink, will be by means of destruction. Other means of disposal, such as farming for another purpose or the use of the animals for pets or for export, are not appropriate for mink.
<P>
As we have said on many occasions, the Bill is intended to cover all animals farmed primarily or solely for fur, not just mink. If other animals came within the provisions of the Bill, alternative means of disposal might be feasible. In such an event, the amendment would ensure that the only means of disposal appropriate for the species concerned were used.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley):</B> I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman makes. I argue that the amendment is unnecessary because the courts judge what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The hon. Gentleman and I do not disagree about disposal. There might be a number of methods of disposal that do not require destruction. Destruction might be necessary for mink, given the damage that they can cause if they escape, but chinchilla, for example, could be used as pets. It is for the courts to decide the most appropriate means of disposal, which might not require destruction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. Our amendment mentions ``the appropriate authority'', which in the context of the Bill is the Minister at the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It is important from an animal welfare point of view that the Bill is more clear-cut in the way in which it guides the court to make the appropriate disposal of animals subject to the forfeiture order. That is why we included the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the appropriate authority may specify in future regulations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995 deal with the disposal of mink and specify that they should be destroyed. The case of mink is clear-cut and the courts would take that into account. The Minister has failed to give the Committee an assurance that in all other cases the courts will be guided by existing regulations or legislation to prevent problems with the disposal of species that may be the subject of these orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I think that I can give those assurances. The court will have regard to existing animal welfare regulations and Acts of Parliament. They will not be overridden by the courts, so they will still apply. There is only a small difference between us on this issue. The hon. Gentleman said that it should be for the appropriate authority—a Minister or the National Assembly for Wales—to decide the most appropriate disposal method. I feel, however, that it would be best left to the discretion of the courts, which are best equipped to take into account the details of specific cases and particular incidents. I can nevertheless assure the hon. Gentleman that welfare and other regulations will continue to apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) any person appointed under subsection (a) above shall possess such qualifications or meet such criteria as the appropriate authority shall specify in regulations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendment No. 10, in Clause 4, page 3, line 7, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) No person shall be authorised by the appropriate authority under subsection (1) above unless he has previously been certified by the authority as competent for that purpose.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 1—Persons appointed: qualification—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—Persons authorised, appointed or ordered under sections 3 and 4 shall be veterinary officers of the State Veterinary Service.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendments and the new clause deal with the qualifications of the people employed to deal with matters under subsection (1)(a) and (b). Amendment No. 5 specifically requires the court to appoint a specially qualified person to enforce a forfeiture order. The Bill does not prescribe by whom the forfeiture order should be carried out. It is possible that a convicted fur farmer could be charged with the responsibility for the destruction or disposal of the animals under his care. It may be more likely, however, for responsibility to be given to a third party who is so charged because the court is unlikely to trust the farmer to carry out the order properly or fully.
<P>
In those circumstances, it is important that whoever is appointed by the court is suitably qualified in the welfare and handling of the particular species. Much play has been made—both on Second Reading and in our earlier proceedings—of the dangers posed to local wildlife by mink, if released or if they escape. Most people would agree that mink require experienced handling. It would not be desirable for the safety or welfare of the animals if an inexperienced person were given the job.
<P>
Amendment No. 10 would ensure that the persons authorised to enter premises where it is suspected that fur farming is being carried out are suitably qualified. It would prevent the authorisation of inappropriate persons—people unqualified in the handling of animals or representatives of animal pressure groups, for example—to enter premises for enforcement purposes.
<P>
The entry and enforcement powers in the Bill permit inspection for the gathering of evidence and the carrying out of a forfeiture order. They are wide powers, especially as the authorisation is general, so there is no requirement to make an application for authorisation in any particular case. There could be a significant invasion of privacy and it is proper that such powers should be available only to an appropriate person.
<P>
In the case of entry to carry out a forfeiture order, it is important that the authorised person is experienced in the handling of animals, both to protect their welfare and to prevent the risk of escape.
<P>
An appropriate person might be one of the Ministry's own vets from the state veterinary service, or someone licensed to operate on behalf of that service.
<P>
New clause 1 would ensure that only suitably qualified persons were given responsibility for entering premises for inspection purposes and for carrying out forfeiture orders. The same arguments as I have advanced for the other amendments apply to the new clause. The powers of entry and enforcement are wide-ranging and general and we want the courts to be mindful of the considerable powers that have been given to people. To avoid unnecessary escapes and problems for the animals involved, we seek an assurance that the courts will nominate qualified persons to do the jobs necessary under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I rise to make my first speech in this Committee, Mr. Sayeed, and I am pleased to do so under your chairmanship. I support my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). I can give the Committee some first-hand experience of the danger of the animals that we are discussing, as I might be one of the few people here who has been close to a mink—within a foot or so. They are extremely vicious animals and it is important that the people who enter the premises to carry out the forfeiture orders are properly trained and qualified.
<P>
As the Minister will recall only too well, when animal welfare people allowed mink to escape on the south coast to draw attention to their problems, Ministry staff were diverted from the valuable tuberculosis work that they were doing in the west country. I am sure that you would quickly rule me out of order, Mr. Sayeed, if I went too far down the TB route. However, I will say that TB is the biggest animal health and welfare problem that this country faces and that if people are taken off that project to deal with the Bill, the Minister should make other provisions.
<P>
Where does the Minister expect to find the qualified staff to deal with such dangerous animals? If he feels that the Ministry does not have sufficiently qualified people, how will he recruit qualified vets from outside? How many people does he expect to have to recruit, and how much will it cost? If the Committee is to consider the Bill properly, it needs to consider its finance, personnel and resource implications. It may be appropriate for the Minister to give us an idea of those implications under clause 3, as there is no separate clause to deal with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I absolutely agree with the points that have been made. The people appointed by the courts should be appropriate, confident and have the experience required for handling not only mink but other species. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) says, rightly, that when mink have escaped in the past—for all sorts of reasons and in different parts of the country—to an increasing extent we have had to divert MAEE staff to help to round them up. He is also correct in saying that, in the case to which he referred, some of those staff were our field staff diverted from our cattle TB programme. That is a drain on staff resources, a problem associated with fur farming and an issue that we need to take into account.
<P>
However, I can reassure the hon. Gentlemen on that point. There is no need for a narrow restriction such as that imposed by the new clause, which would allow only an SVS vet to carry out a forfeiture order. The task need not be limited to any group of persons. SVS staff may be used, but other staff have relevant experience. For example, staff in the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency are responsible for the current annual inspections, so they are familiar with fur farms, the animals and how to handle them. The Ministry contains a range of staff who could carry out the job. Incidentally, they are not the staff involved in the field work on TB.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The court could appoint someone else who has experience and is equally competent but is not part of the Ministry. In practice, the courts will appoint an appropriate and competent person to carry out the forfeiture order. I take the point made about experience, and I am sure that the courts will apply such a criterion. We consider that issue important.
<P>
As for amendment No. 10, I believe that it is unnecessary for the Minister to certify competence when authorisation is needed in writing, whether generally or in a particular case, because clause 4(1) already requires the appropriate authority to authorise competent persons. I can assure the Committee that the competent authorities, which are MAFF and the National Assembly for Wales, will appoint only people who are competent and have the skills and experience that have been outlined in the perfectly reasonable points made in debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I hope that the Minister will answer my specific points. How many people will need to be recruited or deployed from either his Ministry or outside, and what are the cost implications?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> As I said, there is no need to recruit anyone from outside, because we already have appropriate Ministry staff. Of course, they will be deployed only if individuals break the law. I hope that that will not happen, and I do not expect it to happen. However, in the unlikely event that somebody breaks the law, we already have the staff. There is no question of increasing the establishment strength.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am reassured by what the Minister says, particularly about the number of qualified staff that the Ministry has at its disposal to do this important work. However, I am still concerned about how the court will easily latch on to that expertise. The Bill simply says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the court makes a forfeiture order, it may in particular—
<P>
(a) appoint a person to carry out the order.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will the court interface with MAFF to ensure that it draws on that experience and brings in competent people to do the work? How will MAFF ensure that that pool of expertise is available?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am not a legal expert, but I know that in such situations the court will seek advice from qualified people. They might include staff from the Ministry, who could suggest guidelines and give their opinions on people that they regard as qualified to do the work. Of course, the court could seek advice from an independent vet, for example. The court can explore several avenues, including the Ministry, for gathering advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where the offender demonstrates that he is incapable of paying the required sum to the court, or keeping the animals himself, make suitable arrangements for the animals to be kept in a proper condition'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 7, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where the court orders an offender to make a payment in accordance with subsection (3)(c) above, it shall take into consideration the cost of keeping the animals concerned in compliance with such regulations regarding animal welfare as applied to fur farming prior to the coming into force of sections 1 to 4 of this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 8, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Notwithstanding any additional requirements imposed by the court under subsection 3(b), a person appointed to carry out a forfeiture order shall keep the animals concerned in compliance with such regulations regarding animal welfare as applied to fur farming prior to the coming into force of sections 1 to 4 of this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Amendment No. 6 would allow the court to make arrangements for animals to be kept properly pending their destruction or disposal, when the offender cannot pay for their upkeep. The amendment would close a possible loophole by providing for the animals to be kept safely, if the offender cannot afford to meet the costs of doing that. It is crucial that the legislation aimed at preventing unnecessary cruelty does not give rise to that by allowing a situation to arise in which there is no proper provision for the upkeep of animals that are the subject of a forfeiture order pending their destruction or disposal.
<P>
The provision is particularly important, given the likely length of time that the process from forfeiture order to final disposal will take. Considerable costs could be incurred in the proper upkeep of the animals during that period. An offender, who has been deprived of his livelihood, would often have difficulty meeting those costs. The amendment has been prompted primarily by our concern for animal welfare. It would ensure that in all circumstances the welfare of animals, particularly mink, was at the top of the agenda in the difficult period between the court making a forfeiture order and the final disposal of the animals.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would provide that when the court orders an offender to meet the costs of keeping animals pending their destruction—if the offender is not keeping the animals himself, for example—that payment should reflect the costs of compliance with appropriate welfare regulations. Again, the amendment would close a possible loophole: when an offender has to meet the costs to a third party of keeping the animals pending their destruction or disposal, they might not be kept in proper conditions to save expense.
<P>
It may be that existing animal welfare legislation would apply in all circumstances. In Committee on a similar private Member's Bill to prohibit fur farming, it was asked whether the existing legislation applied to animals during the forfeiture period. Having read the Hansard report of those Committee proceedings, I am not sure whether that was adequately addressed. The promoter of that Bill may have been seeking advice from the Government on that question. Perhaps this is an opportunity for the Minister to clarify that grey area, which has been the subject of previous debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 is designed to ensure that animals subject to a forfeiture order are kept in proper conditions pending their destruction or disposal. Clause 3 provides for the court to impose requirements for the keeping of animals pending their destruction or disposal, and it is clearly important that the appropriate welfare standards apply to the animals pending a decision on their fate. As I said, that could take some time, particularly as the clause also gives the offender the right of appeal. The amendment would help to ensure that clear provision existed in all circumstances for animal welfare considerations to be addressed. That is in line with the stated aim of the Bill—to prevent unnecessary cruelty and suffering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The concerns that have been expressed are important, but I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. Amendment No. 6 is covered by subsection (3)(b), which gives the court the power to impose requirements relating to the keeping of the animals. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are also covered, because the keeping of animals after a forfeiture order would still be the subject of animal welfare legislation that continued to be in force. The court would take that into account when determining the sum payable in relation to the standards that would apply for welfare and, if necessary, security. In a court case of that kind, a MAFF representative would be available in court to give advice about appropriate standards, welfare legislation and what needed to be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that existing animal welfare legislation would apply when animals were the subject of a forfeiture order. However, I am still puzzled about why he thinks that amendment No. 6 is covered by subsection (3)(b), which provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the court makes a forfeiture order, it may in particular . . .
<P>
(b) impose requirements on any person m relation to the keeping of the animals concerned pending their destruction or other disposal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the court imposed a requirement on the offender to look after the animals during the forfeiture period, but he said, ``I'm broke. There's nothing I can do,'' what could be done? If the offender could not meet the requirement, who would look after and pay for the animals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Under the Bill, if the offender was not able to pay for the animals' upkeep, the court would be empowered to have them humanely destroyed or placed wherever it considered appropriate, depending on species and circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Is the Minister saying that, if the court made an order and the offender appealed and was unable to keep the animals in the appropriate welfare conditions, the court would have the power instantly to arrange for the animals to be destroyed or disposed of?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> As I said, I am not a legal expert in these matters. That is my understanding, but if I am wrong I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman is informed. In some respects, the issue of court action is irrelevant. If the person concerned was not in a position to feed the animals and to look after them properly, something would need to be done to protect their welfare. The court has the relevant powers. It is possible that the animals would be placed with another person and the court's powers in relation to the standards set would apply to any person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will inform me if his understanding is not exactly correct. In rereading subsection (3)(b) I note that it refers to the imposition of requirements on ``any person'', so perhaps I was hasty in judging it to refer to the offender. The court might instead, appreciating that the offending farmer could not deal with the arrangements, decide that it was necessary to approach someone else. A cost would of course arise in that case, and it is not clear to me from the Bill who would pay. If the Minister does not know the answer now, perhaps he would write to me about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend and the Minister would like to consider that, at the stage of the proceedings that we have been discussing, the people concerned are quite a long way down the route of having to give up their livelihood. They will have kept their animals in contravention of the Bill, with the case going to court. A court order will have been made, against which they might appeal. They will almost certainly lose an appeal, given the circumstances of the case. Given all that, there would be great incentive simply to let the animals loose. I ask my hon. Friend and the Minister to give us some thoughts on the way in which a court would deal with the psychology of someone who might do that. The worst thing for the animals' welfare would be for them to be let loose in the wild, because people might try to kill them by whatever means. I hope that the Minister has given that matter some thought.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point that I had not thought of. The offender might be so incensed by the court's action that he sets free some of his animals as an act of defiance. I am not clear whether there is existing legislation that the courts could use against that offence of setting free mink. If other legislation could be used, why have we not had animal rights people in court for releasing mink? I do not know of such a case coming to the courts. A farmer might perversely release his mink or other animals as an act of defiance against the court. What would be likely to happen in such a situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The deliberate release of animals such as mink already constitutes an offence and the courts can take separate proceedings against anyone who does that. Anyone suspected of the offence will be prosecuted. I put it on the record that I utterly condemn the deliberate release of mink into the wild because of the enormous damage that that does. That act is wholly irresponsible.
<P>
The point relating to the cost of keeping the animals if the owner cannot is interesting. The Ministry currently finds itself in such a position with regard to other issues. The Committee might be interested to know that my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) is promoting a private Member's Bill—the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill—which would deal with that point. It would empower bodies approved by the Ministry to take over the care of animals, to raise money for animals' upkeep and to sell them. That point is important and the Ministry is supporting the closure of the loophole. However, the present issue is wider and relates not only to fur farming—it applies to people prosecuted for cruelty and to people who abandon animals. We are trying to resolve the issue.
<P>
If no one can take the animals, the court has the power to have them humanely destroyed. People might take animals such as chinchillas, perhaps for disposal through the pet trade. The result depends on the species and the circumstances. The court has the power to deal with the animals as it thinks most appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is interesting that the Minister seems to be admitting to a loophole in the existing law. He introduced to the discussion the private Member's Bill that is being considered. We welcome that useful Bill, of course. Is the Minister saying that, until that Bill is enacted, there will not be proper provision for ensuring that animals left in limbo are adequately taken care of by the courts and by others?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In the circumstances described by the Minister in relation to suspected maltreatment of other farm animals, the RSPCA would be involved. The situations that we are considering are serious. Animals would be being kept in contravention of the Bill, a forfeiture order would probably have been made and an appeal might have been lodged. We would be a long way down the litigation path. Does the Minister expect the RSPCA to be involved regularly to ensure that the animals are being kept properly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> That is a possibility, but it depends on circumstances. Mistreatment of animals is an offence that is dealt with in separate legislation. All animals are covered by the Protection of Animals Act 1911 as well as by various farm Acts. If such an offence has been committed, the RSPCA may become involved.
<P>
I do not want to confuse hon. Members about animal care. I have been giving examples of circumstances in which no one has power to take over the running of, say, a farm or zoo that has gone bankrupt. There is currently no power or authority to take such action in such cases, but that is not so in relation to the matters that we are discussing, with which the court has the power and authority to deal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In the light of the Minister's answers, and although we may table similar proposals on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any animal destroyed in pursuance of a forfeiture order made under this Act shall be destroyed in accordance with the requirements of such regulations concerning the slaughter or killing of animals of the relevant species as may be in force at that time.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to ensure that animals that are the subject of a court forfeiture order are destroyed in accordance with existing regulations. The clause contains no provision to ensure enforcement of the specific regulations that usually apply to the slaughter or killing of animals in accordance with their species. Mink farmers must currently abide by the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, which set out the three permitted methods of killing mink: lethal injection and inhalation of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. The amendment would clarify ambiguity about whether those regulations apply to mink that are subject to a forfeiture order and would help to ensure that clear provision addresses animal welfare considerations in all circumstances. We believe that that is in line with the Bill's stated aim, which is to prevent unnecessary cruelty and suffering.
<P>
Of course, the Bill deals with all animals that are kept for fur farming and not just with mink. Are those animals covered by existing legislation and do the 1995 regulations deal specifically with the destruction of other species that may fall within the Bill's ambit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman; the Bill contains no provision that exempts from existing legislation animals that are to be destroyed. He is right that slaughter is covered by the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, which implement EU directive 93/119/EC and make it a general offence to cause avoidable excitement, pain or suffering to any animal at the time of slaughter. They lay down specific requirements on permitted methods for killing mink and foxes for their fur, which will have to apply and from which it is not possible to exempt anyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We do not seek to introduce exemptions, but to tie into the Bill clear animal welfare conditions that are appropriate to each species. We have no qualms about the cover provided for mink, which is adequate. As the Bill is all-embracing and deals with all animals that are raised for fur, we want an assurance that any species within its ambit will be dealt with appropriately. Thought has been give to mink and fox, but has adequate thought been given to other species?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I repeat that the killing of any animal is covered by regulations. It must be done—this is especially true of commercial animals—with regard to the 1995 regulations. The Bill in no way undermines those, and they will stand and apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We now come to the meat of the Bill after, of course, clause 1, which dealt with the offence of keeping animals primarily for their fur. Clause 5 relates to compensation. As we said on Second Reading, there is every likelihood that the Bill will become law. The Government have a massive majority and are committed to it. Fur farmers believe that it is inevitable that their hitherto animal husbandry will be made illegal in this country. We are convinced that that will be challenged in a European dimension, which will complicate matters. The Bill will probably become law by the end of the year. Fur farmers desire an unequivocal statement from the Government on compensation. Although that has been promised, it has not been given the meat or substance that would make them comfortable. The amendments are an attempt to address their concerns.
<P>
Amendment No. 11 is simple. It would change the word ``may'' in clause 5(2) to ``shall''. That would give a stronger sign that the Government are serious and committed. ``May'' is conditional—they may do this or they may do that, depending on how they feel. ``Shall'' would make it clear that they are committed to introducing compensation schemes. The Bill should set out clearly the specifics of the compensation scheme to reassure fur farmers that the basis for the calculation of compensation payments will be transparent and reasonable.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 12 specifies the elements of fur farming for which compensation would be payable. That would reassure fur farmers that the basis for the calculation is transparent and takes into account all the critical aspects of their business.
<P>
Fur farmers are likely to incur major losses. First, it might take time to clear and recover land before it can be used for other purposes. Secondly, buildings and equipment for fur farming are specialised. It is generally accepted—as I am sure the Minister's Department will concur—that they cannot be converted to other uses. Thirdly, the livestock provide the income stream for mink farming businesses. The mink will have to be destroyed. There is no other use for them because they are reared only for the value of their fur. Fourthly, it would be difficult to transfer the goodwill that arises from trading with the industry and customers, both here and abroad, to a new business undertaking because fur farming is so specialised.
<P>
We are pleased that the Government have dropped from their Bill the statutory restriction that the private Member's Bill would have placed on the payment of compensation for loss of income. However, they have not given an assurance that loss of income will be reflected in the compensation scheme. It is our view and that of the National Farmers Union that it is imperative to build the key elements of the compensation scheme into the Bill to reassure the industry and make the Government's intentions clearcut.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 relates to the payment of legal fees for the cost of the advice that fur farmers need to receive. That cost should be reimbursed in the compensation scheme. A similar amendment was tabled when the private Member's Bill was debated in Committee. It was rejected—probably on the Government's advice—because it referred to ``advisers''. The promoter's side argued that that placed no limit on the number of people that fur farmers could consult, so creating a blank cheque. Therefore, amendment No. 15 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the payment of reasonable fees for professional advice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would rule out paying a list of advisers. To my knowledge, no other Government have introduced a Bill to ban a whole sector of farming, so the valuation of the businesses and the negotiation of compensation will be a novel process for all concerned.
<P>
It has been standard practice for many years for claimants under the land compensation code to be entitled to have their professional advisers' reasonable fees paid for by the acquiring authority. That rule would apply, for example, if the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions wanted to force a motorway through a mink farm, which was for that reason subject to a compulsory purchase order. Those circumstances are analogous with the Bill, which would impose a compulsory ban on fur farming. The effect would be the same in each case: the use of state compulsion to confiscate an individual's property, on grounds of wider public benefit, public morality or whatever the Government wanted to give as the main reason. The ban on fur farming is a unique occurrence. Fur farming is a specialist form of farming. It is essential for the farmers to have access to good professional advice in negotiating their compensation claims. The amendment would help to ensure that such professional advice was available to them.
<P>
Amendment No. 16 would provide for the cost of land clearance to be included in the compensation payment in appropriate cases. A similar amendment was tabled in Committee when the private Members' Bill was being considered. The Government then gave an assurance that as a general principle they would consider the cost of demolition in relation to a claim in particular cases. However, they entered a caveat, saying that it would not be unreasonable for claims to be considered on their individual merits rather than under blanket provision. We agree and our amendment conforms to that requirement. Nevertheless, no professional opinion is available to the effect that the specialised buildings and equipment associated with mink farms are capable of conversion to another type of farming or business use. On the contrary, a clear view is held that after a ban on fur farming the land would need to be cleared before being put to another use.
<P>
The amendment would provide that the costs of clearing the land could be paid under the compensation scheme. The estimated costs of clearing land in that way are, as the Minister knows, not insignificant. Clearing land to return it to a green-field site would cost in the region of £17,000 per hundred breeding females. For a 6,000-female farm the figure would be £100,000. Those are substantial sums of money. It would be wholly unreasonable not to include those costs in any compensation calculation as land clearance is a prerequisite of allowing the land to be used for any other type of farming or business.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 would provide for compensation to cover costs associated with winding up a fur-farming business. There is a general rule in compensation schemes—and the Minister will no doubt make play of it—that claimants should mitigate their losses where possible. Nevertheless, the cost of the losses associated with the winding up of a business can be wide-ranging and significant. It is right therefore that that should be reflected in the compensation arrangements.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 would provide for compensation to be payable for forced sales of capital such as property, land or equipment. If a farm had to terminate a contract prematurely—one covering its lease of land, perhaps—the costs of that withdrawal would be covered. The leasing of buildings and equipment is subject to time scales. There is always a cost when people wish to terminate such leases in advance of the appropriate date. There might be contracts for the cleaning of buildings or equipment. The fur farmer might have to pay compensation to cover contracts that he or she had entered into. There might be redundancy payments. Employees will no longer be needed because the farmer will, if he can, make his livelihood in some other way.
<P>
Winding up fur farms is likely to take time, given the problems to which we have alluded. There seems to be no way in which fur farmers could keep on labour. If a fur farmer still has a relationship with former workers, he might seek to re-employ them at a remove once the fur farm has been shut down, the land cleared and the buildings demolished and he has moved to another form of farming There will be a case for redundancy payments in the immediate future. Other reasonable disturbance costs associated with the termination of the way of working and of the livelihood would also be covered.
<P>
The amendments should be made to give the necessary reassurance to fur farmers. That would make the provisions clear-cut and transparent. Everybody would know where they stood in relation to the Government's promises that fair, reasonable and adequate compensation would be payable.
<P>
A central plank of the proponents' argument from the outset of the proceedings of, first, the private Member's Bill and latterly the Government's Bill has been that compensation would be payable. It has been argued that it would be better for fur farming to cease and for the farmers to come out of the business rather than for stringent animal welfare regulations to be set. It has been said that the farmers would be unable to meet those regulations and would go out of business without compensation.
<P>
We are told that the issue is about public morality. An important ingredient of the proponents' moral argument, which they have used on many occasions, is that compensation has to be clear-cut and transparent. We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about this group of amendments and the next, both of which are extremely reasonable. They set the case clearly and unequivocally. We expect the Minister to deliver on them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In my haste to speak on the earlier clause I perhaps forgot to declare, as is stated in the Register of Members' Interests, that I am a farmer, although I have no interest in fur farming. I am also a chartered surveyor and so have had experience of making claims on statutory and compulsory purchase schemes.
<P>
I would like to reinforce one or two of the comments made so reasonably and comprehensively by my hon Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. The arbitrator—when he is appointed—will consider carefully some aspects of this debate, in which we are probing the Government's intentions. In accordance with the rules established by Pepper v. Hart, the Minister's reply will be scrutinised carefully.
<P>
Amendment No. 11 seems small and insignificant when one first looks at it, as it seeks merely to substitute the word ``shall'' for ``may''. It is, however, highly significant. Clause 5(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A scheme may, in particular,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then lists items that it can take into account. I am no lawyer, but I believe that the phrase ``in particular'' should enable an arbitrator to take into account nothing except that which is prescribed in the Bill. In the interests of fairness, the state should be generous in its compensation, as it is the party that requires people to give up their businesses. I hope that the Minister will reply in the spirit of that principle. I am sure that the European Court will take the same view if the matter ever comes before it. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, which, like the other amendments, deals with a significant aspect of the legislation.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 12, it seems to me that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has raised an important point about goodwill, which can cover a number of issues. An established business may be worth more as a whole than its constituent parts. A valuer, working under the Lands Tribunal, will need to consider that. Will the Minister assure us that goodwill is to be included in the compensation? Will he also comment on future income stream? A well-established and successful business that is making profits each year and which has good contracts and good customers will have an expected income stream that covers a number of years. A valuer would usually take such income into account.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 15 and 17 deal respectively with fees and expenses. Considerable fees can be amassed while building up a claim. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire pointed out, it is up to the claimant to minimise the claim to a reasonable level. The arbitrator would certainly take that view, and of course unreasonable fees would not be considered. I have been involved in the preparation of cases for the Lands Tribunal, so I know that building up a claim is an expensive and time-consuming business. All sorts of records and professional and specialist reports might have to be obtained and paid for. That is why the Bill should provide for professional fees and for the arbitrator's costs—a matter that might overlap with amendments to be considered later. The arbitrator will undoubtedly take those costs into account when he is making the award at the end of his case.
<P>
On amendment No. 16, I believe that, in equity, the person who is put out of business should be left as if he had no business at all and as if his land had been properly cleared. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has given some interesting figures regarding the cost of clearing land. I know nothing about specialist mink farming, so I was shocked to learn that the cost of clearing land—presumably even on a fairly small mink farm—could be as much as £100,000. That is just one aspect of the claim, so one can begin to get an idea of what its total value might be. The claimant should be in exactly the same position after the claim is awarded, with cleared land, as before the claim was made.
<P>
Finally, I shall deal with expenses in slightly more detail. My hon. Friend referred to a number of expenses, and amendment No. 17 mentions premature termination of contract. However, all sorts of expenses might arise, which one might or might not have envisaged. The Minister should make it clear what expenses he would expect would be allowed.
<P>
The claims will be substantial. The state should be generous in meeting them and what the Minister says today will suggest whether he thinks so too. That will send a strong signal to the arbitrator in making judgments about awards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I want to make four quick points. First, I am keen to understand whether the Minister accepts the principle that when the state removes someone's livelihood—an action that in this instance I support—it is a matter of natural justice that that person should not be financially disadvantaged as a consequence. Secondly, if he intends that the costs or losses ensuing from the decision to remove a person's livelihood should be met, why does the Bill use the word ``may'' instead of ``shall'' in specifying the scope of the scheme? The Minister has said throughout that he intends fair compensation to be paid. As a relative novice in the House I fail to understand why that is not specified in the Bill. The word ``may'' could be interpreted differently once the Bill was passed.
<P>
Thirdly, have the Minister or his officials quantified the compensation that is likely to be paid as a result of the Bill? Is there a rough estimate of that in total and per fur farmer? Lastly, as this is the first instance of the banning of an aspect of farming, and as an important principle is being established—which, admittedly, I go along with—is a precedent being set for future measures? I am thinking particularly of moves, which I support, to ban hunting. Would a precedent be set whereby, for example, hunt kennels would be compensated? It is important to understand the Government's thinking on those important issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I want to comment in particular on amendments Nos. 13, 14, 15 and 16.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are being debated separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Sayeed. I should have noticed that. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 reflect amendments that I tabled last year, to which the Minister responded quite positively. Amendment No. 15 reflects amendment No. 24 to last year's Bill, which dealt with professional fees. The Minister stated at that time that the Government were prepared to consider professional fees. He gave a positive response on the general principle, although of course he quarrelled with the particular, but that has now been fine-tuned.
<P>
The same goes for amendment No. 16. It reflects amendment No. 27 to the private Member's Bill and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has already pointed out that last year the Minister accepted the general principle of compensation for the cost of clearing land. After the fine-tuning of the amendments and in the light of what the Minister said last year, we hope very much for a positive response now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): The clause takes us right back to 1215 and the arbitrary right of the state to deprive someone of property or income, and the people's requirement that the person concerned should be compensated. We have had most interesting debates revealing a fascinating inability of either side to see the point of view of the other on the principle of the Bill. Now, however, we are dealing with a fundamental principle. A Government should not be allowed to close down an activity without compensating in full for the loss of every aspect of that business.
<P>
I hope that the Minister has discussed that with his Treasury colleagues. They could receive a substantial bill. In Austria, the only other country that has implemented this policy, the Government compensated farmers to the tune of £400 per breeding female. There were 160,000 farmed mink in the United Kingdom in 1999. If our farmers receive the same compensation, the Government will face a bill of £64 million. Given that sum, it is extraordinary that there is only one, slightly flippant, reference to the actual cost of compensation. Paragraph 26 on page 5 of the explanatory notes states that the cost of compensation for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the current thirteen mink farms could, in respect of assets, be up to £400,000 and perhaps four times that amount if income were to be compensated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is of the highest importance that we set a precedent for the future. Subsequent Governments might close down other activities on moral grounds. Amendment No. 11 is fundamental. We must change ``may'' to ``shall''.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): The comments by Conservative Members cast doubt on whether there will be a compensation scheme. If the hon. Gentleman read the clause, he would see that there is to be a scheme. The word ``may'' refers only to its contents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is exactly the problem. Compensation must not be just for capital and stock, but for income, goodwill and add-on costs. It is not good enough to leave the Bill so vague. We are setting an extraordinary precedent that goes back to 1215. The state is closing down an activity that generates an income. The Government must state in the Bill that they are bound to compensate, in the fullest manner, all aspects of that business.
<P>
To return to my example, farmers in Austria received £400 a head for a female mink. The same payment here would generate a bill of £64 million. Other figures that I have prised out back that up. A Danish company valued one farmer's plant and assets on a replacement basis at £2.6 million. That makes a joke of the sums in the explanatory notes.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the cost of clearing a farm. I was told that it would cost £100,000 to remove sheds and clear a site. If sheds are not cleared, the farm owner will have to pay rates. The Minister should pay attention to that. Rates on redundant farms could constitute a significant sum. Amendment No. 11 is fundamental. It is an absolute must that we change ``may'' to ``shall''.
<P>
I touched on the value of the land and buildings, and mentioned the figure of £2.6 million. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold mentioned goodwill. Some people have built up international reputations: one farmer sells his fur under the brand name Blue Iris. There is real value to that. It has taken years to build up the business and it is legitimate for amendment No. 12 to include goodwill, because a lifetime's work cannot be thrown away at the whim of the state.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold referred to expenses. He has far more experience than I of working out the costs of closure. Closing down the farms will be complicated. It will involve a lot of work and much doubt at a time when no income is coming in. We are creating an extraordinary precedent for the future and the Government must make it clear that the costs will be borne.
<P>
The greatest doubt that arises from the Bill results from its failure to mention income. It is critical to state clearly that income qualifies for compensation. The NFU wrote to me and stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the income stream from breeding of mink or fur provided the farmers with their main return from running the businesses it is crucial that the Government gives an assurance that the compensation will include losses of income.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I concur with the earlier comments of my hon. Friends and support amendments Nos. 11, 12, 15 and l7.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The Bill is an enabling Bill in relation to the compensation scheme. If enacted, it will give powers to set up the scheme. There must then be consultation with the people affected and issues will be raised.
<P>
I want to help the Committee. I shall try to deal with some of the points raised and say what the Government would consider to be reasonable and legitimate within the consultation that is part of the scheme. There are precedents for closing down sectors. I have been in farming for a long time. As hon. Members who were around at the time will know, under the previous Government, the head deboning industry was closed down, as it was associated with BSE. Not a penny was paid in compensation to that industry. It was wiped out overnight and many people lost their jobs. It does not automatically follow that if legislation is passed to close down a sector, compensation has to be paid. Previous Governments, as they were entitled to do, used that fact to pay no compensation to the head deboning sector when it was closed down.
<P>
The Government have made it clear that there is a moral issue in relation to the people who will be affected. Some hon. Gentlemen, who are not in the Committee at present, argued that the way to deal with the matter was to apply standards that were so comprehensive, sophisticated and expensive that people would go out of business by being bankrupt. Legitimately, any Government have the right to apply standards that they think are appropriate and justified to any sector, industry or rearing method. We felt, however, that that would not treat people fairly and would force them into bankruptcy, and that there is a case for compensation. That covels the point made by the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker). The Government accept the principle of compensation and intend to provide it.
<P>
Cost estimates are to be found in the explanatory notes and are based on the professional advice that I received. They will be part of the consultation process in putting together the scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) has an obsession with what other countries do. Our decision should be based on what is appropriate for the United Kingdom. I do not seek to interfere in whether other countries have fur farming: it is a matter for those countries' electorates. On the other side of the coin, I do not appreciate it when other countries poke their noses into what we decide for our own people. We are trying to deal with the matter fairly.
<P>
Opposition Members misunderstand the terminology of clause 5 in respect of ``may'' instead of ``shall''. I understand their point and I am not entirely unsympathetic, but the wording was designed by parliamentary draftsmen and ``may'' is intended to provide flexibility in the application of the clause. Consultation about the scheme must be taken into account and other aspects of compensation—not included in this empowering Bill—may need to be included in the final scheme. Ironically, the danger of changing the wording to ``shall'' is that it may make the Bill more restrictive and deprive it of the necessary flexibility. I reassure Opposition Members that ``may'' is not intended to provide a weaselly escape clause. It is terminology commonly used to allow flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does the Minister accept that as the Bill stands, an arbitrator who sought to widen the terms, as in our amendments, would be ruled ultra vires? He would be widening the terms of compensation, which would mean using more taxpayers' money. That cannot be done without statutory approval. If the Minister will not accept our amendment now, will he accept on Report an amendment to strike out the words ``in particular'', which would be a move towards our present amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</b> I am trying not to be dogmatic, but using terminology in the way proposed by the amendment can be restrictive. I return to the point that the Bill confers enabling powers. The scheme for compensation is not built into the Bill, but is part of the consultation. It will be made by a statutory instrument, which will be laid before Parliament. The statutory instrument will provide the powers for compensation, but it cannot be drafted until the Bill is passed.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> May I try again? I understand that no Government moneys can be granted for any purpose unless granted by statute and properly put through this House. If the terms are not laid down in the Bill, no arbitrator has the power to widen them. Unless the Minister accepts some of our points, an arbitrator will be unable to take them into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> My understanding is that the arbitrator will apply the scheme as made. The hon. Gentleman is incorrect about the restrictiveness of the scheme, though I am certainly prepared to give further thought to the matter. There is, as I said, an unintentional danger of making the scheme more restrictive. I strongly believe in flexibility. Consultation can take into account the points that have been made so far.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 deals with compensation for buildings, equipment and livestock. They are perfectly reasonable aspects of the compensation scheme to consider, especially when they cannot be used for other purposes. Amendment No. 15 deals with professional fees—
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We are grateful for the Minister's clarification on land and livestock. He did not say buildings and equipment and he certainly did not mention goodwill, which is also part of amendment No. 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am working my way through in a linear way and I shall come to all the points that have been made. In any kind of scheme, it is reasonable to include buildings, equipment and livestock. [Interruption.] I shall come to that in a moment—the hon. Member for Cotswold is getting very excited.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 deals with the professional fees for setting up the scheme. During the passage of the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) I said that it was acceptable to the Government to include reasonable fees, and I repeat that now. Again, I should have no objection to that being part of the consultation about the formulation of the scheme.
<P>
That brings us to amendments Nos. 16 and 17, which deal with clearing of land, good will and disturbance costs such as redundancy payments. There might be an argument for meeting the cost of clearing land and, again, I am willing to consult on that. However, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire is not right when he says that there is never an alternative use for the buildings. That depends on the design. There are examples of fur farms that have switched to alternative production, for which they have used the existing buildings, but we shall consider each case on its merits. In some cases that may not be possible, but in others it may.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We know of one case where some buildings were turned over to growing strawberries, but we know of no others where an alternative use has been found. Will the Minister tell the Committee about any other examples?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Growing strawberries was the example that I had in mind, probably because we both heard about it in the same Committee. There may well be other cases, but at present I do not know of them. As I say, the issue of clearing land can be considered during our consultation on the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I want to probe this further. I agree with the Minister that there is one example of alternative use—that of switching to strawberry growing. He has not told the Committee of any others and yet in his initial statement he said that I was wrong and that there were plenty of other uses to which this land and these buildings could be put. We should like to know what they are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is self-evidently wrong. He said that there was no other use for the buildings; we know of at least one example and there may well be others although, as I said, I do not know of any at the moment. However, this is an illustration of the difficulty of being too prescriptive in the Bill at this stage, because the compensation scheme will differ according to the circumstances of each farmer. This is an enabling Bill and the scheme will be set up after consultation, taking into account points that are raised. It will then be empowered by statutory instrument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</b> This would normally be tested by an arbitrator or someone else saying ``Yes, there is an alternative use''. The claimant would say, ``No, there is no alternative use''. The farm would then be put on the market and if no buyers were found after a reasonable period, it would be deemed that there was no alternative use. Would the Minister consider that that would be a sensible mechanism to resolve such a question?<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</b> I am aware that there are different ways of resolving such issues and, like the individuals concerned, I shall rely on professional advice. We shall discuss later the various mechanisms for appeals and arbitration, should there be disagreement on a particular point.<P>
<P>
Goodwill is a difficult issue because it is hard to define and value. I can see many potential problems there. It will be considered as part of the consultation process, but I would not want to mislead the Committee by saying that it will be easy to get to grips with. Dealing with any compensation scheme is difficult.
<P>
I remind hon. Members that the Bill provides for a phase-out period to 2003, which is intended to allow businesses to deal with issues such as redundancy payments. A phased winding down of a business can take place, so that those people who must find alternative employment or alternative businesses have plenty of notice. However, that does not rule out those businesses that want to close down before the 2003 deadline.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> On that last point, I can see the merit of extending the work-out period to 2003—clause 7 specifies 1 January 2003—to allow reasonable time for the industry to be dismantled. However, I take exception to the Minister's point that it is easy enough for people who are running down their businesses to continue paying employees. Those employees will not have a great deal to do, even if there is a period when mink can still be sold for their fur to provide an income stream. In any case, I doubt that that will happen, because the guillotine will fall and presumably a farmer's normal trading will cease after that period.
<P>
In a work-out period, there is a decreasing income stream, which will put pressure on those small businesses to keep funding their employees. That is not as easy as the Minister makes out. It is more likely that farmers will cut and run, because it is basically impossible to keep a business going on a diminishing income stream, as the Minister should know.
<P>
I understand the Minister's arguments about the use of the word ``may'' in the context of enabling legislation, because I have been down the same road on many occasions. However, I am reflecting the concerns of not only my colleagues, but fur farmers, of whom I think that there are just 11. At this stage, they are not confident that the Government will deliver, not only on the spirit of their pledges about compensation, but in real monetary terms that reflect the values of the businesses. Changing the word ``may'' to ``shall'' would strengthen the clause. After all, the word ``shall'' is used, in italics, in subsection (1):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The appropriate authority—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when that is the Minister—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall by order make a scheme for the making of payments.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, when the scheme is discussed in subsection (2), the word ``may'' is used instead of ``shall''. I accept part of the argument that that allows flexibility, but it might enable the Government to get off the hook. Fur farmers are apprehensive and worried that the clause is worded in such a way that it gives the Government room for manoeuvre, for ducking and diving and getting away with paying the minimum.
<P>
Figures have already been mentioned in the explanatory notes. Paragraph 26, which deals with the financial effects of the Bill, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is estimated that the cost of compensation under the Bill for the current thirteen mink farmers could, in respect of assets, be up to £400,000 and perhaps four times that amount if income were to be compensated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are setting out their stall at the outset. Despite the consultation that is offered in the clause, they set it out by saying, ``We think it is between £400,000 and £1.6 million''.
<P>
On the compensation figure of £400 per breeding female, my hon. Friend for North Shropshire was a little optimistic about the number of mink that are being farmed in Britain: there are about 25,000 breeding females. Four hundred pounds per head for 25,000 comes to £10 million of compensation. If the Austrian model is to be copied—although we do not have to follow the Austrians—there must be a sensible guideline that arrives at £400 per breeding female. The figures in the explanatory notes are five times lower than the sum that the industry has every right to expect.
<P>
We have attempted to beef up clause 5 to ensure that all the matters that should legitimately be considered for compensation are stated in the Bill. If the order ``may'' include them, there is no guarantee that fur farmers will receive the compensation to which they think they are entitled and that Opposition members of the Committee consider is fair and reasonable. The draft legislation to set up a statutory instrument that ``may'' include such matters in consultation with the industry may not satisfy farmers' requirements—nor ours, given the Minister's responses so far.
<P>
The Minister must explain to us and to the farmers why the explanatory notes show that his Department envisages no more than £1.6 million in compensation. If assets count for no more than £400,000, it is a joke as the industry knows as well as we do. It is up to the Minister to tell the Committee why he does not think that it is a joke. The figures are wildly out of kilter with reality. The purpose of the amendments is to make sure that the critical ingredients of any compensation valuation are there for all to see. At present, they are not, but they ``may''' be taken into account. Is that good enough? I think not.
<P>
Most businesses are valued for sale on the open market in a free market on the basis of their income stream. As said on Second Reading—and I repeat now—if the Government wrote into the Bill a provision that the compensation that would be payable to fur farmers would be based on a notional market value in the European Union of a legitimate exercise—namely, fur farming—a Danish fur farmer buying the farm would pay for a going concern. That is the real value of the business, not nit-picking matters, such as costs going on fees. The real value to the fur farmer is what he could sell his business for on an open market in a free market within the European Union under European law.
<P>
The present practice is not illegal under European law and will continue across the North sea. The Government are seeking to change something fundamental and to criminalise an activity that is legal elsewhere in the European Community and is subject to European law: there is strong legislation controlling the production of fur from animals such as mink.
<P>
The amendments seek commitments from the Government that the statutory instruments—which clause 5(1) states ``shall'' be made—contain clear-cut evidence that the various ingredients will be taken into account. The Government could easily rewrite clause 5. It would satisfy us if it said that a notional value would be taken of what a farm would fetch on the open market with a willing buyer and seller. That valuation would take into account the value of the land, buildings, the income stream, the number of breeding females and so on. That is the real value of the business and, in relation to the Austrian figures, it is closer to reality than the pathetic £400,000 to £1.6 million that the Government have put in writing as on offer.
<P>
I presume that the Minister has been to the Treasury people and gained clearance for the expenditure. They will not be happy if expenditure exceeds £1.6 million: in fact, they will say no, because £1.6 million is the limit. They will say that the sum is that which been negotiated, agreed, included in the explanatory notes, and not a penny more. These people attending our debate probably wondered where that figure came from.
<P>
If consultation with fur farming people, which we agree is important and should be built into the Bill, takes place on the basis of an upper ceiling of £1.6 million—a wholly inadequate sum in view of the real value of their businesses—the whole idea of compensation becomes a joke. The Minister must explain specifically why, in the context of an open and transparent commitment to compensation, our amendments are inappropriate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister has sought to be helpful this morning. However, it will be picked up in another place that unless our amendment to subsection (2)—and especially the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A scheme may, in particular—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is accepted, the Bill is flawed. It is a fundamental principle of Parliament that nobody can grant taxpayers' money unless properly passed in statute. Unless the Minister amplifies what is said in statute, so it can be taken under the terms of Pepper v. Hart, or it is built expressly into the Bill, there is no way that an arbitrator, court or anyone else can widen the terms of the scheme.
<P>
It is a fundamental principle that if the state is to deprive a person of a business, he must be fully compensated. The Minister prayed in aid the case of the head boners. The Minister will know that when I was parliamentary private secretary to a previous Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, we were roundly criticised—quite rightly—for not compensating head boners. If a legal business is taken away from someone, the state must—irrespective of whether it likes that business—fully compensate for it.
<P>
The Minister has not acceded to the principle of goodwill being valued, so if I were a fur farmer I would be incredibly worried after this morning's proceedings. I would say that my livelihood is being taken away, yet the state will not compensate for all the future income that I will lose. Anyone involved in business, as I have been, knows full well that it takes time to build up a business. Gaining a full income stream does not happen on day one, year one or year two: it can take several years. Chopping off a business and paying no future income stream compensation is wrong. If the Minister will not accede to that principle, cases may end up in the European court, which will order proper compensation.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can say something more this morning about goodwill, and that he will agree at least to consider including in the consultation process the question of whether future income stream should be compensated for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The Minister said that he intends to produce a fair compensation scheme. I am sure that that is his intention. As he mentioned, it is legally possible for him to pay no compensation. That would be extraordinary, but it is compatible with the legal position. Some elements, both in Committee and elsewhere, believe that the compensation scheme will be unfair. When does he intend to publish the draft compensation scheme? I understand that it must follow the enabling legislation, but a draft compensation scheme made available before Report stage might deal with some of the fears that abound.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Like my hon. Friends, I found the Minister's reply most unsatisfactory. I gave some practical examples, but the Minister apparently thinks that it is not in order to mention cases from outside the country, because fur farming is a domestic matter, to be decided locally. All I cited was an instance in which a Danish company had valued a running business. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, we should take the value of the whole business as a going concern, not just the fiddly bits to which the amendments relate. The figure of £2.6 million was relevant, as it was a bid from a company currently involved in fur farming.
<P>
The Minister did not adequately consider the value of good will. It takes 40 years to build up a business, to acquire a reputation and to establish and market a product. Compensation must recognise that genuine value. The Bill does not refer to income, which omission worries the NFU, a non-party political organisation. Worse, the explanatory notes make it clear that although the battle with the Treasury has not yet started, the Ministry is already lying down.
<P>
Paragraph 26 of the notes says that compensation will be £400,000 for assets, and may be up to four times that if income is included. That is not definite. It is clear that the Minister has not decided whether to include income in the scheme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said, unless the Bill clearly details what compensation will be given for, a Treasury Minister will be able to say, ``Sorry, boys. You should have cleared this up before the Bill got on the statute book. We are not bound by law to compensate for those matters unless they are specified''. If I were a fur farmer, I would be even more alarmed by the explanatory notes in the light of the Minister's comments. I would be grateful if he told us what discussions he has had with the Treasury about any ceiling on compensation. Has he discussed income and asset compensation?
<P>
Deliberately, the Bill has been extraordinarily loosely drafted. I am not a lawyer and I have not been involved in drafting a Bill, unlike the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, but I would be happier if the word ``shall'' were used. The Bill should make the scheme mandatory and clarify how compensation is calculated. Otherwise, a junior Treasury Minister will stamp on the scheme, and farmers will receive poor compensation.
<P>
Substantial sums are involved. I gave the figure of 160,000 as the number of farmed mink in 1999. I do not know the exact figure for breeding females, but at £400 an animal, the sum involved is a country mile from the laughably low numbers mentioned in the explanatory notes, and the Treasury will run a mile when presented with such figures.
<P>
Ideally, the Minister should accept the amendments, but given my doubts about that, it is vital for him to give us clear details about his discussions on compensation with the Treasury. I will throw another figure at him. I talked to a farmer who said that he would lose £1 million in income during the next five years, from just one farm. Sadly, there is a huge gulf between what the Bill says, which the vague explanatory notes confirm, and the facts that the Minister will face in discussion. It is worth touching on what my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said. Unless the compensation scheme is fair, the Minister will end up in the European court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I must come back to the point that I stressed: this is an enabling Bill. It gives the powers for the scheme. The detail of the scheme will be in the consultation and the statutory instruments. It is perfectly reasonable for hon. Members to ask what would be acceptable as part of a compensation scheme. I have tried to answer their questions. Aspects of the amendments are perfectly reasonable, and I would expect to see them in a compensation scheme. Other aspects, such as goodwill, are difficult. It is notoriously difficult to value goodwill, as I know from constituency casework. One must be extremely cautious about it, but nevertheless all those points can be considered as part of the consultation and I shall expand on that in a moment.
<P>
I take exception to the claim that the Government are ducking and diving. I have been straight about compensation during the discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for Garston about her Bill. Although it was her Bill, the Government would have had to find the compensation. I gave commitments in Committee about compensation. This is now a new Bill. I was under no obligation to keep to those commitments, but I have kept to them. We intend to do everything that we said we would do in relation to that Bill.
<P>
On the question whether it should be ``may'' or ``shall'', Opposition Members are in danger of being more restrictive than they intend. I am prepared to give the matter further thought; I do not have hang-ups about those words. My concern is to have flexibility and to take into account aspects of compensation that may arise during the consultation. I give that undertaking to the Committee.
<P>
I have to rely on my professional advisers for the estimated costs in the Bill. There are accepted ways of valuing businesses, as the hon. Member for Cotswold will know. The business will be valued according to those principles. The figures I have are estimates. They are cleared by the Treasury. It is not an absolute ceiling. It would be wrong to believe that there is no possibility of going over the figure in the Bill, although I must emphasise that I have a duty in relation to public funds. There are established methods for Governments to assess compensation in these circumstances, and I expect that they will be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I realise that the Minister is trying to be helpful. Could I press him once more and ask him whether, during the consultation, he will at least consider compensating for future incomes? That is an important aspect of compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Yes, the Bill allows compensation for income. My hon. Friend's Bill specifically ruled that out. During the discussion that we had in that Committee—because, as I said, the Government must pay in the end—I accepted that there would be an amendment that did not bar the consideration of income. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the provision of compensation for income will certainly be considered in the compensation scheme. The Bill makes provision for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> This issue is fundamental. None of us disputes that all the matters we are discussing—income, buildings, capital and costs—are allowed under the Bill as it stands. We do not doubt that. However, we fear that they will not be calculated when it comes to the crunch. That is why we want to insert the word ``shall''. As the Minister said, this is an enabling clause. It is broadly drafted and could take in all the matters that worry us. Is it the Government's policy to include those matters? That is where income is vital. The Government's explanatory notes show that income is still an option. The words ``perhaps'', ``if'' and ``were'' are not definite. The Government have an option of including income when they consider losses under subsection (2)(a). We do not doubt—

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is this an intervention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a somewhat long one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Is it the Government's firm policy to use the clause to compensate for income?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The purpose of making this provision available is so that it can be included in the compensation. It is not general practice, particularly in an enabling Bill, to specify every dot and comma at this stage. That is not the role for the Bill. That is the role for the scheme after proper consultation with those affected. The statutory instrument will then be formulated.
<P>
Obviously the scheme will have to be prepared, to answer the point raised by the hon. Member for Lewes. It will take some months to prepare the scheme and we cannot start until we have the necessary powers. The Bill gives us those powers. Once that starts, with the agreement of industry, we propose to send professional valuers to value the assets and the incomes. That assessment will inform decisions about the details of the scheme. The scheme will then be drawn up and it will go out to public consultation.
<P>
Professional valuers will assess every farm. We will examine the points about valuation and income so that we have proper figures to go on. We cannot go on claims that are made in Committee or newspapers: people will always make such claims. The task must be done properly and professionally. We will do that, and all these points will be taken into account. That will give us some costs, which will be part of the consultation. If people feel that the professional valuations have not been done properly they can challenge that during the consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> May I take the Minister back to a comment that he made a little while ago in answer to the hon. Member for Lewes, who asked whether some preparatory work could be done? I take his point that until the Bill is enacted, consultation cannot take place. Has any discussion taken place with his officials and the fur farmers, either as individuals or as an association, about the basis on which compensation will be calculated? Has there been any contact or have the figures in the explanatory notes been conjured up by his officials?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The figures in the explanatory notes come from our professional advisers. It would be wrong to use the phrase ``conjured up''. They represent values such as the compensation scheme would cover. That can be examined in more detail as part of the consultation. The hon. Gentleman seems to be asking for consultation before we have the powers to carry that out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not ask for consultation. I simply asked whether there had been any contact between the Minister's officials and representatives of the fur farming industry to discuss likely levels of compensation. He says that his professional advisers have come up with these figures but they are not fur farmers. Has there been any contact? I think that the answer is no, but I should like the Minister to answer my question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> That sounds like consultation to me. I was explaining to the hon. Gentleman that we cannot have the consultation until we have the powers. I have already given the Committee an undertaking that before the consultation goes out, valuers will meet the farmers and examine their assets and will bring forward a more detailed valuation, which will include income. That will be part of the consultation, which will give us a clearer idea of the range of options and the sums involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Perhaps I can explain what I was trying to say, because it has been misinterpreted by the Minister. I did not suggest that he should go out to consultation now, but that his officials could produce a checklist of the sort of things that will be eligible for compensation at this early stage, which would then form the consultation document to be used when the Act becomes law, as I am sure it will, given the Government's large majority. I am asking the Minister for merely an indication of what will be subject to consultation, not about the consultation itself. The explanatory notes contain an estimate of how much will paid by the Government in compensation, so preparatory work must have been done to reach that figure.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Yes, we are obliged to give an estimate and so we have a ball-park figure. These costings are an internal matter and are carried out for any Bill, and in this case they are believed to be around the figure you mentioned. There will, of course, be more detailed consultation, but the hon. Gentleman cannot ask for a pre-consultation. We cannot start work on consultation until the Bill gives us the power to do so. I appreciate that there will be farmers who are waiting for the scheme and are keen to see it progress. I do not want to delay compensation and once the Bill has completed all its stages, there is no reason why we cannot start the preliminary work in order to cut down the amount of time it will take for the scheme to come into operation. However, at present we have no legal powers to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> What preliminary work has been undertaken to reach the figure in paragraph 26 of the explanatory notes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The assessment is based on estimates from our professional advisors, the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, people who go on to farms and know the market trends and prices and the value of equipment and its capital write-down period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Although we have some sympathy with the Minister on the enabling part of clause 5, further assurances still need to be given to firm up exactly what will be involved. We shall definitely revisit the issue on Report. The problem is that as figures have already been quoted, it is clear that someone in the Minister's Department has done a calculation for the Treasury. The figure given in the explanatory notes is £400,000 for assets and four times that—up to £1.6 million—if income is to be included. The problem with giving those figures at this stage is that it pre-empts consultation and its outcome.
<P>
Today we latched on to what the Minister said when he told us that the figures were merely estimates and did not mean ``not a penny more, not a penny less''. He knows as well as I do that the Treasury, having agreed these figures, will resist any substantial move from the top whack figure of £1.6 million. Alternatively the Treasury will say to him ``Okay, find it elsewhere in your MAFF budget.'' As he and I know, that is what the Treasury always says. The Minister will have to find the extra money by taking it from some other area of his responsibilities.
<P>
The Government say that they will listen to what the fur farmers have to say during the consultation process and will send in professional advisers. That is all well and good and we accept it—we have no reason to doubt the Minister's integrity—but I have already gone into detail on the real meaning of the free market and if the Minister's limit is £1.6 million, give or take a few hundred thousand pounds, and that proves to be way out on the basis of the fur farmers' own estimates of the value of their businesses, there could be a massive difference between their expectation and his.
<P>
It would have been better not to have had sight of the £1.6 million figure because the true cost of compensation is likely to be four or five times as much. That is the problem. The enabling part of clause 5 does not provide reassurance that the farmers will be fairly, properly and fully compensated, because it does not say so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that Home Office officials carefully worked out how much compensation would follow from the abolition of certain firearms? We told the then Home Secretary in Committee and on Report that it would cost considerably more. We were given every reassurance that it would not, and I suspect that the same will apply here. Based on commercial experience, the compensation will be considerably more than the figure worked out by Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of officials and included in the explanatory memorandum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is likely to be the case. Underestimates are made all the time for the obvious reason that figures have to be passed by the Treasury. Ministers slip in figures to their of officials, which they hope will be accepted. Renegotiation follows when the amount is exceeded. In the example mentioned by my hon. Friend, it took months if not years for compensation to be paid. We hope that that will not apply here, but I return to the fundamental point—what guarantees can the Minister give to the fur farming community that compensation will be fair and appropriate? If the limit is £1.6 million—give or take £100,000—it is unlikely to meet their requirements. What will meet them nobody seems to know, because neither the Minister nor his of officials have talked to fur farmers to ascertain the ball-park figures that should be addressed. As I said, on the basis of the Austrian example, the figures are well out. Consultation is not really consultation, but carving up an already fixed figure.
<P>
Our amendments are designed to target specific cost areas. If they are totalled fairly and appropriately for every farm to the total of the 13, it will certainly amount to much more than £1.6 million. The Minister must tell us how the Government are to get themselves off that hook. If he does, I will withdraw the amendment. If not, we shall have to think again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been a Minister and knows that the Bill is fully in line with how legislation is customarily arranged. I have already said that there will be an independent valuation of the businesses, including their income. At this stage, I cannot be fairer than that. There are bound to be differences of opinion about the appropriate figures, so it is right and proper for me, as a custodian of public funds, to ensure that the valuation is independent. Provisions for that are included in the Bill. I have already given undertakings and I am trying to be as fair as possible.
<P>
It is wrong to use the example of what happened in Austria. I have no idea whether the Austrian figures were based on market valuations or some other criteria. It is irrelevant to what we are doing in this country. What is relevant to this country is that we carry out a fair and independent valuation. The nature of the package will be included in the consultation process. I have tried to be as fair and open as possible about what is acceptable and what may cause difficulties in the scheme. Consultation is consultation; all aspects of the problem can be taken into account.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Does not the Minister think that it would be easier for those working out the details of compensation if they were given clear headings about what should qualify for compensation? Our concerns could be encompassed in the clause, but it is not incumbent on those working out the compensation to deal with them.
<P>
With the Treasury breathing down their necks and a derisory figure in the explanatory notes, the chances are that they might leave out critical factors such as income. The factors should be listed in the Bill so that the people working out compensation have a clear framework in which to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I have already given an undertaking that assets and income will be taken into account in the valuation. I did not give that undertaking lightly: it will be done, and it will feed into the consultation. There is an argument that the figures may be an under-estimate; my professional advice is that they were accurate when they were calculated and according to the criteria supplied. The figures submitted will be tested by an independent valuation, and the independent valuations will provide figures on which to base compensation. The process, which the Bill enables, cannot be fairer than that. At this stage, it is not appropriate to specify in the Bill every dot and comma of a compensation scheme. The Bill gives an enabling power, not the detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister said that the basis for compensation will be partly dependent on independent advice. He laid great stress on the independent advice and assessment that he will bring to bear. Does that mean that if the independent advice values the fur farming business in Britain at £5 million in compensation, he will meet that bill? Or is he restricted to £1.6 million?
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I have already explained that the hon. Gentleman would be mistaken to think that we cannot go a penny over that figure because it is cast in stone. That is not correct. However, it is a fair estimate by independent officials in the Department, and they have given professional advice about that assessment. If the independent assessments come up with a different figure, we shall have to consider it in the Ministry. We shall deal with it as part of the consultation and valuation process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> On the basis of the pledge given by the Minister that if there is a discrepancy between the valuations of the independent assessors and those of his officials, he will address it later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 3, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the payment of interest to be calculated on a compound basis on the total of payments agreed at final settlement or as may be determined by arbitration, and to be payable from the date of the settlement or of any time limit imposed for the payment of compensation, whichever is the earlier.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall discuss the following amendment: No. 14, in page 3, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any compensation scheme made under this section shall include provision for the payment on account where requested by the claimant of 50 per cent. of the amount of compensation agreed between the claimant and the appropriate authority, or in any other case of the amount of compensation that the appropriate authority estimates the claimant is entitled to under the scheme, within three months of the submission of the claim or on the expiry of any time limit imposed for the payment of compensation whichever is the earlier.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The amendment allows interest to be claimed on any outstanding compensation and to be payable in the period from the date of the final settlement to that of payment. If a time limit for settlement of the claim were imposed, interest would be payable from the date of expiry of that limit.
<P>
We have had a lengthy debate on compensation and we hope that whatever scheme the Minister eventually puts in place, following the statutory consultation that has to be undertaken, it will be regarded by all parties as fair. If it is, the submission, negotiation and settlement of claims need not take long. If, however, negotiations on some claims turn out to be lengthy, because of disputes about entitlement or quantum that may involve arbitration by the dreaded Lands Tribunal under subsection (5), settlements could take months, if not years. In those circumstances, it would be appropriate for compound interest to be payable on the amount of money that is finally agreed or determined. The advice to the Government from their working party on compulsory acquisition was that such interest was payable.
<P>
Until the claimant—in this case, the fur farmer—receives the compensation for which he is negotiating, he cannot put it to any use, such as reinvest it or earn interest by putting it in the bank. Claimants under the compulsory land purchase code are entitled to claim interest on their outstanding compensation. The same rules should apply to people put out of business by the Bill. The precedent for paying such interest is well established, and it is difficult to justify treating some victims of compulsory purchase differently from others.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In Committee on the private Member's Bill on fur farming, the Government accepted in principle the argument on interest payments when the settlement of a claim had been subject to unreasonably long delays. Amendment No. 13 would improve the Bill by making provision for such payments.
<P>
I remind the Minister that the Government introduced legislation in its first Session to make interest payable when companies miss payment dates for invoices. It is right that the same principle should apply to compensation payable by the Government. The amendment would also act as an incentive to the scheme's administrators to expedite claims efficiently once they were settled.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 would allow for interim compensation payments when final payment of compensation was unreasonably delayed. A similar amendment to the private Member's Bill was tabled in Committee by the hon. Member for Garston, who was present until a moment ago. I am sorry that she has had to rush off on more important business. Her amendment asked for 90 per cent. of compensation to be paid up front. The Government accepted the principle, but took the view that 90 per cent. was too much, although land compensation cases use that figure.
<P>
Since 1973, claimants under the land compensation code have been entitled to request advance payments of 90 per cent. either of the agreed compensation or, more usually, of the acquiring authority's initial estimate of their entitlement. As we said, it can take months or years to reach a final settlement in practice. In the meantime, the person affected should be helped to reorganise his affairs, perhaps by setting up a new business with up-front money that is a substantial proportion of the compensation due.
<P>
The amendment would extend to the fur farming industry the same rights as exist for land compensation. It would be unreasonable for the Government to reject that. It is in the Government's interest to accept the idea, as it is likely to enable fur farmers to establish other sources of income sooner rather than later. If the Government accept the principle behind the amendment, it is important that they include an appropriate provision in the Bill, to provide the necessary reassurance to the fur farming industry.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we continue, I must inform the Committee that Standing Order No. 88 permits me to extend the sitting to 1.15 pm, if by so doing the Committee might conclude consideration of the Bill without meeting again. I ask hon. Members to consider further whether such an extension is appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am tempted to say cheekily that it would not be necessary to sit this afternoon if the Government acceded to all our demands. If we had such an assurance, we could take everything formally.
<P>
I commend what my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has so ably, reasonably and comprehensively said about the amendments. I need to make only one or two other points. Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are important. As my hon. Friend said—I have a similar experience—most land compulsory purchase schemes make provision for interest and interim payments to be made. It is easy to work out roughly the scale of the payments, but the final details can be difficult to establish and are often not immediately available. If the general quantum of the credit claim is known, it is reasonable to make interim payments.
<P>
I have already mentioned the firearms scheme under which gunsmiths and gun owners were compensated for removal of the right to own certain firearms. Home Office of officials were so overwhelmed with the claims, which were much bigger than initially calculated, that payments were greatly delayed. I do not know how many staff the Minister envisages will be necessary to deal with the payments. Although there are many fewer mink farmers than the people who needed compensation under firearms legislation, it will not be an easy job. It is likely to take many months—years, in some cases—to settle the final claims. Interim payments should be made in the interests of equity and fairness.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire argued that interest payments are an incentive for the state to speed up the settlement of claims. There is a famous saying, ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' and the same applies to payments. If payments that are justifiably due are not paid, it amounts to a penalty. As my hon. Friend said, if the state demands interest and penalties for late tax and VAT payments, it is equitable that the same principle should apply when the state is late in paying out compensation under the Bill.
<P>
I know from my own constituency experience that some compulsory purchase schemes are still not fully settled, seven years later. Under those schemes, the claimants will be paid interest. One of the reasons why those claims are not fully settled is that the district valuers—the state officials who will be consulted on land valuation matters—are overstretched. Offices have been amalgamated and staff numbers reduced because of Treasury demands. They are simply swamped by compulsory purchase schemes, mainly due to roads.
<P>
If the claims under the Bill have to join that queue, it could take several years to settle them. Based on my experience of claims going to arbitration under the Land Tribunal procedure, it is almost always years rather than months before the final award is made. I hope that the Minister will therefore agree to consider at least the spirit of our amendments, if not their exact form on the amendment paper.

<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I can confirm that I am sympathetic to the spirit of the amendments. It is inappropriate for them to be built into the Bill, but I can give an undertaking that the matters that they cover will be part of the consultation. Models already exist for dealing with interest payments and payments on account. I repeat that those matters will form part of the consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> With those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 3, line 33 at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and shall have regard to the views expressed those persons and bodies'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to have regard to the outcome of consultation with interested parties on the detail of the compensation scheme. The farming industry is specialised and the assessments made by the Ministry's officials regarding its valuation may not be in the same ball park as those of the industry. It seems that no one has had to deal with the issues in the Bill before, so perhaps it is not surprising that there is no clear guidance from the legal or valuation professions on designing a fair compensation scheme for such specialised businesses. We maintain that only those with a specialised knowledge of the business are well placed to assess what the key elements of the compensation scheme should be and the likely costs involved.
<P>
The Bill imposes a draconian prohibition on the fur farming industry. It is imperative that the legislation contains clear and firm safeguards for the farmers. It is only fair that the industry is given not only an opportunity to make its case for compensation, but a guarantee that proper account will be taken of its representations.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be implying that consultation would have no purpose and that those consulted would not be listened to. I refer him to ``The Collins English Dictionary'', which says that to consult is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to have regard for (a person's feelings, interests, etc.).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those exact words are in his amendment, which seems to be covered by the term ``consultation.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We know what the word ``consult'' means and that Governments use it all the time. The present Government are embarking on a consultation exercise on the health service, which is apparently a total farce, because the forms had to be returned before some people actually got them. Therefore, we know what ``consultation'' sometimes means. All we are suggesting is that the consultation exercise should have regard to the views expressed by the persons and bodies consulted.
<P>
We want a meaningful consultation exercise, but we have doubts that it will take place, because there is a discrepancy between the valuation already placed on the industry by MAFF officials and its real value to the people involved. The Minister has made a concession: if the independent advice that he mentioned suggests a far bigger figure than that already put into print by his officials, he will address that at the appropriate time. We accept his assurances. To arrive at a proper, accurate and fair valuation, we would like the Government to say in the Bill that proper regard will be given to views expressed by the people whom they consult.
<P>
Statutory consultation will provide a formal opportunity for professional advice to be taken by both the farmers and the Government on what would represent a fair compensation scheme in what I reiterate are unique circumstances. It is right that Ministers should be required to have regard to the outcome of consultation, otherwise the whole exercise could simply be cosmetic.
