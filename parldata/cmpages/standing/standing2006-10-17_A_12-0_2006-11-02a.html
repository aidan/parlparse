<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000385"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b><b class="B"> </b>On a point of
order, Mr. Amess. I wish to clarify something that I said
during Tuesday&#146;s debate on amendment No.
257.</div>
<a name="06110296000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000386"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): I remember it
well.</div><a name="06110296000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000387"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The record will show that I said that certain
groups of claimants are excluded from local housing allowance and
pathfinder schemes and that we will replicate that provision at the
national roll-out. I want to clarify what I said about charities.
Claimants will be exempt from local housing allowance schemes only if
care and support or supervision is provided by the charity; that
replicates exactly the pathfinder position. I thank the Committee for
its
indulgence.</div><a name="06110296000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000388"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Committee is most grateful that the Minister
has refined her position.</div>
<a name="06110296000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000389"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Amess. I shall welcome you to the Chair at a more
appropriate point in our proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, I
confirm that during our conversations on Tuesday I referred to an
organisation called &#147;working links&#148;; hon. Members will be
aware that I should have called it WorkDirections. I hope that I have
reassured the Committee.</div>
<a name="06110296000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000390"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is entirely in order that both Ministers have
tidied up the record.</div>

Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): I beg to move amendment
No. 266, in page 19, line 15, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The regulations
may provide for local variations in AMHB in the event of a shortage of
suitable accommodation for disabled
people.&#146;.</div><a name="06110296000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is fairly straightforward. I seek to discover the
Government&#146;s approach to dealing with those who, potentially,
are tremendously vulnerable&#151;disabled people, their carers and
associated family&#151;in those parts of the country that do not have
a huge supply of houses available to rent with the potential to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 434</div>be adjusted or improved to allow for their particular needs, or places
that have already been adjusted to reflect those needs.</div>
<a name="06110296000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary pointed out
this morning that we do not have a national housing market but a series
of local markets. It will depend on the local market as to whether
there is an adequate supply of such places that can be adjusted or that
have already been adjusted. Given the huge variety of adjustments that
may be required for the many different conditions, it is clear that
there may be no such houses in some parts of the country. That will
lead to problems finding an appropriate house or somewhere at a
reasonable rent that could be
adjusted.</div><a name="06110296000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000392"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Would my hon. Friend not
agree that, by the nature of things, the sample will be rather small,
and that any deductions drawn from that sample will result in a
correspondingly low degree of
confidence?</div><a name="06110296000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000393"></a>John
Penrose:</b> My hon. Friend is right. When discussing the
single room rent restriction, we spoke of the difficulty of finding an
accurate factual basis on which the rent officers could make decisions
affecting various parts of the country. This is a similar example, but
based on a different set of facts.</div>
<a name="06110296000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point will cause
difficulties. Not only will the disabled have to find places that can
be adjusted to meet their needs, but they have what may be classed a
non-standard shape of household&#151;for instance, the carer may or
may not be a member of the family. That can give rise to an unusual
type of family geometry when compared with the normal run of family
types for which rent officers will be declaring local housing
allowances.</div><a name="06110296000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary may have started to prefigure her answer when summing
up this morning in our debate on the single room rent restriction.
However, I hope that she can explain a little more about how the
Government plan to deal with the problem and that she can reassure us
about the steps that they plan to ensure that this important and
vulnerable group will be properly looked after when local housing
allowances are
decided.</div><a name="06110296000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000394"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is good to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Amess. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has raised
the subject in his amendment. I respect the admirable intentions behind
it. As he indicated, to a certain extent it follows on from comments
made by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr.
Hunt).</div> <a name="06110296000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure the
Committee that we already have powers to make different provisions for
different classes of people under section 175 of the Social Security
Administration Act 1992. We can also make different provisions for
different areas under section 175(6). However, more importantly, adding
the qualification suggested by the amendment to the local housing
allowance would undermine its main advantages of simplicity,
transparency and fairness.</div>
<a name="06110296000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee
accepts that the majority of disabled recipients live in the social
rented sector and will not be covered by the local housing allowance.
As I said during a debate on a previous amendment, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 435</div>the discretionary housing payment scheme is also in place. That flexible
system will enable the local authority to target help to those who most
need it.</div>
<a name="06110296000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
relevant issue of live-in carers. If the dwelling is the carer&#146;s
normal place of residence, the carer will be included as an occupier in
the housing benefit calculation; the customer will be entitled to an
additional room and a non-dependant deduction will be made. We
recognise the different issues; I have already mentioned the charitable
and voluntary sectors. The local housing allowance has a built-in
flexibility, at an individual level, through discretionary payments. I
hope that, with that reassurance, the hon. Gentleman will feel free to
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="06110296000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000395"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for that brisk and
comprehensive response, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06110296000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

proposed</i><i class="I">,</i> That the clause stand part ofthe
Bill.</div><a name="06110296000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000396"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> It is a great pleasure to see you on this
moderately sunny Thursday afternoon, Mr. Amess.</div>
<a name="06110296000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give a general welcome to the
LHA and what it was trying to achieve&#151;a simpler and fairer
system. It was designed to encourage greater personal responsibility
among claimants, which is a good thing. It wanted to provide tenants
with a bit more choice and to reward their shopping around; that was
another noble aim. It also sought to reduce administrative complexity
and promote financial inclusion by encouraging a welcome trend among
those who were unbanked to open bank accounts so that they had a
reliable way of receiving money and paying money to
landlords.</div><a name="06110296000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the devil is always in the detail. Clearly, during a pilot not
everything has been nailed down and got right, and we Conservatives
will not be so unreasonable as to pretend that the problem has been
cracked. However, the clause concretises some of the proposals in the
LHA pilots. I should like to pose a series of questions and points, on
which we, along with outside groups and claimants, would like
reassurance.</div> <a name="06110296000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first question is about why there is so little evidence from the
evaluations of LHA of moves by existing claimants to more appropriate
property&#151;more appropriate in the sense that claimants might pay
lower rent and be able to save some of that money under the pilot
schemes.</div> <a name="06110296000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
really like to know how many people have been taking advantage of the
cash retention built into the proposal. It is all very well saying that
a lot of shopping around is going on and that lots of claimants are
able to retain some of the saving by going to a less expensive
property, but can the Minister quantify that? It is a great idea in
theory, but is it happening in
practice?</div><a name="06110296000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
question relates to shortfalls. Hon. Members, on the Government and the
Opposition sides, will have some interesting examples to give, but I
shall return to that in a minute.</div>
<a name="06110296000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need
some information from the Under-Secretary about the IT side of the
equation. The housing benefit service in pathfinder areas seems to be
doing quite a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 436</div>good job with the system. However, I am led to understand that IT
problems, ranging from acute to minor, have been experienced. There is
some suggestion that the level of resources needed to support an LHA
national roll-out, which is what the clause seeks to do, has been
seriously underestimated. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary
would give us her views on that. Is she entirely satisfied that the IT
capability and resourcing are there to ensure that the national
roll-out goes ahead
smoothly?</div><a name="06110296000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000397"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Would my hon. Friend not also want to bear in
mind, first, that when any system is changed there are always
frictional and transitional problems, and that those transferring from
one system to another will be the most vulnerable to that? Secondly,
there is a world of difference in scale between a pilot with a
comparatively small scale, and an escalation to a nationwide
system.</div><a name="06110296000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000398"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point.
Reassurance from the Under-Secretary would be most welcome.</div>
<a name="06110296000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Next, and crucially, for all of
us who are involved in the welfare reform conversation, we must ask the
question: what has the LHA done for work incentives, and encouraging
people back into work, so far as housing benefit is concerned? The
evaluation that I have seen did not disclose very much evidence of the
LHA improving employment opportunities. One of the evaluation
reports&#151;forgive me; I forget which
one&#151;said:</div><a name="06110296000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
officer believed that the effects of the LHA in their location was so
small&#151;affecting the better off calculation by only
&#163;5-&#163;10&#151;that it was of little significance in the
claiming/working
decision&#148;</div><a name="06110296000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">by a
claimant.</div><a name="06110296000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Others
simply do not know if it is affecting such
decisions.&#148;</div><a name="06110296000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
2006 evaluation report on the Department for Work and Pensions
website.</div> <a name="06110296000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Under-Secretary to ask herself whether that LHA pilot has done its work
on work incentives. What statistical data has she been looking at
before deciding to roll out the proposal nationally? Is there more that
could be done after the Bill is enacted to ensure that the propositions
in the pilot are tweaked so that we can get more people incentivised
into work? We all know about the quite vicious withdrawal rates in
housing benefit. I hasten to add that that has been true for many years
under successive Governments: it is the nature of the beast that there
must be sharp withdrawal rates, and it is difficult to flatten the
cliff edges. Nevertheless, is there anything that can be done to look
again at those pilot schemes to see whether we can do more on housing
benefit, and ensure that the disincentive to work is removed or
lessened?</div><a name="06110296000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="06110296000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next
question relates to the retention of cash should a claimant shop around
and find a lower rent. Proposed new subsection (5) provides that a
claimant&#146;s HB could exceed their rent liability, if their
appropriate LHA rate is higher than their actual rent liability. The
Green Paper asked for views on a proposal to cap the amount of HB that
claimants can receive in excess of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 437</div>their rent levels. Obviously, we welcome and support that proposal,
which is innovative and
clever.</div><a name="06110296000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Green
Paper
states:</div><a name="06110296000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
some areas, claimants are able to receive large cash sums over and
above the amount they need to pay their rent. There is a concern that
this is fundamentally unfair and that it could have serious
implications for work
incentives&#148;.</div><a name="06110296000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Under-Secretary say something about the level at which the Government
are going to set the
cap?</div><a name="06110296000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Respondents to
the Green Paper appreciated the need to restrict cash gains for
recipients of LHA, but also expressed concern about the additional
complexity that a capping regime at that level might add to the scheme.
The Association of London Government has
said:</div><a name="06110296000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
disappointing that the DWP is proposing to cap excess
allowances&#148;</div><a name="06110296000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
this</div><a name="06110296000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;introduces a level
of complexity&#148;.</div><a name="06110296000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have said that they intend to implement a &#163;15 cap on
the LHA that tenants can receive above their rent level. Why was the
capping figure set at &#163;15, and will the Under-Secretary
acknowledge that that could introduce complexity? Why not set the
figure at more than &#163;15? If someone has had the wit and energy
to negotiate downwards, why not &#163;20 or &#163;10? I would be
interested to hear how that &#163;15 capping figure was arrived
at.</div><a name="06110296000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next point
relates to the excellent work, which has been encouraged by the
Government, done by Citizens Advice, Shelter and others in giving
financial advice and support during the roll-out. The scheme is
innovative, and it will be new to HB claimants, which is potentially
very confusing, and the Government were entirely right to put in place
a support and advice system in many of the pilot areas. However, this
is where my concern hoves into view. Citizens Advice has been working
with local authorities which have been promoting the LHA and reassuring
landlords that vulnerable tenants will be provided for and will be able
to make payments. It has also been developing relationships with local
banks.</div> <a name="06110296000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Citizens
Advice has considered both sides of the equation. It has talked to
landlords and banks about opening accounts so that housing benefit
payments can go from the Department into a claimant&#146;s account,
which can be subject to a direct debit not only for the convenience of
the landlord, but so the claimant can plan their finances with some
confidence knowing that their housing benefit will go out on the due
date and that they will not have a landlord on their case causing them
grief.</div><a name="06110296000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is all
important support work, and I understand that much of it is done face
to face to improve the financial literacy and debt-management skills of
the often vulnerable people who need support and benefits, which
includes not only housing benefits, but all other forms of benefit.
Now, those people are getting that support with the new HB
scheme.</div><a name="06110296000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
one example how a citizens advice bureau helped a client. The client
had a current account that was already seriously overdrawn. She was
concerned that when the LHA was paid into her account, her bank would
use it to pay off her overdraft, so she would be unable to pay the rent
to the landlord because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 438</div>there would not be enough money in the account. She also thought that
she would not be able to open another account because of her poor
credit rating. The citizens advice bureau helped her to open a basic
bank account for her LHA to get around that problem. I am sure that
those of us who have spoken to people in pilot areas can produce many
other examples of simple but effective
intervention.</div><a name="06110296000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
the importance of that support network for LHA claimants in pilot
areas, Citizens Advice reports that a number of bureaux have been
informed that funding will be reduced and will not be supplied at the
same level on roll-out. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that, and,
more generally, tell us what funds will be made available for such
support services throughout the country on the national roll-out? Has a
figure been earmarked for such work, and can assurances be given to
those who are helping to drive up financial literacy skills, such as

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000399"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> As my hon. Friend has mentioned
the magic word &#147;finally&#148;, could he reflect on what one
might call the rent profit cap, about which he spoke a few moments ago?
Is it not worth considering, at least in principle, whether that cap
should be linked to the level of local rent determination rather than
being somewhat arbitrarily determined as a monetary
amount?</div><a name="06110296000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000400"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> There is no end to my hon. Friend&#146;s
skills. He is a wordsmith, a life enhancer, a caring and compassionate
historian and a guide, philosopher and friend&#151;to me, at any
rate. Importantly, he has added being a policy wonk to his list of
accomplishments, because he has just come up with a policy idea that
had not occurred to me. That might indeed be one way of doing it. I
have already asked the Under-Secretary why the policy cap has been set
in the way in which it has, and I am extremely keen to hear the
answer.</div><a name="06110296000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
interests of time, I shall not detain the Committee, but I hope that
the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) will detain us on the
issue of the size of what is referred to under the current regime as a
locality. Worrying data have been produced by Citizens Advice. In one
particular part of the country, Barnet, the locality&#151;the Bill
will change the term, but I shall call it the locality for the sake of
simplicity&#151;is very large, which leads to the midpoint of rents
for the area being completely unrepresentative of what a real market
rent would be in some parts of the
locality.</div><a name="06110296000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I trust that
we shall hear more about that, but if the research conducted by
Citizens Advice in Barnet is correct, something must be done. From the
evidence that Citizens Advice has provided, it seems that there are
serious shortfalls, which need not occur if the rent officer draws the
map more sensibly. Why have the localities been allowed to grow so
large for the purpose of rent determinations by the rent service? I am
not sure what the logic is, but I am sure that it is leading to very
large shortfalls in certain parts of the country.</div>

Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I shall not continue with
the weather theme in our conversations, but I note that the Room is
considerably chillier than before. In the interests of hon. Members at
some point being able to go and warm their hands on a hot drink, I
shall try to be brief, despite the scope of the
clause.</div><a name="06110296000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
tabled an amendment, because I believe that there will be an
opportunity to examine matters when regulations are made. However, I
look to Ministers to consider my concerns during passage of the Bill
and to return with further recommendations or reassurances that will
satisfy me and those who have advised
me.</div><a name="06110296000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to
thank the CHAS Housing Aid Service, for which my husband worked until
1998 as a director in Kirklees and for which I have some affection. I
no longer have any direction connection with it, but Niall Holland came
to see me and has been extremely helpful in advising me about its
concerns. CHAS is a small organisation and therefore was not involved
in the consultation, but perhaps that could be remedied in the course
of our further deliberations, so that it can discuss matters directly
with Ministers and so that proper solutions can be found in the
future.</div><a name="06110296000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) mentioned
shortfalls, and the way in which they have come about. We do not wish
to exacerbate an already difficult situation by what we are about to
do. The CHAS report, &#147;Behind Closed Doors&#148;, covers a
number of large metropolitan areas, including Kirklees, and one of its
studies covers south Kirklees in my constituency. For single rooms, the
current shortfall is approximately &#163;18, but in more typical
rental accommodation, the shortfall is &#163;28 for one-bedroomed
accommodation and &#163;16 for two-bedroomed accommodation. For
bigger properties, the differences vary considerably. Those shortfalls
in my area were replicated in all the areas that were studied,
including Bradford, Doncaster, areas right across south and west
Yorkshire and beyond to, for example, Exeter. The study concentrates
largely on areas in Yorkshire&#151;it is none the worse for that, but
the concerns do not only apply to Yorkshire. I suspect that shortfalls
are replicated to varying degrees across the country, depending on
market rents and on housing demand and
availability.</div><a name="06110296000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another way in which shortfalls may be exacerbated: the move from a
mid-point assessment to a median assessment. On the face of it, the
Government&#146;s Green Paper entitled &#147;A new deal for
welfare: Empowering people to work&#148; gives a useful explanatory
note on how median rent could improve the situation. The example given
is of a range of 13 houses with rental values between &#163;50 and
&#163;200. In that group the median is &#163;150, and the mid-point
is
&#163;125.</div><a name="06110296000352"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="06110296000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next problem
arises out of the work of rent officers. When rent officers were asked
how they apply their own values and about the research that they do in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 440</div>setting those values, we found that they cut out the lowest and the
highest of those 13 properties available for rent in order to reach
their mid-point.</div> <a name="06110296000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
parliamentary question, my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield
(Mr. Sheerman) asked how the median would be reached. He
asked specifically whether the median that has been referred to would
include all rents or would exclude significantly high or low rents. The
answer was that it comes from the rent officers&#146; market evidence
database. Our problem with that is that we know in our own area that
the rent officers&#146; market evidence database already excludes the
lowest and the highest rents available in our area. We need to ask
whether guidance will be given to rent officers. The median, which
would on the face of it bring about an improvement for people, needs to
be a true median and not one that is being
disguised.</div><a name="06110296000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000402"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Am I right in thinking that the size of the
locality exacerbates the problem that the hon. Lady is
describing?</div><a name="06110296000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000403"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> The hon. Gentleman, perhaps
not unusually, is a little ahead of me because I am about to come to
the size of the locality, which has an impact on deciding a median
because the bigger the locality, the larger the variation in rent for
similarly sized properties. My area has some leafy and quite wealthy
areas. Holmfirth, for example, is a relatively wealthy area when
compared with England as a whole, with average annual household incomes
of &#163;30,000. Even in Colne Valley&#151;which is not the
worst-off in Britain&#151;the average income in the poorest ward is
&#163;20,000. Therefore, there is a &#163;10,000 difference in
incomes. That is followed by a difference in house prices and rental
markets. However, Huddersfield and Dewsbury, which are included in the
Kirklees area, have significantly lower incomes per household and a
following variation between house prices and rental values.</div>
<a name="06110296000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
only that Holmfirth&#151;if anyone wants to visit it, it is the
location for &#147;Last of the Summer Wine&#148;&#151;is
extremely beautiful and a great tourist attraction. However, the fact
that it is a tourist attraction affects its house prices. That is
noticeable in my village, Slaithwaite, which is also a tourist
attraction due to the production of &#147;Where the Heart is.&#148;
It shows how a market can be so easily affected by something that does
not appear to be a market change. However, the fact that the television
crew decides to film there changes the value of the properties.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> That may also have a negative impact on
prices&#151;we may look at that in future&#151;but it is currently
seen as a beautiful place and one that has a sense of community,
something that cannot be easily quantified. I do not know how a rent
officer would evaluate that. While a sense of community is one of those
things that changes market values, it cannot easily be put into a
guidance note to rent officers. Nevertheless, they might look more
closely at what is affecting market values in their own
areas.</div>
<a name="06110296000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some areas in
the pathways have been very large indeed. Taking Sheffield and Leeds as
examples, I am an ex-Sheffield girl myself and, not having lived in one
of its leafy areas, knew that there were certain areas in which I would
never even have aspired to own a property because the property values
in Sheffield vary so greatly. It is a city that was built up from a
number of smaller 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 441</div>communities, which urbanised over the years as the steel industry grew.
My own area is very rural with many formal agricultural properties,
smaller villages and even tiny hamlets. There is a great deal of
difference between the kind of rent that can be attracted in a tiny
hamlet and one that would be attracted in another area. A motorway, for
example, could have a huge impact on the market. In some places, it
would have a beneficial impact as it would give an easy route to other
places where people could go to get work, but in other parts the impact
would be seen as detrimental because people do not like the
noise.</div>
<a name="06110296000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000404"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): Is the hon. Lady
concerned that having a single rate for a large area could discourage
labour mobility, because it could mean that people looking for work
might feel restricted to living in a particular part of the area and
might not be able to move to some of the areas that she has referred
to? It might impede the desire for people to move back into the labour
market if they are out of it.
</div><a name="06110296000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000405"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> Indeed. The report produced by Labour MPs in
1997-98 was about that very point. It was one of the first surveys of
rural communities and was carefully produced, considering the reasons
why people were leaving rural areas and going to urban areas to find
work: the travel-to-work problems, the community effects, rising house
prices that meant that they could not afford to stay and the need to
follow the work. There are other effects. In an area such as my
constituency, for example, most people go to work in Manchester, Leeds
or Sheffield. People going to those towns are followed by the
development of four-bedroomed houses, because when people can afford to
get on the motorway and tootle on to work in such places but come home
to the beautiful Colne Valley with its fantastic scenery, they want to
live in the houses that they desire. They change the whole housing
market for the people who already live
there.</div>
<a name="06110296000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000406"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I have been following the hon. Lady&#146;s remarks
carefully, and I agree with most of what she is saying. Does she think
that there is a further problem with the phenomenon that she is
describing? A lot of evidence in housing policy suggests that we need
to create mixed communities where people of all income groups, families
and so on live in the same area. Allowing the broader areas that she is
worried about risks putting that policy in
jeopardy.</div>
<a name="06110296000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000407"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> Of course, some of that can be catered for by
looking at planning guidance, which makes a huge contribution. I have
taken many an opportunity to object to some developments that I thought
did not add helpfully to the social mix. This is not the only way in
which social housing can be provided, and it is not the only way in
which we can ensure that houses of a suitable type for rent or cheap
purchase can be provided, or indeed some mix of the two so that people
can have part-equity. There are other ways of looking at the market,
but what does not change is the variation between one locality and
another.</div>

Boswell</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="06110296000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000409"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I am feeling generous, because I am so fond of
the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06110296000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000410"></a>Hon.
Members:</b>Favouritism!</div><a name="06110296000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000411"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am mortified, but also deeply flattered. Has
the hon. Lady seen the dilemma that I see? She cogently made the point
about striking off the outliers in determining the median. She also
made the point about the huge variations within wards that we may all
have between affluent and less affluent areas. I am sure that is true.
However, given the need to have a good statistical base to inform the
rent officer&#146;s determination, one needs a large enough sample,
and given the need to be precise enough to deal with local market
conditions, one needs a local solution. Does the hon. Lady at least
acknowledge that that is a dilemma whoever is in
government?</div><a name="06110296000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000412"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> Of course it is a dilemma. In order to get more
information, CHAS contacted our local authority and asked for the
information in order to make a better assessment of the rents
available. Unfortunately, the rent officers did not feel&#151;some
for not such good reasons, but others for good reasons&#151;that they
could provide all the information that might have informed us better in
this debate. In their decision not to provide that information, they
cited the exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act 2000
about revealing information that might be against economic interest or
would affect the financial interests of the UK Administration. That is
a pity. I can understand some of that. I can understand some of the
other reasons that they gave. But given that most of us in a locality
know the general amount of rent that is on offer and the kind of
benefits that are paid for that type of property, I do not entirely
accept what the rent officer said. It might have informed our debate
better if we had had a clearer picture of what was really happening in
Kirklees, but unfortunately I cannot advise the hon. Gentleman further
on that because I simply do not have the
information.</div><a name="06110296000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">But any
fool can see by looking in the adverts in the local paper the type of
variation that exists. That gives rent officers considerable problems.
One would not want to skew a market or to attract a higher rent to an
area simply by setting a level that its market value would not attract.
That would be a mistake. I do not see why taxpayers should pay for
something that the market would not attract. Also, reasonably, people
should be able to find a mechanism to ensure that the rent that the
market attracts is true and fair and does not lead to further,
unexpected and unnecessary consequences, especially around the issue of
rent shortfalls. That is what we must focus our minds
on.</div><a name="06110296000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also take
account of the fact that markets change constantly. There is not one
fixed locality that we can draw a red ring around on a map and say that
it is there for all time. This problem surfaced in the case of
Heffernan <i class="I">v.</i> Rent Service, which was heard in Sheffield. I will
not read out all the determinations by Judge Gilbert on that occasion,
but in his examination of the issue of locality he talked at some
length about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 443</div>the difficulty of defining a locality. If anyone wants to read the
judgment, this is in paragraphs 84 to 87. The problem in that case was
that the definition of locality that was being used at that time was
not being properly applied. The definition
was,</div><a name="06110296000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a broad
geographical area made up of a number of neighbourhoods with a mix of
property types and tenure where a tenant could, as an alternative to
the property in question, reasonably be expected to live and benefit
from similar amenities.&#148;</div>
<a name="06110296000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to go through all
the particular types of tenure, property and amenities that this case
looked at. We all know about the changes that can happen in an area. A
new school might attract more properties and different types of
properties; a new amenity and proximity to other desirable amenities
can also change markets. There is not one fixed area. That gives us a
problem. We need to look at ways through the regulations to advise our
rent officers on how to determine what a locality is, rather than use
too broad a brush. Unless I am misadvised about how the median will be
used, it might mean that people find themselves with a bigger shortfall
than we would
wish.</div><a name="06110296000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need to find a way through the system for particular tenants. It
is difficult sometimes to understand how rent officers come to their
conclusions. Some people have asked me to ask for greater transparency
on rent officers. I have thought about this a great deal. If the
information about every property that a rent officer looked at were
made available for anyone to see, would that in and of itself cause a
skewing in the market? Would transparency alone be the solution? I am
not absolutely convinced that it would but I should like the
Under-Secretary to think about and respond to that. In her assessment,
will the greater transparency of the work of the rent officer aid the
process or inhibit it? There is scope for greater transparency and
perhaps greater liaison between rent officers and other departments.
Sometimes rent officers have seemed reluctant to engage with other
sectors, especially the housing association and social housing market
sector. If they had a better understanding of how the market
operates&#151;I am not talking about controlling it&#151;they could
come to an understanding about how a reasonable rent could be set in an
area.</div>
<a name="06110296000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="06110296000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that transparency alone would lead us to the result we want. There may
still be times, as in the Heffernan case, when people feel that they
have had a raw deal. That being so, at present they either pay their
rent or they do not. They either decide to live in a property or they
go elsewhere. People have to do their best and get on with what is
available to them or make another
choice.</div><a name="06110296000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
problem in the attitude of, &#147;Never mind, if you can&#146;t
live in that house go and find a cheaper one&#148;. We all know why
people choose to live in a locality. Opposition Members have already
raised the issue of people in a travel-to-work area wanting to be
nearer to places where there are job opportunities. Some people, for
example, parents who are having trouble raising their children, want to
be near to relatives or friends who can give them support. I have had
cases in my constituency of women who were intimidated by a former
partner and who needed people nearby whom 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 444</div>they could trust. They were reluctant to move out of their locality and
away from those who provided an important support network in their
daily lives. That is a reason for people wanting to stay where they
are, in the community they are used to.</div>
<a name="06110296000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">People do not
necessarily want to move their families around. There is much credit in
a family having stability, which can be found in the community that
people live in, as I know from my constituency experience. It is a
credible, and creditable, reason for wanting to stay in a locality,
even if the accommodation is much smaller than rent officers think is
appropriate.</div><a name="06110296000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
way of dealing with the problem is to consider the work of the rent
advisory committee in the Kirklees authority, for example. As well as
rent officers, the committee includes estate agents and other people
with a housing interest who come together to discuss the area&#146;s
general housing needs. They are well informed about what is happening
in their local housing market and know what is available, what the
houses prices and rentals are likely to be, and what types of amenities
are planned that might have an effect on the market. Those people are
under-utilised at present and they could add something to the mix,
especially if they were used as a point of appeal by those who felt
that the rent officer had sent an unreasonable rate for their benefits,
given the locality.</div>
<a name="06110296000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Under-Secretary
consider regulating for a group as a mechanism for providing an
over-layer, so that people can be certain that what they have been
offered has been properly considered and know that they have a right of
appeal? It is a right that exists throughout the benefit system, yet it
seems to be curiously unavailable in this proposal.</div>
<a name="06110296000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me to another point
that was raised in respect of the Heffernan case: the appropriate
maximum housing benefit, to which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
alluded. Whether we are talking about the median, the mid-point or any
kind of average, it is the maximum that in the end causes the crunch,
and all these matters will affect that. If someone as eminent as Judge
Gilbart could not find an absolute answer to that because, in his own
words, he was having to determine only whether or not the rules had
been applied correctly, rather than whether or not the rules were
correct, I should like to ensure that the rules that we have are
correct and that all tenants feel that they receive a fair
deal.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000413"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> It is good to see you in the Chair again,
Mr. Amess, and it is a pleasure to follow the hon. Lady.
Given the range and depth of her comments, in both their extent and
their thoughtfulness, it will be interesting to hear the
Under-Secretary&#146;s response. She raised a number of issues and I
shall not repeat what she said, but I share many of the concerns that
she
raised.</div><a name="06110296000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say at the outset of this clause stand part debate that Liberal
Democrat Members, too, welcome the principles behind the local housing
allowance. Indeed, all hon. Members who have dealt with housing benefit
cases at their constituency surgeries will welcomethe idea of
simplifying the housing benefit system. Hon. Members on both sides of
the Committee will also welcome the idea of promoting greater personal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 445</div>responsibility for the payment of housing benefit in order to promote
financial inclusion and, indeed, a general sense of greater
responsibility. This is also about greater fairness and choice within
the system. My comments will be made in that context, but there are
difficult questions that must be asked in addition to the points that
have already been
raised.</div><a name="06110296000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds made an important point on work incentives.
I want to press the Under-Secretary on that issue, not least in respect
of the withdrawal rate for housing benefit. I should be interested to
hear from her whether, under the local housing allowance system, the
Government propose that the withdrawal rate for housing benefit should
remain the same as it is today, or whether she will seek to amend that,
too. I am sure that many members of the Committee will have had a
chance to study the tax and benefit tables issued by the Department for
Work and Pensions on Tuesday, which show the interaction between the
tax system, the tax credits system, the benefits system and withdrawal
rates. Marginal deduction rates affect many people on low incomes. I
see a few heads nodding around the Committee, so I can see that we are
on shared ground here. For example, a lone parent who is a local
authority tenant and has child care costs of &#163;100 a week for one
child faces a marginal deduction rate of 95.5 per cent. That means
that, for every extra pound that that person earns, they get to keep
only 4.5p for
themselves.</div><a name="06110296000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role
of housing benefit in that context is very important, because the
marginal deduction rate for housing benefit is high. The way in which
it interacts with the tax credits system and other parts of the
benefits system exacerbates that problem, so I should be interested to
hear from the Under-Secretary what plans she and her ministerial
colleagues have to address that important point. Given the way in which
the benefits system, housing benefit and the tax credits system
interact, many people who are trying hard to take responsibility for
their own lives by working&#151;which is what the Committee is
talking about&#151;but who are in receipt of housing benefit and
other benefits have very poor incentives to improve their employment
status, to work more hours or to get a better job. That issue is
critical in this debate and I look forward to the
Under-Secretary&#146;s comments on
it.</div><a name="06110296000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share many of
the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Colne Valley on the
definitions of broad rental market areas and the operations of rent
officers. The provision of information by rent officers and the extent
to which that is open to scrutiny will be the subject of debates on
amendments under clause 33. I do not propose to dwell on that now, but
the definition of broad rental market areas is important. Again, I
consider the matter from the perspective of someone who represents a
large rural constituency. The hon. Lady raised the question of the
extent of broad rental market areas and how that affects local housing
allowance determinations and people&#146;s decisions about where they
can or cannot live. However, it also affects the so-called
&#147;shopping around benefit&#148; of the new local housing
allowance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 446</div><a name="06110296000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary knows the
highlands of Scotland well, and it may be that the whole ofthe
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency will be one
broad rental market area. That would have a much more severe effect on
the ability of people to rent privately anywhere in Badenoch and
Strathspey because of the limited supply of housing in those rural
communities, where there is little choice and high levels of rent are
payable. In that context, it is important that she sets out the
Government&#146;s intentions for the way that the broad rental market
areas should be drawn up and to what extent she will be guiding rent
officers to set smaller or larger areas.</div>
<a name="06110296000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the city of Inverness, there
are quite different rental market areas, as the hon. Member for Colne
Valley said about her own part of the world. An average of the whole
city would ensure that people in receipt of local housing allowance
would in effect only be able to afford to live in part of the city.
That is an outcome, which I think all hon. Members would agree is
highly undesirable for the reasons I pointed out in an earlier
intervention. It would be useful if the Under-Secretary could provide
more information about the Government&#146;s intentions in relation
to the broad market rent area or
localities.</div><a name="06110296000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Related to
that is the timeliness of LHA determinations on an annual or more
frequent basis. I have certainly noticed in Inverness that there is a
problem because of the limited supply of the types of housing we are
talking about and the housing market conditions, which has caused the
price of houses for sale to rise dramatically and far beyond the means
of local people. That is a digression, but it is important as it has an
impact on rent levels. In many cases, private landlords have seen the
value of their properties rise dramatically, which leads to an increase
in the rent they can charge. If the rent officers&#146;
determinations are not keeping up with that market-driven process, many
more people, even over the course of a year, could be left with
dramatic shortfalls.</div>
<a name="06110296000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not simply cause
financial problems. For example, in Inverness the local housing
association has shared evidence with me that that leads to an increase
in people presenting themselves as homeless. People cannot meet the gap
created by housing benefit not keeping up with the level of rents in
the private sector. I would like a word from the Under-Secretary on the
question of timeliness of revisions. In some of the pathfinder areas,
revisions have taken place monthly and I would be interested to hear
whether that is the intention of the Government under this
clause.</div><a name="06110296000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds rightly referred to the question of
vulnerability assessments and the role of Citizens Advice and others in
providing support and help to people who might be financially excluded
and find the responsibility of paying rent and bills difficult. It is
important that the Under-Secretary sets out her intentions in allowing
that financial advice to be provided and in supporting organisations
such as Citizens Advice as it provides support in all the areas where
this is rolled out. That is particularly important at the start of the
roll-out because it is at the point of change that many people are more
in need of advice. When they are used to the new system, it can operate
more fluidly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000414"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman been informed by outside

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000415"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Yes, I have been informed of that, and I am
concerned about it. I understand that, although demand for the services
will reduce after a year or so, it will never disappear completely, so
if the services disappear the number of people who face problems might
increase.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000416"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On that point, is the hon. Gentleman not failing
to take into account housing benefit
onflow?</div><a name="06110296000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000417"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> If I misspoke, I apologise to
the Committee. Let me rephrase my remarks. At the point of change, a
large number of people might move on to the new benefit and need help,
and because the new benefit encourages people to take responsibility
for themselves, there will be a perpetual flow of people who need
financial advice and help. One of the advantages of local housing
allowance has undoubtedly been a reduction in complexity, from the
point of view of both claimants and benefit administrators. That was
clear when I visited Lewisham to talk to people who had been
administering the pilot.</div>
<a name="06110296000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The one area
in which complexity has increased is making vulnerability assessments.
As the Committee knows, when a vulnerability assessment has been made
and somebody is to be treated as vulnerable, their housing benefit can
be paid directly to the landlord. That is the only category of people
for which that can happen automatically. The process of making
vulnerability assessments can be a significant new burden for local
authorities, and they have addressed it in different ways, whether the
test is subjective or objective. Again, I wonder what guidance the
Under-Secretary will issue to local authorities on the manner in which
vulnerability assessments should be conducted. Overall, the level of
complexity seems to be about the same as it was. The process is less
complex for most tenants, but it is more complex for those in the
vulnerable category.</div><a name="06110296000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one further question for the Under-Secretary. In responding to the
previous debate, she suggested that there might be a degree of policy
change in relation to local housing allowance. She said that the
proportion of people subject to a single room rent whose costs would be
covered by SRR would rise from 26 per cent. to 50 per cent. Will she
explain what policy change has been made since the pathfinder pilots
that makes her confident that such an increase will take
place?</div><a name="06110296000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000418"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): I want to make a number of
points, many of which have been put to me by the Welsh Assembly. I
understand that the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration has
made a submission in response to the Green Paper, but I should like to
ask the Government to clarify some of the points that have been put to
me.</div><a name="06110296000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like other parts
of the United Kingdom, Wales has benefited from the pathfinder pilots.
Two have been held in Conwy and Pembrokeshire, and, like central 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 448</div>Government, the Welsh Assembly has learned from them. It is relevant for
it to do so because, although social security and housing benefit are
not devolved matters, the Welsh Assembly has, under the devolution
settlement, developed its own policies on housing and social care.
There is a clear implication that changes in legislation will impact on
those devolved areas of
responsibility.</div><a name="06110296000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to mention the fact that local housing allowance is to be determined by
the median rent. The example on page 98 of the Green Paper shows that
that would be more generous than the mid-point calculation that has
previously been used. However, I suggest that that is not always the
case, because it depends on which figures are cited. It has been
suggested that the new method of calculation might result in recipients
receiving less generous allowances than has been the case. Moreover,
the provision in the Bill is different from the approach in the
pathfinder areas. Lessons have been learned, but it was decided that
what was tested would not form the basis of the legislation, so we have
a different proposal in the Bill. Will the Under-Secretary explain the
empirical grounds on which the proposal was based? What evidence is
there to back up the argument that the proposal in the Bill is better
than the proposal in the pathfinder
areas?</div><a name="06110296000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Pembrokeshire, where house prices and rents have recently increased
considerably, it has been suggested that if a methodology other than
median rent were used for LHA, the calculation would be completely
different. I should like that point to be clarified. As for the size
criteria for homes and the LHA rate, it is proposed that the
calculation should be based on the number of bedrooms rather than the
number of living rooms. Although the Green Paper says that that could
be a &#147;simpler, more intuitive approach&#148;, a case has not
been made why it should be better. Intuition is one thing; hard facts
are something else entirely. Again, that approach has not been tested
empirically in the pathfinder pilots or elsewhere, and it would be
useful if the Under-Secretary were to explain why the Government have
reached such a conclusion in the
Bill.</div><a name="06110296000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference has
been made to capping, which concerns the difference between the LHA
payment and rent costs. The figure of &#163;15 has been mentioned,
but I reiterate the request for an explanation why that sum is the
magic figure. In the pathfinder areas, it has been an important source
of income for many people and, if it is to be reduced, a case should be
spelt out for that reduction and a reason given why the figure
shouldbe
&#163;15.</div><a name="06110296000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Worries
have been expressed by many people about the complicated nature of
housing benefit. There is no doubt that housing benefit is complicated,
and we would all welcome a change that would simplify the procedures.
It has been said that what the Government are proposing is not as
straightforward as it might be, and the two systems will run in
parallel for a considerable time. To digress slightly, we all know from
the example of the Child Support Agency the difficulties that can arise
from such a process. One individual may realise that another individual
receives a completely different rate of support, yet the system is
meant to be fair to everyone. It will be difficult to explain why,
under the new allowance, some people receive one rate while others
receive a different rate. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 449</div>The difference is that new entrants will be on the new rate and those on
the old system will remain so for some
time.</div><a name="06110296000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will the
system provide an incentive for people to work? A fundamental element
of welfare reform, which is the raison d&#146;être of the
Bill, is including an incentive for people to work in the system. It
has been suggested that someone on housing benefit who is inclined to
work might realise that if they take a job that does not work out, they
will be forced back on to the new benefit at a lower rate. Rather than
take the risk of that happening, that individual might stay on benefit,
although they were inclined to do otherwise. We must tackle that issue
head-on and clarify such
matters.</div><a name="06110296000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to the scope of the LHA, the Bill is focused clearly and precisely on
the private sector, but it gives the Government the power, through
secondary legislation, to extend the changes to the social sector as
well. The Green Paper states, quite
correctly:</div><a name="06110296000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are aware that there are significant differences between the private
rental market and social housing, and between the social housing
sectors of the UK devolved administrations. Many complex factors will
need to be taken into account before a decision is made on exactly how
we take forward reform in this sector. Proposals need to be developed
with caution and over a longer
timescale.&#148;</div><a name="06110296000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is true,
but I should like an explanation why it has been deemed necessary to
empower the Government to advance proposals for the public sector in
the future, rather than saying that there could be new legislation in
the future, which could be properly debated and scrutinised by
Parliament. My colleagues in the Welsh Assembly Government in Cardiff
and I would like that point to be
clarified.</div><a name="06110296000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000419"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I want to make a couple of
observations and ask the Under-Secretary a couple of questions so that
she can justify the clause standing part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06110296000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, I think
that all hon. Members welcome the simplification of housing benefit.
There is no dispute, whether from claimants, local authorities or
politicians, on whether it is a good thing to simplify an incredibly
complicated system. The other good news is that, during the pathways to
work pilot schemes, the rent arrears did not necessarily increase,
which is a reasonably good sign, and there were no enormously adverse
effects from the criteria that were used or the rates that were
set.</div><a name="06110296000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
concern that during the pilots the number of private landlords
demanding deposits from people in receipt of housing benefit increased
from66 per cent. to 75 per cent., which is a small but
significant shift. Will the Under-Secretary say something about that
and about the implications for people claiming some form of housing
benefit or local housing
allowance?</div><a name="06110296000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Colne Valley spoke eloquently and in a sophisticated manner
about the nature of a local housing market and the pressures brought to
bear on people to live in certain locations. I should like
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 450</div>join the hon. Lady in asking the Under-Secretary to say why the danger
and pressure of people being forced to live in a particular area is
outweighed by the
benefits.</div><a name="06110296000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The local
housing allowance is based on discriminating in respect of the locality
in which someone lives. Does the Under-Secretary consider it to be a
discriminatory benefit, because it discriminates on the basis of where
somebody lives? If so, will she justify why such discrimination is
important?</div><a name="06110296000125"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000420"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I had not intended to speak,
but my remarks are to some extent fired, and even informed&#151;if
that is possible&#151;by the interesting contributions by the hon.
Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and my hon. Friend the
Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie). I am concerned about fairness in
dealing with different claimants, which is a theme that I have
occasionally developed in this
Committee.</div><a name="06110296000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is with
some trepidation that I take on the burden of representing the Welsh
interest, which is by marriage rather than a direct connection. I have
a good deal of sympathy with the hon. Member for Caerphilly. In dealing
with areas with a high proportion of second homes, which is a deeply
political and controversial issue in all the Celtic countries and in
some parts of England, it is at least arguable that no normal housing
market is easy to assess. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary
were to explain how rent officers could sterilise artificially high
rents driven by artificially high capital values, which are driven by
Chelsea money, if I may use that shorthand, and how that would
therefore create equity between areas with equivalent indigenous
incomes but different costs, even though other circumstances are the
same. That is one
concern.</div><a name="06110296000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="06110296000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000421"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
returning the favour. Has he noticed that in areas that are popular to
live in, and especially in those attractive to tourists, significantly
lower numbers of social housing are available for rent? Choice is
narrowed in those
circumstances.</div><a name="06110296000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000422"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That is a reasonable concern. On the other side
of the equation, a lot of people find themselves in bed-and-breakfast
accommodation, which is also a feature of some of our tourist areas. I
want to flag up with the Under-Secretary concern in the Committee that
there should be a degree of equity between claimants and no perverse
consequences in the way that the system
works.</div><a name="06110296000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000423"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a fundamental
point. In many rural areas, such as the Scottish highlands, the
definition of the rental market area and the level of local housing
allowances might well have an impact on whether someone chooses to let
out their property privately throughout the year to a regular tenant or
to make it a holiday home. In some communities, in which 20, 30 or 40
per cent. of houses might already be second or holiday homes, that
decision has a direct impact on the ability of individuals on low wages
to live in that community, and therefore on the sustainability of the
community asa whole.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 451</div><a name="06110296000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000424"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman; he makes a very
good point. I, myself, have surplus farm cottages&#151;not a large
number&#151;because farming is so different from what it was, and I
do not mind saying to the Committee that that is exactly the dilemma
that I rehearse with myself: are we going to let them to local families
or perhaps make more money out of holiday lets? I think that Ministers
need to focus on
that.</div><a name="06110296000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall pick up on what the hon. Member for Caerphilly said. I worry
intensely about the two-tier system of benefits that apply to old and
new cases, and occasionally even feel motivated to write to the
Attorney-General about my concerns. That is precedented; it has
happened in the past. I would get a splendid lawyer&#146;s answer
saying, &#147;Parliament has determined that it is all right&#148;.
However, our hearts are not comfortable when two systems run in
parallel. The underlying concern being expressed is that we should have
a fair outcome.</div>
<a name="06110296000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000425"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I wonder whether my hon. Friend can enlighten me on
a point with respect to the proposed local housing allowance that I
cannot get my head around. Obviously, as the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) said, market prices
are dictated in part by Government policy on housing benefit, which
impacts on local house prices. However, does my hon. Friend agree that
if the Government, as they do now, pay whatever the rent is, wherever a
person chooses to live, they could exacerbate the peaks and troughs in
local house prices? However&#151;I do not want to pre-empt the
Under-Secretary&#151;if we have a single housing allowance, which is
the Government&#146;s proposal in the Bill, we could even out those
troughs by reducing demand in the most expensive areas and increasing
it in the least expensive ones. Does my hon. Friend think that the
proposed allowance could have a mitigating
effect?</div><a name="06110296000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000426"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> It is catching. Another of my colleagues might be
making some of the Under-Secretary&#146;s point for her. My hon.
Friend is absolutely right. The existence of a benefit creates feedback
into what happens in the real world. The market clearing prices offered
on housing units vary depending on whether people have the benefit in
their hands to pay for them. That must be right.</div>
<a name="06110296000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">There could be a smoothing
effect, but on the other hand, the point that I was
emphasising&#151;I shall not do more than that, because I do not wish
to subvert the proposals&#151;is that there are wrinkles in relation
to areas with a high second home population, differences between old
cases and new cases and possible anomalies resulting from the
introduction of the new structure depending on the size of the housing
area, as the hon. Member for Colne Valley mentioned. None of that
utterly rules out the idea, and I do not wish to do so, but it requires
the Under-Secretary to respond to a particularly absorbing debate and
to give us her thoughts on how to iron out such
wrinkles.</div><a name="06110296000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000427"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Well, I suppose that that is one way of inviting
a Minister to address the Committee&#151;saying that I am here to
iron out the wrinkles. I wonder whether that is stereotyping women
Ministers, but I know that that is not what the hon. Gentleman meant. I
was only joshing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 452</div><a name="06110296000136"></a>

Joshing!</div><a name="06110296000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000429"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is an unusual word, one that I have
never used before, but it is nearly 3 o&#146;clock on a Thursday
afternoon, after what has been&#151;I agree with the hon. Member for
Daventry (Mr. Boswell)&#151;an absorbing and wide-ranging
debate. I suspect that we will not be able to solve all the problems
this afternoon, or iron out all the wrinkles that have been identified.
Hopefully, though, we will make a smooth transition to accepting the
clause.</div><a name="06110296000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to respond to something that the hon. Member for Windsor said, because
he made an important point. Perhaps he did not realise how important it
was.</div><a name="06110296000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000430"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I bet he
did.</div><a name="06110296000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000431"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Perhaps I am underestimating his political nous.
He spoke about discrimination. Introducing a local housing allowance is
about ending discrimination in the private housing market. Like many of
my colleagues from all parties, I see adverts in local papers for flats
or houses for rent with the sentence below, &#147;No DSS should
apply.&#148; By introducing the local housing allowance, we are
dealing with long-standing discrimination against those who receive
housing benefit. We are translating a person from a benefit recipient
to a player in the market.</div>
<a name="06110296000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That links in with the comments
of the hon. Member for Windsor about financial inclusion. It is a
cultural change for the individual, the landlord sector and society as
a whole. Why, when looking for a house, should a person have to
identify their personal circumstances and the relationship between them
as an individual and the state benefit system? A high moral philosophy
underpins the introduction of the local housing allowance, over and
above all the issues of transparency and
simplification.</div><a name="06110296000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000432"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I entirely agree with the Under-Secretary about
the Bill&#146;s intentions, which are admirable. She has put it very
well. Would she not agree that it is yet another way of getting away
from the old idea of the truck system, where things were made available
in kind rather than left to the choice of the autonomous individual? I
am with her on that. Does she also agree that it will be desirable in
the medium term to consider a transition to other forms of social
housing? I did not make the point in my remarks that there is a danger
that if that is not done, a further anomaly will open up or intensify
between the private rental market and the social housing
market.</div><a name="06110296000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000433"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is a long time since I have heard the truck
system discussed. It takes me back to the higher history days that we
did in Scotland while everybody else was doing GCSEs and A-levels. I am
delighted by the historical analogy. I intend to discuss the social
rented sector in more detail later on. We should recognise that the
social rented sector is a different beast from the private rented
sector. There is very limited capacity in the social rented sector to
negotiate rents. That is why&#151;I hope that this will reassure my
hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly and Mrs. Hart, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 453</div>one of the Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government&#151;it is not
our intention to introduce the local housing allowance into the social
rented sector. Yes, it was in the consultation document, but we
listened to the consultation responses and recognised that it would be
inappropriate to roll it into the social housing sector. I trust that
my hon. Friend can take that message and that reassurance back to
Mrs. Hart.</div>
<a name="06110296000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I can get through most of the points that have been made, although I
hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I do not deal with every
specific
detail.</div><a name="06110296000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000434"></a>Mr.

mine.</div><a name="06110296000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000435"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Yes. I appreciate how important
the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds is. He asked very specifically, as
I would have expected of him, given his background, about the funding
of the roll-out. As the hon. Gentleman may be aware, we have set aside
some &#163;62 million to support the national roll-out of the housing
allowance. The precise allocation of the funding has yet to be decided
but, as he also raised in his contribution, the financial support would
also ensure that local authorities could support those aspects of
financial inclusion that were in the pathfinder areas. Those included
help to claimants to access bank accounts&#151;which he fairly
identified as one of the very positive elements in the pathfinder
areas&#151;the provision of basic financial literacy material, such
as how to open a bank account, based on existing DWP literature,
signposting the most specialist advice with debt and money management,
and the citizens advice bureaux. I hope that that will give the hon.
Gentleman some comfort about our analysis of the costs of rolling out
the local housing allowance, although we do not yet know what the exact
benefit expenditure is. There is obviously an administrative side and a
benefit side, and it will depend on the future rents in the private
sector, which we have no way of knowing
now.</div><a name="06110296000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issue of
IT, which was raised specifically by the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds, the five major IT suppliers to local authorities have
developed local housing allowance software. Some modifications have
been needed, but I can give the assurance that the IT will
work&#151;she says confidently. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> We are nodding
in agreement here. If hon. Members see me duck, Mr. Amess,
you will know where the answer originated. We will provide the
necessary funding to ensure that that happens. We have made an
extensive investment in local authorities over the current spending
review, which has put in place a firm basis for further improvements
over the next few
years.</div><a name="06110296000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to the
&#163;15 cap, and why we have decided on that. It was always going to
be difficult to decide where the cap was going to be. However, we think
that the&#163;15 cap strikes the right balance between
providing tenants with a choice over their accommodation and removing
the disincentives to work. As I said earlier about other parts of the
Bill, the cap is very much about encouraging an incentive to work. We
think that the &#163;15 cap is the right amount, and our
understanding is that it would leave about 75 per cent. of the caseload
unaffected, so the overwhelming majority of the recipients of the
allowance would benefit from the cap. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 454</div></div><a name="06110296000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="06110296000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Bury St. Edmunds rightly raised the matter of work incentives. We
cannot change the culture overnight, but local housing allowance is
part of that change. Instead of a person thinking about taking a job
not knowing what the impact would be on their housing benefit, the
greater transparency of the local housing allowance will ensure that
such a person knows how much they will have in their hand to negotiate
for accommodation. Jobcentre Plus advisers will be able to say how much
a person will get, without having to make all the calculations that are
currently undertaken in relation to housing benefit.</div>
<a name="06110296000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members will recognise
that a range of factors have an influence on whether people move into
jobs or not. Housing benefit plays a part, but only a part. We are
doing all that we can to raise awareness of the fact that the new
housing benefit and local housing allowance can be paid to people in
work, because sometimes the information is abroad that the benefit is
available only to people who are not in work.</div>
<a name="06110296000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that hon. Members will
accept that deciding on the &#163;15 cap was a matter of striking a
balance, but we think that it is the right
balance.</div>
<a name="06110296000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000436"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Before the Under-Secretary leaves the subject
of work incentives, will she address the question of the withdrawal
rate of housing benefit? From memory, I believe that the rate will be
65p in every extra &#163;1 earned. That will have a dramatic impact
not only on people&#146;s work incentives, but on their incentives to
progress in work, particularly when one considers the way in which the
rate interacts with the tax credit system and other aspects of the
benefits system.</div>
<a name="06110296000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000437"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I was going to come to that later, but I will
deal with it now. The assessment of the income and the tapers will
remain the same as under the housing benefit system. In that respect,
it replicates the current scheme. Recent research suggests that the
taper is not the main barrier preventing people from moving into work.
Sometimes the barrier is that people lack knowledge as to whether they
can retain their housing benefit and move into work. However, in the
next stage of the reform programme we intend to consider the
relationship between all the elements, including the tax credit system,
which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and housing benefit. Interaction is
an issue, but the research indicates that the taper, although
important, as the hon. Gentleman said, is not the main barrier
preventing people from moving into work.</div>
<a name="06110296000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000438"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> May I suggest that the Minister places the
research to which she has referred in the Library, if she has not done
so already, so that hon. Members can study
it?</div><a name="06110296000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000439"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> If the DWP research has been made public, I will
place it in the Library. Before Monday, the hon. Gentleman may like to
look at the DWP website and he might find that the research is already
there.</div>
<a name="06110296000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000440"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> It&#146;s a wonderful thing to do at the
weekend.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 455</div><a name="06110296000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000441"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Yes, sometimes it can be very cold in Inverness
on a weekend night when there is nothing else to do. They have
broadband now.</div><a name="06110296000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
getting the right size of localities, as the hon. Member for Daventry
pointed out, the issue is a matter of judgment. If we go for smaller
localities, there is a danger that we could create pockets of
deprivation or reinforce deprivation. Having a large number of
localities could increase complexity for claimants and local authority
staff. We have listened to what hon. Members have said on the issue,
and it is a fair point that housing markets are different from area to
area. In the highlands and islands, for example, the housing market is
starkly different from elsewhere. We will reflect on the comments made
on that matter.</div> <a name="06110296000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question whether rent officers should operate with greater
transparency, I reassure the Committee that officers liaise with
stakeholders, such as local authorities. Such situations will always be
difficult. We are demanding greater transparency, and there is a strong
view that, in order to maintain their professional independence,
officers need to avoid undue influence by some stakeholders. Once
again, the key is getting the balance right. We would not necessarily
want to specify in guidance how rent officers liaise, but there is an
increasing amount of consultation and discussion between them on the
matter.</div> <a name="06110296000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
my next comments will allay some of the fears that we have heard
expressed about median rent. Until now, under the current system,
including pathfinders, the rent officers looked at the market evidence
database, which included all the evidence on rents apart from local
authority rents, I think. They then chose to remove the significantly
high and low figures in pathfinders to reach the midpoint. At the
national roll-out, a true median rent will be used. Outliers, as they
have been called, will be excluded. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Member for Colne Valley is reassured that the figure will be a true
median, based on the analysis of rents in the locality; it will not be
an artificial figure, because the outliers at the top and the bottom
will have been knocked off. I hope that that reassures
her.</div><a name="06110296000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000444"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I will send my hon. Friend a copy of the
report, which shows that in some circumstances, the median can be lower
than the midpoint that is used at present, whether the top and bottom
figures are excluded or not. That is a concern. In every case where the
top and bottom figures are excluded, the median is significantly lower
than the midpoint that is being used. Will she consider that
point?</div>
<a name="06110296000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000445"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I would be delighted to look at that evidence. My
understanding is that under the system that we will roll out, using the
median will at least ensure that 50 per cent. of the properties in the
locality&#151;if we can call it that for shorthand&#151;will be
affordable to those on the new local housing allowance. I would be
interested, however, in seeing the evidence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 456</div>that my hon. Friend has highlighted. We are very clear that we want rent
officers to use all the evidence in the area.</div>
<a name="06110296000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying to run through all
the other points that have been made. The change in size criteria was
mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly; I assure him
that the criteria do not mean that the claimants will have fewer rooms.
They mean that local housing allowance rates are set and published
according only to the number of bedrooms in a property, which reflects
the reality of the letting structure. People do not advertise living
rooms and so on; they advertise a three-bedroomed property, for
example, and the new allowance will be calculated on that
basis.</div><a name="06110296000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
from the Welsh Assembly Government has grave concerns about some
aspects of the Bill. I know that she has had extensive consultation and
discussion with the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my
hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr.
Plaskitt), who has primary responsibility for housing benefit. I
appreciate that we may not have allayed all her fears, but we are
certainly well aware of some of the issues relating to the Welsh
Assembly Government. A reassurance has been given that we are sensitive
to those concerns, but we think that the roll-out of the local housing
allowance is in the best interests of those who are looking to rent in
the private sector in Wales, and not only those in other parts of
Britain.</div><a name="06110296000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
linking rules, there is an extended payment scheme, of which
Mrs. Hart may not be aware, that allows an additional four
weeks&#146; continued payment of LHA if somebody moves into work. In
addition, we are not taking the powers to roll out the LHA in the
social sector, nor even to test it. We have given continued assurances
that we shall not do anything like that.</div>
<a name="06110296000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have addressed
most of the points in our wide-ranging debate and that I have allayed
most concerns. I shall finish where I started: LHA will for the first
time put those who are on benefit, and who are looking to rent in the
private sector, into a system that should impact on their ability to
decide whether to move into employment. It is not just a question of
having a system that is more transparent and less complicated. Most
importantly, it will give people on benefit the capacity, for the first
time, to negotiate in the private sector rental market in the same way
as has long been the case for those who are not on housing
benefit.</div> <a name="06110296000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
few&#151;or rather, with those extensive&#151;comments, I commend

you for drawing the Committee&#146;s attention to the correct version
of the amendment, Mr. Amess. The amendment proposes what is
colloquially known as a sunset provision that would ensure that
regulations under the clause would cease to have effect after January
2010. The arguments in favour pertain to the content of the clause, and
I hope that you will permit me to range quite widely, in the hope that
the need for a clause stand part debate may thereby be
obviated&#151;from my point of view at least.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I was going to say that the clause
refers to antisocial behaviour. We may have just seen an example. I do
not think that the hon. Member for South-West Surrey is in receipt of
an antisocial behaviour order, but maybe one would be appropriate. I do
not know what other Committee members
think.</div><a name="06110296000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000448"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b><b class="B"> </b>May I ask the hon. Gentleman to clarify for
the sake of the record why he thinks that it might be appropriate for
me to be in receipt of an antisocial behaviour

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000449"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall not try the Chairman&#146;s patience
too much on that. Throwing bottles around is generally deemed to be at
the antisocial end of the spectrum, although I appreciate that in this
case it was accidental and I withdraw my comment.</div>
<a name="06110296000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are significant concerns
as to the powers in the Bill, as I said on Second Reading. I understand
that the Government intend to pilot the idea, but as Committee members
know, the Bill contains power whereby the housing benefit of someone
who has been evicted for antisocial behaviour can be progressively
sanctioned to nil for a period of up to five years. That is quite a
severe financial
sanction.</div><a name="06110296000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary may wish to clarify, but it seems that the power will
not be that widely used. I have seen figures&#151;I think that they
are public&#151;indicating that the Government envisage 1,500 cases.
I gather that in Scotland there might be six cases where this might
apply. In practice, given the severity of the sanction and the poor
quality of rehabilitation services for antisocial behaviour in many
parts of the country, it may be used much less than that. This power is
in the Bill more to grab headlines than to do anything serious to
tackle antisocial behaviour. That would be my first reason for worrying
about allowing these powers to remain in the Bill and to be rolled out
across the country without any further primary legislation or debate on
the Floor of the
House.</div><a name="06110296000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="06110296000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have listened to the views of a wide variety of external organisations
and I have not been able to find a single organisation that has lobbied
in favour of these provisions. The Under-Secretary may have been
lobbied extensively in favour of them, but I certainly have not.
Whether it is the Social Landlords Crime and Nuisance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 458</div>Group, the Child Poverty Action Group, the British Council of Disabled
People, Shelter, the National Housing Federation and especially the
National Landlords Association, they have all made strong
representations against the inclusion of these powers. There are a
number of reasons for that.</div>
<a name="06110296000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there is the question
that I raised on Second Reading about the impact on families and
children. There is a serious concern that removing housing benefit
could have unintended consequences for the dependants of those people,
whether it is the children of the person who is behaving antisocially
or perhaps the parents if the child is behaving
antisocially.There were reports today, according to a study
for the Youth Justice Board, of antisocial behaviour orders becoming a
badge of honour among young people. Of the 137 young people surveyed,
67 have breached their ASBOs at least once, 42 more than once and six
on six occasions or more. There are already questions about the way in
which this approach is working.</div>
<a name="06110296000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it is the antisocial
behaviour of a child that has resulted in an eviction, the parent may
be unable to control the child and the rehabilitation services may not
be available in that area. As hon. Members know, there are serious
concerns about the quality of rehabilitation services for antisocial
behaviour that are available in different parts of the country, so we
could have a postcode lottery in the implementation of this
provision.</div><a name="06110296000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06110296000450"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): One of the other
elements that has alarmed people, quite apart from a postcode lottery,
is that in the former pit villages that I represent where there was a
lot of social housing and many people exercised the right to buy and
are now private tenants, there is one rule for private tenants and a
completely different one for those people who are in social housing.
From the outside they appear to be exactly the same sort of houses, and
the provision seems to discriminate against those with less
money.</div><a name="06110296000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000451"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Lady makes a very important point and
I was going to come to that. It is yet another reason why a sunset
clause, which would cause the powers of the Bill to lapse after three
years so that the matter would have to come back to the Floor of the
House to be debated before it could be rolled out across the country,
would be a good idea.</div>
<a name="06110296000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another objection to these
powers is that they are discriminatory between people in receipt of
housing benefit and those who are not. There is no such sanction for
someone who is not in receipt of housing benefit. I should be grateful
for the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to this. On Second Reading,
my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) referred to the
idea of probationary tenancies as an alternative to these sanctions as
they could have a wider application.
</div><a name="06110296000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000452"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I cannot forget to allow my civil libertarian
instincts to come out from time to time on these sorts of issues. Does
the hon. Gentleman not agree that the clause appears to set no limits
on the warning that a local authority may issue? Not many people who
have been evicted from a house will have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 459</div>tame in-house lawyer to take them to judicial review, but nevertheless,
I suppose that local authorities always have a duty to be reasonable.
However, there is no circumscription of the powers. The clause does not
even say that they must be relevant to the housing experience as
such&#151;if I may put it that way. Should not that be judicially
tied down a
little?</div><a name="06110296000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000453"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> As usual, the hon. Gentleman makes a useful and
important point, which I hope the Under-Secretary will consider in her
response.</div>
<a name="06110296000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000454"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b><b class="B"> </b>May I take the point
that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha
Engel) raised a bit further? The issue is not about whether a person
lives next door to somebody who is also in receipt of housing benefit,
but about people who live in similar accommodation and who are
sometimes also on low pay or housing benefit. However, the terms of
their tenancies vary, because some people rent from private landlords
and some live in social housing. The problem is that sanctions can
apply in social housing, but no sanctions apply where accommodation has
been bought. People living in such accommodation can cause dreadful
mayhem for the people in their neighbourhood. It is the tenants who
live in the locality who want some sanction to apply, not the landlords
who want their
rent.</div><a name="06110296000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000455"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> My response to that&#151;I thought that this
was the point that the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire was
making, but perhaps I misunderstood&#151;is that antisocial behaviour
can be caused by a range of people, irrespective of the nature of their
tenancy or whether they receive housing benefit. I am sure that the
hon. Member for Colne Valley would not claim that there is a
preponderance of antisocial behaviour among housing benefit recipients,
so her comment does not affect my argument in favour of restricting the
powers in the
Bill.</div><a name="06110296000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000456"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> Just to clarify, the issue really has nothing to do
with housing benefit and everything to do with whether a person is in
social housing as opposed to privately owned housing. That is the
distinction. It is wrong to have additional powers to penalise somebody
for being in social housing rather than a privately owned
property.</div>
<a name="06110296000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000457"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Lady makes a fair point, but my
argument is that the problems that I have identified with the powers in
the Bill are such that they apply whether somebody is in social
housing, private sector housing or whatever. I seek to curtail those
powers with the amendment. She is right that there is an argument for
the same considerations to apply to everybody, but I question the
motivation behind introducing the powers, their potential impact and
the extent to which the Government should be free to continue to roll
such powers out throughout the country without having further recourse
to Parliament through primary legislation. That is what I should like
them to have to do, which is why I seek to have the amendment inserted
into the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 460</div><a name="06110296000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000458"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I slightly disagree with the hon. Gentleman and the
hon. Members for Colne Valley and for North-East Derbyshire on one
point. Of course anyone is capable of antisocial behaviour, whether
they are in the private rented sector, the social housing sector or
whatever. However if they are in receipt of my and other
taxpayers&#146; money, which allows them to live there, I object to
their using that to behave
antisocially.</div><a name="06110296000192"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000460"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Perhaps I am not disagreeing with the hon. Lady, in
which case I am delighted to agree with her. My point is that I object
to such behaviour as a taxpayer. As taxpayers, we are perfectly at
liberty to say that if we subsidise someone&#146;s living costs, we
expect them to use that money to behave responsibly. Furthermore, other
people on the street, who are also taxpayers, feel that particularly
strongly.</div>
<a name="06110296000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000461"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
My point is not that we should not be tough with people who are guilty
of antisocial behaviour. Many measures are available to deal with such
behaviour and Liberal Democrat Members have made proposals for others.
I am just not convinced that this measure will have the consequence
that we all desire&#151;that of curtailing antisocial behaviour. I
suspect that we are all agreed on that. This is a question&#151;to
use an earlier phrase of the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds&#151;about means and practicalities, not ends or
principles.</div> <a name="06110296000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
expressed reservations about the powers in this Bill, I conclude by
asking the Under-Secretary to reflect on another issue. I know that one
of the conditions in the provision is that, in addition to someone
having to be evicted from their tenancy, they would also have to have
refused engagement with rehabilitation services. It is important to say
that the quality of rehabilitation services is patchy across the
country. What proposals does the Under-Secretary have to improve those
services and what right of appeal does she have in mind against these
sanctions, particularly on those grounds? Is she aware&#151;and I am
sure, as the Minister with responsibility for disabled people, that she
will be&#151;of the problem of mislabelling disabled people, who have
been inappropriately served with an antisocial behaviour disorder? Two
out of three individuals described as being involved in antisocial
behaviour have some form of vulnerability, 18 per cent. have a mental
disability and 9 per cent. have a physical disability. Is she really
saying that people who are already in a vulnerable position&#151;for
a variety of reasons, perhaps to do with a lack of understanding among
the services dealing with antisocial behaviour&#151;should have their
benefit taken away as well as being
evicted?</div><a name="06110296000196"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000462"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Does that not give rise to the
thought that has been pursued throughout the Committee&#146;s
proceedings, that those who are threatening sanctions&#151;in local
government and elsewhere&#151;need better training, not just on
disability awareness, but on mental health conditions? They have huge
powers at their disposal to affect the lives of people, whether through
eviction or benefit sanctioning as under this clause. We need to do a
better job in training public sector decision
makers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000463"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I could not agree with the hon. Gentleman more.
That point has been made throughout the deliberations on part 1 of the
Bill. It applies equally here. If the people engaged in administering
the powers do not have the knowledge or understanding of the range of
conditions that they might be dealing with, some extremely vulnerable
people could end up having their benefit taken away from them
inappropriately.</div> <a name="06110296000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful if the Under-Secretary would reflect on that point in
her response and also on what consideration the Government have given
to the impact of these measures on child poverty. That is a serious
matter that the Government have not adequately addressed. I share the
concern of the Child Poverty Action Group that if these measures are
used inappropriately, they could have a serious effect on some
vulnerable young people and families.</div>
<a name="06110296000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all those reasons, I hope
that the Committee will consider supporting this amendment on the basis
that it seeks to restrict the application of powers in this Bill for a
limited period. That would allow the Government, if they wished to do
so, to pilot these measures&#151;to get their press releases out and
so on&#151;but would require them to come back to the House for
further primary legislation before these provisions were rolled out
across the country. This would enable the Government to report back on
the impact they had found in those areas that I have discussed and many
others. Without that, we might be in a seriously difficult position
indeed.</div>
<a name="06110296000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000464"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I rise to support the amendment for one very
simple reason: the Conservative Opposition have a track record of
supporting sunset clauses and this is a sunset clause of great
importance because it relates to a proposal that, to my mind, is easily
the most controversial in the Bill. Frankly, the Opposition have
serious problems with it.</div>
<a name="06110296000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would in effect
turn the clause into a pilot. If the powers are used&#151;I hope that
they are not&#151;Parliament could look at the evidence for the
effect of the powers, not only on the income levels of the adults
sanctioned, but the knock-on effects on the children in a sanctioned
household, if there are any. Parliament would also be able to examine
the approach of local authorities, the advice given to them and, most
importantly, the available rehabilitation services, which should if
successful preclude the need for benefit
docking.</div><a name="06110296000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those
things need to be tested to destruction. One way in which to do that is
to set a time limit for the clause. In that spirit of evidence-based
policy making to ensure good public policy and that those who are
potentially the most vulnerable have their interests protected, I
support the
amendment.</div><a name="06110296000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000465"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I trust that I can provide a reassurance that
will allow the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey to withdraw his amendment and obviously encourage others to
support its
withdrawal.</div><a name="06110296000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
get to what I hope will be the killer point, I shall deal with some of
the general ones that havebeen raised. I agree with the hon.
Member for Bury 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 462</div>St. Edmunds that we should test the clause, not necessarily to
destruction, but rigorously and robustly through the piloting stage.
That is why we want the powers to pilot. I can reassure the Committee
that, during the piloting period, we will discover whether local
authorities find it useful. We have an undertaking already from Sandy
Bruce-Lockhart who has indicated that he is willing, on behalf of the
Local Government Association, to enter into serious discussions with
us. So we appreciate that local authorities need to feel that it is a
useful tool.</div><a name="06110296000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need
to look at whether the sanction is an effective incentive to the
take-up of rehabilitation, which I shall come to in a moment. We need
to look also at the resources needed to set it up and run it, the
impact on landlords and the effect on rent arrears&#151;whether it
will be sustainable. We will consider also the impact on housing and
homelessness, which will include vulnerable people, and on charities
and voluntary bodies, as well as the profiles of those sanctioned. The
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is correct:
we estimate that no more than 1,500 people will be sanctioned because
of the way in which it will kick
in.</div><a name="06110296000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need also to
understand why people are prepared to be evicted when significant
support is offered to them&#151;the imponderable in all this. In a
rational discussion, I would have thought that given the choice between
being evicted and potentially being made homeless or taking up support,
rehabilitation and help with their behaviour, people would accept the
latter. We must have a deeper understanding of why that is not always
the case, although, as the hon. Gentleman said, the figures show that
it is still a tiny minority involved. We need to consider monitoring in
the non-pilot authority areas to see whether there is any significant
difference throughout the
country.</div><a name="06110296000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rehabilitation
and the right support have made a difference to how people operate in
considering their behaviour. In Scotland, the superb Dundee families
project was highly controversial when it was introduced. Many Labour
members were astonished at the bravery of some of our Labour colleagues
in Dundee who agreed to establish that project. That brave step has
proved to be a very positive experience for most of the people who have
been supported.</div>
<a name="06110296000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000466"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As it was such an interesting project, could the
Under-Secretary tell us what it
did?</div><a name="06110296000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000467"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It offered support for those families whose
behaviour was so unacceptable that they were no longer welcome in their
own communities. It took them out of that community and put them into
what was called core housing, a group of houses concentrated in one
area. Intensive work was done with those families. I shall read an
extract from one case study, which
states:</div><a name="06110296000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
problems before I became involved with the Dundee Families Project were
not being able to cope with my kids&#146; behaviour. There had been
complaints from previous neighbours and I was subsequently homeless and
wanted to get a home for me and the kids and I wanted to be happy
again. I was trying to come to terms with the recent loss of my husband
and I was not coping well. I was very depressed at the time and having
panic attacks.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 463</div><a name="06110296000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the images
that the hon. Gentleman conjured up. The letter goes on:</div>
<a name="06110296000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When I became involved
with the Dundee Families Project I was offered help to manage the
kids&#146; behaviour through the Dundee Families Project Parent
Support Group and individual work. The children also got help...We
were living in the project for about eight months before we got our
dispersed flat.&#148;</div><a name="06110296000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
move out of the core housing into a dispersed flat where there is still
support. The letter continued:</div>
<a name="06110296000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
got a lot of support. I owe a lot to the Dundee Families Project for
all the help they have given me for the past20
months.&#148;</div><a name="06110296000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Dundee example is about families, the majority of people that we
envisage would be part of the sanctions regime would, we suspect, be
mainly, but not exclusively, single people whose behaviour is
unacceptable to their neighbours in the social rented sector and in the
private rented sector. Recipients of housing benefit should not be
treated differently in the two
sectors.</div><a name="06110296000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.38

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000468"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Where was I? Oh yes, I was in Dundee. It is a
lovely place to
be.</div><a name="06110296000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000469"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Before the break, the Under-Secretary was
talking, quite rightly, about the achievements of the Dundee families
project. Can she confirm for the record that it did not involve any
form of benefit
sanction?</div><a name="06110296000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000470"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I was using the project as an illustration of the
importance of rehabilitation, not necessarily in connection with our
current proposals. I was asked about the evaluation of the success
rate. Using a variety of care indicators with the most difficult
families, it is about 84 per cent. I was being illustrative rather than
saying that such a process would be used in all
cases.</div><a name="06110296000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000471"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> On the basis of those wonderful results, which
did not require benefit sanction, why is there a mad rush to enact the
clause immediately when, clearly, there are many other ways the results
can be
achieved?</div><a name="06110296000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000472"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thought I had dealt with that matter in my
opening comments about the series of issues that we want to look at in
the piloting process. The amendment is unacceptable to us. In some
respects, that is because of the way in which the parliamentary process
operates. However, I thought it was important to deal with some of the
points raised in the debate. Obviously, there will be a right of appeal
against the imposition of a sanction, as there has been in relation to
all areas of sanction.</div>
<a name="06110296000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I need to be clear: we do not
want people to be sanctioned and we do not want to impose a sanction on
housing benefit. It is important to emphasise that we want people who
have been evicted for antisocial and unacceptable behaviour to be
offered the option of looking at that behaviour with a view to going
back 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 464</div>into housing benefit. The policy will be successful if it encourages
people to take up rehabilitation. If no sanction is imposed, we will
consider the policy to be successful.</div>
<a name="06110296000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are asking
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey to
withdraw his amendment because we intend to commence the pilots for the
proposal as soon as is practical&#151;in the winter of 2007-08. I
assure hon. Members that we are considering pilots of two years only.
At the end of that time, we will decide whether to roll out nationally
on the basis of a full evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme,
using the criteria that I have indicated. That evaluation will include
a full regulatory impact assessment for the proposal. If the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment were to be agreed, the difficulty would be
that there would be no flexibility as to the start time. He is asking
for a sunset clause at a time when, because of the parliamentary
process, we cannot be definite about when we can start the pilots.
However, I can tell the Committee that we are looking at two years
only, and that when we come to discuss the regulations we will have a
much clearer idea as to when the pilots will commence and, therefore,
end. The hon. Gentleman would be proposing a sunset clause without
knowing when sunrise was going to take place, so I ask him to withdraw
the amendment.</div>
<a name="06110296000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000473"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, and I
hear what she says about the parliamentary process. However, on Tuesday
we debated the length of pilot projects, and I tabled a probing
amendment to find out whether she thought that two years was long
enough. She said that she did, and that is the case here too. The
sunset clause is important because the critical issue for me is that
Ministers, having evaluated the pilots, should return to the Floor of
the House to debate the matter. It is not merely a question of rolling
out regulations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000488"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> We have just had quite a wide-ranging debate, but
I wish to flag up one or two points. I am rather sceptical about the
clause and the powers that it contains. I was heartened by the
Under-Secretary&#146;s comments, although not so heartened that I
decided to vote with her. I am not casting any aspersions on DWP
Ministers, particularly the two before us today, who are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 465</div>good eggs, but I shall cast aspersions on the Prime Minister&#146;s
motives. Yes, the end of consensus has
come.</div><a name="06110296000361"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="06110296000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
evidence that proposition by asking this question: how did the clause
get into the Bill? I ask because the Government first floated the
withdrawal of housing benefit from those who commit antisocial
behaviour in their 2000 housing Green Paper. It was acknowledged at the
time, after the consultation, that it would be difficult to reduce or
withdraw housing benefit from a claimant guilty of such behaviour
without adversely impacting innocent family members. After that Green
Paper, Ministers pretty much gotit right. What then happened
was that a DWP consultation paper on the proposed withdrawal of housing
benefit&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06110296000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000489"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid that the hon. Member is not
allowed in the Committee. I kindly ask him to withdraw if the Minister
needs to have a
conversation.</div><a name="06110296000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000490"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> It is a disgraceful diversionary tactic to try to
put the shadow welfare reform Minister off his stride, but it will not
succeed. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> And now the chuntering from a sedentary
position. The Government obviously do not like this very much, but I
shall
continue.</div><a name="06110296000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2000, Ministers in the DWP decided that withdrawing housing benefit
from those who committed antisocial behaviour was a bad idea. They did
not want to go ahead with it. It was then resurrected in May 2003 in a
DWP consultation paper. That paper gave two options. One involved a
sanction triggered by court action, which is what we have here, and the
second involved administrative action without the trigger of court
proceedings. At that time, both options were opposed not just by a
majority but by an overwhelming majority of respondents to the
consultation.</div> <a name="06110296000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
list those who oppose sanctions triggered by court action, which is
materially what is in the clause. They know quite a bit about the
subject: Barnardo&#146;s, the Child Poverty Action Group, the
Children&#146;s Society, Citizens Advice, Crisis, Homeless Link,
Mencap, Mind, the National Autistic Society, the National
Children&#146;s Home, Turning Point and Shelter.</div>
<a name="06110296000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Objections were also registered
by those representing professionals working in the field,
including&#151;the list is not exhaustive&#151;the Association of
Directors of Social Services, the British Association of Social
Workers, the British Property Federation, the Chartered Institute of
Housing, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the Housing Corporation, the
Housing Law Practitioners Association, the National Housing Federation,
the Small Landlords Association, the Social Landlords Crime and
Nuisance Group and the Tenants and Residents Organisations of
England.</div><a name="06110296000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
have obviously been considering the issue and not wanting to get on
with it, because there has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. In the
face of all that opposition, it went quiet for a bit, but not without
others piling in to say that it was a bad idea. Eighteen of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 466</div>the 20 community safety partnerships that responded to the consultation
opposed the sanction because it was not seen as a useful additional
tool. The most persuasive objections came from local authorities
themselves&#151;145 out of the 178 authorities that
responded opposed the sanction, not only because it would compromise
their rental income, but mainly because they wanted to concentrate on
better use of existing powers. Let me underline that point. Opposition
Members are not saying that there should not be tough measures on
antisocial behaviour. As Shelter and others rightly point out, the
victims of antisocial behaviour are often precisely the people whom
Shelter and other bodies have as customers. We all know that from our
constituencies. We are not against tough measures, but we want to know
more about why the existing powers are deemed not to be strong
enough.</div><a name="06110296000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was then
a formal announcement in June 2006 by the Secretary of State&#151;I
keep on getting confused as there are so many of them, but it must have
been the current Secretary of State&#151;on the reintroduction of
plans to withdraw housing benefit from those guilty of antisocial
behaviour. I wonder whether it was all his own idea, or did it have
more to do with the Prime Minister&#146;s respect agenda, which he
wanted to get kick-started? Most people believe that it was a
headline-grabbing measure, inspired by No. 10. That would not be a
great surprise to me. I do not blame the Ministers here today, or
departmental officials; I think that they probably find it as unwise as
all the groups that I have listed find it. That is because there are
existing powers, so it cannot be for any reason other than No. 10
wanted to headline it. That is the way it looks, not just to me but to
many other people. The Under-Secretary made a good fist of defending
that. I repeat: the fact that she says it will be subject to rigorous
piloting and scrutiny is welcome. However, I can assure her that we
will be watching the evaluations of the pilot like
hawks.</div><a name="06110296000252"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000492"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend says from a sedentary position
that we are not doves. Could we be hawkish doves? I do not know, but we
are going to scrutinise it very carefully and look at it like
hawks.</div><a name="06110296000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two final points. First, the clause makes it clear that
rehabilitation services and support will be deployed. I hope that that
will be before any decision to dock the benefit, which is clearly
envisioned in the legislation. That is fine, but there are doubts as to
whether those rehabilitation services will be widely available. My
understanding is that the DWP says the rehabilitation that is
envisioned in the clause will be provided through existing services. Is
more money going to be made available? Can the Minister tell us
specifically about that? In the experience of all of us, current levels
of, for example, drug and alcohol dependency services and mental health
services are not anywhere near good enough. We all share a
responsibility for that; we can always do more and always do better.
However, the hon. Lady cannot rely on the proposal contained in this
clause about their being rehabilitation and warning notices and help
and support before any benefit sanction if those rehabilitation
services are not properly resourced. It is not just about help and
advice with managing one&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000493"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that
the whole point is that many people, such as those we have been hearing
about in relation to the Dundee families project, require the most
intense attention, a greatdeal of time and what might be
called &#147;tough love&#148;. Although it is not clear to me, is
it clear to himwhether the existence of rehabilitation
services in the Government&#146;s terms is a formal condition of
proceeding? If that is so, is there any guarantee written in that those
rehabilitation services have to be of an adequate or appropriate
quality?</div><a name="06110296000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000494"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I
understand that rehabilitation services would have to be provided and
fail before any sanction was deployed. We should be comfortable with
the terms of the Bill. There is a firewall, as it were, in that
rehabilitation services have to be accessed and must be succeeding in
turning around the offending behaviour. However, I am concerned that,
if those services are not adequately resourced, they might not be
adequate. The Under-Secretary needs to say whether the provision will
be funded from existing budgets or whether there will be
additional
money.</div><a name="06110296000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Under-Secretary will be open to a proposal from Shelter and Citizens
Advice that might be worth piloting, in relation to those persons in
hardship&#151;mums and people over 60 and others&#151;who might be
subject to a sanction. Shelter says that the30 per
cent. reduction in benefit, which is part of the current proposals, is
too high and would be quite a big hit to the family finances. Shelter
suggests reasonably that, where there is hardship, the 30 per cent.
reduction should be limited to 10 per cent. throughout the whole
restriction period, rather than there being a 30 per cent. reduction in
the post-eight-week period. The Under-Secretary might want to take that
on board in the trialling and piloting that she eloquently described,
which will happen over a two-year period. Is that is on her
agenda?</div><a name="06110296000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I started by
departing from the path of righteous, but I have veered back. We
appreciate what the Under-Secretary said in the previous debate, but
could she consider Shelter&#146;s proposal and tell the Committee a
bit more about resourcing? I know that, if she had the money, she would
put it in tomorrow. However, there is a question about whether the
Treasury will be similarly
minded.</div><a name="06110296000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000495"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I will be brief. I have a few pertinent points
to make, which I aired in the previous debate but to which the Minister
did not respond.</div><a name="06110296000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
share the concern of the hon. Member for BurySt. Edmunds that
the principal motivation behind these measures is more to grab
headlines than to deal effectively with problems of antisocial
behaviour. This is more legislation-as-Government-press-release than
something that is seriously intended to do the job that all parties
agree on: taking tough measures that will be effective in tackling
antisocial
behaviour.</div><a name="06110296000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the
concern of the hon. Member for BurySt. Edmunds on funding for
rehabilitation services. To 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 468</div>what extent does the Under-Secretary expect that services of the quality
of the Dundee families project will be available in every area of the
country? Will such services have to be available and exist as a
condition before the sanction proposed in the measures can be
applied?</div><a name="06110296000362"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06110296000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
reiterate my concerns about two particular groups of people. The
Under-Secretary has said that the Government intend the measure largely
to apply to single people, but can she be sure of that? I am concerned
about the impact on families with dependent children and child poverty.
I would be grateful if she were to address that
issue.</div><a name="06110296000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also be
grateful if the Under-Secretary were to address the impact of sanctions
on those people, whom I mentioned before, who are wrongly labelled as
antisocial, where the issue might be a consequence of a mental health
problem or a lack of understanding and training. According to some
research, that is the case with 18 per cent. of those who currently
have antisocial behaviour orders. It would be a matter of grave concern
to both sides of the Committee if people who are mislabelled as a
result of mental health problems have their benefits sanctioned,
too.</div><a name="06110296000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, as the
hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has said, it might be useful to hear
the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to the proposal that has been put
forward by Shelter and the Child Poverty Action Group about reducing
the level of sanctions in the case of vulnerable people. I add to that
a question about the unusually lengthy period for which sanctions can
apply, which is up to five years. Will the Under-Secretary tell the
Committee more about the Government&#146;s thinking on having
sanctions in place for such a long
period?</div><a name="06110296000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000496"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I want to ask the Under-Secretary to take
special notice of one group of people. I fully understand the reason
behind the piloting of the scheme and all the safeguards that she has
outlined, which will hopefully bring somebody into line, if we can put
it that way, before any sanction is necessary. The group of people who
I hope receive special attention in the pilot is people experiencing
domestic
violence.</div><a name="06110296000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Domestic
violence is often regarded as antisocial behaviour, but there is a much
deeper concern of which we should all be aware. I know that the police
deal with domestic violence differently in different areas. In my area,
there is a database which should be referred to at every report of any
kind of incident in which a victim of domestic violence is named.
However, it does not always work, and I know that other areas do not
have a similar database. I am anxious to ensure that what is apparently
antisocial behaviour, but is actually of much deeper concern, is
properly accounted for in the
pilot.</div><a name="06110296000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000497"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is worth reflecting on the fact that this is
not the first time that sanctions have been introduced into the
benefits system. Indeed, sanctions have been part of the benefit system
since 1913, so in many respects the Liberals and their successors
blazed a trail on sanctions. I have to admit that I am not sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 469</div>whether the sanctions that were imposed then would be supported by the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and his party
now.</div> <a name="06110296000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
return to the point about the rights and responsibilities agenda. For a
moment, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds lost his warm and cuddly
cool&#151;my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have been taking
bets on how long it would last. My hon. Friend and I will not divorce
ourselves in any way from the respect agenda, because we think it
important that we rebalance the rights and responsibilities agenda in
this country&#151;I know that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
was perhaps trying to make a political point in looking towards the
Prime Minister. I should reassure the Committee that the proposal is
not about antisocial behaviour orders, but about antisocial behaviour
and what we can do to help deal with some aspects of it. It has the
overwhelming support of most of my colleagues in the parliamentary
Labour party, because we recognise that many communities are blighted
by serious antisocial behaviour. Yet, even after eviction has taken
place, there is no current sanction to stop those who make their
neighbours&#146; lives a total misery from going back into the
housing sector with the same rights and privileges. That is a powerful
argument.</div><a name="06110296000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
proposing sanctions against people who are currently in tenancies,
because the most severe sanction&#151;eviction&#151;will already
have taken place. We shall not write off people after eviction, even if
it is only 1,500 people, or the six people in Scotland&#151;I feel
like Abraham trying to find 100 just people. Even if people&#146;s
behaviour has been so bad that the local authority has gone to court,
has presented evidence, and has gone through the long process of
eviction, we will still offer people rehabilitation, if they want it,
to protect their rights under the benefits system. I think that that is
a reasonable deal, given the misery that is sometimes caused by
antisocial behaviour&#151;even in sunny
Inverness.</div><a name="06110296000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000498"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Under-Secretary is
absolutely right. Antisocial behaviour is an incredibly serious problem
and blights hundreds of families in my constituency and in the
constituency of every hon. Member. There is no disagreement in the
Committee on the need to take tough measures to tackle antisocial
behaviour. I referred earlier to an idea proposed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Rochdale, which, while serving a similar purpose, may in
some ways even be tougher&#151;the introduction of probationary
tenancies so that people may lose not their benefits, but their
house.</div><a name="06110296000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000499"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I wonder whether we are talking at
cross-purposes. I have said that the sanction will not kick in until
two criteria are met. One is that the person has already lost their
house, and the second is that they have refused to accept
rehabilitation. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is agreeing or
disagreeing with me, or whether, like many Liberal Democrats, as it is
late on a Thursday afternoon, he is doing both. It is all right for him
to say that he is against antisocial behaviour, but him and his party
need to answer a question. The question concerns the worst offenders,
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 470</div>whom we estimate there are 1,500 in the country, who are so bad in their
behaviour both in the private and publicly rented sectors that their
private or social landlord has gone to the bother and expense of
serving an eviction order. Is he not willing at least to try ways of
bringing those people back into the housing
fold?</div><a name="06110296000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000500"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Under-Secretary spoke persuasively about her
vision of what should happen under the system. If someone behaves
antisocially, goes through the process that she has described, is
evicted, refuses rehabilitation and is then not offered any support for
housing benefit, what will happen next and where will that person
go?</div><a name="06110296000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000501"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> This is the great philosophical argument that we
are all going to have to deal with&#151;the rights and
responsibilities issue. We cannot say that people can opt out of their
responsibilities to other members of their community, and that is not
only in respect of accepting a benefit from the state. The hon.
Gentleman perhaps answered his question in a previous debate, although
a little more starkly than I would have done. I reassure the Committee
that if the individual co-operates with the rehabilitation process and
the support that will be built into it, the sanction can be lifted at
any point. That is what we are seeking to
do.</div><a name="06110296000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">When he returns to
Inverness tonight, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey might wish to reflect on what he will say to the neighbours
of the six people who are so bad that Highland council is going to
evict them if he will not support the piloting&#151;we are not
rolling it out&#151;of the sanction regime. The sanction regime tells
people starkly, &#147;We are at the end of our tether with your
behaviour. We are still prepared to invest in you and we still want to
get you back into the mainstream, but you have to do something
too.&#148; The Dundee projects and other projects have shown that
that can happen, if there is give and take on both sides by the state
and the community and by the
individual.</div><a name="06110296000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the issue of resources, which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds has
mentioned. The Government are investing heavily in rehabilitation. The
respect action plan announced our commitment to establish a national
network of family intervention centres. We are on track to deliver them
in 50 areas by the end of
2006.</div><a name="06110296000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000502"></a>Mr.
Boswell</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="06110296000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000503"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> This might deal with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question. If the appropriate support is not available in the local
authority, that authority would not be able to use the sanction, so the
two go hand in hand. I do not know whether that deals with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question.</div>
<a name="06110296000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000504"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> It helps a good deal with one
of our major worries, but I have a rather narrower question for the
Under-Secretary. The benefit sanction of course applies to the
recipient of housing benefit. The Under-Secretary has said that most of
the cases that she envisages would involve single persons but, as it
happens, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 471</div>much of the debate has been about families, partly because of the Dundee
project. Will she assure the Committee that the rehabilitation support
will be holistic and available to the whole family, notwithstanding the
fact that, technically, only one person stands to lose their
benefit?</div><a name="06110296000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000505"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. We
would not seek to victimise other members of a family where only one
person is the perpetrator of the difficulties. There is a good case for
ensuring that we support the whole family, and we will. To reassure
Opposition Members and some of my hon. Friends, I have said that
sanctions are more likely to be used on single people. The reason why
we say that is that single people are more likely to be evicted for
antisocial behaviour and are therefore more likely to be in the
pool&#151;if I may call it that&#151;to be
sanctioned.</div><a name="06110296000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
new intervention projects have been established since 2003, six of
which have been run by the National Children&#146;s Home and one of
which has been run by Sheffield city council. The rehabilitation
results have been first class, because the process is not only about
reintegrating people into their communities, but about ensuring that
children attend school. For example, there are reports of an 84 per
cent. improvement in school attendance, which illustrates the holistic
approach highlighted by the hon. Member for
Daventry.</div><a name="06110296000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000506"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> There are many such projects, including those in
Aberdeen and other places that the Minister has mentioned, but will she
tell us whether financial sanctions were imposed on the families
involved?</div><a name="06110296000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="06110296000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000507"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I said to the hon. Gentleman earlier that we are
using such projects as illustrations of the benefits of rehabilitation.
Yes, of course they are operating under the current process, but to
repeat my earlier point, the most severe sanction in the instance to
which we are referring this afternoon has already been levied. The most
severe sanction is the eviction of people from their home. We are
providing the opportunity for that sanction to be lifted and for people
to move back into
housing.</div><a name="06110296000283"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000508"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The Under-Secretary made a sensible point about
pilots. Previous exchanges have brought a question to my mind: if the
sanctions are piloted for two years in certain areas but the national
network of rehabilitation is rolled out throughout the country, does
she foresee the evaluation of comparing performance in areas where
sanctions apply with areas in which they do not apply, so that it is
possible to understand whether sanctions make any difference in
themselves to the success of rehabilitation
processes?</div><a name="06110296000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000509"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I have actually already answered that question
and said that a comparison would be made between the piloted areas
where there would be a sanctions regime, if necessary, and those areas
where there would not be a sanctions
regime.</div><a name="06110296000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
pick up on the comment by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, let us
consider the neutral stance of organisations, including the Local
Government Association, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 472</div>to that particular housing sanction because it is significantly
different from the previous ones. As I have said on a few occasions, it
is post-eviction sanction. We appreciate the grave misgivings and
worries that were expressed about a sanction when someone was in situ
in a house in receipt of benefit. However, although issues have been
raised about some of the details, there is a far more neutral approach
to the benefit sanction in principle that we are discussing. The hon.
Gentleman has highlighted the worries about the previous sanctions that
we had put out for
consultation.</div><a name="06110296000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that there was widespread anxiety about such matters meant that we
did not pursue them. However, we still believe that it is important for
those very few people who have tried and tested the system to the nth
degree that we consider another way to deal with such matters. I know
that hon. Members are worried, and rightly so, about people with mental
health difficulties and those who might have behavioural problems. Yes,
that will be part of an assessment involving individuals, households
and their needs.</div><a name="06110296000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reassure the Committee that we do not intend to push people into
rehabilitation services that would not be appropriate for them. I
recognise some of the scenarios that have been presented by members of
the Committee about people with behavioural difficulties that perhaps
can be misinterpreted. We shall obviously be working with local
authorities, many of which will have significant skills in the area of
assessment of those with
difficulties.</div><a name="06110296000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000510"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Can the Under-Secretary say whether she would
like to pilot the proposal from Shelter and Citizens Advice to the
effect that the 30 per cent. docking would be reduced to 10 per cent.
for vulnerable
people?</div><a name="06110296000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000511"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman will understand if I do not
give him a definitive answer to that question. We are aware of the
proposal and I am sure that members of the Committee will come back to
it at further points in the
process.</div><a name="06110296000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000512"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> May I pursue the point about
domestic violence? It often happens that the person who ends up being
evicted was the victim of someone else&#146;s crime. I know of cases
when the whole community gangs up on the victim rather than the
offender and the person is misidentified as an offender when they were
not. If we were to pilot such a project, there would have to be a
proper understanding of how those offences are
pursued.</div><a name="06110296000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000513"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> My hon. Friend speaks words of
wisdom. I recognise the position that she has highlighted and, once
again, that is an area where we shall be working very closely with
local authorities that have expertise and knowledge. I am sure that
they will engage with the local network of voluntary and charitable
organisations that have front-line experience, not only in domestic
violence but, as I said earlier, in particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 473</div>circumstances that, if not handled properly, could result in an eviction
when not all individuals in a household are the perpetrators of
antisocial behaviour. I hope that the Committee will endorse the

am delighted formally and belatedly to welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Amess, this early evening in
London.</div>
<a name="06110296000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000515"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Has the Minister noticed that the sun is about to
set over the shoulders of the hon. Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire (Gordon Banks)?</div>
<a name="06110296000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000516"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I would have noticed, of course, but my hon.
Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire is in Belfast today,
so it would have been pretty difficult. I notice if I turn around that
the sun is in fact setting behind my hon. Friend the Member for
Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown). Of course, the sun always
shines in Dumfries<i class="I">. </i>The sun may be shining in Belfast, but it
may set a little later there because of its latitudinal
position.</div> <a name="06110296000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now come
to the substance of the Bill&#151;the extended payment schemes on
housing benefit and council tax benefit. Clauses 29 and 30 are
technical, as is the amendment. With your indulgence, Mr.
Amess, I shall rewind our proceedings&#151;almost halfway&#151;to
clause 15 to confirm formally to the Committee that a request was made
for the paperwork on private and voluntary providers, and that all 240
pages are in the Library. They will also be placed on the DWP website.
After careful consideration, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I
decided to make them available unedited. All paperwork that was made
available to potential private and voluntary sector contractors and
providers is now available to all members of the Committee and, by
extension, all Members of this House and of another place. Thank you,
Mr. Amess, for your indulgence in allowing me to share that
with the Committee.</div>
<a name="06110296000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extended
payment scheme in the amendment and in the clause is aimed at providing
additional housing benefit and council tax benefit support for people
coming off prescribed benefits for work-related reasons. The structure
of the scheme is similar to existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 474</div>schemes, with the detailed entitlement conditions described in secondary
legislation, thus providing the flexibility to keep the schemes under
review.</div> <a name="06110296000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current schemes, the housing benefit and/or council tax benefit claim
has to be ended before an extended payment can be made. Once the
extended payment ends, a person has to make a new claim if they think
that they might be entitled to housing benefit or council tax benefit.
The purpose of the amendment is to preserve a feature of the current
extended payment scheme. For ease of reference, I shall refer to it
solely as housing benefit, although the same rules will apply for
council tax benefit.</div>
<a name="06110296000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is concerned with
certain people whose housing benefit stops, for example because they
have moved out of their home to start work in another local authority
area. They would not usually receive an extended payment, because their
entitlement to housing benefit would have ended before they ceased to
be entitled to a qualifying benefit for the extended payment. The
subsequent ending of the qualifying benefit for work-related reasons,
one of the basic conditions for the entitlement to extended payment,
would have no effect as the housing benefit claim would have already
been closed. The current scheme allows a grace period if the move takes
place in the week the person takes up employment or in the preceding
week, and the powers in the clause must be amended to allow that to
continue.</div> <a name="06110296000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed amendment would give the Secretary of State the power to
prescribe in regulations a period before the cessation of qualifying
benefit, during which the person would be treated as being entitled to
housing benefit or council tax benefit. The intention is that the
period should be the same as that in the current schemes, making
special provision for cases in which housing benefit and/or council tax

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000517"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 259, in
clause 33, page 28, leave out lines 21 to
23.</div><a name="06110296000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Committee
seems to move in fits and starts: long periods of debate on some
clauses followed immediately by periods of dramatic progress. I intend
to speak to the amendment briefly, because the issues that it seeks to
address have been well aired in earlier debates, not least in remarks
made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley on clause 27. However, it
gives the Under-Secretary the opportunity to answer some of those
points in more detail.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 475</div><a name="06110296000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to probe the circumstances in which the information
prescribed in subsection (1) is to be provided for use by the
Department. Will the Under-Secretary clarify whether information
relating to individual cases will be required to be provided for those
five areas listed in subsection (1)? Is the intention to prescribe
general information about housing benefit or specific details about a
case, relating, for example, to individual child support cases, when
such information may be shared? Will she explain the
Government&#146;s
intentions?</div><a name="06110296000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000518"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I should like to press the
matter a little further. We have discussed, particularly in the debate
on the single room rent restriction, whether rent officers are getting
their decisions right in all cases. There was much disquiet in that
debate about whether they are setting single room rent levels
correctly. It was felt that there could be a vicious downward spiral:
the level was set too low, which led to shortfalls in claimants&#146;
benefits, which in turn they had to make up. That also had a negative
knock-on impact on the supply of suitable properties, which made it
harder for rent officers to determine what the correct rent level
should be.</div>
<a name="06110296000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">One obvious
way to deal with some of these problems and allow a degree of external
verification and audit, and justification as to whether the rent
officers are getting such decisions right, is to increase the amount of
transparency. We could shine a little more sunlight into potentially
murky corners by ensuring that rent officers show their workings when
they take the decisions about the local housing allowance in any one
area. I am sure that it is germane and important for the single room
rent restriction, but it will be important in respect of many other
classes of property.</div>
<a name="06110296000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
earlier amendment about the single room rent restriction was not agreed
to, my suggestion is an alternative way of dealing with the
problem&#151;a point that I was making at the time of that earlier
debate&#151;and it would be tremendously beneficial. I see no
downsides in making the information available to the public and to all
interested parties, so that they can check that the decisions are
justifiable. In the spirit of open government, I therefore hope that
the proposal will be relatively easy for the Under-Secretary to agree
to.</div><a name="06110296000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000519"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Once again, I hope I can allay concerns of the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey as expressed
in the amendment. Clause 33 establishes a gateway, enabling the
Secretary of State to require rent officers to pass information to him
or to a person providing services to him, for various specified
purposes, including social security purposes. The information is
already being provided under existing powers, but the Secretary of
State can only request the information.</div>
<a name="06110296000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking
forward legislation to facilitate the local housing allowance roll-out
has provided a suitable opportunity to enable the Secretary of State to
require rent officers to provide him with information in a manner and
form that is useful to him. The information will include details such
as how many determinations rent officers have made and what proportion
of these have meant that housing benefit has been restricted. In
future, it will also include information about the local housing
allowance rates and the broad rental market rates.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 476</div><a name="06110296000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked what personal information would be
transferred, and I can assure him that we do not envisage that personal
information would be transferred through the proposed gateway. Analysts
tend to make broad assumptions based on their analysis, and that detail
is not necessarily appropriate.</div>
<a name="06110296000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also
answer the question posed by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare
(John Penrose)? I appreciate that there is some concern about the
transparency of the rent officers&#146; deliberations and I hope that
in the last debate I highlighted the fact that there is a great deal of
market evidence and information to be gathered, including that from
professional contacts and letting agencies. It is difficult to see
whether that information could be published in full because there would
be potentially serious consequences. For example, the rates might be
seen as an indicator of a customer&#146;s housing benefit
entitlement, and assumptions that would be very misleading to customers
could be drawn from the unexpurgated information. Dare I say it, it
could also encourage landlords to increase rents and we must be careful
that housing benefit and local housing allowance do not start to lead
the market in determining what the rent could be. If landlords increase
rents, that could increase the shortfalls to the customer.</div>
<a name="06110296000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The average data for each local
authority is published in the Rent Service&#146;s annual valuation
report. Concerns were raised by hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee relating to data transparency, and my hon. Friend the
Minister and I will look at the comments that have been made to see
whether there is anything else we can say or do that will give comfort
to hon. Members on the
issue.</div><a name="06110296000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with all
benefit information that the Department holds, its use will be strictly
governed and controlled. The information will be accessible, as now,
only to certain officials of the Department and then only on an
&#147;if required&#148; basis. Each time the information is
accessed, the access has to be justified by a business case showing
that it is essential for the effective running of the Department. The
business case also has to show that Data Protection Act and European
convention on human rights issues have been carefully considered. The
information is essential to our ability to monitor the impact of our
policies on all DWP benefits, but it is done within a framework of
safeguards. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000520"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her
reassurance on the transfer ofdata. She answered the point
that I was getting at. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000521"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 265, in
clause 33, page 28, line 26, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;122G
 Supply by rent officers of information to
claimants</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(1) The Secretary of
State may by regulation make provision about the obligation of a rent
officer to provide information to claimants of housing
benefit.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 477</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) The Secretary of State may impose on a rent
officer obligations with respect to making available to claimants of
housing benefit information about the basis of calculation of levels of
housing benefit.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3)
Regulations under subsection (1) may require the production of
information or documents used in calculating local levels of housing
benefit.&#146;.</div><a name="06110296000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall dwell on the point about data for a bit longer. Amendment No. 265
deals explicitly with the provision of rent and the making available of
information that rent officers use in making their calculations. It
would allow for the provision of information to claimants and so, by
implication, make that information available more widely to the general
public.</div><a name="06110296000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
and this subject are particularly important, not just in relation to
information on individual LHA rates, but more so to information that
leads to decisions about what constitutes a broad rental market area.
This issue is of concern to Members on both sides of the Committee and
it seems to me that the key issue is this: a decision by a rent officer
about what constitutes a broad rental market locality&#151;to use the
shorthand&#151;has a great impact on people in that area. For
example, would they decide that the entire city of Glasgow should be a
broad rental market area, or would they look within the city and
identify clear local markets where different conditions pertain and
where, in order to maintain the social mix, different LHA rates and
broad rental market areas should be
established?</div><a name="06110296000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
could say the same about rural areas. A decision about whether the
whole of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey should be a broad
rental market area would be of great significance. That is especially
the case because&#151;picking up on a point made by the hon. Member
for Daventry&#151;in rural communities dominated by second homes and
holiday homes, rental prices are likely to be much higher than perhaps
in the more deprived parts of the city of Inverness. So those decisions
can have a real effect on where people can afford to live if in receipt
of housing
benefit.</div><a name="06110296000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">That it is
not possible to understand the basis on which rent officers make those
decisions is a matter of great frustration for many people. The
information that they use to make those decisions is not publicly
available. I welcome the fact that our deliberations have so far been
conducted in a spirit of openness, as was shown by the decision of the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform to make available all
documentation on the contracting-out arrangements. It would be in a
similar spirit of openness if the Government were to adopt the
amendment&#151;it is a simple change&#151;or something like it, to
enable greater public access to information supplied by rent
officers.</div><a name="06110296000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the previous amendment, the Under-Secretary made the point that
making information publicly available could lead either to people
thinking that they are entitled to a certain allowance or indeed to
some landlords seeking to push up their rents to the level of the local
housing allowance. However, those considerations pertain only to
information relating to the rate of local housing allowance. In any
case, the rate of that allowance in pathfinder areas has been published
already&#151;for example, on the Department&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 478</div>websites. Regardless of whether that is the case when the scheme is
rolled out, the rate of allowance for different categories in an area
will be obvious to everyone and so the questions about people thinking
they have an entitlement or landlords knowing what the rate is will
apply anyway.</div> <a name="06110296000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
information that people will need to help them understand the
considerations taken into accountwhen establishing broad
rental market areas will notbe available. That is critical,
and I hope that the Under-Secretary will make it clear that the
Government accept the need for that information to be available in
relation to the broad rental market areas. Even if the amendment is not
acceptable to her, I hope that a suggestion will be made at a later
stage to enable
openness.</div><a name="06110296000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000522"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I wish to give my hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary the opportunity to put it on record that she has agreed
to meet me and representatives of CHAS to discuss the proposal and
other matters, so that we can consider whether a degree of transparency
may properly be supplied. There could be dangers in that, as I outlined
at greater length earlier in our proceedings. I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for her acceptance of our concerns and willingness to consider
them further. I welcome this opportunity to put on record my thanks for
her
help.</div><a name="06110296000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000523"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I should like to restate my concern about
transparency, but I welcome the Under-Secretary&#146;s comments on
the previous amendment. She has said that she will reconsider the
matter, so I do not intend to make a long speech. I await Report with
interest. By that time, with any luck, she will have had a chance to
reconsider.</div><a name="06110296000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000524"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> We are on&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>There was
a lack of a gateway of communication network there with the Whip. We
need to get semaphore
working.</div><a name="06110296000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
comments that I made on the previous amendment also stand in relation
to amendmentNo. 265. We need to be careful how we put
information into the public domain. I appreciate that, under the
current housing benefit rules, it can be confusing for customers to
work out what their housing benefit will be, and that is one reason why
we are introducing the local housing allowance. We are committed to
publishing the rates for that allowance and the broad rental market
areas every month through the Rent Service. That will assist customers
greatly and allow them to see in advance the maximum level of housing
benefit for a particular size of accommodation and what it will mean
for them. It will provide a more transparent system of calculations and
of giving information to
customers.</div><a name="06110296000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure
the Committee that the Rent Service answers questions from individual
customers about how decisions have been made and the direct impact that
they will have on those people. Of course the service must have regard
to public law requirements such as the Data Protection Act 1998 and the
Freedom of Information Act 2000. To ensure transparency and
accountability, the Rent Service will also publish maps of various
locations on its public website.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 479</div><a name="06110296000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hark back to my comment
earlier that it is difficult to publish some parts of the information
gathered, partly for the reason that I gave earlier&#151;the
distorting effect that it could have on the local market. The data
could also undermine customer confidentiality and have an impact on the
relationship with local stakeholders. With those comments, and with
thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley, whose point I
appreciate and whom I will be delighted to meet, I ask the hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06110296000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06110296000525"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> We might wish to discuss this issue again at a
later stage, particularly the information used to define what a broad

fully what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 480</div>Under-Secretary says about the need to keep personal information
confidential, and I accept the worries about individual cases, but I
see no reason why information on the generic decision about where a
BRMA should be and what will constitute one should not be made public.
I accept that the Under-Secretary wishes to consider the matter
further, and I look forward to the results. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06110296000335"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
