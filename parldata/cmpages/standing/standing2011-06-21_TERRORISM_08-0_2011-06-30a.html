                     </span>
                  </strong> This morning, we were discussing clause 10,
which relates to criminal investigations in terrorism-related
activities, and I was seeking to respond to a number of
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One issue
that was raised was the relationship with the relevant senior police
officer at the appropriate police force referred to in the clause. If
there was an offence, it would still fall to a particular force to
investigate it, and that force would manage the order. However, the
national co-ordinator of terrorist investigations advises all forces,
and will obviously continue to do so. The responsibility for
investigating an offence therefore lies with the appropriate police
force, so there is a clear line of responsibility. There will be
engagement with the relevant senior police officer, or the chief
officer, as they are referred to in the clause. The way in which the
clause is intended to operate in relation to the relevant police force
is therefore clear. There is a principle allowing for the delegation of
responsibility, which was mentioned, and consultation will generally
take place at senior official level, but the central state is kept
closely informed of the outcome of such consultations.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000034">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I understand what
the Minister says about the chain of command, keeping things under
review and the Secretary of State being involved in pursuing
prosecutions if possible. When I made the point about police
commissioners, I was not being partisan in any way, but there will be
an issue about them. Could the Minister tell us now, or perhaps later,
what their role will be?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000036">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> There has been quite extensive discussion in
the House of the operational independence of chief officers of police
and the role of the directly elected police and crime commissioner, and
that debate is continuing in the other place. In that context, the hon.
Gentleman will probably be aware of the concept of the strategic
policing requirement and the obligations of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 234<a class="bkMark" name="Column234">&#160;</a>
                  </div>individual police forces to adhere to that requirement in respect of
obligations and requirements that cross borders and require join-up.
That issue has been given careful scrutiny in the House and continues
to be given careful scrutiny in the other place, as the Police Reform
and Social Responsibility Bill proceeds. It is in that context that the
need for that join-up is understood, and the operational independence
of the relevant police chief is part of that arrangement. I do not know
whether that is of assistance to the hon.
Gentleman.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000037">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It is, and I thank the Minister for his
explanation. He has talked about the additional resources that will go
to the security forces because of the terrorism prevention and
investigation measure notices, but I am concerned about how things will
work if those resources come out of the local police force’s
resources. The elected police commissioner will want to have a view
about that. Have the Government thought about what involvement the
elected police commissioner will have?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000038">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That touches on a broader debate about the
strategic policing requirement, because the same arguments could be
made in respect of other types of organised cross-border criminality.
Counter-terrorism and the work that is undertaken to fight it are one
part of the work on the strategic policing requirement. Ultimately, the
police have operational independence to act in the way they deem
appropriate, cognisant of the responsibilities they have in securing
and delivering national security. Such matters will be addressed
through the strategic policing requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000039">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, who is now in

authority for service personnel was dealt with in clause 10, and I
thank him for highlighting that point. We will certainly consider that
further in the context of the Bill, so I am grateful to him. The
provisions in the clause are important as they will aid and assist
investigation. We therefore contend that the clause stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000040">&#160;</a>

that the Minister would offer a response to my specific point about
when a chief constable responsible for the continuing investigation is
a different chief constable from the one responsible for the
supervision of the individual in the agreed location. In my speech, I
pointed out that chief constables may have slightly different
priorities—one may want a slightly looser set of conditions;
another may want a slightly tighter set of conditions. I asked how that
conflict might be resolved, as we would not want the Secretary of State
to involve herself in operational policing. I hope that the Minister
will take the opportunity to respond to that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000041">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is always the way that points are
sometimes inadvertently not addressed when we have a debate that
straddles the morning and afternoon sitting. I apologise to the right
hon. Gentleman; it was my intention to respond to the point that he
raised this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
do not see a conflict. When seeking to attain a TPIM, there is join-up
between the security services, the police and the advice that is given
to the Secretary of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 235<a class="bkMark" name="Column235">&#160;</a>
                  </div>State in seeking to obtain the order, to set the
conditions and attach them. A lead force will be responsible for the
investigation of underlying terrorism-related activity that may be
ascribed to an individual. It will have responsibility for the
consultation duty that is laid out in clause 10. Ultimately, however,
the police have a duty to protect the public too, not just the
Secretary of State. In our experience of control orders, that tension
has not existed. Ultimately, it is for the protection of the public
that everyone seeks to act. Therefore, practically, in terms of the
experience of control orders, and in the application of the structure
in connection to TPIMs, we do not see a conflict. That has not arisen,
and we do not envisage it arising, because ultimately the Secretary of
State, the police and all of us wish to see prosecutions. Equally,
circumstances arise where the protection of the public is the driving
factor, so there is that alignment.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000043">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The Minister must be correct to assert that that
is less likely to be a conflict under TPIM than it may have been under
control orders, if I understand his argument, because it is my
submission that the fact that there is no power of relocation should
mean that the same chief constable responsible for the investigation
would probably be responsible for the supervision of the offender. In a
case where there were different chief constables, would the chief
constable responsible for the ongoing investigation be involved in
discussions about the conditions that the Secretary of State may wish
to
impose?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000044">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> At the outset, the Secretary of State sets
out the conditions of a TPIM notice based on the assessment provided to
her by the security services and the police. That is subject to an
ongoing assessment of its reasonableness and appropriateness. The right
hon. Gentleman will be aware of the continuing duty on the Secretary of
State, which we will come on to in clause 11, to keep under review
whether certain conditions are met. I have no doubt, therefore, that
the Secretary of State will receive continuing advice. We anticipate
that there will be a join-up between the security services and the
police, and they will advise and make appropriate recommendations to
the Secretary of State on a continuing basis. We do not see the tension
that the right hon. Gentleman suggests might occur. The join-up in the
arrangements already exists. We envisage that it will continue and will
deliver on the national security agenda. I hope those comments will
reassure the right hon. Gentleman and that clause 10 will stand part of

places a duty on the Secretary of State to keep under review the
ongoing necessity of both the TPIM notice itself and the measures
specified in it— conditions C and D. In that context, I refer
members of the Committee back to clause 3, which sets out those
conditions. This requirement writes into legislation the effect of
existing case law. In that regard, I refer right hon. and hon. Members
to the Court of Appeal case of the Secretary of State for the Home
Department <em>v.</em> MB. We wish to remove any doubt that, while it
remains in force, a TPIM notice is assessed to remain necessary at all
times. If it is assessed that the notice itself or any of the specified
measures are no longer necessary, this statutory duty will require
either the revocation of the notice or the removal of the particular
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000051">&#160;</a>

well as frequent ad hoc reviews, there will be a formal quarterly
review of each case in which measures are currently in force. This will
bring together all relevant departments and agencies involved in
imposing and maintaining terrorism prevention investigation measures.
The purpose will be to ensure in each case that the TPIM notice and the
measures specified in it individually and cumulatively remain necessary
and proportionate, given the latest intelligence and other assessments.
This review will monitor the impact of the restrictions on the
individual, including any mental or physical health issues and any
impact on their family. If the objective of the measures—the
disruption of terrorist-related activity—is achieved and the
threat that the individual poses is reduced sufficiently, or the
measures are otherwise no longer necessary, the notice would be
revoked. The same goes for any specific
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000052">&#160;</a>

measure is imposed, there is essentially a review by the court. As the
Minister has now told us, although I do not think it is written into
the legislation, it is contemplated that there will be quarterly
reviews to check that conditions C and D remain met during the currency
of the TPIM measure. In the light of what the Minister has just said,
if that is not the case, or if there are changes, alterations to the
specific measure that has been imposed can take place. There is a
slight discrepancy between the regular reviews and the situation in
which the TPIM was initially imposed, because the review mechanism is
not, as I understand it, subject to review by the court,
notwithstanding the Minister’s comments from which it is
contemplated that there may be alterations as a result of which changed
circumstances make an alteration to the TPIM
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000054">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">First,
I am curious to know whether there are any limits on the extent of the
variation that the Secretary of State may apply in any particular
circumstances under subsection (1)(c). If the Secretary of State
decided to add an extra place to the list of those from which the
person was to be excluded, or to bar an association with one additional
individual, we would understand that that was a minor variation.
However, if the information available to the Secretary of State caused
her to vary the TPIM substantially with many exclusions, many bars on
associations and other measures, would she have to apply for a new
TPIM, or could she simply vary the existing one? It is important for us
to know whether the process is only for fine tuning a TPIM. If
substantial changes are required, will it be necessary to start the
whole process
again?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000065">&#160;</a>

second question concerns subsections (2) and (3). Elsewhere in this
carefully layered process of applications for permission, directions
hearings, review hearings and so on, clear time scales are laid out.
The directions hearing must take place within seven days, for example,
and the review hearing must be held as soon as practically possible.

                  </strong> The right hon. Gentleman suggests that a
variation might create the need for a new TPIM. It is worth looking
back to our debates on clauses 3 and 11 with regard to what the
Secretary of State must be satisfied about. Obviously, tests are
applied at the outset for granting a TPIM. To secure the TPIM in the
first place, the Secretary of State has to be satisfied that the person
is engaged in terrorism-related activity, which is condition A.
Subsequent conditions then apply, including condition C, which is
that<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">After
the first hurdle of the Secretary of State being satisfied that a TPIM
is required, there is the question of the terms and conditions or
restrictions that sit alongside it. It is important that the Secretary
of State has the ability to monitor and to consider in the context of
clause 11 but, equally, that she may consider broader security issues
and vary the measures. Clause 12 will retain the flexibility for the
Secretary of State that, given their previous comments, right hon. and
hon. Members will see as necessary and
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000073">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">If
the Secretary of State is minded to make a variation, it does not mean
that a new TPIM is required; she can simply vary the conditions
attached to the TPIM within the scope of schedule 1. Obviously, if
other information comes to light, that might lead to prosecution or
other steps. If a TPIM is granted, conditions will be attached to it
and they can be varied under clause
12.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000074">&#160;</a>

one of their key ways of avoiding being observed too closely was
changing their location every night. Under the regime, does someone

there tomorrow and somewhere else on Thursday. I don’t know
where I will be on Friday, but I will be within the locality”?
Is that acceptable under TPIMs? Will our law-making stop that kind of
action, because otherwise watching will be a real bore for the security

of the issues. The point is that the TPIM regime enables the Secretary
of State to impose the requirements set out in schedule
1.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East also made a point about
an application that may be made by the individual subject to a TPIM. In
such cases, it would be open to that individual to come forward, as set
out in clause 12(2). Clause 12(3)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000077">&#160;</a>

               <p>so
there would be an obligation to consider the case. Public law would
mean that the Secretary of State must consider a variation request
expeditiously, although the complexity of the request may affect the
speed of that consideration. If an individual were to apply and say
that certain changes were required, that might necessitate careful
consideration by the Secretary of State in conjunction with the police
and the Security Service. I would hesitate about acceding to a request
for a specified time frame in which the matter should be considered,
and I would prefer to rely on broader public law principles to ensure
that the matter is considered fairly and in the appropriate time scale
required for proper consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000078">&#160;</a>

majority of cases in which a revocation notice is served, since in most
circumstances, it would not be appropriate to revoke something that had
impacted on an individual with effect from an earlier date. We believe,
however, that that does not provide sufficient flexibility for cases
when the court directs the Secretary of State to revoke a notice with
retrospective effect. The intention is that the court has the power to
make such a direction. It has such a power under the control order
regime, and we do not intend to reduce that power under the TPIM
regime. I assure the Committee that the normal practice—when the
Secretary of State revokes an order because she has reached the view
that it is no longer necessary—will remain. The revocation
notice will take effect when the notice is served or at a specified
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000088">&#160;</a>

cases when revocation from an earlier date may be necessary. That is
likely to happen only in cases when the Secretary of State is directed
to revoke a TPIM notice by the court. An example of that would be if
the court concludes that while it had originally been necessary to
impose a TPIM notice on an individual to protect the public from a risk
of terrorism, that notice had became unnecessary at some point during
its duration. The court may then direct the Secretary of State to
revoke that order from that
date.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000089">&#160;</a>

amendment, it seems that clause 13(2) could simply specify that the
revocation took effect at the time specified for this purpose in the
revocation notice, thus placing an obligation on the Secretary of State
to put a time in the revocation notice, which would be sensible. I will
certainly not oppose the amendment, but I wonder whether further
consideration could be given to the matter as the Bill continues its
progress. Having a revocation notice that takes effect on service seems
possibly unnecessary and undesirable. There may be disputes about when
service takes place. The Government might find it more sensible to have
a time set out in the notice as to when the revocation takes
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000090">&#160;</a>

to this, because I cannot remember it from my perusal of the

required? Is ordinary service sufficient? Does service take place at
the time that this is posted through someone’s letter box? If
personal service is required, is it sufficient if it is served on
someone’s personal representative? Is it possible to obtain an
order for substituted service from the court? The Government would not
get into any of those difficulties if they simply set out a time at
which the revocation takes effect. The only point that I am
making is that the subsection should be amended to make it clear that
revocation takes effect from the time set out in the

                  </span> I have an exploratory
question on how the clause will operate. Under clause 13(6)(a), the
Secretary of State may agree a revival notice when a TPIM has expired
and has not been extended for a further year under clause 5(2). I am
unsure how that measure will interact with clause 13(9), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“A
TPIM notice which is revived…comes back into force when the
revival notice is served or, if later, at the time specified for this

               </p>
               <p>Could
that allow a TPIM notice to be served for a  year, to expire,
and then, after six months, to be revived by the Secretary of State on
the grounds set out in clause 13(6)(b) if conditions A, C
and D were met? The measure does not require condition B to be met,
which provides that there must be new terrorism-related activity. We
might have information about terrorism-related activity and serve a
TPIM notice for a year. We might then have a fallow period for six or
nine months. After that, could we revive the TPIM notice without having
to show that condition B
applied?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
core argument for the two year cut-off point might be that by the end
of two years someone’s networks and associations have degraded
to such an extent that the Secretary of State is content for TPIMs to
come to an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 242<a class="bkMark" name="Column242">&#160;</a>
                  </div>end and surveillance to be enough. It would therefore appear
contradictory to allow for an open-ended situation if the first TPIM
had not been extended for a second year. In theory, we could come back
five years later, without needing evidence of new terrorism-related
activity, and use the same evidence to revive the TPIM notice. Will the
Minister say whether such circumstances are envisaged? Perhaps five
years is a bit extreme, but I can well envisage a six-month fallow
period of intensive surveillance, after which people might seek to
revive a TPIM notice without evidence of new terrorism-related activity
because the surveillance has been
insufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000099">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I wish to raise two not entirely unrelated
points, which develop my comments on clause 11. First,
because there is no requirement to satisfy condition E,
there will be no subsequent supervision by the court of the revival of
the notice. Notwithstanding that, the Secretary of State would be
seeking to revive a notice that had been revoked and removed, which
would mean that she had previously concluded that it was unnecessary.
Might the Government consider giving the court the same supervisory
role at that stage, which would be consistent with the Bill’s
principles, so that the Bill hangs together?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
subsection (3) gives the individual the right to make an application to
the Secretary of State for the revocation of the TPIM notice. Again, I
understand that at that stage there is no court supervision, whereas
the TPIM notice under clause 11 will be regularly considered by the
Secretary of State. It is entirely possible to contemplate
circumstances in which there is a regular review by the Secretary of
State, who comes to the legitimate conclusion that the TPIM notice
should continue. Given a change in circumstances, however, that
conclusion might be open to challenge. However, it would be open to
challenge only if the individual knew the change in circumstances, but
they will not, because they will not have access to the same
information as the Secretary of State. I am concerned, in the context
of subsection (3), about the fact that because under clause 11 there is
no regular court review, the individual, who might have had a right to
apply to revoke the TPIM notice, will not know that, because the
evidence available to the Secretary of State on the regular review is
not available to him or her, and there is no court oversight during the
process. The Government need to consider that, given the way in which
the Bill—and indeed the previous regime—interferes with
the liberties of the
citizen.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000101">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It may help if I set out some of the
background. Clause 13 makes provision for the revocation of a TPIM
notice, and for the revival of such a notice in particular
circumstances. The individual who is subject to the notice may at any
time apply to the Secretary of State for it to be revoked, and the
Secretary of State is under a duty to consider such an
application.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State may also revoke a notice at any time, whether or not
such an application has been made. That is important as it ensures
that, where a notice is no longer necessary, it can be revoked without
delay. As we have already discussed, the Bill makes it clear that a
notice and its constituent measures can and should remain in place only
when necessary, with a requirement for a review of ongoing necessity,
as set out in clause 11, being a key element of the process. It is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 243<a class="bkMark" name="Column243">&#160;</a>
                  </div>vital that we can respond flexibly to any change in circumstances, or
any assessment of risk that may affect the need for the
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are some circumstances in which a notice may no longer be necessary and
may therefore be revoked, or where a notice may subsequently become
necessary again. An example would be when an individual who was subject
to a TPIM notice was detained in custody, at which point the measures
might cease to be necessary. In such circumstances, it would only be
right that the notice be revoked. However, if the individual were
subsequently released from custody, perhaps after only a few months,
and still posed a threat, the measures might again become necessary to
protect the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
ensure that there is no public protection gap in those circumstances,
subsection (6) provides a power to revive a previously revoked notice
where conditions A, C and D under clause 3 are met. Those conditions
require the Secretary of State reasonably to believe that the person is
or was involved in terrorism-related activity, and to consider that the
notice and each of the measures are
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
individual would have the right of appeal to the High Court against any
decision by the Secretary of State to revive a TPIM notice. That is
provided by clause 16(1), and I direct my hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham to that provision. I am happy to
examine the appeal rights in clause 16 if there is something that has
not been addressed, but in framing that clause we always envisaged that
the matter would be dealt with as I have explained.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The power of
revival does not apply to a notice revoked on the direction of the
court. Clause 14 provides a separate power for a new replacement notice
to be imposed in such circumstances if necessary. In those
circumstances, not only must conditions A, C and D be met, but the
court must grant permission before any new measures may be
imposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The power
provided in subsection (6) allows the Secretary of State to revive a
notice that has expired after 12 months. That is intended to cover a
situation in which a notice is imposed, as all notices will be, for
12 months, at the end of which period it is not necessary to
extend it for a further 12 months. In addition, because those
circumstances have come about at the time at which the notice is due to
expire, it is allowed to expire, rather than being revoked.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such a
situation is likely to be rare, but could arise, for
example, if an individual were taken into custody at the point when the
TPIM notice would otherwise have been extended for a second year. In
such a case, it might subsequently become necessary to revive the
notice if the individual was released from custody but continued to
pose a threat at that point. Again, conditions A, C and D would have to
be met for that power to be
exercised.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
notice revived under clause 13 does not start the clock on a new
two-year time limit. To ensure that the time limit—a key part of
the Bill—is not circumvented, subsection (9) makes provision for
the duration of a revived notice. In the case of an order that expired
at the end of the first year, the revived TPIM notice would be in place
for a full second year.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the case
of an order revoked part-way through a year, the revived notice would
be in force for the length of time for which the notice would have
remained in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 244<a class="bkMark" name="Column244">&#160;</a>
                  </div>force if it had not been revoked. Therefore, if the
notice had been revoked after four months, the revised notice would be
in force for eight months. In effect, the clock will be stopped at the
point of revocation and will continue where it left off if the notice
is revived. That will ensure that an individual is not subject to the
measure for more than two years without evidence of further engagement
in terrorism-related activity. It will also ensure that the public can

                  </strong> The Minister has given us an illustration in which
a notice might expire and then be revived when someone is taken into
custody. Clearly, if someone is in custody, the public are being
properly protected. The scenario that I put to him was slightly
different and I would welcome his view on that. Let us say that a
notice for one year expires and is not renewed at that point. There may
then be a period of surveillance, perhaps for six to nine months, which
results in no new evidence of involvement in terrorist activity.
However, it is still open to the Secretary of State to revive the TPIM
for a further year. The effect will be to have a protective regime for
longer than the two-year cut-off point in the Bill. That is
contradictory to some extent, if the main reason for having a two-year
cut-off is that by the end of two years, the networks will have
degraded and the association will not be strong, so the public will be
safe. However, the Minister is contemplating a longer period without
new evidence of involvement in terrorist
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000112">&#160;</a>

making. I have given a scenario where we believe that the measure is
appropriate for someone who is in custody and released in that way.
While we are always able to consider scenarios in Committee, I think
she accepted that that was unlikely to happen, because of the
requirement in condition C that it must be “necessary”.
That is one of the factors underlying the revival provisions in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000113">&#160;</a>

                  </span> It is a pleasure, Mr

rapid progress, but I would be grateful for a little clarity on a
couple of points. If I had had years of legal training, I would not
need to raise such points. Subsection (1)

               <p>Will the Minister
clarify what that rules out? As I understand it, normal appeals in
criminal law can be on a question of law or if there is new evidence.
Presumably, if there was new evidence, one would want to still have an
appropriate mechanism to check that that actually fits in. I also want
to be sure that the clause would not mean that there was not access to
the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights.
I particularly want the Minister to confirm that article 6 rights would
not be prejudiced. I am sure that that is the case,
because the Secretary of State would in any case be obliged to act in
compliance with those measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000126">&#160;</a>

harsh thing to deprive an individual whose liberty has been restrained
of the right of appeal, allowed by a judge of first instance, to the
Court of Appeal, and indeed thereafter, except on a question of law.
Will the Minister undertake to look at the matter? Perhaps I may
respectfully suggest that a more sensible limitation would be that no
appeal should lie on any question other than a question of law, without
the permission of the first-instance judge. There should be an
automatic right of appeal on a question of law, and a right of appeal
with permission from the first-instance judge on a question of fact, or
on a mixed question of fact and law.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000130">&#160;</a>

states:<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000132">&#160;</a>

               <p>That
is a concept with which my hon. and learned Friend and my hon. Friend
will be familiar, and it reflects safeguards that exist in other
circumstances. On the specific point raised, if the individual finds
fresh evidence in relation to the proceedings that would, for example,
undermine the case deriving from the fact that the Secretary of State
has reasonable belief in the individual’s involvement in
terrorism-related activity, he or she may request the Secretary of
State to revoke the notice under clause 13(3). If the Secretary of
State refuses, the individual has a right of appeal against that
decision—in other words, we get into the debate on clause 16(4).
Such a right is applied in that way under clause 18, but under those
circumstances, a mechanism already exists. I hope that is helpful to my
hon. and learned Friend and to my hon.
Friend.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000133">&#160;</a>

go to the court. Appeals are concerned with circumstances where a judge
has got it wrong; this is different, as we are contemplating a
situation in which the Secretary of State gets it wrong and then the
judge of first instance gets it wrong. The Bill deprives people of
fundamental rights and liberties. In those circumstances, I suggest
that with the permission of the judge—who may well say that the

                     </span>
                  </strong> Let me talk through the issue in relation to
the law. Subsection (1) makes it clear that an appeal may only be
brought on a point of law from any determination by the High
Court—or its equivalent in Scotland—in relation to TPIM
proceedings. That does not affect the judicial safeguards set out
elsewhere in the Bill such as the initial court permission
stage, the full review and the various rights of appeal. We
have already discussed the test that will apply to those
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the
context of the full review and the various rights of appeal, the High
Court will substantively consider the merits of the Secretary of
State’s decisions in each case. A subsequent appeal from the
determination of the court of first instance in those
proceedings—the High Court—is limited to an appeal on a
point of law. That includes an appeal brought by the Secretary of
State, as well as by the individual subject to the measures. We judge
that limitation to be appropriate because in such cases, the court of
first instance is the appropriate fact-finding body. It has developed
particular expertise and a body of knowledge in this area of national
security, and it has an experienced body of judges who hear those
cases. That makes it the right court to review all the material on
which the Secretary of State relies to make her decisions, and to make
findings on that
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000136">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
such cases, it is right to limit the right of appeal to a point of law,
because the higher courts do not necessarily have the expertise or
resources to reconsider the entire factual basis of the case, and it
would not be appropriate to have two further opportunities for a full
re-hearing of the case—at the Court of Appeal and at the Supreme
Court. The limitation on appeals to a point of law is by no means
unique to the Bill; there is a similar provision in the 2005 Act, which
picks up the point made by the right hon. Member for Salford and
Eccles. It occurs in numerous other contexts, including, classically,
in relation to appeals from statutory tribunals, such as the Special
Immigration Appeals Commission, which is a recognition of the body of
expertise that has developed in tribunals of first
instance.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2) means that the individual subject to the measures, or any person
other than the Home Secretary, may not appeal against a court
determination at the initial permission stage or on a reference
following the use of the urgency procedure. That reflects the role of
the first stage of judicial involvement as an initial safeguard, at
which the court considers whether the Secretary of State’s
decisions were obviously flawed, and which may be heard without the
knowledge of the individual who is subject to the measures. The
individual has the opportunity to be present and to be represented at
the automatic full review of the measures, once they have been imposed,
and will also have the full right of appeal contained in clause
16.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000138">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am tempted to embark on a long explanation of
why I have fundamental problems with the whole approach to special
advocates. Problems are introduced into our legal system when an
advocate knows information but cannot adequately discuss it with the
person they represent. The situation raises issues about whether there
is an adequate brief and an adequate right to
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000143">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
the interests of time, however, I will truncate my comments—I
made similar ones on Second Reading, and Members will be familiar with
my concerns. I accept that there has to be some mechanism to deal with
such intelligence, but I am very concerned about this one. I do not
want to reopen the entire row, however, so it will be helpful if we can
move on from
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
continue to be concerned about the system, and we also heard such
concerns from special advocates. I will not read all their evidence
back into the record, but they made a few specific suggestions. In the
briefings we received, there were interesting points about having a bit
more flexibility on their ability to communicate with their client
about such things as the timing of meetings. Even if the Minister will
not suddenly change the Government’s entire line on special
advocates, I hope that he will look carefully at their suggestions and
see if any can be accepted. The Home Office report stated that there
would be a review of such evidence, and I believe that a Green Paper is
coming. It will be helpful if the Minister can tell us where we are so
that we can take a measured step away from the use of special advocates
and secret evidence, whenever we can avoid using
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000145">&#160;</a>

highlighted about clause 18 by my hon. and learned Friend the Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham. Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998
provides that public authorities must act in a way that is compatible
with the European convention on human rights. That law is generally
applicable, so there is no need to make additional provisions to that
effect in the Bill. Indeed, the advice that I have received suggests
that unnecessarily repeating provisions in such a way is “poor
drafting practice”.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000146">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend tries to draw together the separate points of special
advocates and closed evidence. Focus has, quite reasonably, been
attached to the issue. The Government are carefully considering how
closed or secret evidence may apply. As my hon. Friend is aware, the
case of AF (No. 3) related to what was considered to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 249<a class="bkMark" name="Column249">&#160;</a>
                  </div>be a stringent control order. In such circumstances, controlled
individuals must be given sufficient information about the case against
them so that they may give effective instructions to their special
advocate. That, in effect, means that such individuals must be given
the gist of the key allegations against them. The High Court judge
reviewing each case will decide on the disclosure required to allow a
fair trial in such circumstances. The rules will provide that it is the
court, not the Government, that decides whether material may be
withheld.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the judge
concludes that certain material must be disclosed to allow a fair
trial, even if that disclosure would be damaging to the public
interest, the Secretary of State must either disclose it, or withdraw
it from the case, meaning that the material could not be relied on. It
is true that that would not necessarily involve the individual knowing
the detail or the sources of the evidence that forms the basis of the
allegations against them. The Law Lords ruled that that was not
necessary to meet the requirements of a fair trial in such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
clear reasons why it would not be in the public interest to disclose
all information, such as if the information came from an informant who
might be put at risk, or if it was obtained using an investigative
ability that might be compromised. The Law Lords, however, were equally
clear that the requirements of a fair trial would not be satisfied if
the case was based solely or mostly on closed material while the open
material consisted purely of general assertions.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph 5
of schedule 4 expressly provides that nothing in this rule-making
provision, or in the rules of the court made under this provision, is
to be interpreted as requiring the court to act in a way that is
inconsistent with article 6, so that reflects the case law that has
developed with control
orders.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000152">&#160;</a>

for putting on record the effort that is being made across the

have to be in this territory. We all want evidence to be tested in open
court so that a jury is able to hear it and reach a verdict in our
conventional legal system. Unfortunately, in some circumstances, we
must have a special advocate

Minister will have talked to ministerial colleagues in Europe and other
jurisdictions who are struggling with exactly the same problems, so it
is not the case that we have a particularly illiberal system for secret
and closed information. I say to all Government Members that these are
very difficult issues. No one wants to be in the realms of closed
sessions without defendants knowing what is being put against them, but
we have to balance with that the protection of not only our own
intelligence, but that from other sources, on which we rely enormously
to try and keep our country safe. I am grateful for the

of State to report to Parliament quarterly on the exercise of her
powers under the Bill to impose a measure on a person by a TPIM notice,
to extend a notice, to vary the measures specified in a notice, and to
revoke or revive a notice. Although the details of the operation of the
system and of particular cases will be sensitive and therefore could
not be disclosed publically, the clause will ensure that key
information about the operation of the system will be in the public
domain and regularly updated. Crucially, the report will include
information about the extent of the Secretary of State’s use of
her powers and the number of cases in which measures are imposed. It

making public as much information as they can, but we need to be
cognisant of issues that might damage national security, the effective
operational management of the TPIM system or an individual’s
right to a private life, should they be identified. There are therefore
understandable and reasonable limits. However, as I have indicated,

               <p class="tabbed">Again,
the amendment is self-explanatory. Clause 20 gives the Secretary of
State the opportunity to appoint an independent reviewer who will
prepare an annual report on the operation of the Bill and lay it before
Parliament. The amendment would provide that that would have to happen
within three months of the Home Secretary receiving the report. That is
important because of the reduction of parliamentary scrutiny. The
report will be an important indication of how things are working and
the independent reviewer’s view. We believe that we should have
that at the earliest opportunity, so the amendment would give the
opportunity for that report to be in Parliament within three
months.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000177">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We do not believe that it is necessary to set
a maximum period by which a report from the independent reviewer must
be laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State, as suggested under
the amendment. I shall explain why, but the hon. Gentleman will no
doubt consider further my
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Reports
by the former independent reviewer, Lord Carlile, on the operation of
the 2005 Act were promptly laid before Parliament by successive
Governments. As the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles will know,
they were often laid a matter of days, or at most weeks, after the
receipt of the report. A similar approach is taken in respect of other
reports that the independent reviewer is required to produce and the
Secretary of State to publish, such as the annual report on the
operation of the Terrorism Act 2000 and part 1 of the Terrorism Act
2006.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would not alter current practice. In our judgment, it is not
necessary—in this or any other context in which the Secretary of
State would be required to lay an annual report before
Parliament—to specify a maximum time frame. Opposition Members
took the same view when they passed successive pieces of legislation
with almost identical provisions to those in the Bill.

language of immediacy, because clause 20(5) says that the Secretary of
State “must lay a copy”. Why not use the language of the
2005 Act, which states that on receiving the report, it will be laid?
That wording suggests a degree of urgency and immediacy. I commend the
words of the 2005 Act, the provisions of which the Minister has been so
keen to replicate throughout the rest of the

                  </strong> These Government amendments are technical
drafting amendments. They do not represent any change to policy.
Amendment 131 simply ensures that the offence is more clearly and
consistently framed, so that both subsections (a) and (b) of clause
1(1) refer to the “the individual”. Amendment 132 may
look more significant, but in fact simply ensures that there is no
potential ambiguity as to whether the drafting of the Bill delivers the
existing policy intention as explained in the explanatory
notes.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
explanatory notes explain that the offence extends to the breach by the
individual of any permission granted to the individual by the Secretary
of State in respect of a measure in a TPIM notice. If the Secretary of
State grants permission under schedule 1 for the individual to do
something that the TPIM notice otherwise prohibits that individual from
doing, and grants that permission subject to conditions, a breach of
those conditions without reasonable excuse will constitute an offence.
For example, should the Secretary of State allow the individual to
attend a place from which he is otherwise excluded by his TPIM notice,
subject to the condition that he is escorted by a constable, if the
individual attends that place other than under police escort, that
would constitute a breach of the exclusion measure in the TPIM notice
and therefore, in the absence of a reasonable excuse, it would be a
criminal
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
considered the detailed drafting of clause 21, it became clear that
there might be ambiguity as to whether a breach of the terms of a
permission would definitely be caught. As it is undesirable to have any
such ambiguity about what constitutes a criminal offence, the
Government amendment will ensure that the Bill clearly reflects the
stated policy
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000193">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Will the Minister be candid with the Committee
about clause 21? What thought has he given to the additional challenge
and difficulty presented to the law-enforcement agencies as a result of
the changes in the Bill and the fact that it means that there will be
greater reliance on surveillance than under the control order regime,
which may make it far more difficult to sustain a
prosecution?<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are dealing with individuals about whom we have information that is not
admissible as evidence in court, so we cannot prosecute, although we
may continue to try to do so. That is why they are subject to a control
order or, in the future, to a TPIM. If an individual contravenes the
conditions placed on him, he is liable to prosecution. With the
overnight residence measure, such a contravention can be objectively
measured, because he would presumably have an electronic tag. If he
broke that condition, there would be a proper record and that could be
used as evidence in court. However, the evidence for a contravention
might be based on intercepted telephone conversations or intelligence
provided by someone working under cover in a surveillance operation,
and such information would not be admissible in a
prosecution.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister should be candid with the Committee about what thought he has
given to that issue. To return to the mantra that we have repeated many
times in Committee, because the restrictions are less stringent, the
risk is greater. The Minister argues that that is mitigated by the
additional money but, in my submission, it will be more difficult to
sustain the prosecution of someone who has contravened the conditions
in the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 255<a class="bkMark" name="Column255">&#160;</a>
                  </div>TPIM. Will he be straightforward and tell us how he intends to address
that deficit? We all agree that someone who is not keeping to the
conditions should be subject to the law, prosecuted where possible and
imprisoned. I look forward to hearing the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000196">&#160;</a>

rehearsing arguments that we have already had. However, I say to the
right hon. Gentleman that additional police and surveillance might make
it more likely that an offence is triggered—information might be
identified that shows an offence has been committed under
clause 21. We have had a range of debates over the nature of
the regime and the additional support that we see as mitigating the
challenges that could arise. I hear the point of principle that he has
consistently made in Committee, but we have been through that several

who is watching to see whether a suspect keeps to the conditions
operates under cover or if their information is based on a sensitive
source that could not possibly be compromised, that evidence could not
be used to prosecute the individual for contravening those conditions.
In some circumstances, the additional police presence might assist, but
the Minister must be candid and say that it might not. An officer might
be operating under cover and might not wish to have his identity
revealed. He might be working with a source that is sensitive and
cannot be compromised. It might not be as straightforward as the

the challenges in the area, of which right hon. and hon. Members will
be well aware. Obviously, other provisions apply—we might come
to them in due course—on powers of entry to check compliance
with the terms of the TPIM notice and identify whether breaches have
taken place that are actionable under clause 21, but the duty is on the
Secretary of State to bring a prosecution and make out the case in the
ordinary way, with admissible evidence, in order to persuade the court
that a breach has taken place for which no reasonable excuse can be
proffered in defence of the individual’s actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000199">&#160;</a>

complexities on both sides involving the limitations of law on
admissible evidence with which we in the Committee are all familiar.
Equally, additional support to the police and security services
mitigates risk and, in certain circumstances, might enable breaches and
offences under the Bill to be identified and prosecuted. I accept that
limitations apply under the law as to the admissibility of evidence and
the need to adduce the evidence that can be brought before the court.
We do not take such matters lightly. No doubt we will continue to

                  </strong> Actually, no. Clause 22 gives effect to
schedule 5, which provides for police powers of search, entry, seizure
and retention in a number of scenarios relating to TPIMs. The Bill
takes a different approach from the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005,
which did not set out on the face of the legislation the main powers
relating to entry and search. To be fair to the hon. Member for
Bradford South, that was a point that was recognised by the right hon.
Member for Salford and Eccles in our discussion on Tuesday, when she
rightly challenged me on the need to have rights of search and entry.
She did not move her amendments and I did not thank her at the time for
her generosity in doing that. I want to put my thanks on record. There
is a difference and distinction in the Bill by expressly setting out a
number of these provisions. I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Bradford South for allowing me to underline the differences contained
in the Bill as contrasted with previous legislation. I thank him for

                     </span>
                  </strong> Mr Scott, I believe that it would be in order
for me to respond to the hon. Gentleman’s comments. We consider
it important to ensure that the rules on taking and retention of
biometric material from individuals subject to TPIM notices are not
exceptional, but are in line with the provisions we are making
elsewhere for similar cases. The schedule makes separate provision for
Scotland to that for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to ensure
that it is line with the different police procedures and legislation in
Scotland.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
powers to take from a person subject to a TPIM notice both
fingerprints—including palm prints—and non-intimate
samples, which can include a sample of hair, a sample taken from a nail
or under a nail, a swab taken from any part of the body including the
mouth, saliva and a footprint or other impression of a part of the body
other than the hand. The individual may be required to attend a police
station for the purpose of taking fingerprints or a non-intimate
sample. That material may be checked against other such material held
under a variety of other powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000221">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 258<a class="bkMark" name="Column258">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">As the
Committee may know, in the Protection of Freedoms Bill we are
introducing a new regime for the retention and destruction of such
material with the aim of striking a fair balance between protection of
the public and individual civil liberties. The schedule makes
provision, in line with that regime, for the retention and destruction
of material taken under this Bill. That means that any samples taken
from the individual will be destroyed as soon as a DNA profile has been
derived from that sample, or, if sooner, within six months of taking
the sample. It also means that, where the individual has no relevant
previous conviction, the fingerprints and DNA profile may be kept for
only six months after the TPIM notice ceases to be in force, or, in a
case where the notice has been quashed, until there is no further right
of appeal remaining against the quashing. However, there is an
exception for cases in which a chief officer of police determines that
it is necessary to retain the material for national security purposes,
in which case the material may be retained for up to two years. It will
then be open to the chief officer to make a further determination, if
necessary, that the material should be retained for a further two
years. That exception for national security cases is of vital
importance in supporting future counter-terrorism
investigations.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
recognise that the police and other law enforcement authorities face
particular difficulties when working to counter threats to national
security. Counter-terrorism investigations often run for many years. As
we have discussed, the threat posed by an individual who has been
subject to a TPIM notice for two years may in some cases continue
beyond that time, but it will be managed by other means. The retention
of an individual’s fingerprints and DNA profile will support
that. To apply a fixed six-month retention period alone, without any
mechanism for extending retention where necessary for national security
purposes, would inevitably lead to the early destruction of valuable
material relating to individuals who are of continuing interest to the
police and the Security Service, undermining attempts to protect the
public from the threat we
face.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
reflects the approach taken to national security cases in the
Protection of Freedoms Bill, including the safeguards. We intend for
the power to extend retention to be subject to independent oversight by
the new independent commissioner for the retention and use of biometric
material, and we aim to amend the Protection of Freedoms Bill to
provide for that. Each national security determination that is made or
renewed, and the reasons for it, must be sent to the commissioner, who
will have the power to order the destruction of material that does not
meet the necessary criteria. That approach will provide the right
balance between national security and civil liberties by ensuring
strong protection for
both.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Schedule
6 will also place limitations on the uses to which biometric material
taken from a person subject to a TRIM notice may be put. Again, those
uses are in line with the provision being debated in the Protection of
Freedoms Bill. Such uses are those in the interests of national
security, those for the purposes of a terrorist investigation, those
for purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime, the
investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution, or those
for purposes related to the identification of a deceased person or of
the person to whom the material relates.<a class="bkMark" name="11063057000225">&#160;</a>
