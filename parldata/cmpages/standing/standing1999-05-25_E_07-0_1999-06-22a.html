Question proposed this day, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) was on his feet when the Committee adjourned.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I was speaking when the whistle went at 1 o'clock; indeed, I had barely begun.
<P>
It is a pleasure to find that you are chairing our proceedings this afternoon, Mrs. Michie. By way of a brief preamble to assist your understanding of what we are discussing, let me say that we have come to what many people regard as the Bill's most important clause. Certainly, it is the clause that has given rise to the greatest controversy.
<P>
The practical effect of the clause will be quite rare, as it will not alter hugely how the criminal justice system deals with rape trials. However, it will make a significant, far-reaching difference on those occasions on which it matters.
<P>
At 1 o'clock I was about to reaffirm that hon. Members of all parties in both Houses hold personal views about the right of the defendant to cross-examine a witness. However, those views may not always reflect the official view of the party to which their holders belong. I shall illustrate that in a moment.
<P>
We are not dealing with any old witnesses, but witnesses who are complainants in rape cases. Committee members will know of one or two cases that have taken place in the past two or three years in which defendants have been permitted to cross-examine witnesses who are rape victims. Significant publicity attached to those cases and engendered great loathing and concern that such an experience should have been allowed to happen to someone who had already been a victim and&#151;by virtue of the ordeal of the cross-examination&#151;had to relive the horror of what took place.
<P>
Attitudes on the issue do not split along party lines, but across them. There is no better example of that than the debate on clause 33 that took place in the other place. I shall go over what two or three of their Lordships said, not to make a party political point, but to highlight the concerns that Committee Members must respond to when agreeing that clause 33 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Bang on cue, the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) arrives, just as I am about to remind him that his noble Friend, Lord Thomas of Gresford, warned of potential miscarriages of justice, should clause 33 proceed further. Speaking in the other place on 1 February, Lord Thomas said that the burden on the prosecution to prove guilt in rape cases was no less than in any other case.
<P>
We agree with that, but by denying the defendant the right to cross-examine in defence of himself, courts run the risk of the defendant addressing the jury at the end of the trial, claiming that the trial has been unfair. According to Lord Thomas, should the jury agree, the defendant might be acquitted when he was guilty. Therefore, there is a risk associated with the clause that there might be an acquittal if the defendant could, somehow, convince the jury that he had been hard done by. That is a valid argument, but we put it on one side for the moment. It is a risk that I would be prepared to take.
<P>
Baroness Mallalieu cautioned that, in rape especially, there is always a danger that the accused may be the victim of a false allegation and that we must therefore avoid falling into the trap of assuming guilt. In such circumstances, are we justified in eroding the defendant's rights and providing fewer safeguards by removing the right to cross-examine the victim?
<P>
The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, accepted in the debate in the other place that there was an abuse, but in his view it was demonstrated to have occurred on only two occasions. That was insufficient to justify a blanket prohibition and, therefore, the strength and guidance that the Court of Appeal had delivered following the Milton Brown case should stand. He said that there had been no further example of abuse since that strengthened guidance had been provided.
<P>
<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall gladly give way, but I am rehearsing the arguments against our accepting the clause. I shall explain in a moment why I do not agree with it.
<P>
<B>Ms Drown:</B> The hon. Gentleman was quoting from Baroness Mallalieu in the House of Lords, who said that, in rape cases in particular, people might be vulnerable to false accusation. Does he have any evidence to back that up? I suspect that there is none.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that Baroness Mallalieu, with all her experience as a barrister, would be able to provide some. I shall come to what has been said in this House, but I am simply saying that people with significant legal experience have real anxieties about the clause. I shall come later to why I believe that, in spite of those anxieties, the clause should stand part of the Bill and why the Committee should address it now.
<P>
I was saying that the Lord Chief Justice felt that, as there had been no further examples of abuse, we could let the matter rest. I shall say later why I take the contrary view.
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)&#151;I am disappointed that he is not here today&#151;questioned whether the provisions of the clause were necessary. More pointedly, those hon. Members who were in the Chamber for that debate know that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), whom the Minister of State mentioned earlier, strongly opposed the clause and had some support for the amendments in the names of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale).
<P>
We know two things from that. First, some people with legal experience have a view, as a result of that experience, that we cannot set aside and ignore. We know equally that there is no consensus within parties. However, it is a challenge for the Committee to respond, as the Minister of State did this morning for the Government and I seek to do this afternoon for the Opposition, to these arguments and establish whether we can provide a sufficiently convincing argument as to why the concerns should be rejected and why the clause should therefore be accepted, even unamended.
<P>
The Minister of State will know that the Opposition came to a view in principle about this matter in the summer of 1998 when an amendment was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir B. Mawhinney), the then shadow Home Secretary, to the Bill that became the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The amendment was not pressed, but it gave us an opportunity to have a debate and we were willing to await the publication and progress of this Bill to address the matter.
<P>
I mentioned that Lord Bingham said that there had been only two cases. That is not strictly correct. Even in the last three or four years there was a trial in Scotland involving William Austin, who cross-examined a victim of indecent assault in graphic detail and was in the end convicted, despite his ability to cross-examine. In 1996 there was the case of Dennis Chambers, who at the time was charged with Milton Brown in a case of stalking. Courts have always had the discretion to halt unnecessary and intrusive questioning. If the vicitim is being put through an ordeal unnecessarily, the courts have been able to intervene and stop it.
<P>
Given that the discretion existed when the four incidents to which we have referred occurred, one must question whether revised guidance would be adequate in all future cases. It is only revised guidance. The change that it makes is not substantive, and it is by no means as substantial a change as the clause would make. More important, we must conclude that the publicity surrounding these cases does not encourage other rape victims to come forward.
<P>
This morning, the Minister of State mentioned the fear of trial. There is no doubt that the publicity given to these cases created an atmosphere of distress and anxiety in the minds of victims of rape and other sexual attacks and the fear that, if they came forward and agreed to give evidence, they might be subjected to lurid questioning by their assailants. Victims will need substantial reassurance that there is no risk or danger of being cross-examined. As I hope will be obvious to the Minister and the Committee, I have given a great deal of thought to this matter, and I have concluded that that is a substantial argument in favour of an absolute prohibition as set out in the clause. There then can be no such risk.
<P>
If, in the interests of justice, we want to consider the interests of the defendant as well as the victim, we should question whether the ability to cross-examine the victim has any practical value to the defendant. I am doubtful that it does. The jury can draw its own conclusions from any gratuitous trawling over the sordid details of what took place. That was characterised by the Milton Brown and Ralston Edwards cases, which the Minister mentioned this morning. That leads me to question whether defenders of the right to cross-examine try to defend a theoretical and historic right rather than a right that is of practical value to a defendant. The inability of those who defend the right to cross-examine to show the practical value of its retention enables us to focus on the effect of such cross-examination on the victim.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Juries will not know about the effect unless the accused tells them or, as Lord Justice Bingham said in another place, unless the defendant is so stupid and pigheaded that he makes matters worse for himself by creating a fuss about being unable to cross-examine the victim. Lord Justice Bingham doubted that that would happen.
<P>
That leads me to conclude that the balance of interests between the victim and the defendant should be redressed. As the Minister said this morning, the clause does not prohibit cross-examination. However, the victim should never suffer the ordeal of cross-examination by her assailant.
<P>
That leaves us with only two further points to discuss. First, we should consider whether the courts should retain a discretion. At present, there is no bar to such cross-examination, but guidance to the courts states that it can be stopped. That guidance has now been strengthened. As the Minister knows, the Law Society suggested that clause 33 should be amended to include the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``without leave of the court''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I made that annotation in my copy of the Bill when I first read it. I concluded that we could raise the point without tabling an amendment. It would be wrong to table an amendment that we did not believe to be worthy. I have said in private conversations with the Minister that the issues that clauses 33 to 39 cover are too serious for us to send any confusing signals about our beliefs and intentions.
<P>
Secondly, we should consider whether the blanket prohibition infringes the European convention on human rights. It is important to note that the Lord Chief Justice concluded that it did not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was very close to concluding my remarks before the Division and was about to make the point that some have asked whether the clause will contravene article 6 of the European convention on human rights. In the debate in the other place, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham, said that he had never taken that view. Although that might not be a conclusive judgment&#151;one day, the courts may have to decide&#151;I am happy to accept his conclusion.
<P>
However, I fundamentally disagree with the Lord Chief Justice's other conclusion. He concentrated on reminding us of the need to avoid wrong and unjust convictions and said that they had been very much invoked in the press in recent years. He therefore concluded that no case had been made for clause 33 and that the provision should not be brought into force until it had been shown by practical experience to be necessary. It seems to me that Lord Bingham is suggesting that we should wait until another victim of rape has gone through the ordeal of cross-examination or should, at least, be prepared to take that risk before we accept the clause.
<P>
Lord Bingham's view reminds me of constituency correspondence. There might be a junction in one's constituency that local people want something done about, but the highway superintendent says, ``There have been no fatal accidents. Go away. You can't have anything.'' Those who say that there have not been sufficient cases to justify the clause are, in effect, arguing that we should take the risk that other complainants will suffer the ordeal that was experienced in the cross-examination in the Edwards case. In addition, we run the risk that victims will be deterred from giving evidence.
<P>
For those reasons, on balance, I have come to the conclusion that clause 33 is right. My views were summed up by my noble Friend Lord Cope of Berkeley, who speaks on home affairs matters in the other place. On Third Reading there, he said that we are more likely to risk miscarriages of justice if witnesses in rape cases are deterred or discouraged from coming forward to make a complaint or to give evidence. Defendants have rights, but I am not persuaded that those rights have significant practical benefit. Victims also have rights, and the four cases that I have mentioned&#151;there may be others&#151;involved victims being abused by their assailants in open court. As a consequence, there is a danger that other victims will not come forward to give evidence.
<P>
For those reasons, I am prepared to say that we will support the clause.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I join the hon. Member for Ryedale in welcoming you to the Committee this afternoon, Mrs. Michie. We hope not to detain you for long. Indeed, the unanimity between both sides of the Committee this afternoon should not be taken as a sign that that is always the case. It is not entirely because of your benign presence but arises from the arguments that have been marshalled on both sides in favour of the clause. The arguments against it have been ably rehearsed and then dismissed by the hon. Member for Ryedale, and I need not repeat them, as I outlined them in my opening remarks in favour of the clause.
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee longer, save to say that we are satisfied that the clause strikes the right balance between the rights of victims and defendants. For too long the law failed to recognise the deterrent effect on victims of sexual assault of knowing that there was a possibility, however remote, that they would be subjected to cross-examination by the person whom they accused of being their assailant. That undoubtedly bore heavily on the minds of women, and it is mainly women who are victims of sexual assault. For that reason and because we want to ensure that such victims feel able to bring the allegation and give their best evidence in support of it, we arrived at the view that the clause was necessary.
<P>
Those in the other place who have regard to our proceedings will note the unanimity across the parties when the Bill returns to them. Across the parties, the Committee is determined that victims of sexual assault should have that protection.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>Child complainants and other child witnesses</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The clause is intended to provide greater protection for child witnesses in some of the most distressing criminal cases.
<P>
The clause replaces and extends the provisions of section 34A of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as inserted by section 55(7) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. That prohibits anyone charged with an offence of violence or cruelty from personally cross-examining a child who is alleged to be the victim of the offence or to have witnessed its commission. If the child has witnessed the commission of the offence, the ban applies whether the victim is a child or an adult.
<P>
Child witnesses will continue to enjoy those protections under clause 34, but it slightly extends the prohibition, to ensure that witnesses in cases of kidnapping, abduction and false imprisonment are also protected. It also ensures that unrepresented defendents who are accused of one of these offences will be unable to cross-examine child witnesses in relation to any other offence with which he or she may be charged in the proceedings.
<P>
The clause also bans adults defendants from personally cross-examining their child co-defendants in cases involving sex, violence or cruelty.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (4) sets out the age limits below which witnesses are deemed to be children for the purposes of the clause in relation to the offence which they have witnessed. In line with sections 32 and 34A of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, clause 34 sets the age limit at 17 for sexual offences and 14 for offences of violence and cruelty.
<P>
Subsection (2) provides that the prohibition will extend to witnesses who counted as children under subsection (4) when they gave their evidence-in-chief earlier in the trial, even if by the time of the cross-examination they have reached the age limit specified in that subsection.
<P>
That is for the obvious reason that from time to time, a witness has a birthday in the middle of a trial and it would obviously be a nonsense if that caused the trial to be aborted or the case to proceed on a different basis from that on which it commenced.
<P>
The last difference between this provision and that under the 1988 Act is that clause 37 provides a mechanism for unrepresented defendants to appoint a lawyer for the purpose of cross-examination only, if they wish to conduct the rest of their case themselves; or, if the defendant does not appoint a lawyer at all, for the court to appoint its own lawyer to test the witness's evidence in the defendant's interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause extends a concept that the previous Government introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which amended the 1988 Act. Many of the arguments advanced in our debate on clause 33 apply to clause 34 and we are content that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 35</center></H4>
<H4><center>Direction prohibiting accused from cross-examining particular witness</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I believe that the clause will be warmly welcomed by the Committee and the House because it will enable us to deal with those special cases in which it may still be undesirable to allow cross-examination in person by the defendant, even though it does not fall within a mandatory ban. My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) has raised the matter on several occasions. The test will be when worse-quality evidence will be given if the unrepresented defendant is allowed to cross-examine in person. The interests of justice may best be served by preventing the defendant from cross-examining in person. In such cases, clause 35 gives courts the power to do that, either following an application by the prosecution or of their own volition.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon expressed great concern about a case in which, inexplicably, the prosecution decided to proceed with a charge of grievous bodily harm, rather than rape, when someone entered into premises uninvited and, in violent circumstances, had sexual intercourse with a person whom they found in bed.
<P>
The prosecution proceeded with the charge of GBH, not rape, Of course, it would have been horrendous if the victim in that case had faced cross-examination by the defendant. Under the Bill, it will be open to the prosecution or the court, of its own volition, to say that, in such circumstances, it would be wrong for such a cross-examination to proceed. Therefore, there will be an important protection in cases such as that outlined by my hon. Friend.
<P>
In response to my honourable Friend's concerns, I hope that, as a result of the Committee's decisions, not least that which it has just taken in relation to the main mandatory prohibition, such cases will be charged and prosecuted as rape rather than GBH in future, and that sentences in such cases will be considerably longer than the seven years imposed in this case. That is a typical example of the need for the law to be strengthened in the way that the Committee and&#151;in due course&#151;the House are resolved to strengthen it.
<P>
The mandatory bans under clauses 33 or 34 are drawn fairly tightly and clause 35 allows courts to impose discretionary bans, if necessary, in other cases of the sort that I have outlined, once they have weighed the witness's circumstances.
<P>
Witnesses who are not covered by clauses 33 and 34, but who might need that sort of protection, may include victims of stalking or domestic violence or witnesses who have been subject to intimidation by the defendant and who, as a result, are especially frightened by the prospect of being cross-examined by him. Courts will be able to impose a ban under the clause only if they are satisfied that the witnesses' circumstances and the case merit it and that nothing in the case makes a prohibition contrary to the interests of justice.
<P>
If a ban is to be imposed, it will have to appear to the court that the quality of a witness's evidence under cross-examination is likely to be diminished should the defendant himself cross-examine the witness, and that that evidence would be improved were he to be prevented from doing so. Quality is defined as the completeness, coherence and accuracy of a witness's evidence.
<P>
The court must have special regard to a number of criteria in deciding whether a witness's evidence would be improved by a ban. First, it must take account of the witness's views: is he or she content to be cross-examined by the defendant? It is important that the court should take cognisance of that.
<P>
Secondly, what sort of questions is the witness likely to be asked? The court needs to consider that, so that it can decide whether those questions are likely to be especially distressing.
<P>
Thirdly, how has the defendant behaved during the case? That is important, and involves the court assessing how the defendant behaves generally and in relation to the witness. That is often a good indicator of how the defendant will conduct a cross-examination. The court must discover whether such a cross-examination is a genuine exercise to elicit facts supporting the defence case, a continuation of a campaign against the victim or a way of getting back at her.
<P>
Fourthly, the court must consider whether there is a relationship between the witness and the defendant. That is particularly important in relation to a number of concerns that my hon. Friends have raised with me during our deliberations in relation to offences of domestic violence. I think that that will bring considerable comfort to those who initiate such proceedings.
<P>
Fifthly, the court must consider whether any co-defendant has been charged at any stage with a sexual offence or an offence to which the clause applies. That might apply in relation to a gangbang, for instance, where one or more of the co-defendants has been charged with rape, but the defendant concerned has been charged with the ``lesser'' offence of actual bodily harm although he had been part of the gang. Obviously, the court would need to have regard to that.
<P>
Sixthly and lastly, the court must consider whether a special measures direction has been given, or is to be given, to the witness. That might affect the court's view of the witness's need for assistance and ensure that any help that had already been given was taken into account. Obviously, a witness's vulnerability should not be exploited by a defendant determined to do so.
<P>
For the purposes of the clause witnesses who are themselves charged with an offence in the proceedings cannot be protected from cross-examination in person by another defendant. Only child defendants in cases involving offences caught by clause 34 will be eligible for such protection, under clause 34(5).
<P>
Unrepresented defendants who are banned from cross-examining witnesses under this clause will be asked to appoint and instruct their own lawyer for the purposes of cross-examination only under clause 37. If they do not appoint a lawyer, the court will be able to appoint its own lawyer to test the witness's evidence in the defendant's interests. Requiring defendants to appoint legal representatives is not in breach of the ECHR, and I do not believe that it will lead to miscarriages of justice.
<P>
In the light of my comments, I hope that the clause will be acceptable to the Committee and will be allowed to stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the Minister of State for explaining the provisions in detail and for not moving some of the clauses formally, because they are extremely important.
<P>
As the Minister of State knows, this is a new provision that has not been universally welcomed by the legal profession. It has made a number of criticisms, saying that the Bill provides a mechanism for a prohibition of cross-examination for offences of no particularly identified kind. Understanding some of those concerns and why they have been raised, I believe that the clause provides the discretion that people sought in respect of clause 33. Therefore, they seem to want it both ways.
<P>
Secondly, as the Minister of State said, the quality of the evidence is a key factor. In considering the quality of the evidence, we must simply look at subsection (3) for clues to the kind of cases to which such a prohibition might be applied. Not knowing what the Minister of State would say, I had already written down such things as intimidation of the witness; cases of domestic violence, where fear of giving evidence can be as great as in rape&#151;in some instances perhaps even greater&#151;and cases of indecent assault. As the Minister of State said, someone may be charged with rape, while a co-defendant to whom the clause would apply may be charged only with indecent assault.
<P>
One other point that the Minister of State did not make but which I think is important relates to subsection (4)(b), which says that any reference to the quality of the evidence shall be construed in accordance with 16(5). That is the key issue of coherence. What impresses me about the clause is that it is because of intimidation or fear of further domestic violence that the evidence would not be as coherent as the interests of justice demand. One appreciates the significant departure that we are making in the law in introducing these clauses but, on balance, the Opposition are happy to agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): I shall be brief. I have two points to make about the clause. First, where discretion is allowed by the judges there can be concern in the community about the quality of the judges who are exercising their discretion. Only this morning there was a report of a judge who, in his summing-up of the case of a group of boys charged with repeated indecent assault on a girl of 13, described it as a game that went too far.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister give us an assurance that the judges who sit on trials of the nature described in part II of the Bill will have training to carry out their discretion in a worthy manner befitting their profession? Secondly, there are a number of other areas of discretion in this Bill such as special measures and the admission of sexual history. Can he assure us that the Home Office will agree to an immediate monitoring and evaluation of the powers in the Bill as they come into force, rather than waiting for three years, by which time a review may be called for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have taken steps to set up inquiries as to how best to ensure that public confidence in the judiciary hearing cases of this sort is maintained and developed. I am assured that judges are authorised to try rape cases by the senior presiding judge on behalf of the Lord Chief Justice. That is done on the basis of recommendations by presiding judges when they need an additional authorised judge in their area. Like other judicial appointments, there are no set criteria but I am assured that the Lord Chief Justice ensures that presiding judges take considerable care to satisfy themselves that the judge in question has already shown the qualities needed for handling these trials.
<P>
It is made clear that only authorised judges should try sexual offence cases. That is a requirement that is seldom, if ever, breached. Indeed, I had an investigation carried out and it was possible to find only two cases that had been wrongly allocated: one in error and the other as a result of a misunderstanding of the policy on the circuit. That has now been rectified.
<P>
I understand my hon. Friend's concern. I am assured that, as a result of a letter last autumn to the Lord Chief Justice by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice met all presiding judges to discuss the issue and to reinforce the message that all judges hearing such cases must be authorised.
<P>
However, in addition to that, we are anxious to ensure that the training made available through the Judicial Studies Board to judges is appropriate for its purposes. It will obviously need to take into account the changes that Parliament is now making. Authorisation and training must also come as close together in terms of timing as is possible, so that there is no time lapse between the time that someone is authorised and the time that he receives training. If there were such a lapse, it is theoretically possible that an untrained person could hear cases. That is undesirable. However appropriate the judge's experience that led him to be given authorisation, the fact that training is available and undertaken will bolster public confidence in the process. That is what we seek to achieve. Discussions will be entered into with the Judicial Studies Board and with the judiciary to bring about that added assurance.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) seeks clarification on the proposals to monitor and to pilot the measures. I am happy to assure her that there will be careful and contemporaneous evaluation of the pilots. I will also discuss with my officials how it is proposed to monitor outcomes after the pilots have got under way, and I will provide that information to my hon. Friend either in correspondence or on Report. It is important that public confidence in the system is bolstered. That is essential if victims and witnesses are to feel confidence that the necessary safeguards and protection are in place to enable them to give evidence.
<P>
I hope that my reply answers my hon. Friend's concerns. I hope that the Committee will give the clause a fair wind.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 36 ensures that directions made under clause 35, which prohibit a defendant from cross-examining a witness in person, will be binding unless and until the court considers that the direction should be discharged in the interests of justice.
<P>
The prosecution and defence will be able to apply for a direction to be discharged. However, the court will grant their application only if there has been a material change of circumstances since it was originally made or since they last applied for it to be discharged, that might justify the court revoking the direction. Otherwise, the court can discharge directions of its own motion.
<P>
The court will be required to give its reasons for making, refusing or discharging any directions in open court. The reasons will be recorded automatically in the Crown court; in magistrates courts, they will have to be entered in the court register.
<P>
Subsection (5) allows rules of court to be made. They will enable the court to determine uncontested applications without a hearing. That is desirable for the expeditious disposal of proceedings. The rules will also prevent unsuccessful applications from being renewed except when a material change of circumstances has occurred. That is always necessary to prevent the defendant from abusing or manipulating the processes of the court to his or her advantage. The rules will allow expert evidence to be heard in connection with any applications for directions under the clause to be made or discharged. They will provide for the manner in which confidential or sensitive information is treated in connection with such applications. That is especially important because such information often includes personal details that occasionally need to be protected appropriately if there is to be free and proper exchange of information.

<H4><center>Defence representation for purposes of cross-examination</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 37 provides for legal representation for unrepresented defendants who are banned from cross-examining a witness under the Bill. Reference was made to that earlier in the debate. The same arrangements will apply when a defendant has been prevented from cross-examining a witness who is a child, a sexual offence complainant or because the court has imposed a discretionary ban. The provision is important because it ensures that the imposition of a ban does not disadvantage the defendant.
<P>
The court will first ask the unrepresented defendant to appoint a legal representative to undertake the cross-examination on his behalf. He will instruct that lawyer in the same way as he would instruct a lawyer who had conducted the whole case on his behalf. The defendant will be given a specific amount of time in which to appoint a lawyer and to inform the court of whether he has made an appointment. The court will determine the time limit in each case.
<P>
If the defendant refuses to appoint a lawyer, or if he fails to notify the court of his decision within the specified time, and it appears to the court that no appointment has been made, the court will consider whether it is necessary for the witness to be cross-examined in the interests of justice.
<P>
If the court decides that that is necessary, it will be able to appoint a lawyer to test the witness's evidence in the defendant's interests. The court-appointed lawyer will be given access to transcripts, the prosecution's case papers, statements made by the defence, any medical and forensic evidence and so on. However, as he will be appointed only when the defendant has refused to appoint or instruct a lawyer, he will not be instructed by the defendant, or be able to put the defendant's case, and he will not be responsible to the defendant. His role will be to test the witness's evidence in the defendant's broad interest on the basis of any information that the court can give him.
<P>
The arrangement is intended to remedy circumstances that have occasionally occurred, in which defendants are banned from cross-examining child witnesses and judges have to choose between allowing the witness's evidence to be untested&#151;that is clearly not satisfactory&#151;and asking the questions. That is also unsatisfactory because it draws the judge into the arena. A lawyer will be able to act more freely in representing the defendant's interests without compromising his position in the court.
<P>
When the court appoints a lawyer, the judge will have to consider warning the jury under clause 38 that cross-examination has not been undertaken by the defendant's own lawyer. However, the judge will need to consider that under his discretion. It is proper for the judge to have some discretion because that goes back to a point made earlier today, that it would be unwise to fetter a judge's discretion in that regard because the delivery of a warning could have the opposite effect of that intended. The judge will need to consider whether a warning is appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 38 provides two additional safeguards, in the form of jury warnings, so that unrepresented defendants who are prevented from personally cross-examining witnesses under any of the clauses in this Bill still receive a fair trial.
<P>
First, the judge must give members of the jury such warning as he thinks necessary to ensure that they do not draw any inferences against the defendant because he has been prevented from cross-examining the witness in person.
<P>
Secondly, the judge must give such warning as he thinks necessary if the court has appointed its own lawyer to test the witness's evidence, so that the jury understands that the cross-examination was not carried out by the defendant's own lawyer and so may not have been as full a cross-examination as might otherwise have been possible.
<P>
It is then for the jury to have in mind when it considers the evidence what the impact of any warning should be. Experience shows that it is best to leave such warnings to the discretion of the judiciary and for them to be put in a form and a manner that is informed by the judge's experience of the trial and his or her assessment of the state of play at that point in a trial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The clause is very important. Earlier, we discussed a similar provision in respect of the giving of evidence under special measures by children and vulnerable witnesses. On balance, it is right to leave discretion with the judge because, as I said earlier, in the majority of cases it will be to the defendant's benefit for there to be no warning, because the jury will not, of necessity, be aware that the defendant has been denied the opportunity to cross-examine, especially if the prohibition is absolute, as it is in clauses 33 and 34. That is a further compelling argument in favour of an absolute prohibition in those clauses because it means that the defendant had no choice; therefore it is difficult to see what inferences could be drawn.
<P>
The clause provides additional comfort for defendants, especially in extreme cases in which the defendant flatly refuses to appoint his own legal representative and relies on one that is appointed by the court. In such cases it will be obvious to the jury that something is not quite right. We are happy for this sensible measure to be included in the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The clause may be more important to some that to others, but it is undoubtedly important to lawyers, because it sets out how lawyers appointed by the defendant or the court under clause 37 will be paid. I do not see any practising lawyers in the Committee, so perhaps we can pass over the clause rapidly. It is a practical measure to ensure that the objectives of the clauses that we have debated today are met, and that there is access to properly qualified legal assistance in the circumstances that we have been discussing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister of State is right to draw attention to the fact that there appears to be no one here to speak for the lawyers, but I should like to speak briefly for the taxpayers, who will pick up the bill. There is a slight quirk in the arrangements, although I am not sure how else it could have been done. I could have made this comment on clause 37, but it is more appropriate on this clause.
<P>
If the defendant refuses to appoint his own legal representative, the court will do so and will pay. If, however, the defendant instructs his own legal representative, the bill comes out of the legal aid fund. One would like to think that, while there may be arguments about different budgets, the eventual cost to the public purse will be the same, whichever route the defendant takes. We believe that the provision in clause 37, backed up by this clause, is an important safeguard in respect of clauses 33 and 34.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> In this instance we have the public purse very much in mind. The purse in this respect has two pouches. It may be academic to the taxpayer, but it is not academic to the Treasury&#151;nothing ever is&#151;nor is it academic to the Lord Chancellor or to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz), the Parliamentary Secretary in the Lord Chancellor's Department, whose budget we are here dispensing. Even though I am a Home Office Minister, I cannot be too cavalier in these matters.
<P>
Therefore, we have decided to prevent the defendant from playing the system. That is why we did not accept the suggestion in ``Speaking Up for Justice'' that, in all these circumstances, legal representation should be provided without charge to the defendant. Our view was that, to prevent defendants playing the system, if a defendant who has conducted his own defence appoints and instructs a lawyer for cross-examination and has the means to make a contribution to his costs, he should be required to do so, in the same way as if he were appointing a lawyer for his whole defence, because the lawyer will be acting on the basis of instructions that will enable him to make the individual's defence. That is to be distinguished from the case where the defendant refuses to appoint a legal representative, having represented himself up to that point, and the court decides that it is necessary to test the witness's evidence in the interests of justice and the defendant's own interests. In those circumstances we believe it right that the state, having made that determination, should meet the costs, because the state has an interest, which is the perceived fairness of the proceedings: justice must be seen to be done and must be done. Instead of undermining that important public policy objective, the state should meet the costs of legal representation.
<P>
That is how we have decided to proceed in relation to legal representation. With that explanation, I hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Russell (Colchester):</B> If it is deemed right, as I am sure it is, that the state should provide the funds for lawyers under the clause, will the Minister of State agree that the same argument applies to intermediaries under clause 28?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The role of intermediaries is still being looked at. As I said earlier today, the rules and regulations that will apply to intermediaries have not yet been drafted. The jury is still out on cost and payment, but if a conclusion is reached before Report and Third Reading, I shall let the House know. In any event I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to let him know how we propose to proceed.
<P>
We must ensure that no vulnerable witness or defendant who requires an intermediary of the kind that we have discussed today should be denied one for want of means. We must find an appropriate way to ensure that, where an intermediary is required to elicit best evidence, the court has that best evidence available to it.
