of witnesses. The third provision shortens the afternoon
sitting&#151;the Committee&#146;s opportunity to question
Ministers&#151;by an hour, reducing the time from 4 o&#146;clock to
5 o&#146;clock, instead of 4 o&#146;clock to 6 o&#146;clock. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126126</b><a name="09060975000391"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Taylor. It is a pleasure to see you here this
morning.</div><a name="09060975000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise two issues, one of which has been raised specifically by the
Catholic Bishops Conference. I will question its representative first
and then other panel members can comment. The issue is the employment
exceptions for the purposes of religion, and the changes between the
Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 and the Bill.
The Catholic bishops say that the Bill narrows the exception, while the
Government&#146;s position is that it simply clarifies existing law.
However, you can read it both ways. This specifically looks at the
extent to which a particular religion or belief is a genuine
occupational requirement of a job. Can I ask you, Mr.
Kornicki, to set out your position and the extent to which you feel the
language in the Bill does or does not significantly tighten or limit
the exceptions in existing
law?</div><a name="09060987000001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kornicki:</b></i> Our understanding is that it is a distinct
tightening of the law. For example, the explanatory notes make clear
that a youth worker would not be entitled to the
benefit of the exemption. As this is now formulated, it
represents a misunderstanding of how religion works. It is not simply
an activity that takes place once a week in a particular place; it is
about the whole of life. Important functions will be carried out that
will be relevant to religious activity that might be more than, or
different from, simply leading liturgical
worship.</div><a name="09060975000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give
you a brief example from <i class="I">The Catholic Herald</i><i class="I"> </i>of 29 May,
in which an advertisement was placed by the Catholic archdiocese of
Liverpool for an &#147;Assistant co-ordinator for Faith Formation
(Marriage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>and Family Life Ministry)&#148;. It mentions a diocesan-wide role and
a requirement to be a practising Roman Catholic. It is primarily
concerned with teaching on marriage, family and life issues. It would
be inconceivable that the Church would be required to appoint to that
post somebody who was, for example, a flagrant divorcee in a parish who
had remarried somebody else civilly, and demonstrated by their life
publicly that they were wholly at variance with the teaching that they
were supposed to be
promulgating.</div><a name="09060975000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000392"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Does anyone else have a comment on that, in either
agreement or
disagreement?</div><a name="09060975000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> Perhaps I can endorse what has been said
from the perspective of the Church of England. There is no doubt that
this is a substantial narrowing of the present exemption, which talks
of</div><a name="09060975000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the purposes of
an organised
religion&#148;.</div><a name="09060975000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The narrowing
is considerable, particularly under paragraph 8. The Government have a
difficulty  because they are bringing together various strands
of discrimination and, in relation to some strands, the present
exemptions are narrower than others. For example, exemption can be
necessary in relation to gender, because the priesthood, bishops,
rabbis and imams are confined to only one gender&#151;that is quite a
narrow restriction. However, there are other areas where we need a bit
more scope than the provision provides.</div>
<a name="09060975000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fundamental difficulty is
that, if a religious organisation is imposing a faith requirement on a
particular post&#151;we have a lot of posts where we do
not&#151;and saying, &#147;You&#146;ve got to be an Anglican, a
Roman Catholic, or whatever it might be&#148;, we will, particularly
for representational or pastoral roles, want people to lead lives that
are consistent with the teaching of that particular Church or faith.
Our conviction is that the provision does not allow for that. You might
believe that some of our rules and disciplines are wrong, but our view
is that that is a matter of religious liberty&#151;a matter for the
Church of England, Roman Catholics, the Jews or
whoever.</div><a name="09060975000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
seeking carte blanche, but if a religious organisation is employing
someone in a role for which you have to be a member of that faith, it
is reasonable that restrictions&#151;whether they be on marital
history or whatever&#151;can be part of the requirements. I think
that the provision would prevent that.</div>
<a name="09060975000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><a name="09060975000393"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): Others might
want to come in on this subject, so I will not go on to a new topic.
When you say &#147;or whatever&#148;, do you mean gay people as
well? You gave the example of marital status, which means that gay
people would fall into that category, would they
not?</div><a name="09060975000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> Gay people would not fall into that category
because the Church of England does not discriminate on what we would
describe as sexual orientation. The difficulty is that we have
requirements in terms of conduct.</div>
<a name="09060975000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000394"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> If they behaved as gay people do, that would mean
to have gay sex with someone, which would be outside
marriage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="09060975000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> The discipline of many&#151;in fact
most&#151;Christian Churches and many other faiths is out of line
with what many people in society think. However, our view would be that
that is the discipline of that organisation. If people are employed in
a representational, pastoral or teaching role, the Government accept
that there will be exceptions, but we are arguing about how broad those
exceptions should be.</div>
<a name="09060975000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000395"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Let us say that an Anglican who is a youth worker
does a good job, gets rave reviews, and is doing well. He then comes
out as being gay, his work does not suffer, and he is still doing well.
Would your organisation, or an organisation of a Church nature, have
the right to sack that person when they come out? Alternately, say
someone&#146;s marriage breaks down and they are having a terrible
time personally. Do you think that you should have the
right&#151;whether you choose to or not&#151;to sack someone on the
basis of that private trauma, even though they are still doing a good
job by objective
standards?</div><a name="09060975000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> There are two answers to that. First, I do
not think that the example of youth workers given in the explanatory
notes is correct. I do not believe  that the provision, as
drafted, would prevent Churches or other religious organisations from
applying requirements to youth workers, because youth workers have a
very important teaching role. There is a misunderstanding there. One of
our difficulties is that this has appeared without any discussion with
any of us on the panel.</div>
<a name="09060975000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second point, it is
always difficult when people come into positions for which there is a
requirement. Sometimes people are required to be of a particular faith
but lose their faith when they are in the job. You face difficult
pastoral situations there, but if there is a requirement that you have
to be an Anglican or a Catholic, or one that refers to a
person&#146;s personal life, we would contend that you have to have
the ability to impose those&#151;both at recruitment and when someone
is in
post.</div><a name="09060975000058"></a>

131</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000396"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So basically you are saying yes. We can argue
about whether a youth worker is wholly or mainly involved in promoting
and explaining the doctrine of the religion, or in providing activities
for youths&#151;that could vary according to the facts of the case.
You are saying, just as when someone changes their religion, that if a
person becomes sexually active, that is a matter for you, and it could
be a factor in whether they continue with their livelihood.</div>

organisation is entitled to look at the totality of someone&#146;s

a representational, pastoral or teaching role. That is true on behalf
of any faith, not only the Church of England or

different ways. The consistency of the Church of England&#146;s
position and the way in which it behaves across the country seems to
depend on the attitudes of different bishops to different
circumstances. Is that right?</div>
<a name="09060975000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> I was asked a specific question about a
possible individual case. In all religious organisations, you will find
that people handle difficult personal situations in sensitive ways. The
Church of England&#151;and I think all faiths&#151;has rules and
standards. You will never get total consistency in practice, but
certain rules are observed strictly by all bishops. For example, to
take a non-contentious issue, bishops would not agree to ordain someone
in the Church of England who was living outside marriage with somebody
of the opposite sex. That person would either have to be married, or
not be living together with someone. I do not think that the Bill
trespasses on that, but I mention it as there would be consistency on
that issue.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000400"></a>The

life in the bedroom in order for them to be employed by the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000402"></a>The

on this matter.</div>
<a name="09060975000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Copson:</b></i> Obviously, we make use of the exemption in
employment for our chief executive, for example, and for our funeral
celebrants, who conduct non-religious funerals. As far as we are
concerned, we are content that the provision gives us all the scope we
need for genuine occupational requirements; we do not see it as a
narrowing of the previous requirement. If it were a narrowing, however,
we would support that. Our view, which you can see in the evidence from
employment tribunals included in our submission, is that some religious
organisations have been going well beyond what was allowed by the
occupational requirement in the past. Although we would welcome a
narrowing, we do not think that this is a narrowing, and we are content
that it will let us do what we need to do on preferring non-religious
people for a very limited number of posts.</div>
<a name="09060975000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000403"></a>The

make it clear whether their question is aimed at a specific member of
the panel or whether it  is open for response. I will call
Maleiha Malik in a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><a name="09060975000404"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Thank you, Mr.
Taylor. My question is to the two Church representatives, unless others
wish to contribute, and it is procedural. Are some of the difficulties
that we are clearly already in related to the fact that these matters 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>were not really consulted on? Can you give us a bit of history about
when they were introduced to you, and your take on them?</div>
<a name="09060975000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kornicki:</b></i> These matters were introduced to us when
the Bill was printed. We had no sight or prior knowledge of them. We
have good relations with officials. I sit representing both Churches on
the senior stakeholders group, but there was no intimation of this at
all.</div><a name="09060975000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000405"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Thank you. It is understood from the earlier
exchanges that we are trying to strike a relatively fine balance
between the objectives of equality and not collapsing your position
into an at-large licence for discrimination and the rather&#151;as
you see it&#151;narrow provisions in the Bill. I noticed in
particular that Mr. Fittall mentioned three tests:
representational functions, pastoral functions and the third one, which
came in as a side wind, teaching. I am not clear whether that is
subsumed by the pastoral. Would an amendment along those lines achieve
what you want, which is presumably to allow you to deal with situations
of scandal or distress to the Church, but outwith the constraints of
equality law, without collapsing your position to one of
discrimination? How do you see the balance being
struck?</div><a name="09060975000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> That is exactly right. I should have said,
as we did in our briefing to proceedings on Second Reading, that we
broadly support the objectives of the Bill. Gay rights are important,
and people should not in general be discriminated against in the
workplace. You are talking about how to balance conflicting rights. The
issue is where you strike the balance. Our contention is that it ought
to be possible through judicious amendments to strike that balance more
satisfactorily.</div><a name="09060975000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
end of the day, we want equality. We also want to preserve religious
liberty, which has been  an important hallmark of this nation
down the  years. However wrong people might believe individual
Churches or other faith groups are on some issues&#151;whether it is
their attitude to divorce, whether women should be priests or same-sex
conduct&#151;it must ultimately be part of the teaching of that
particular faith
strand.</div><a name="09060975000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><a name="09060975000406"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Osborne</b> (Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) (Lab): I would be
interested in what you think about the recent decision of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland to enable a Church of Scotland
minister to fulfil his calling in a church in Aberdeen? It was voted
for by a majority in the General Assembly recently. My understanding is
that he lives openly with his gay partner. Could anything in the Bill
as drafted stop the Church of Scotland doing that? Would there be
implications for how you want to amend it, for
example?</div><a name="09060975000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
you cannot answer for the Church of Scotland and we have no
representative of it here, but why did it believe that such action
struck a balance between its pastoral care and not discriminating
against a
person?</div><a name="09060975000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> I was really disappointed with the statement
made by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for Scotland after the
careful and finely balanced debate that the General Assembly had a
couple of weeks back. The commission said:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="09060975000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The values of fairness,
equality, dignity and respect are of more worth than those of ignorance
and intolerance.&#148;</div><a name="09060975000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well,
that is a point of view, but there is a danger of polarising the two
views. Lots of Churches are agonising over the issue. We saw in the
Church of Scotland debate how it was agonising over whether it could
move forward. It held two debates, one of which allowed the minister to
take up his post in Aberdeen. Two days later, it called a moratorium on
ordaining people in gay relationships and set up a
commission.</div><a name="09060975000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Church
of Scotland is struggling with the issue. The Church of England is
struggling with it; we see that clearly. The Anglican communion is
struggling with it. Some Churches struggle with it less because they
have clear views one way or the other. Our contention is that, whatever
our particular position on the spectrum, such things must be worked out
within the particular faith
tradition.</div><a name="09060975000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
we should not be allowed to discriminate, as you would see it, in
relation to backroom jobs. The Government recognise that there is a
sort of front-of-house role to assist the observation of
&#147;liturgical and ritualistic practices&#148;&#151;not a
phrase that we would have come up with had we drafted the
Bill&#151;and promoting and explaining the doctrine of the
religion.</div><a name="09060975000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision has been drafted narrowly and it creates some anomalies, too.
It draws the line in a very strange place. It could enable
discrimination against organists, but not youth workers. We need some
discussion about that, as the Bill moves
forward.</div><a name="09060975000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maleiha
Malik:</b></i> I do not think that there is any evidence that
there is a narrowing, but, like the British Humanist Association, we
would very much welcome and strongly support any narrowing of the
exemptions, for the following reason. The way the exemptions strike the
balance between the rights of organised religion to discriminate and
the rights of individuals to be free from discrimination is deeply
unfair. It gives too much power to organised religions to police their
internal members.</div><a name="09060975000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
submission proposed the following amendment &#151;a narrowing
of the exemptions to subject them to requirements of reasonableness and
proportionality, as in many Scandinavian countries. So, for example, an
individual who had worked for a long time and then went through certain
private law changes could not be summarily dismissed from
employment.</div><a name="09060975000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we strongly recommended in our submission that the current position of
having no supervision of how those exemptions are being used is
unsatisfactory. We suggested that there should be an annual reporting
provision. Those who exercise exemptions should report annually to the
Joint Committee on Human
Rights.</div><a name="09060975000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000407"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to probe a slightly different aspect. I am
fairly relaxed in those cases where there is a genuine occupational
requirement for the Churches to be able to exercise their right to
choose. What I am not clear about, which is the start of my question,
is whether the Bill narrows the
law.</div><a name="09060975000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
existing regulations, it is already the case that being of a particular
religion or belief can be a genuine occupational requirement of the
job. It is already the case in existing law, to pick up Ms
Malik&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>point, that the requirement has to be proportionately applied. We seem
to be arguing about whether the exact wording in the Bill
around</div><a name="09060975000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting or
explaining the doctrines of the
religion&#148;</div><a name="09060975000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">sufficiently
captures those who are not doing so, such as those involved in pastoral
work.</div><a name="09060975000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at one
of the examples given by the Catholic bishops, I would not think that a
residential caretaker post was an instance in which being a practising
Catholic ought to be an occupational requirement of the job, just
because of contact with members of the Church. My reading of the Bill
so far suggests that it does not actually&#151;certainly not
significantly&#151;narrow the existing law, because the existing law
says that it has to be a genuine occupational requirement of the job.
What I am looking for is why you think it
does.</div><a name="09060975000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The youth worker
role, from what you have said about it involving the teaching of the
religion and its nature, seems to me to fall within the exemption in
the Bill. I am not clear what other roles you are talking about that
would be
excluded.</div><a name="09060975000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000408"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Please keep questions fairly concise; we have a
lot to do before 11.30
am.</div><a name="09060975000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kornicki:</b></i> My understanding is that the previous
legislative provisions did not define the purposes of an organised
religion. That is defined in paragraph 2(8) of schedule 9, and it is
that definition that effectively narrows the law. That is the change
that has been made, as I understand
it.</div><a name="09060975000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that we
are trying to make here is that, fundamentally, this goes to the
credibility of the post holder in performing their function. The youth
worker may have a function that involves supervising teenage children
in a church hall, in social activities. That is not formal teaching of
religion, but the group may be coming up to their confirmation, and
issues of religion will and should arise&#151;issues of morality and
of behaviour. It would not be credible for the person holding that post
not to be in harmony with the teachings of the Church. The credibility
of the function being performed would be at stake in such pastoral,
representative roles if the person were not in harmony with the
teachings of the Church. That is what we are looking
at.</div><a name="09060975000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> May I clarify? We are not saying that the
religious genuine occupational requirement in paragraph 3 of schedule 9
has been changed; it is the other requirements relating to sex,
marriage and  sexual orientation, which come in paragraph 2.
The interaction between those two is where you get the narrowing. In
saying that something is a religious post, yes, that remains the same,
but what requirements can be set in relation to marital history, sexual
orientation, conduct and so on? That is where there is undoubtedly a
narrowing&#151;in paragraph
2(8).</div><a name="09060975000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jon
Benjamin:</b></i> The discussion to this point has picked up
a number of themes, one of which is the lack of uniformity, be it in
the Church or the Jewish religion, over how these things will be
applied. In the case of the youth worker who comes out or whose
marriage breaks down, an important reaction may  be that of the
parents or the members of the organisation&#151;how they would
respond to that&#151;and, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>again, rightly or wrongly, whether the wider population would endorse
that view. Their concerns and their rights to practise their religion
and to have people interacting with them and their children must be
considered.</div><a name="09060975000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
lack of uniformity, and I do not think that one can fairly press any
one of us for an answer&#151;goodness knows, in the Jewish community
there is a great breadth of opinion on all those issues. Equally, it
comes down to the nature of the occupation or the job. It is very
difficult. Maybe Parliament should avoid trying to give a definitive
black-and-white view on any of those
things.</div><a name="09060975000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Genuine
occupational requirement&#148; is a helpful phrase as far as it goes.
&#147;Reasonableness&#148; and those words beloved by us lawyers
also help, but ultimately,  it will come down to not the
courts, I hope, but the Equality and Human Rights
Commission or whoever is providing guidance. I understand that the
commission is considering providing guidance&#151;perhaps statutory
guidance&#151;to help people, employers and potential employees
through what will be a
minefield.</div><a name="09060975000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It occurs
to me that, taking the example of faith schools, which is an area I am
quite involved in, it should be incumbent on employers to provide in
the job specification some justification for what is a genuine
occupational requirement and the mores and standards of behaviour and
activity that they expect. Then, in all fairness to the applicants for
a job, they would understand what was required of them and whether they
would be comfortable working in a particular environment. That might
avoid a lot of these problems down the line, but of course, one cannot
foresee a marriage breaking down or someone&#146;s lifestyle changing
significantly.</div>
<a name="09060975000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, there is a very
up-front and open approach to what is expected of people. Perhaps the
document can be used in some evidential way to show whether the
requirements of the community in which someone is seeking to work are
set out clearly, so that they know what they are letting themselves in
for, and equally, whether the community, the Church, the organisation
or the religious institution has set out its stall clearly at the
outset.</div><a name="09060975000099"></a>

138</b><a name="09060975000409"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): We are quickly getting into
the area of competing rights. In many ways, the Bill does not deal with
it, or find any way out. Out of interest&#151;if we have the
time&#151;I want to know from all panel members whether you have any
suggestions about how we deal with competing rights. Is it your feeling
that the courts have been tending to take the line recently that
religion is at the bottom of the list, and if there are eight protected
characteristics, will the Bill leave us with religion clearly at No.
8?</div><a name="09060975000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kornicki:</b></i> I think the answer is yes. There is
anecdotal evidence&#151;I do not have details to cite&#151;of the
number of court judgments that have seen religion as a lesser right
when compared to others. The worry is that the Bill sets up in a number
of areas issues where different rights will be in conflict and
different parties, both of whom are protected under the legislation,
may claim the protection of the same legislation against each other.
That is difficult.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="09060975000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is regrettable that the Bill
gives absolutely no indication of the means by which those issues are
to be resolved. They have to be resolved, but at present every employer
and public authority will be left not knowing what effect the law is
intended to have. The result of that, inevitably, will be a chilling
effect on public practice to avoid the risk of legal
action.</div><a name="09060975000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authorities at
every level, with increasing gold-plating, will give themselves
precautionary rules to prevent anything from happening. That ultimately
means that public dialogue will be much less rich, and it will have a
suppressive effect on freedom of religion. It is important to remember
that article 9 of the European convention on human rights provides for
freedom of religion, not freedom of thought. We are talking about the
freedom to practise religion in
full.</div><a name="09060975000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><a name="09060975000410"></a><b class="B">The
Solicitor-General</b><b class="B">:</b> As the Minister taking the Bill
forward, it is my strong view that there is no narrowing in the
definition. I would be pleased to follow the question that Mark Harper
put to you, to try to get a clearer answer. Perhaps it is best
expressed by saying that it is possible to have an exception. We are
talking about licensing discrimination, and consequently you will all
accept that that exception must be as narrow as possible. The
explanatory notes best encapsulate that by stating that employment for
purposes of an organised religion can exclude people if
</div><a name="09060975000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appointing a person who
meets the requirement in
question&#148;</div><a name="09060975000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;presumably
that is adherence to a
faith&#151;</div><a name="09060975000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is a
proportionate way of complying with the doctrines of the
religion.&#148;</div> <a name="09060975000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
definition, which I do not think narrows down what went before. Perhaps
you could help me. I assume that nobody wants a disproportionate way of
complying with the doctrines of the religion. Why would you want more
licence than merely that which is sufficient to comply with those
doctrines? That is a two-pronged question.</div>
<a name="09060975000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kornicki:</b></i> We may be at cross purposes. We are looking
at schedule 9, paragraph 2(8), which gives a definition of employment
for the purposes of an organised religion. I understand that that was
not qualified under previous legislation. The Bill qualifies it quite
strictly in two sub-paragraphs that limit it to</div>
<a name="09060975000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;leading or assisting in the
observation of liturgical or ritualistic
practices&#148;,</div><a name="09060975000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
alternatively</div><a name="09060975000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting
or explaining the doctrine of the
religion&#148;.</div><a name="09060975000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes make it clear that a youth worker, for example, would
be excluded under the provision. This relates to requirements relating
to sex, marriage or sexual orientation only.</div>
<a name="09060975000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> May I add a further point to answer the
Minister&#146;s question? The phrase &#147;proportionate
means&#148; in sub-paragraph (6) was not in the earlier regulations
on sexual orientation. Of course we do not want to argue that we should
have disproportionate freedom, but it must be asked what the effect of
this measure will be. This is a situation in which once complainants
have established a prima facie case, the onus of proof is put on the
defendant, which would be the religious organisation. Effectively
inserting a requirement that someone has to prove that that is
necessary&#151;which is what the religious organisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>would have to do&#151;would make this a higher case. In effect, you
have provided that for priests, bishops, imams and so on, that would be
okay, but we are saying that there is a wider range of jobs.</div>
<a name="09060975000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">My director of ministry at
Church house has a big representational role. He is not out there
teaching the faith, but he is involved in organisation and selection of
people for ministry. The director of communications for the Church of
England has a representational role, and it would not be credible for
him to do his job if he had been married three times and caused a
scandal, or if he were a campaigning member for gay rights in a
sexually active relationship. Given the Church of England&#146;s
position, that would not be consistent. Taken together, I think that
sub-paragraphs (6) and (8) make it more difficult for us to impose our
requirements. If that is not deliberate, perhaps we could discuss the
matter further.</div>
<a name="09060975000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000411"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I must interrupt: I am sorry but we are limited
in time and I want to move the deliberations of the Committee to the
part of the Bill that deals with the impact on religious organisations
carrying out public functions. I call John
Mason.</div>
<a name="09060975000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000412"></a>John
Mason:</b> On the question of public functions, the main
distinction seems to be about whether the public sector as a whole has
a duty to provide services. Within that, you could have lots of diverse
groups providing those services, or does each individual group have to
do everything? For example, the health service provides for abortions,
but individual members can be involved in that or not. Similarly, with
adoption agencies, schools or other organisations with public duties,
do you feel that it is necessary that everybody deals with everything,
or is it possible to have separate groups providing different
ways?</div>
<a name="09060975000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Andrew
Copson:</b></i> Our view is that there will always be, to
some extent, a mixture of provision in that way. There will be some
clear needs, especially locally and in particular communities, to
provide services by a certain group for a certain group. That is the
way that a public authority could satisfy their obligations, but
equally it might be the case for services that are delivered or
co-ordinated on a national level that they are provided in the other
way. However, I do not think that the Bill tends in one direction or
the other. Our concern is far more likely to be that if organisations
such as religious ones are providing a public function, they are held
to the same non-discrimination rules as secular or state agencies and
organisations that are performing public functions. That is something
that the Bill does not fully do at the moment, because it allows
religious organisations to discriminate in employment and in the
provision of services, even when they are providing a public service
under contract. We would say that they should not be allowed to. We
make no judgment about whether it is right or wrong to allow religious
organisations to contract to provide public services, but we say that
if they do so, they should be subject to the same requirements as
everyone
else.</div><a name="09060975000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> We want to say that you need to proceed with
a bit of care in this area. If you look at schools, you have 1 million
children in Church of England schools and many people in Roman Catholic
schools and other faith schools. That is necessary, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>accepted by the Government, and the Bill allows it to continue. The
distinctive ethos of those schools should be preserved. Yes, there is
public money going in, they are part of state education and they have
to observe a lot of public requirements, and quite rightly so, but the
notion that the Catholic, the Anglican or the Jewish identity of the
school should be safeguarded by requiring that the head teacher is of
that particular faith does not seem at all a strange proposition. The
Government recognise that, and that is preserved by the Bill, although
I know that the British Humanist Association is not happy with that.
However, on that score, we want the Bill to remain as it is. If you are
going to have faith schools as part of the state system, you need to
allow them to preserve their
ethos.</div><a name="09060975000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jon
Benjamin:</b></i> It is self-evident that charities and
voluntary groups, be they religious or otherwise, make a huge
contribution to the welfare services in this country. My concern,
again, is about apparent conflicts and managing those conflicts and
interpretations.</div><a name="09060975000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one takes the example of a care home for elderly Jewish people or a
battered women&#146;s refuge, clearly, they are providing a service,
possibly because of the vulnerability of the beneficiaries, for a
particular group or minority, religious or otherwise. They are
providing a service. They may be doing it at some cost to themselves,
therefore relieving the state or the local authority of that burden,
but there is concern that the public duty of a local
authority that procures those services will be interpreted differently
from the exceptions that are quite legitimately open to the service
provider. It is a matter of helping the people who will apply this to
understand that, notwithstanding their public duty in terms of
discrimination and equality, it is legitimate for a particular group to
provide a care home for elderly Jewish people, battered Muslim women or
whoever it may be. That conflict needs to be managed and
explained.</div>

conscientious objection, which exist in statute for abortion. Is it
your contention, Mr. Kornicki, that there ought to be more
opt-outs for people performing public functions&#151;for them not
have to do certain things on the basis of their conscience, religious
or
otherwise?</div><a name="09060975000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kornicki:</b></i> What you are suggesting is a new approach
to issues in the Bill. I would start from somewhere different, if I
may. We are looking for a way in which we can recognise the ability of
people to live their lives in accordance with religious teachings as
they have done for a very long period, while being consistent with the
requirements that the Government are now making. There is a balance to
be struck here; in different areas a different approach might be the
right answer. Opt-outs might be one answer for some issues&#151;they
exist already. There may be other legislative approaches which would
achieve the same end, which is what we are concerned
about.</div>

me&#148; or &#147;I am not going to treat unmarried women who come

separate question of Mr. Benjamin? There is an exemption in
the Bill that allows religious organisations&#151;even, as
Mr. Copson said, those performing public functions&#151;to
discriminate against people who are seeking to access those public
functions, based on their religion. You gave an example of a care home.
How do you feel about a Catholic adoption agency saying that
prospective Jewish adoptive parents need not
apply?</div><a name="09060975000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jon
Benjamin:</b></i> If an adoption agency is catering for
Catholic families and helping them to have families and raise them in
the Catholic ethos then I do not see a problem. There are agencies out
there that will help all sorts of people&#151;gay couples,
whoever&#151;to adopt and no one needs to feel that they have missed
out. If there is a Jewish adoption agency providing a service for
Jewish people, there is equality there. That is real equality, because
people have a choice: they can go to the agency that works for them and
their way of life.</div>

Can I ask Mr. Fittall whether he thinks that, in terms of
the Bill, it is reasonable that children in school should be exposed to
unwanted conduct if they are gay&#151;conduct, for example, that
violates their dignity and creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading
or humiliating environment? Can you picture any circumstances where you
think that that would be acceptable in schools, on the grounds of
sexual orientation, in the terms that I have
given?</div><a name="09060975000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">William
Fittall:</b></i> There are two questions there. One is
whether there are any circumstances in which it is right, and the
second question is whether it should be made against the law. I
entirely agree with you that there are no circumstances in which that
should happen. However, as we have discovered after long debates on the
harassment issue&#151;in relation not only to employment, but to
services and facilities and to harassment on religious or sexual
orientation grounds&#151;you quickly get into significant difficulty,
because the definition of harassment has an objective element and a
subjective element. You have to ask yourself the wider question: how
far do you want the law to trespass into territories where good conduct
is best promoted by example and encouragement, rather than by the force
of law?</div>

difference between adults seeking to book a hotel and children who are
a captive audience in school, where we know that there is a
problem&#151;which none of us would support and I am not accusing you
of supporting this&#151;of homophobic bullying, and being subjected
to an intimidating, hostile, degrading or humiliating environment in

whenever it arises. It is a highly contested area. Let us be under no

Do you want to bring litigation into such matters or are they best
resolved by other means? Our contention is that bringing the law into
that area will not be particularly

discrimination.</div><a name="09060975000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maleiha
Malik:</b></i> On the issue of conscientious objection, there
are provisions in the legislation through indirect religious
discrimination provisions to allow some accommodation of religion and
belief in areas such as the workplace. My
organisation is strongly against further accommodation of conscientious
objection, especially in the public sector for the following two
reasons. First, we are very strongly against it when the conscientious
objection in and of itself constitutes a breach of the constitutional
right not to be discriminated against by another person. That would be
the case, for example, of the Christian registrar&#151;the Ladele
case&#151;who wanted the right not to perform civil partnerships. The
case was decided in an industrial tribunal and we endorse the decision
of Mr. Justice Patrick Elias at the Employment Appeal
Tribunal, who held that, in fact, she had no right to conscientious
objection. Our pragmatic reason is that it is wrong, as a matter of
principle and practice, to send out a signal that there can be
segregated public services when public officials should, rather than
setting the tone of discrimination law, be at the forefront of
discriminating against users of public
services.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000420"></a>The

147</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000421"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The Government&#146;s suggestion is that it
should be possible to provide for multiple discrimination protection
when there are multiple protective characteristics. Will that make the
law simpler or will it create further complexities, which will be
difficult to navigate other than through the courts?</div>
<a name="09060975000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maleiha

because the different grounds of discrimination mean that people are

you capture certain types of harms that otherwise slip through the
cracks. It also allows a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>greater degree of flexibility for courts in terms of remedies. The most
important area in which it is useful is, for example, when an
individual falls within race, gender and sexual orientation. That must
be the area  at which the discrimination law is targeted

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><a name="09060975000425"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): It is a pleasure to
have you in the Chair, Mr. Bercow, and at short
notice.</div><a name="09060975000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask
each of the panel members quickly some questions about gender pay
audits. I was particularly struck by some of the estimates in the
impact assessment&#151;the costs of a gender pay audit for companies
in the private sector. Pages 138 and 139  of the impact
assessment say that the one-off implementation costs of a gender pay
audit would be &#163;92.24 per company and the ongoing, annually
recurring costs would be &#163;15.38 per company. Do any of you have
views on how realistic those costs
are?</div><a name="09060975000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We think that those costs are an
underestimation of the real costs involved. Possibly the reason for
that is that, in calculating the figure,  the people doing the
impact assessment have not taken  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>into account what must lie behind coming to that figure. The truth is
that there is a lot of background work that needs to be done first by
companies, which is particularly true for small firms. Many of our
members have said that, in order to produce accurate statistics or
gender pay audits, they would need to use external consultants, for
example. Unfortunately, few of those charge &#163;92 or &#163;15,
so we think that the costs are  likely to be much higher than
those in the impact
assessment.</div><a name="09060975000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000426"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Do you have any idea, roughly, what order of
magnitude you would
expect?</div><a name="09060975000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We do not have any statistical figures. We have
asked some of our members what they think the costs involve in doing
pay audits. The views range. One member said that they think the cost
is equivalent to having one employee working on nothing else for a
month or two. That was quite a small firm. A medium-sized firm with
about 700 employees&#151;if I remember correctly&#151;estimated the
cost of a pay audit to be &#163;14,000.</div>
<a name="09060975000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000427"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Does anyone else on the panel have a view on
this?</div><a name="09060975000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> It is probably quite difficult to make
assessments. I assume that questions have been asked of companies that
already do it, which could produce a realistic figure and say,
&#147;It costs us this much.&#148; There are huge variables between
different sectors. A lot depends on how companies organise themselves.
A well-organised company with a good payroll system ought to be able to
identify such things relatively cheaply. If you have never done it
before, it will be front-end loaded. The first time you do it, it will
cost quite a lot, but as soon as you have got it into your systems, and
you are doing it regularly, it would not be a particular administrative
cost. For a smaller firm it is a different exercise. In a very small
firm, you can simply look around and you will know almost off the top
of your head who has paid what for doing
what.</div>
<a name="09060975000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000428"></a>John
Penrose:</b> And the Government are only proposing it for
businesses with 250 employees or more, I think. The Government would
agree with you that it would cost more up front. They think the set-up
costs would be &#163;92 and then &#163;15 ongoing. Does that seem
reasonable to you? Does anybody else on the panel have any evidence?
Have any of their members been consulted on whether these are
reasonable?</div>
<a name="09060975000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> It seems reasonable to me if you agree with
the principle that you should eliminate gender pay discrimination. If
you are going to do that, you have to find out where it is going on.
You might find that it is not going on, in which case that is good for
your company.</div>
<a name="09060975000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000429"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Sorry, I mean is the cost a reasonable estimate
of the true cost?</div>
<a name="09060975000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> As I said before, it varies so much from
company to company. You are always going to get a very crude analysis,
unfortunately, so I would not like to say.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div><a name="09060975000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> We are very relaxed about this aspect of
the Bill. As you know, it applies to companies with more than 250
staff. That is 9,000 companies in total out of a company ratio of 5
million in the UK. We have a pyramid system. We have millions of tiny
small businesses and just a few thousand very large companies. The vast
majority of small firms would be excluded from this, so we are very
pleased with that aspect. It could be that some of the costs would be
passed on through the fees from organisations like Sage and through the
accountancy profession. But small firms would be completely and totally
excluded from the imposition, and we are very pleased. We lobbied for
that and got it.</div>
<a name="09060975000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> I cannot comment on the costs. As Sarah said,
it probably varies from organisation to organisation, but where we come
from, it is just good business sense to know how you are spending your
money and how you are managing your pay bill. Your approach to that
ensures that people who work for you feel that you value them
appropriately. So our position is to encourage voluntary activity
because it is just a common-sense way of managing things. The costs may
vary, but why would you pay money out to people without knowing whether
it is effective? We encourage the voluntary approach&#151;very much
so.</div>
<a name="09060975000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
155</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000430"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Thank you. Can I move on to the broader issue of
the gender pay gap and how one addresses it? I expect and hope that
everybody here would agree on the principle and importance of trying to
deal with it. I am interested in how much of the gender pay gap you
believe can be sorted out within companies, as opposed to it
originating there and needing to be dealt with through action elsewhere
in society and the community as a whole. Equal Opportunities Commission
research says that 38 per cent. of the gender pay gap is due
to</div><a name="09060975000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;other factors
associated with being
female&#148;,</div><a name="09060975000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">which include
&#147;direct discrimination&#148;, and also a
variety of indirect factors and &#147;systematic
disadvantage&#148;. I am concerned that we might be looking at a
relatively small proportion of the gender pay gap in company activity
and action. Do any of you have views on whether that analysis is
correct?</div>
<a name="09060975000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> Firms in the UK small business sector
typically employ 10 or 20 people. The staff have a very close
relationship with the employer and talk to each other regularly. We
believe that the element of a gender pay gap within the small firm
sector is very tiny. I have used the word &#147;sector&#148;, and
the best way to address the gender pay gap is to look at it
sectorially. It is particularly such sectors as those involving
catering, supermarkets and part-time work that might require company
targeting. In terms of business size, we do not think that any exercise
within the small firm or research sectors would unearth huge gender pay
gaps.</div>
<a name="09060975000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I would suggest that there are a number of
contributory factors, as is suggested by research
from the Equal Opportunities Commission. The TUC has never said that
the gap is due solely to the fact that employers are discriminating,
either indirectly or directly, but there is clearly a sex
discrimination element, which is why pay auditing is important. There
are other huge extraneous factors, such as the availability of flexible
working, and measures to facilitate women returning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>from maternity leave and to provide the extra training that they might
need to catch up. It is a complex picture, and a lot will depend on
what the company does and what sort of people it is trying to
recruit.</div> <a name="09060975000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
still argue that sex discrimination&#151;usually indirectly, but
occasionally directly&#151;is an important factor, and something
within the employer&#146;s control. That is why the TUC has been
concerned to ensure that measures are in place to work out what the
problem is and to promote workplace solutions. We are pushing hard at
the idea of developing people within the work force who can work with
employers to identify and deal with those complicated issues, and we
hope that the Government will support that. Union equality reps should
be given the statutory rights that other union representatives have to
help employers to work on equality issues and eliminate discrimination.
That would save the public purse a lot of money on often unnecessary
litigation, and it would solve systemic problems in the workplace,
which is where they need to be solved.</div>
<a name="09060975000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000431"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I want to ensure that others have a chance to
answer that point, but I think that the Government&#146;s estimate is
that there will be a 1 per cent. reduction in the number of tribunal
cases as a result of this. Do you think that that is a large
benefit&#151;and is that figure right?</div>
<a name="09060975000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I think that you can get far more than that
just on matters of equal pay, which is now one of the biggest
jurisdictions in the employment tribunals. If we can deal with an
unequal pay system, that would remove literally thousands of claims
from the tribunal system for a large workplace. As long as it is
pitched right, the training is available and people can have the time
off to do that training, we could effectively take a lot of cases out
of the system. I think that the number would be far
more.</div>

allow others to respond.</div>
<a name="09060975000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> As Sarah was saying, there are a lot of
issues that can cause problems. Poor management practice can lead to
issues of unfair or unequal pay, which is why the auditing process is
very important. Digging deep to find out the causes of the situation
would mean that an employer could manage their pay bill far more
effectively.</div> <a name="09060975000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
a complicated matter, and there are many issues that are not under the
direct control of the employer. There are issues about women preferring
to make decisions about what jobs to go for, and the trade-off
decisions that they might make in terms of access to part-time work
versus pay levels&#151;that is very important&#151;or the distance
they need to travel to work. Another issue might be the confidence
levels that women have regarding bargaining for pay in the first place.
Those complicated issues must be dealt with on all fronts, not just
left as the responsibility of the employer. Employers need to get their
act together, and it is common sense for them to do so, but we need to
work in partnership on this issue and not simply depend on the usual
defence of market rates. Market rates can have an inbuilt bias, and we
must be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>conscious of those dimensions and ensure that we work together more
coherently to deal with the gender pay gap.</div>
<a name="09060975000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We agree that the causes are complex, and if we
want to make progress, we must find a holistic solution that tackles
the education system, the choices that girls and boys make at school
and the fact that vocational training still has such a strong gender
bias. We must also look at child care and the choices that women make
to take time out of the labour market.</div>
<a name="09060975000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Employers also have a role and
they can&#151;and should&#151;do more to help women to progress in
the workplace. We suggest that more progress can be made by looking at
issues such as flexible working, particularly at senior levels within
an organisation. We should look at things such as leadership training
for women, and performance training for line managers in some cases, to
ensure that there is no bias. We should also look at things such as
networking and mentoring schemes that help women progress in the
workplace. Companies all have different challenges, and they need to be
able to find the solutions that work for them and deliver real
progress.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000433"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Continuing the theme of gender pay audits and
equal pay, I will call Lynne Featherstone, followed by Nia Griffith,
Tim Boswell and Sandra Osborne.</div>
<a name="09060975000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><a name="09060975000434"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): I have one
question each for Sarah and Katja. Last night I sat for two hours at
the meeting of Unison and the Fawcett Society. The room was full, and
every person who spoke said that the most important thing in the
workplace was to have mandatory pay audits, yet they have been left out
of the Bill. I wonder what Sarah thinks are the effects on
women&#146;s poverty in perpetuity if we cannot amend the Bill and
include the
audits.</div><a name="09060975000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> It would be regrettable if the Bill was not an
opportunity to introduce mandatory pay audits. We in the TUC have never
said that they are a panacea or that they alone will solve the problem,
but you will not be able to identify unequal pay until you carry out
systemic monitoring to find out where and why the discrimination is
taking place, and then hopefully work out workplace solutions for
addressing it.</div><a name="09060975000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
had years and years of reviews&#151;equal pay has been reviewed more
times than anything else. The Equal Opportunities Commission has done
it, and we have had the Kingsmill review and the women and work
commission. They have all said that it is essential to have pay
auditing if you are going to crack the problem. However, the trouble is
that they have all shied away from making it
compulsory.</div><a name="09060975000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
greatest respect to Katja, employers are simply not doing it enough.
There are some who are doing it, admirably, who have found that it is
not the problem that they thought it was going to be and that it has
delivered huge benefits. However, there is a hard core in the private
sector&#151;the public sector is different&#151;that simply will
not do it. Until it is done, we will not be able to crack the problem,
which is why the TUC has been adamant about pushing that point. I would
add, however, that we do not think that that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>alone will solve the problem, and I agree with the proposition that
there are a number of other extraneous factors, but you must do that,
and again we urge the Government to do
so.</div>
<a name="09060975000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000435"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> It seems pretty much central to me, and we
have seen that with exposure, publication and comparison&#151;when
people can see what is happening&#151;you get it dealt with. That is
the case in point.</div>
<a name="09060975000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Katja, we have met, and I have
talked to the CBI, so we know where you are coming from: you do not
think that that is the answer. Cost and the recession are often brought
into the equation whenever this discussion occurs. The Government have
said that this will be voluntary until 2013, which is, without
question, four years too late. Two quarters of downward growth in
returns signifies a recession. Would the CBI think that it would be a
good move if I tabled an amendment to say that there should be two
consecutive quarters of growth to signify the start of mandatory pay
audits, so they would begin in either 2013 or after two quarters of
growth&#151;whichever came
earlier?</div><a name="09060975000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> No, because mandatory pay audits would be the
answer only if the main cause of the pay gap was discrimination between
men and women doing the same
job.</div><a name="09060975000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000436"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> But how do we
know?</div><a name="09060975000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We know that that is not the main cause based
on the women and work commission report and other research. Nobody has
been able to establish that it is a factor, or how much of a factor it
is. I am not aware of any research suggesting that that is the main
cause of the pay
gap.</div><a name="09060975000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a place
for pay audits; many companies choose to do them on a voluntary basis.
We survey our members on the issue every year, and we know that more
than 50 per cent. of large firms now undertake voluntary pay audits,
and they do so as part of their package on diversity in the workplace.
Many of them find that useful. However, we also know that, in the vast
majority of cases, when they find a pay gap, it is not between men and
women doing the same job. We need to be realistic here: the audits are
expensive, time consuming and bureaucratic. For a company with limited
resources, there are often better and more effective ways of spending
money than on a pay
audit.</div><a name="09060975000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000437"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> In terms of equal pay for equal work, in
many companies the jobs of women are not the highest paid, and nor do
women reach the highest end of the grade. There is discrimination that
is about not equal pay for equal work, but what jobs are actually
available to women. We cannot see that without exposure of the whole
range.</div>
<a name="09060975000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> I do not think you can say that the fact that
not enough women are in senior jobs in the United
Kingdom is to do with employer discrimination. If you want to look at
getting more women into senior positions, I suggest that you might need
to look at participation levels within different organisations because
pay levels would not give that information. If you want more women at
senior levels, I still think that one of the best things to do is to
encourage companies to offer more flexibility in senior
jobs.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="09060975000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000438"></a>Lynne
Featherstone:</b> I am certainly not saying that there are not
other
issues.</div><a name="09060975000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><a name="09060975000439"></a><b class="B">Nia
Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I am picking up a certain
degree of negativity from the representatives from the CBI and the FSB
about a form of compulsory pay audit. What sort of reporting would you
regard as helpful for identifying pay gaps? Will you ask yourselves
whether you really are an organisation that takes diversity and
equality seriously? Most importantly, if you do not have some form of
reporting, how do you measure
progress?</div><a name="09060975000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> With regard to the smaller business
centres, I have intimated that the boss or employer&#151;increasingly
the female boss or the female employer&#151;in the new archetype has
females over 35 as employees. Increasingly, that person knows exactly
who gets paid what, and good employers who want a good reputation and
to access local authority and public sector contracts will do all that
they can, and will probably have in place a structure through which
everyone is paid equally. We worked with the Equal Opportunities
Commission, as it was then, on equal pay toolkits for small employers,
which worked very well. We are relaxed and content about the threshold
and the acknowledgment that, for smaller employers, it is best to
vouchsafe them before bringing them on to a regulatory element, so that
they are free to employ more
people.</div><a name="09060975000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">One way
forward could be to talk to the major audit industries and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants to see whether they can provide a
solution. The large companies&#151;the CBI members&#151;are audited
annually by those in the industry. As for whether the audit on equal
pay can be carried out at a reasonable rate, the audit industry should
look at the cost
argument.</div><a name="09060975000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
163</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000440"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> The point of reporting is to communicate
something from one person or body to another. I am not sure how your
knowledge of this, that and the other, regarding a particular member of
your organisation, can rely on a descriptive method of saying what is
going on, rather than arising from something that is easy to see and
analyse.</div><a name="09060975000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> Well, 3 million self-employed people do
not need audits&#151;they do not have audits as such. We are talking
about 1 million companies doing statutory audits. As for including
businesses that do not have fiscal audits anyway in another audit, that
would have a fairly regulatory impact. We approve of the exemption and
the voluntary elements. If all that does not work, it is obviously up
to the Government to think about whether there should be a mandatory
element. I refer you to the equal pay toolkit that was devised by the
EOC along with the Federation of Small Businesses, which was a solution
to our members, and to think along those lines. The Equality and Human
Rights Commission might be one way forward to get the message
out.</div><a name="09060975000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
164</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000441"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> So you would be encouraging your members to look
at ways of
reporting.</div><a name="09060975000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> To make sure that there are things out
there that can help them to double check that they are paying equally.
When asked the question, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>the vast majority of my members do pay equally. They are so
small&#151;with five staff&#151;they would pay equally, and I
cannot see how they would not. In a small firm where everyone knows
everyone else, if you pay unequally, the resentment that is bred, as
well as the employment tribunal prospects, are horrendous for small
employers.</div><a name="09060975000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000442"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> I am still unclear about how we communicate that
in the small
print.</div><a name="09060975000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000443"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does anyone else want to come
in?</div><a name="09060975000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Of course, there is a trade-off between a
simple metric figure, which would be easy to compare across
organisations but would risk being meaningless if taken out of context,
and a more descriptive or narrative form of reporting that might be
more meaningful, but would not be as easy to compare. Where the CBI and
most of our members come from on this issue is about what we need to
do. Of course we need to encourage greater transparency, and of course
companies need to have some idea of where they are in order to know
where they want to get to, but where we would like to start is by
finding out what works. I do not think that we have a clear idea at the
moment about what companies are doing out there, and about what they
find works and delivers progress. We know of companies that monitored
for years and years and made very little progress, but then they
introduced staff surveys and tracked the satisfaction rates of
different groups of employees, which has enabled them to make real
progress. For them, that has been a much more meaningful way of
reporting&#151;or whatever you want to call
it.</div><a name="09060975000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the first
instance, we would like to find out what works and what does not. We
would see us&#151;the CBI&#151;as having a role in gathering that
information. On that basis, we think that there could be merit in
developing, in a sense, a basket of indicators that companies could
pick and choose from when it comes to transparency. That might be an
equal pay figure, but it might be such things as female levels of
participation, participation of women at different levels within the
organisation, take-up of flexible working and possibly even child
care&#151;there is a range of indicators. What works in one company
and is meaningful in one company would not necessarily be meaningful in
another company. However, if companies first find out what works, then
we spread that message of good practice and, thirdly, give employers
the tools from which to pick and choose, we think that real progress
could be
made.</div><a name="09060975000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
165</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000444"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I would like to ask Sarah Veale&#151;others may
want to contribute&#151;a little more about part-time workers. My
first question is a sort of technical one, which is whether the
threshold would pose greater problems for employers who typically have
a large part-time or fluctuating work force. I think you are nodding,
but is that at least a potential&#151;that setting a threshold for
audit might create
difficulty?</div><a name="09060975000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> It is clearly much more difficult if you have
a work force that is peripatetic or working various or different types
of
hours.</div><a name="09060975000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000445"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> And expensive, presumably.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="09060975000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> It would be more expensive but, again, the
costs are initial. Once you have worked out the metrics and whatever, I
do not see that it would be any more complicated. Employing part-time
workers often gives employers a greater degree of flexibility and there
is nothing wrong with that at all, but that greater degree of
flexibility sometimes comes with more demanding administrative
costs.</div><a name="09060975000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
166</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000446"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Thank you. I wanted to touch on the question of
the discrimination that may or may not be inherent in part-time work.
My suspicion would be that there is a structural imbalance between
part-time employees and full-time employees&#151;in terms of their
remuneration&#151;that is gender neutral. Secondly, there may well be
an indirect form of discrimination, because females tend to occupy more
of the part-time positions. There are two factors operating, both of
which in a sense are discrimination, but one of which is not
particularly inherent in the Equality Bill&#151;it may be, but in a
different way, and it is not gender discrimination. Would you see that
as a reasonable interpretation? Do you think that you can differentiate
the factors arising from gender discrimination from what I might call
structural discrimination&#151;by the nature of whether the
employment is full-time or
part-time?</div><a name="09060975000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> One of the problems with the law is that
disentangling the two is difficult, because of how equal value is done.
The problem with part-time work is that the question may not simply be
one of possible indirect discrimination in the workplace. A lot results
from people&#146;s lives outside work and the reasons why people work
part-time. The reason why more women work part-time is that they still
tend to be the prime carer at
home.</div><a name="09060975000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
167</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000447"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> There could also be people with a mental health
condition, for example, or a disability.</div>
<a name="09060975000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> Absolutely, or older people who want to phase
themselves out of the workplace and do two or three years part-time as
they go. You would have to differentiate and weigh in some of those
factors. I do not think that makes the operation undoable, but as I was
saying earlier, it makes it slightly more complex. Certainly, the TUC
has always highly encouraged part-time work, but the problem with it is
that employers, and often society, do not value it in the same way as
full-time work, even if the person is doing exactly the same as their
full-time
equivalent.</div><a name="09060975000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know of
examples of job-share schemes where employers have taken on two or
three part-time workers to do a full-time job. If it is managed well,
you get huge benefits. You get one and a half times what you would get
from one person. Good managers will appreciate how to deal with what
are often societal demands for a more flexible approach to how people
do their job. I do not know whether that helps. The trouble is that
equal pay law is not really being touched in the Bill. It is immensely
complicated&#151;more complicated than the laws affecting
discrimination against part-time workers, which are a separate but
linked issue&#151;and probably a lot more work needs to be done on
it.</div><a name="09060975000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000448"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Thank you.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div><a name="09060975000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
168</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000449"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> The legislation to date has not provided the
remedy that it should have provided after such a long period, and there
are all sorts of other complications that have been discussed, on which
progress has also not been made. It is also difficult for individuals
to seek redress in the current circumstances. What are the
panel&#146;s feelings about the idea of representative actions, in
which groups of people could take action at the tribunals? Would that
make the system more efficient and possibly even cheaper? Would it
provide a better remedy for individuals and a more positive way
forward?</div><a name="09060975000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> Do you want me to start? That is one of the
TUC&#146;s propositions, although I am obviously very interested to
hear what everyone else thinks. We put it forward because, particularly
with the large multiple cases and specifically on equal pay, the
current system does not allow you to group together very efficiently
the common points of law that exist across a grade of staff against
whom you are alleging indirect gender pay discrimination. The joy of
representative actions would be that an organisation such as a trade
union, or maybe a citizens advice bureau, could be given a locus to
identify the key legal issues and run a representative test case, if
you like, to which all the individual women would have to sign
up.</div> <a name="09060975000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is that
that would enormously expedite litigation. At the moment, we have cases
where women make a submission and, after it has gone through the
various appellate stages, it is not finally resolved for 11
or 12 years. One of our unions told us that, tragically, one or two of
the women they represented died before receiving the benefits of the
compensation that they were owed. Clearly, anything that expedites the
process would be enormously helpful, so we have put that forward. We
are grateful to the Ministry of Justice for looking into the issue and
seeing what might be done.</div>
<a name="09060975000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise for the record that
we are not talking about class actions. We are not talking about
allowing members of the public to sign up willy-nilly to any cause that
they might think affects them. The case would be specifically
marshalled, and the locus would be given only to groups such as trade
unions and perhaps the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which
could do it expeditiously and curtail it, and not expose employers to
wildcat litigation. We firmly recommend it&#151;certainly to be
looked at&#151;as a means of helping the process work more
efficiently and much more cheaply.</div>
<a name="09060975000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> This is an issue where the CBI and the TUC
disagree quite strongly. We think that it is a myth that representative
actions would somehow streamline the system and facilitate the progress
of such claims. Whatever system you have, you cannot avoid looking at
each individual claim at some stage. The question really is whether you
front-load or back-load it. Whatever system you have, you still have to
assess the individual
claims.</div><a name="09060975000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
under the current system there is already the ability to look at claims
and group them together. We think that could be used much more widely
to speed up the processes involved. We also need to be realistic about
the other potential risks of representative action. Sarah helpfully
says that the TUC is not pushing for class action, which is welcome, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>but I am not sure that the line between the two is always that clear. We
already know that employers&#151;especially small firms&#151;do not
have much faith in the employment tribunal system. There is a real risk
that representative action would lead to a more litigious society and
greater pressure on employers to settle cases even when they are pretty
sure that they would
win.</div><a name="09060975000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> We can go almost full circle because the
process is back-loaded; it is a technique. Employers need to understand
why it makes sense to look at the concept of total reward and how to
better manage the pay bill. In that way they signal the fact that they
are valuing their employees. Looking at flexible working and part-time
working may, as a result of doing an audit, expose the fact that they
are not valuing those people in the right way&#151;they are not
accessing bonuses and so on and so forth&#151;and they are getting
disparities. It would be much more effective to front-load and educate
employers, give them the good practice guidance and build on the
expertise we have had over the years, but expand that through the
provisions that are allowed by the EHRC taking forward the guidance.
That is critical. You cannot do this stuff unless you understand what
to do. Simply being told that you have to do it in law is not the
answer. I am afraid that we have to spend a lot more time investing in
helping people to understand why the proposal is sensible. That is why
it makes sense to push the concept of the business case for diversity
so people get the message and their mindsets switch and they begin to
drive the agenda in a much more proactive
way.</div><a name="09060975000213"></a>

Chairman:</b> Thank you very much. We will have a very brief
interjection by Stephen Alambritis, then we will move to Evan Harris. I
should then like us to move on to some of the other matters that need
to be
addressed.</div><a name="09060975000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> My members want access to justice
themselves. They get free legal advice on employment issues from the
FSB. If they take any action in contravention to that advice, we will
not support them in the run-up to an employment tribunal. Likewise,
staff deserve access to justice. I think that in the
early &#146;90s, there were 30,000 employment tribunal cases and the
latest statistics show something like 200,000, so there is an
increasing tendency for employment disputes to end up at employment
tribunals. What we do not want is vexatious applications that undermine
the confidence of employers, both large and small, in the employment
tribunal system. Some years ago&#151;about four or five
years&#151;we helped one of our members through an employment
tribunal case. The judge awarded &#163;10,000, which is the highest
that can be awarded, against the worker because it was so vexatious and
litigious. We need to ensure that it is a fair system. Behind all those
stats, there are the areas to which Katja referred where there is an
agreement to close the case even though the employer is fully justified
in carrying on. We need to get that balance right. We need access to
fair justice for both
sides.</div><a name="09060975000215"></a>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="09060975000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
169</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000452"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I just want briefly to clarify the CBI&#146;s
position because I do not want it to be misunderstood. Hopefully, these
questions can be answered quite quickly. Do you accept that there is a
pay gap between men and women at the moment that is
unacceptable&#151;for whatever
reason?</div><a name="09060975000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="09060975000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
170</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000453"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Okay. I think that you have accepted that part of
that gap, even if you do not think that it is the main part, is due to
illegal, gender-based pay discrimination&#151;on average; not in
every
company.</div><a name="09060975000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> A very small part.</div>
<a name="09060975000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
171</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000454"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Is your problem, therefore, that you do not think
that pay audits will solve the problem of dealing with this illegally
caused and unacceptable gap, or is it that you think that it is at too
high a price, or
both?</div><a name="09060975000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We think that if an employer is discriminating,
it is unacceptable. We have a strong legislative framework in place
with uncapped compensation so that the employee can seek redress. But
if you want to make real progress on the pay gap, pay audits would be
barking up the wrong tree.</div>
<a name="09060975000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
172</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000455"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So you do not think that they would be effective?
What evidence can you cite that the existing law, and/or the practices
of leadership programmes about which you have talked have made a
significant difference to reducing the pay gap? It may have kept it the
same&#151;it has not got wider thanks to all these little
initiatives&#151;but what evidence can you cite me, with a reference,
that suggests that our existing legislation is dealing with the problem
of the last 40
years?</div><a name="09060975000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> I think that I am right in saying that in 1970
the pay gap was 37 per cent., and it is now 13 per cent. if you look at
median earnings. So clearly, the pay gap is shrinking, but it is not
shrinking by as much as we would like and progress is not as quick as
we would like. But to say that there has not been progress 
would not be
true.</div><a name="09060975000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000456"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Sarah Veale, is that your
view?</div><a name="09060975000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I dispute those figures. I think that the
gender pay gap has been somewhat underestimated there, so I disagree
quite strongly. The fact of the matter is that it has been stubbornly
stark on what is a much higher figure for part-time workers, which, by
the way, is nearer to 40 per cent. I do not think that indicates that
40 years of a piece of legislation has worked on a voluntary basis and
with a few employers being kicked willy-nilly into the
tribunals.</div> <a name="09060975000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that there is a problem with the individual basis of the law. You need
more collective solutions, but it is not working. Any other piece of
law that had not been working for 40 years would be a cause of national
outrage. It is illegal to discriminate, yet it is
happening.</div><a name="09060975000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
173</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000457"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So all you can give me, Ms Hall, are some
contentious figures to show that what we have at the moment is good
enough. I am asking you for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>reference to some academic work that shows that what we have at the
moment&#151;the current legal structure and practices&#151;is
solving the problem, and that we will eliminate the unacceptable pay
gap, which we both accept, in five years&#146; time. Help me,
please.</div><a name="09060975000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> The figures compare the median earnings of
full-time and part-time employees. There is nothing wrong with them.
You may choose a different figure, for example, looking at only
full-time or only part-time. You may choose the mean instead of the
median, but there is nothing wrong with the figure
itself.</div><a name="09060975000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
to why there has not been more progress, to know that, we need to
understand the causes. As we have already discussed, they are
complex&#151;they have to do with our education system, with child
care, women&#146;s experience in the workplace and things such as
flexible
working.</div><a name="09060975000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000458"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not want you to repeat everything that you
have
said.</div><a name="09060975000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000459"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Can I just say to colleagues and
witnesses that I would like to move on to other matters at 12.15 pm,
because there are other issues to be explored. I have just called an
Opposition Member, so I will now call Vera Baird and then John Howell.
It would be helpful if both questioners and witnesses could tailor
their remarks
accordingly.</div><a name="09060975000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
174</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000460"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Can I ask three quick questions? First,
Katja, do you accept that equality and diversity are good for business,
and not its enemies? Stephen and I are assuming that you do, because of
what you said. Let me ask that of you as well, Dianah. You have made
the position clear.</div>
<a name="09060975000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, you have talked a lot
about direct discrimination and how small you think it is. Indirect
discrimination can only really be disclosed by transparency, which
requires some process to reach. Perhaps we are talking not about
culpable employers, but about employers who do not know that they are
paying unequally because of some historic system&#151;they have never
gone through it and done it in a systematic way. Do you
agree?</div><a name="09060975000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, you
were looking, a short time ago, at what you think would work for
businesses in terms of improving gender equality more broadly, but
particularly the gender pay gap. You were talking about a quest for a
basket of indicators, which would inevitably include pay. That is a
good proposition, is it not? That, I think is what the Equality and
Human Rights Commission is going to be asking the CBI to join in doing
with the TUC, precisely to look for those indicators. That can fit on
some metrics, and we can properly measure pay disparity&#151;we seem
to be allied there about that&#151;but do you agree further that what
is really important is that that should be done, and then everybody
should be asked, however involuntarily it is put to them, to comply
with disclosing those measures? That way, we can see, even if it has to
be done differently sector by sector, what companies A to Z are doing
about their pay. The point, surely, would be to get those metrics
worked out between employers and employees as a group, and then move it
into all of your sectors. Would you take responsibility, as the CBI,
for driving that disclosure through all your businesses?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div><a name="09060975000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Yes, of course I agree that equality and
diversity make good business sense and are important. Not only does it
enable employers to recruit from the widest possible pool of employees,
but we know that employers need to respond and serve the customers of
the markets in which they operate, and to do that effectively, their
workplaces must be diverse.</div>
<a name="09060975000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">On your question about indirect
discrimination, I think that it is important that companies continually
look at their pay systems. There are a lot of ways of doing that. We
talk to members every day about the different ways in which they look
at their pay systems and make sure that there is not bias within them.
It is not just to do with different jobs and whether people are paid
the same. It is to do with things such as starting salaries, women
taking time out of the labour market, and, if you have an incremental
pay scale, making sure that women do not fall behind because of that.
Of course companies need to assess their pay systems and make sure that
they are fair. On your question about disclosure and transparency, the
CBI would definitely be keen to be involved in an exercise that shows
the different ways in which meaningful progress can be made to tackle
the pay gap.</div>
<a name="09060975000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
175</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000461"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I just wondered about the answer to the
third question. Will the CBI take responsibility once the metrics are
worked out with the rest of it for driving the requirement through its
membership to comply with disclosing those metrics?</div>
<a name="09060975000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We would absolutely encourage our employers to
use it if we come up with a system that works, but I have to be equally
clear that we do not support a legislative solution in this
area.</div>
<a name="09060975000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000462"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have had expressions of interest from
colleagues in asking questions about contract workers, agency workers,
disability and positive action. I do not know what John Howell wants to
raise, but he has been waiting patiently.</div>
<a name="09060975000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
176</b><a name="09060975000463"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I would like to move on to a couple
of questions relating to age discrimination. The first one relates to
issues around the mandatory retirement age. My first question is about
attitudes towards that and whether you think that will help. The second
is to try to get a sense of where you see the balance in terms of
helping to end age discrimination. Is abolishing or decreasing the
mandatory retirement age going to achieve more compared with a lot of
other measures that can be introduced to encourage employment for
people in the 50 to 69-year-old bracket?</div>
<a name="09060975000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> The FSB is of the firm view that there is
no justification for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age.
Employers look to the Government to set an age for retirement that
would focus everyone&#146;s minds. Small employers, in particular, do
not have the resources to try to decide a way through what should be
the retirement age of their staff, so a retirement age decided by the
Government is a focal point for small employers in particular. If one
of our members has a member of staff who is valuable, loyal and
productive, and there is a strong relationship with the business, they
would strive to do all that they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>could to keep that member of staff on. We do not see any element of age
discrimination as a huge problem within the small business
sector.</div>
<a name="09060975000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
177</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000464"></a>John
Howell:</b> What about the CBI?</div>
<a name="09060975000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We supported the age discrimination legislation
when it was introduced. We believe that it is right to have a default
retirement age. We supported the right to request postponement of
retirement. That system is working well. It is encouraging employers
and employees to have a discussion about retirement. Based on survey
evidence that we have conducted, the vast majority of the requests are
accepted. As far as we  are concerned, the current system is
working well at  the moment. We have accepted, though, that the
Government are committed to reviewing it in 2011 and we will respond to
that review, but we do not think that it would be right to get rid of
the default retirement age altogether.</div>
<a name="09060975000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
178</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000465"></a>John
Howell:</b> I think I saw the TUC representative shaking her
head.</div><a name="09060975000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> We have been around this course a few times
with the CBI. We find it very strange that you have a piece of
anti-discrimination legislation that has sitting within it almost a
green light to discriminate. The good employers will know how to manage
retirement properly. If you retain a mandatory retirement age, it
allows sloppy practices and it does not make employers think carefully
about whether the individuals are actually fit and capable and want to
carry on. The CBI has its evidence. We have evidence that suggests that
the meeting that you can have with the employer to discuss these things
is very weak. The employer is not obliged to give any response
whatever. The absence of complaints simply means that there is not a
process for putting those complaints through. We at the TUC would
encourage genuine flexibility of retirement, bearing in mind
people&#146;s access to their pension schemes. That is another
issue&#151;some people cannot afford to retire early while others
might want to do so for all sorts of different reasons. It is a complex
issue, and we welcome the review that will take place and will submit
our views. We feel that this provision must be taken out of the system,
as it is inherently wrong to allow for discrimination within
anti-discrimination legislation on such weak grounds.</div>
<a name="09060975000246"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> We never really supported the default
retirement age, which we felt was a compromise when it was introduced.
There is no real reason to have an end point and a mandatory retirement
age. Many organisations have abandoned mandatory retirement, and there
are strong arguments at national, organisational and individual levels
for having a more open-ended situation. If people can and want to work
for longer, and are able deliver value to an employer, they should have
the opportunity to do that. If the employer wants to carry on working
with someone, why set up a system that stops them from doing that
without jumping through unnecessary hoops?</div>
<a name="09060975000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not only a UK issue.
Changing demographics are affecting countries around the world and we
must change our mindset about when retirement might be. Do we need to
revisit the concept of retirement? Many people are living longer,
healthier lives and are still fit. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>The concept of being 60 today is more like being 50 or 40&#151;people
feel a lot younger than they used to 10 or 20 years ago.</div>
<a name="09060975000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having an end point does not
make sense. The problem is that people do not like dealing with
difficult situations and managing people. That goes back to the crux of
the argument about good people management, which has been behind all
the conversation we have had today. If we were better at managing
people&#151;and we have lots of advice and guidance on how to do that
better&#151;we would not have the difficulty of needing to set up a
legal framework that makes it more difficult to retain the talent we
need. We must ensure that we can manage the talent pipeline better,
both at the younger and older ends, or businesses will miss out on the
skills that are needed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
179</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000466"></a>John
Mason:</b> I would like to press Dianah and Sarah on their
answers. My gut feeling is that I like what you are saying, and I do
not like people having to retire at a specific age. However, I wondered
about the practical issues for an employer, especially a small
employer, where there is no retirement age at all, be that 70, 80 or
whatever. Suppose that somebody who has been a very good employee
starts deteriorating a bit. Does that not put the employer in an
impossible position?</div>
<a name="09060975000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> There are measures you can take about that. If
someone is genuinely not capable of doing a job any more, a good
manager will know how to deal with that and, sadly, that person will
have to go. That is not beyond any good manager&#146;s capability. If
there is a compulsory age, however, they do not have to think about it
and can say, &#147;Right, you have got to 65, off you go.&#148; In
fact, they should be having a conversation with that person, and if it
turns out they are no longer capable, for all the acceptable, fair in
law reasons, an employer can take the appropriate legal measures to
deal with that. Employers should not be allowed to skip all those
considerations, arbitrarily take a decision that someone has reached a
magic age&#151;as Dianah said, that does not really indicate
anyone&#146;s fitness or otherwise these days&#151;and get rid of
them
willy-nilly.</div><a name="09060975000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
180</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000467"></a>John
Mason:</b> Would 70 or 75 be a
compromise?</div>
<a name="09060975000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I do not think that there should be a
mandatory age. Some 70-year-olds are perfectly able to carry on working
for another five years and some 50-year-olds are not. It is not that
easy. Humans are all different, and a good manager will get to know a
person and make a decision based on what they do, what they have done
and what they are likely to be able to do.</div>
<a name="09060975000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
181</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000468"></a>John
Howell:</b> I want to push the discussion on to a connected
aspect of age discrimination that relates to goods, facilities and
services. The insurance industry has made a big case for retaining age
discrimination or age categorisation, and although I can understand
some of the points that have been made, it does lead to pronounced
difficulties, particularly for older people. I am thinking of some
constituents of mine who are over 85. They have led a very active life
and although insurance for travel is available, after having shopped
around they find that having to pay &#163;3,500 for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>insurance to go to Australia is having a major effect on their lifestyle
and ability to conduct what one would consider a normal life.</div>
<a name="09060975000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Thank you for giving me the opportunity to
demonstrate that I can actually speak. Age is an extremely important
risk factor in insurance. It is vital that insurers can carry on
differentiating by age. I wish to give two examples: an 18-year-old
driver is 10 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured than
most of the people in this room. Similarly, an average claim of a
traveller aged more than 65 is about three and a half times the cost of
that of people in this room. Age is an extremely important factor in
pricing insurance, and it is important that insurers can continue to do
that. You would think that there would only be a need for the Bill to
act on age if the market were not working, and we think that it
demonstrably is working. There is a wide availability of insurance for
people of all
ages.</div><a name="09060975000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern is
that, under the Bill, insurers would be required to &#147;write
across the range of ages, whatever their business model&#148;. For
example, they would have to offer a quote for an 18-year-old in a
sports car and a 108-year-old, whatever the circumstances. The industry
benefits from the fact that it is competitive. It has the ability to
concentrate on particular market segments. Some insurers concentrate on
older travellers, some insurers concentrate on backpackers and there
are insurers who offer lifestyle pension products and so forth. The
fundamental basis for insurance needs to continue.</div>
<a name="09060975000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise the difficulty of
access to insurance, particularly for older people, and that is one
thing  that we are keen to address. I cannot comment on
Mr. Howell&#146;s particular constituency problems. I
suspect that there are issues other than age involved in that sort of
premium. The issue is that of enabling people to access the insurance
that we know is out there, rather than forcing insurers to offer
particular products in particular
circumstances.</div><a name="09060975000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000469"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Whenever witnesses want to come in,
please indicate and, subject to the constraints of time, I will always
try to include people. We should now move on to the subject of contract
workers and agency workers. I call Jim
Sheridan.</div><a name="09060975000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
182</b><a name="09060975000470"></a><b class="B">Jim
Sheridan</b> (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North) (Lab):
Unfortunately, there has been a growth in the use and exploitation of
temporary agency workers across all disciplines, all workplaces and of
both genders. Those temporary agency workers are discriminated against
in the sense that they have lower terms and conditions, pensions,
holidays and everything else. Part 5 of the Bill seeks to deal with
part of the problem. I wonder whether it addresses the concerns from
the perspective of the TUC and employers. Does it comply with the EU
directives?</div><a name="09060975000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Can I make a general observation on the issue?
We dispute that temporary and agency workers are discriminated
against. We need to be clear about what we are
comparing. Agency workers are not employees of the user company in
which they may be placed. Their relationship is with the agency for
which they work. They are covered by the vast majority of employment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>legislation in the United Kingdom&#151;the minimum wage, working-time
regulations and health and safety regulations. We now have, of course,
consultation on the implementation of the agency workers directive,
which will introduce further protections in that area. We do not agree
that agency workers or temporary workers are being discriminated
against.</div><a name="09060975000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I think that we probably disagree.
Consultation is going on, and we are talking to the CBI and others. The
problem is for the agency workers themselves who are not as
protected&#151;I respectfully suggest&#151;as the CBI thinks. They
do not have contractual status, so a lot of employment law does not
apply to them, and they are discriminated against on that
basis.</div> <a name="09060975000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
impact is that employers often use agency workers to substitute for a
full-time person, who would get full protection. We shall have to wait
to see what happens with the agency work regulations, which the TUC
very much welcomes. The trouble is that, unless you get a very strong
comparator basis and you can do proper comparisons between the terms
and conditions on which you employ the permanent workers and those on
which the agency workers are contracted to supply their labour, you
have an inherent built-in inequality, so I can see exactly where you
are coming from on that. In a sense, it is another area of
discrimination that I know is being dealt with elsewhere, but it often
locks in and meshes with the elements of discrimination covered in the
Bill.</div> <a name="09060975000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope, as the
CBI no doubt does, that we can do something together constructively to
make the position of agency workers much better in the UK. That remains
to be seen. I do not doubt the will of the Government to do something,
but it is a tricky area, because we have a two-tier employment market
in the UK, which employers choose to stick with because they benefit
from it. The TUC has spent a lot of time disputing whether it is fair
and equitable to have some people working as workers and not employees,
with no protection, while others are in a completely different
position. The position is rather arbitrary and random, but that is
probably a bigger question than the context of the Bill. I hope that
that
helps.</div><a name="09060975000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
183</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000471"></a>Jim
Sheridan:</b> I am absolutely amazed that the CBI is saying
that temporary agency workers are not discriminated against, because I
see it every day of my life. Some 700 agency workers at Hewlett-Packard
have just been made redundant simply because it is easier to make them
redundant, so I would like to see the evidence that suggests that
agency workers are not discriminated
against.</div><a name="09060975000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
184</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000472"></a>Jim

agency
workers?</div><a name="09060975000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Because of the greater flexibility that those
workers offer. May I check whether those workers were made redundant
because the assignment with the user company ended, or because they
were no longer contracted through the employment agency? There is
misunderstanding, but they are not the employees of the user
company.</div>
<a name="09060975000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
185</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000473"></a>Jim

Hall:</b></i> We know from other cases that if the assignment
ends, they can go and work elsewhere&#151;they will be placed
elsewhere. If they are employees of the agency and they have been with
that agency for two years or more and they no longer work and are made
redundant, they will, of course, be entitled to a redundancy payment,
but they are not the employees of the user
company.</div><a name="09060975000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> That is the point. If they are not the
employees of the user company and they are agency workers, they do not
get redundancy pay. They do not get anything&#151;they can just be
dismissed without any pay whatsoever.</div>
<a name="09060975000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
186</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000474"></a>Jim

discriminated against is
incredible.</div><a name="09060975000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Could I also make a more fundamental point? The
reason why the UK has a lower unemployment rate than most of the rest
of Europe is because of our flexible labour market. We consider agency
workers to be a key part of that. The truth is that we still, even now,
have a lower unemployment rate than a lot of our European competitors.
So, the question is not whether those agency workers in other countries
would have had a permanent job or an agency contract, but whether they
would have had a job at
all.</div><a name="09060975000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000475"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Does any other Member want to come in
on this subject? No, in that case, we will move on to
disability.</div><a name="09060975000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
187</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000476"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I have a brief question for everyone. When making
recruitment decisions, employers are allowed to use pre-employment
questionnaires to ask a range of health and disability-related
questions of people whom they plan to hire. We have been urged to
include within the Bill amendments to prohibit the use of such
pre-employment questionnaires, although employers would still retain,
as they do in the United States, the ability to withdraw a job offer,
if the potential employee disclosed information that made them unable
to perform the role, but that withdrawal would have to be on good
grounds. Would any of you, particularly the business organisations,
have any problems if such an amendment were tabled and accepted? Katja,
will you answer
first?</div><a name="09060975000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Most of our members would be relaxed about such
an amendment. Increasingly, companies do not rely on pre-employment
questionnaires and, in fact, when they ask about the health of the
individual, it is at the point when they are offering a job. We need to
make sure that there are not particular jobs where health and safety
issues are of particular concern, where there may be a case for using
pre-employment questionnaires, but, subject to that, I do not think
that it is something our members would have a big problem
with.</div><a name="09060975000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> There is no evidence of the wide-scale
use of pre-employment questionnaires within the small firm sector. As a
former disability rights commissioner, I have taken soundings with
members, who want to employ the best person for the job. We would have
no qualms about an amendment along those
lines.</div><a name="09060975000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> We certainly think that screening should be
post-offer to check that everything is okay for the reasons that
Stephen has mentioned.</div>
<a name="09060975000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I agree with that, you will be delighted to
know. There is consensus on that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="09060975000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> It is not a direct answer to that point,
but insurers discriminate on the basis of disability. It is essentially
just a matter of whether any particular issues arise from, for example,
adapted vehicles and so forth. That could arise in an employment
context as
well.</div><a name="09060975000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
188</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000477"></a>Jim
Sheridan:</b> Before asking this question, I want to make sure
that I have the right person. Are you the Mr. Starling who
received a prestigious award for the work that you did in denying
compensation to people with pleural
plaques?</div><a name="09060975000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Am I obliged to answer that question? The
Association of British Insurers has a very strong position on pleural
plaques, which is that they are not an illness and therefore do not
merit compensation. But I am Mr. Starling of the Association
of British Insurers,
yes.</div><a name="09060975000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
189</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000478"></a>Jim
Sheridan:</b> I would like to establish whether you are the
Mr. Starling who got an award for the work that you did in
denying people
compensation.</div><a name="09060975000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> I have not received any award, other than
my salary from the Association of British
Insurers.</div><a name="09060975000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
190</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000479"></a>Jim
Sheridan:</b> The question that I want to ask is, given the
work that the insurance industry has done in denying people
compensation for pleural plaques, there is a significant school of
thought that suggests when you are diagnosed with that illness, you are
disabled. Certainly, if it develops into full blown mesothelioma, you
are disabled&#151;if not dead. Given that, I want the insurance
industry to clarify whether the measures in the Bill will assist it in
denying people who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma or pleural
plaques proper
compensation.</div><a name="09060975000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> I do not think that the Bill has any
relevance at all to paying compensation for illness or injury derived
from the workplace. I do not believe that there is any link here at all
with that sort of issue and I do not fully understand the reason behind
the
question.</div><a name="09060975000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000480"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I allowed the question, Mr. Starling,
because the issue that we are covering is that of disability. It seems
to me that the question is clearly within that category, and for that
reason I allowed it. However, you are, of course, at liberty to answer
as fully, as comprehensively or, indeed, as briefly as you think
appropriate.</div><a name="09060975000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> If you wished to buy health-related
insurance and had mesothelioma, clearly that would be an issue. You
would not be able to obtain cover for that for understandable reasons.
If you have pleural plaques, that is an indication of exposure to
asbestos and would be part of any risk assessment, but it is not
directly related to the provisions in the Bill, as I understand
them.</div><a name="09060975000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
191</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000481"></a>Jim
Sheridan:</b> You said that you do not discriminate against
people with disabilities. Do you recognise that mesothelioma is a
disability?</div><a name="09060975000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> No. My understanding is that having a
disability relates to people who have a long-term disability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>that they might be born with or develop. Mesothelioma is an illness.
Unfortunately it is a fatal illness, and it is dealt with by insurers
in that
context.</div><a name="09060975000289"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
192</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000482"></a>Jim
Sheridan:</b> So you discriminate against people with
mesothelioma.</div><a name="09060975000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> If you have mesothelioma, clearly it is a
very serious cancer and there would be circumstances in which it would
be difficult to get particular sorts of insurance, because they are
health related and you would not be able to get
them.</div><a name="09060975000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
193</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000483"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> May I come in briefly on this, because it
illustrates whether we are correct in using the word
&#147;discrimination&#148;? On Mr. Sheridan&#146;s
point, if you have a terminal illness and you know that you have it,
clearly you are not going to be able to take out a life insurance
policy. That is straightforward and, particularly in relation to age
and other types of discrimination, it goes to the heart of what
discrimination means. Clearly, an insurer has to have a range of facts
at their disposal to price the risk appropriately, and the extent to
which you can price the risk appropriately is an issue raised by the
Bill. If you cannot price the risk appropriately, will that mean that
insurance is available to people? Will insurers then cease to write
that business at all? Will you expand on the ability to price risk and
particularly on the extension, which is around
age?</div><a name="09060975000292"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> In insurance, some risks are extremely
difficult to price. As you say, if you have a terminal illness that
might be one such risk in terms of life or health insurance when
travelling abroad. Having said that, there are specialist providers
that cover such risks or provide insurance that manages them. If you
did not have that ability to manage risks, in some circumstances
insurance would be almost impossible to buy across the
piece.</div><a name="09060975000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
effect, if you have a disability, such as being wheelchair-bound, the
risk is that the insurer&#146;s price will be associated only with
things such as special modifications to a vehicle and will not
otherwise affect the way in which insurance is
provided.</div><a name="09060975000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000484"></a>The

positive
action.</div><a name="09060975000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
194</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000485"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I just want to ask members of the panel who have a
view on the new provisions what their views are. If you have a strong
view, now is your chance. I am happy to start with Stephen if he has a
view on the provisions whereby positive action is allowed in making
employment decisions between &#147;equally qualified
candidates&#148;.</div><a name="09060975000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> We do not have a strong view. We are
relaxed and content with the intentions of the Bill on this. The
chances of a small employer having in front of them two equally
qualified candidates who are both suitably qualified are minuscule,
whereas the consultants or recruiters used by a large firm would
normally present it with two excellent candidates and leave it up to
the employer to make the final
decision.</div><a name="09060975000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> We welcome this new tool in the kitbag for
progressing diversity, but we do not see it being used very often. It
could be used successfully only  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>by sophisticated organisations that can evidence why they are using this
particular technique. It is more likely to be useful in situations in
which you are recruiting a number of people, such as fast-track
graduates, and you want people with certain kinds of talents and to
develop certain opportunities. You might want to show that you need to
choose more women than men or a greater proportion of people from
minority ethnic groups to work towards a balanced work force. You would
have to ensure that you evidenced why you were doing that. For example,
you might have wanted to address an existing imbalance in your work
force.</div><a name="09060975000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
would have to be sophisticated to use this technique successfully so
that there is no backlash. There is a great deal of confusion about
what positive action is. People only want to be appointed because they
have merit in the first place. That has to stack up, but we need it in
the
kitbag.</div><a name="09060975000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> I agree with that. I do not think that
regulation is the right way to take positive action further. What the
Government have done is very welcome, but other organisations such as
the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the Equality
and Human Rights Commission have a big job to do in explaining what
positive action means so that what Dianah has described can be put in
place. It is much more complicated than looking simply at recruitment
decisions. It goes far further than that. Much more guidance and help
is
needed.</div><a name="09060975000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> I agree with you on this issue. We would like
to see many more employers use positive action to improve diversity in
their work forces. We have some concern about how the clause is
drafted. It could lead to legal uncertainty, which would make employers
reluctant to use it. We would like to see tighter drafting of the
clause.</div><a name="09060975000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
195</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000486"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I want to pick up on one point that Dianah made.
Dr. Harris&#146;s question was specifically about clause 153, which
is about recruitment and promotion decisions. My reading is that the
explanatory note applies only to people who are equally qualified,
whereas the language in the Bill&#151;which we will probe in
Committee&#151;talks about people who are &#147;as
qualified&#148;. That does not seem to be the same thing. The measure
does not allow you to have a policy of discriminating in favour of
particular people. It must be done on a case-by-case basis. I agree
with the broad consensus that it will not be possible to use it very
often. The chances of there being two equally qualified candidates are
pretty slim. There must also be evidence that they are equally
qualified. Given that&#151;one or two of you have already picked this
up&#151;is this really the right way? If you look at clause 152, you
will see that it focuses much more on the positive steps that employers
can take to reach out into different groups that they perhaps do not
recruit from. Is that a more productive way of approaching this matter
than clause 153?</div>
<a name="09060975000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dianah
Worman:</b></i> You need many different tools in the kitbag
to make progress; you cannot depend on one. The discussion has gone
back to good people-management practices. If you get your act together
on that, you are less likely to have to introduce these techniques, but
we need them all to make progress.</div>
<a name="09060975000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> A lot of the focus should be on the
pre-recruitment stage in terms not only of encouraging people to apply
to work in a particular company, but of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>tailoring training to ensure that particular groups progress within the
workplace. That is
correct.</div><a name="09060975000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the drafting of the clause itself, we need to be clear what it
refers to, but I am not sure that we are at the moment. We have some
concerns. The explanatory notes and the clause are different, but we
are also not entirely clear as to what &#147;as qualified as&#148;
means in this context. Some of our legal members have been saying that
it could be taken to mean just qualifications. We would like to see a
much broader definition including experience and a reference along the
lines of &#147;&#145;as qualified as&#146; in the reasonable
judgment of the employer&#148;. Only with those caveats will we give
employers the confidence to use the power. Otherwise, it will be a
missed
opportunity.</div><a name="09060975000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000487"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
196</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000488"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> On the same point about positive
action, my understanding from conversations with some business
organisations is that this kind of step is being taken now. For
instance, if somebody wants to market something to a black and minority
ethnic group, and if two sales people apply for the job, one of whom
comes from the group, they would want to favour the person who comes
from the group, given that they would be under-represented in the
community of employees and that it would be appropriate and helpful for
the marketing prospects of the business. If that happens now&#151;it
would be surprising if it did not and the evidence that we have
garnered is that it does&#151;the danger is that it would be
discriminatory at the moment. Protection will come from this clause in
this
Bill.</div><a name="09060975000307"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Basically, employers want certainty and clear
parameters. That requires some redrafting of the Bill. We have not had
a lot of feedback saying that employers are using it at the recruitment
stage at the moment&#151;obviously, there are different rules
relating to disability. Employers want clarity above all and good
practical guidance. We urge the EHRC to make that one of its top
priorities and to give employers the confidence to use
it.</div>
<a name="09060975000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
197</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000489"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Forgive me for pressing, but I do not
believe that you have answered my question. Leave disability out of it;
it is not what I meant. I referred to race. It would be discriminatory
to do what I have suggested happens at the moment in business, whether
you have any experience of it or not. Will this clause give some
protection to managers who wish to take steps of that kind?</div>
<a name="09060975000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> Yes. That is why we support the
clause.</div>
<a name="09060975000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> Yes, we agree as well. Employers have an
eye to marketing and sales, and to getting the best possible deal and
symmetry between their staff and customers, so actions would be taken,
as they are today, that are positive about whom to employ. The positive
action clause would help in that regard.</div>
<a name="09060975000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">When debating
amendments, we would put into the pot the use of the word
&#147;suitable&#148; as well as &#147;qualified&#148;. A small
firm would look at the suitability of the potential employee as well as
at the strap line of whether they are
&#147;qualified&#148;.</div><a name="09060975000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000490"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Thank you very much to both
witnesses.</div>

essential and positive action is a very good thing. We support the
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000491"></a>The

an

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
198</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000492"></a>Sandra
Osborne:</b> Can I ask you about the public procurement
provision in the Bill? Do you welcome it, and how do you think that it
will be implemented? What would be the best way of implementing and
monitoring
it?</div><a name="09060975000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We welcome the provision in the Bill. It is not
particularly detailed, so we look forward to seeing the consultation
document and the follow-up to that. We believe that procurement can be
an effective lever, and our members support the general principle
behind the clause. For the clause to be effective, we suggest that it
needs to be focused on outcomes and not on processes or ticking boxes.
It also needs to be relevant to the contract and to be sufficiently
flexible to enable you to focus on different issues in different areas.
So, for example, if you are delivering welfare-to-work services in
Bradford, race may be a relevant factor. However, if you are
contracting for stationery in Devon, race would probably not be a
relevant factor. So the clause needs to be sufficiently
flexible.</div>
<a name="09060975000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
other point that I would make about procurement is that our members get
quite frustrated about the inconsistency in approach. We would like to
see much better guidance given to local authorities and public service
organisations about what questions they should ask, what they should be
looking out for and about how the bids are assessed. Certainly, the
feedback that we have received is that there is a lot of inconsistency
at the moment and employers do not quite know where they
stand.</div><a name="09060975000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> The key point in ensuring that the
procurement process is good for everyone, including large and small
firms, is simplification of the process. What we would seek, as we talk
through the clause, is to use the principles of the Glover review,
which looked at public procurement and sales, to see whether or not the
clause can take advantage of that simplification of procurement
processes. So, in dealing with the procurement aspects of the Equality
Bill, we would be content if the Glover review recommendations were
thought of as the Bill is being considered.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
199</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000493"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> May I pick up on Katja&#146;s
example? I am sorry; I am not deliberately directing all my questions
at the CBI.</div>
<a name="09060975000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Katja, you
talked about the difference between delivering welfare-to-work in a
place where there is a large BME population, where you would have
thought that procurement to assist equality and diversity is
appropriate. By contrast, regarding the delivery of pencils in Devon,
the suggestion is that it would not be thought appropriate. However,
you would not want public authorities to procure stationery from a
stationery manufacturer in Devon that had repeatedly broken equality
law and that had been brought to the tribunal for being racist, sexist
or for discriminating against disability, would you? So, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>in that situation it would be relevant as to whether or not that company
was included in the pool, would it not?</div>
<a name="09060975000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000494"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before the answer is given, I just want to say
that I would like all four colleagues to get in and ask questions.
Therefore, really pithy answers would be
appreciated.</div><a name="09060975000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> If that company had been found repeatedly to
have been discriminating, I think that it would be relevant. However, I
think that we need to be careful not to penalise companies for a
one-off
mistake.</div><a name="09060975000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
200</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000495"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It would have to be proportionate,
would it not, to exclude them? However, that possibility of exclusion
ought to be
available.</div><a name="09060975000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Katja
Hall:</b></i> We would need to look at the detailed drafting.
If the company were a repeat offender, then it might be
relevant.</div>
<a name="09060975000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
201</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000496"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> &#147;Relevant&#148;? It would be a
good reason to exclude that company. As a public authority, with your
equality duty, you would not buy public services from somebody who paid
black people less than white people, would you?</div>
<a name="09060975000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> That is the key thing. The provision needs to
be linked to the public sector duty; it is not there on its own. What
the Government have done is extremely helpful in explaining how this
could
work.</div><a name="09060975000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
202</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000497"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I want to pick up that precise point, and I
particularly want to ask Stephen and Katja a question. If we are going
to talk about &#147;outcomes-focused duties&#148;, which I think
both of you have mentioned, the example that Vera just gave is quite
important, because you would be most interested in obtaining the best
value for money from your pencil supplier regardless of what that
supplier had done, providing that it was operating within the law. If
it had not operated within the law, it would have fallen foul of the
law in some way.</div>
<a name="09060975000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in whether, if you believe in outcomes-based procurement,
that alters the answer you gave the Minister just
now.</div><a name="09060975000329"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> I do not think that we should seek to
reward bad employers through the procurement process. The award of a
public sector contract is a huge plus and a huge bonus to firms, large
and small. We believe that the award of public procurement contracts
should be based on commercial grounds, but that the reputational aspect
of the business should be taken into account by buyers and purchasers.
We need to be mindful, as Katja has said, of the one-off offender, and
I agree with Vera with regard to proportion. If a firm is continually
known to be defying employment legislation, they are a bad employer and
should not be rewarded with a public procurement
contract.</div><a name="09060975000330"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
203</b><a name="09060975000498"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Sharon Hodgson</b> (Gateshead, East and Washington, West)
(Lab): There will still be a provision in the Bill for a
default retirement age or forced retirement at 65. You are probably
aware that this issue is currently being considered by the High Court.
Do you believe that this form of direct age discrimination is
justified?</div><a name="09060975000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000499"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have discussed this
issue.</div><a name="09060975000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000500"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> I am sorry.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="09060975000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000501"></a>The
Chairman:</b> So very brief
answers.</div><a name="09060975000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Stephen
Alambritis:</b></i> Small employers are helped where the
Government has an indicator of what the retirement age is. We would
leave the retirement age up to the Government. But a small employer
without a human resource or legal department is helped by an
indicator.</div><a name="09060975000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000502"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have given a business voice a sentence or two,
so I shall give the same to a trade union
voice.</div><a name="09060975000336"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sarah
Veale:</b></i> Just to repeat, we do not think that there is
a justification for having a mandatory retirement age. We think
employers should judge on the individual&#146;s ability. It is
contradictory to have within age discrimination laws a provision that
specifically allows employers to discriminate purely on the grounds of
age.</div><a name="09060975000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
204</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000503"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I want briefly to ask the gentleman from the
insurance industry a question. Do you recognise that there is concern
that there might be discrimination against people who have genetic
factors that put them at risk when it comes to getting fundamental
insurance, such as life insurance associated with a mortgage, if the
moratorium were to
go?</div><a name="09060975000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> At the moment, there is a moratorium on
genetic testing. It is an agreement between the Government and the
insurance industry. I believe that it will last until 2014, but I will
have to check
that.</div><a name="09060975000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
205</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000504"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> So if it
went&#151;</div><a name="09060975000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> There is no question of its going at the
moment. It is there, in
place.</div><a name="09060975000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
206</b><b class="B"><a name="09060975000505"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> After 2014, unless you can see the future, it
might well not be there and the insurance industry would presumably
want to stratify, because that is its job. Do you recognise that there
is a risk&#151;it may not be your problem, but it may be a public
concern&#151;that there would be an uninsurable group of people who
therefore, essentially, could not get insurance because of their
genetic
characteristics?</div><a name="09060975000342"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> One of the reasons why we extended the
moratorium to 2014 is because that is quite a long time away and we do
not quite know what the position of genetic knowledge will be or what
the situation would be if people could do their own genetic testing and
find out about themselves. So we have extended it precisely because it
is an uncertain future and an unknown situation. That is why we think
that a moratorium, which the Department of Health and Ministers have
agreed has worked well, is the best way forward. I do not want to
speculate on what might happen by then, except to say that we have
agreed that there has to be a lot of discussion leading up to 2014,
based on the current
science.</div><a name="09060975000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060975000506"></a>The
