                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
580 would require the levy to be reduced by 50% for premises
participating in well-established and recognised corporate
responsibility initiatives, specifically Best Bar None, business
improvement districts —we have heard a great deal about
them in relation to the Bill’s provisions on the late night
levy—the Purple Flag scheme, Pubwatch and similar watch
initiatives. If a reduction for those initiatives was left to the
discretion of the local authority, the general view is that it might
risk the reductions not being made and thus affect the credibility of
participating in such initiatives, for which there is widespread
support. It is also felt that those initiatives have achieved a great
deal during the past few years and we are worried that the Bill might
undermine the initiatives
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000036">&#160;</a>

order to acknowledge the important contribution and investment that the
industry has made to improve standards and address the challenges of
the late night economy, particularly in town and city centres, it is
appropriate that such high-profile initiatives are clearly identified
under the Bill as requiring a reduced levy. That would also safeguard
the initiatives themselves and encourage further take-up in areas where
such partnership approaches do not yet exist. I should be grateful if
the Minister would comment on the proposal because it would be positive
for the late night levy and several of the existing
initiatives.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000037">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Benton, and members of the
Committee. I thank the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North for the
way in which she introduced the proposals. Like her, I want to put on
record my welcome and support for the local initiatives that she
highlighted, such as business improvement districts, Best Bar None,
community alcohol partnerships, Purple Flag and various others. It is
important to recognise the contribution made by those local schemes to
managing the night-time
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
problem with the hon. Lady’s amendments is that we plan to
consult on the details of the various categories of organisation or
scheme that may be engaged with that sort of provision. The
consultation will include close working with, and input from, best
practice scheme representatives. That consultation would be pre-empted
if we were to set out in the Bill a number of different local schemes,
as amendment 580 would. Putting such a provision in the Bill would
unduly circumscribe the clause because we would require primary
legislation to change it. Indeed, the schemes themselves might alter,
and new schemes might come onboard, so we think that it is best to
conduct the consultation, although I certainly welcome what the various
existing schemes do and the contribution that they make.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The other
theme running throughout the licensing provisions is that they are an
attempt to promote local engagement and local decision making.
Licensing authorities, given their knowledge of local priorities, are
best placed to decide which schemes to exempt. We should not try to
limit that discretion by defining national 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 597<a class="bkMark" name="Column597">&#160;</a>
                           </div>exemptions in the Bill, which would set the situation in stone. I hear
the hon. Lady’s point about whether our approach might be seen
as a disincentive to the schemes, but I do not think that it will be.
This is about analysing and assessing what works best in local areas so
that local councils can determine how best to manage their night-time
economy. I hope that many of the schemes will continue
to be adopted and that they will grow. Therefore,
in some cases, there will be no necessity to go down a statutory route.
It will be at the discretion of local authorities and councils to
determine what they do to reflect local circumstances and, in so doing,
to recognise the contribution that the late night economy makes. I
therefore hope that the hon. Lady will be minded to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000040">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments.
It is absolutely right that there should be full consultation on the
issues and a debate on other initiatives that might be helpful to local
communities, and town and city centres, in dealing with the late night
economy. However, the excellent approaches throughout the country
through the schemes, and existing good partnership working, mean that
the Government ought to focus on the schemes. They should acknowledge
that as local businesses contribute voluntarily to those schemes as
part of that partnership working, they ought to receive some credit.
There is concern that local businesses will be asked to make a
contribution to the late night levy in addition to their work with some
of these initiatives. They should be given credit for the work that
they already undertake, and that work should be acknowledged through a
reduction in their funding of the late night
levy.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000041">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Good morning to you, Mr Benton,
and to all members of the Committee. We have now reached an extremely
important clause. The clause repeals provisions in the Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which will be replaced with
provisions in subsequent
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be remiss of me not to welcome the Under-Secretary to the
Committee. Before I had to leave on Thursday, he said some kind things
about me, and I appreciate and reciprocate his remarks. His right hon.
Friend the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice is in the room,
and I am glad that his iPad—or whatever is in front of
him—is
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
part of the Bill includes extremely important clauses, and clause 139
enables those clauses that follow it. There is no doubt that members of
the Committee understand that policing protests can generate
controversy, given the conflicts of interest that need to be balanced.
It is important that the interests and rights are protected of not only
the protestors, but those against whom the protestors are protesting.
Of course, we must also consider the interests of the general public.
Balancing all interests is difficult and sometimes controversial. The
balance is even more difficult to strike when protests relate to what
we think is appropriate around Parliament. Should the normal laws of
the land apply or should additional provision be made, as we have seen
over the past few
years?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is important because Parliament, for reasons that we do not need to go
into, is a symbolic place for protest. It is where laws are made, so
people rightly feel that they need to come here to protest if they feel
strongly about a policy that the Government are, or are

                           </div>not, pursuing, or about a decision that has been made. Alongside that,
Parliament has to function, so issues of security must be taken into
account. Although the European convention on human rights gives people
important rights under both article 10, on freedom of expression, and
article 11, on peaceful assembly, such rights are not
absolute.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It would be
helpful in this stand part debate on the Bill’s big set-piece
clause, if the Committee spent some time considering the background to
the existing position. It will be interesting to hear the
Minister’s justification for what the Government are doing and
it is important to discuss how they arrived at this position. Before
the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 was introduced, a
number of byelaws and the Public Order Act 1986 applied to Parliament.
In addition, there were Sessional Orders for the House of Commons and
Stoppages Orders for the House of Lords, which related to access and
gave the Metropolitan Police Commissioner the power to direct police
officers to keep Parliament free from obstruction. I had not realised
until a few years ago that those powers applied under an Act of 1839,
which is astonishing.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In 2003, the
Select Committee on Procedure carried out an inquiry into those powers
as a result of demonstrations that had taken place outside and near
Parliament. It was particularly concerned about the demonstration by Mr
Haw who, in 2002, the High Court found, despite people’s
irritation at his behaviour, was not obstructing the pavement.
<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> Well, that is the courts. As my
legal friend, the hon. Member for Northampton North would say, that was
the result of a legal process, which is how things operate properly in
a democracy—we have Parliament; then we have the legal process.
The Procedure Committee went on to say that because of the various
protests and demonstrations that had taken place, the law was
inadequate—indeed, the House authorities and the police said
that it should be adapted for modern circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not every
Committee member was in the House at the time, but many of us were. We
remember the Countryside Alliance demonstrations in May 2004, when
there were serious disturbances outside Parliament, and the five
protesters who got into the House of Commons Chamber. Whatever the
rights and wrongs of those protests and their causes, there were real
concerns and, consequently, the 2005 Act was passed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Almost as
soon as that Act came into force, however, more concerns were raised
about whether it struck the right balance. The SOCPA provisions cover a
wide area and various behaviours are prohibited. We all remember the
cases of Maya Evans and Milan Rai, who were arrested and prosecuted for
reading out the names of British soldiers and Iraqi citizens who had
been killed in Iraq. I do not think that any member of the Committee
would think that that situation was acceptable, and yet it was a
consequence of an Act passed in Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In a desire,
quite rightly, to protect Parliament and to strike a balance between
protests and the ability of Parliament to function, we
unintentionally—I do not think anyone deliberately set out to do
this—created a situation where someone could be prosecuted for
such an act. We then saw people trying to find loopholes in the law and
ways to get around it. On the one hand, the law has an unacceptable
impact on individual citizens who, I believe, were participating in a
simple and effective 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 600<a class="bkMark" name="Column600">&#160;</a>
                           </div>protest, but on the other hand, it cannot deal with the protesters we
saw outside. The law is unacceptable if it is used to deal with
individual protests, but at the same time it cannot deal with Mr Haw
and others who have taken up residence in Parliament square. In the
years after 2005, it became generally accepted that the provisions
should be repealed. Such a proposal was included in the Constitutional
Reform and Governance Bill that followed the Tamil protest, which was a
good way of handling of the protests, but, as the Minister will know,
that measure fell in the wash-up before the general election in May
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have introduced their own proposals to deal with the
problem, but I think that it is helpful to provide background. I have
said this in private to the Minister, and I will say it again in
public: everyone has been wrestling with the problem, and everyone has
said that it should be possible to deal with it more effectively.
Everyone says it and all of us think it, yet it seems  to
present an enormous problem for us when seeking to legislate in a fair
but effective way. The Minister needs to put on record the
Government’s thinking behind the proposals in the Bill about the
balance that they are seeking to strike in clause 139 and the following
clauses between the right to protest, which the Government want to
maintain—it would be idiotic to say that they are trying to stop
that—and the right for people to go about their everyday
business and to enjoy the square. We need to understand how the
Government have arrived at their proposal in the Bill and how they have
balanced those almost competing parts of the
equation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposals before us do not exactly mirror the SOCPA provisions, but
some of the powers that they will give to police and authorised
officers are significant. Clause 139 will repeal SOCPA, but the
Government have introduced proposals that are similar to SOCPA, albeit
that they will be applied to the much narrower and restricted
geographical area of Parliament square. The Minister needs to explain
how that decision—that that narrow bit of the square is the
obvious piece of land to legislate for—was arrived
at.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000082">&#160;</a>

its permanence. The trouble that arises as soon as one asks that, as
the hon. Gentleman did—I ask this without being sarcastic to
him—is that one must define what one means by
“permanent”? Is it one, two, four, three or six weeks?
That is part of the problem in trying to legislate for that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000084">&#160;</a>

am trying to keep my comments fairly broad, because we will come to the
detail in later clauses, and I do not want you to rule me out of order,
Mr Benton. There is a need for reform—I am not saying that there
is not—but there is a problem with the Government’s
proposal, because if the arrangement is reasonable and not permanent,
people should be able to protest overnight. I do not have a problem
with that. The Government cannot say whether a protest should stop at
11.30 pm or midnight. We have a problem with the permanence of it,
rather than the right to protest in itself. How have the Government
struck the balance in the Bill—dealing

my concern that, however well meaning the
Government may be on some of the same problems that we got into, there
is a danger that if the area is narrowly defined, the protesters could

the same problem returns? It is a difficult issue to

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The problem is
not the legislative desire or intent, because the Committee would agree
that the current situation is unacceptable. How do we move from where
we are to where we want to be, balancing the two sides of the coin? To
be fair, the Minister will have been struggling with that as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
some practical difficulties, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Kingston upon Hull North will deal when we debate subsequent clauses.
That is why I asked how the provisions, which now relate to a small
area outside of Parliament, have been arrived at. Westminster city
council said, “Let’s have a massive designated
area.” Without wanting to extend that area a great
deal—we do not want that, before the Minister for Policing and
Criminal Justice quotes me somewhere—there is a problem if that
is not done. Why should they not just cross the road? If they were on
Parliament square, they could just move to the other side of the road
and put their tent up. We will come to these practical things as we
debate later clauses, but my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and
Deeside is absolutely right to raise that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000088">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I think the hon.
Gentleman makes some excellent points. Does he agree that what the
public find so confusing is that if they went down a pavement in their
locality and pitched a tent, they would be moved on pretty quickly by
the police? They do not understand why this one bit of pavement, which
is similar to every other bit of pavement in this country, is allowed
to have a permanent encampment that cannot be moved by the police. We
all accept that people will camp overnight for Wimbledon tickets, and
the police will turn a blind eye on occasion, but it is the continued
permanence that people do not
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a reasonable point. My understanding of
the court judgment was that the obstruction being caused, because of
where the pavement was, was not sufficient to justify the tent being
removed. If it had been on the pavement nearest the Palace, where many
people go past, it would constitute an obstruction under the law, and
could be moved. The public and other Members of Parliament have to
understand that, while we all want to do something, it is difficult to
legislate for this. The hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth has
made a point about the visual impact, which we will come on to. The
more important point is that while there is an obstruction if someone
wanted to walk along that pavement, that is not the same thing as
having the burden of proof for the judge to agree that the law has been
broken. That was my understanding of what the law said in respect of
the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000090">&#160;</a>

nature of some of the protest as well. Some of it is not issue-based.
As an MP, I feel that some of it is just abuse—someone with a
megaphone abusing people day in, day out. That is not particularly nice
for those concerned, or for people walking past coming into

all the time and there is abuse. There are clauses in the Bill to say
that the use of a loudhailer is a prohibited activity. People cannot
use amplified noise equipment to generate noise outside Parliament
unless they get  21 days’ authorisation, so may I ask
the Minister, what if I get 15 drums? People can make a hell of a noise
with a load of drums and they are not amplified. The unintended
consequences of the measure are enormous. People stand outside with a
load of drums beating, or with cymbals—we can all make up other
examples of noise equipment that is not amplified, but which can be
used to make a significant noise—until it amounts to the abuse
that my hon. Friend has pointed

confusing for the public is that they all know pavements that are as
wide as that bit around Parliament square, where they could equally
pitch a tent, yet they are not allowed to do it there. What is so
unique about that bit of pavement? It is not particularly wide, nor
very different from other pavements. On the access point, is it not
ironic that there is concern about access to that bit of pavement and
yet, when Parliament square turned into a Glastonbury-style tented
village, one could not walk across it? There was no access whatsoever

I think that that is an important question, because what people say is
that they are irritated by the tents and by Mr Haw. Is that what the
Government are saying? We will come on to the clauses that focus on
sleeping bags and sleeping equipment. Are the Government really saying
that they do not want any overnight protest outside Parliament? Are
they saying that it is fine if people stand up and stay

permanence of the encampment on Parliament square and the frequent
noise that disturbs those who wish to work, live in and traverse the

example, to allow the quiet enjoyment of statues, many of which were
placed in Parliament square by public subscription. Do not people have
the right of quiet enjoyment of a public place as well as the right to
peaceful protest? This is not a protest; it is an encampment. Should

the Minister confirm whether that is the case, or did <em>The Sunday

BBC reported that Westminster city council had served letters on the
remaining protesters to vacate the pavement surrounding Parliament
square. It
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000108">&#160;</a>

difficulties that we have started to address are dealt with. As we go

are questions about and irritation with what is happening outside
Parliament. I reiterate to the Minister that although I understand
points about the permanence of the protest, the visual aspects of it,
access and other people’s human rights to enjoy the square, I am
particularly concerned that that does not translate into something that
would stop people turning up to protest there, even for a few days
because they stayed overnight. There is a real difficulty in striking
that balance. The Minister will have wrestled with it, and the
Committee will be interested in what he has to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000113">&#160;</a>

the harm that we are trying to deal with?” I hope the Minister
will answer that question. While it is possible that these protests
affect tourism, I would be interested to hear evidence of that. I have
heard comments that they are not very nice. There have certainly been
comments that they have prevented other people from being able to
protest, which is extremely serious, but while it is a fact that there
is quite a lot of noise, we should not ban something just because we do
not like it. I look forward to hearing the Minister explain how he has
achieved such a balance. The direction of travel is excellent, however,
and I am glad that it is sucking along members of the previous

protests outside, such as the Countryside Alliance protest and the
almost continuous anti-war protests. More recently, we have seen
student protests and the Tamil protests, and we will see more over the

key issues is the permanence of the protests and their impact on a
range of people, including tourists. The hon. Gentleman was a little
dismissive of people who work in the Palace of Westminster and the
surrounding streets, and of MPs and the rights of other people to
protest. Let us consider the impact of protests on tourists. London is
one of the most popular international tourist destinations in the
world. Millions of people visit London each year and the Houses of
Parliament must be one of the most visited destinations. As was said by
the hon. Member for Northampton North, the gardens in the square are
beautiful. There are important statues there of Nelson Mandela, Abraham

Gentleman’s question is yes. I have witnessed that with my own

                           </strong> If legal minds on the Committee want to support us,
I welcome their legal advice—I look to my friend, the Member for
Northampton North, to back us up. There are 17,000 pass-holders who
work in the Houses of Parliament, and the square is the nearest place
they can go to if they want a bit of time out. As we all know, those on
the Committee and those serving the Committee—and those watching
it—have a stressful job. This is a stressful time in the House
of Commons, and the square is the nearest place to go to sit down and
have some quiet reflection. The ability to do that is diminished by the
scale and longevity of the protest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
the right of MPs to gain access to the Houses of Parliament to do our
job and our duty. The Tamil protest was one of the best protests
outside Parliament. Those involved were protesting about really emotive
stuff, and the protest spilled out on to the road, so the police came.
I tried to get in to vote during the week of the Tamil protest. I was
in the right-hand lane to turn right into the House of Commons in my
car, and a police officer said, “No, you can’t do that.
You’ve got to go over Westminster bridge and round the
roundabout, and come back and take a left.” I complained to the
Sergeant at Arms about that. She investigated and ruled that the police
officer was incorrect in his observation of the rules and should have
let me pass. So the protests have an impact on MPs getting into the
House. We often have messages from our Whips—the
authorities—on our bleepers saying, “Make sure
you’re here early because there are huge protests
outside.” They recognise that MPs cannot gain ready access to
the House of Commons. We have eight minutes in which to vote, and
protests outside, especially large-scale protests, affect our ability
to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
also the rights of other protesters to protest. Has the area been
colonised by one group of protesters?

                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> Does the hon. Member for Cannock
Chase want to intervene? I am getting some sedentary support from the
Government, which is welcome. The permanence of the protest is damaging
the rights of tourists, people who work in the House of Commons and the
surrounding streets, other protestors and
MPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue is not only the permanence of the protest, but how that protest
is, on occasion, articulated—and I use the word
“articulated” carefully. My hon. Friend the Member for
Alyn and Deeside referred to the lady with the loudspeaker shrieking
for hours on end. I was taking visitors from my constituency, who had
come on a special day out, round the House of Commons. I took them on
to the roof of the House next to Big Ben; it was a special moment for
them. The lady was screaming and screeching for hours on end, but then
she stopped for one minute. After the stop, she came back and said, 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>“Now, where was I?” She herself did not know what point
she was on, and she was looking to the public to tell her what
important point she was making about whatever. Someone screeching and
screeching for weeks and days on end could be seen as a bit of an
abuse, and we have to look at
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Gedling referred to night-time protests,
which we need to be careful about. Some of the best protests that I
have been on were night-time protests. They are often organised by
Churches, and include overnight candlelit vigils. Those protests made
their points peacefully using candles, prayer and reflection, and posed
no threat to anyone. Candlelit vigils and overnight protests should be
respected.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000132">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a good point. I am sure that a number of
people have done something like that. For example, I am sure that quite
a lot of hon. Members from across the House have slept out overnight to
protest about homelessness. A practical consequence of the Bill could
be that a charity that wanted to organise a sleep-out in Parliament
square to raise awareness of homelessness would not be able to do so.
The clause is drawn so widely that it catches people whom I do not
think the Minister wants to
catch.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000133">&#160;</a>

we can already see the impact of the cuts on the homeless. The other
week, the <em>Evening Standard</em> had a report about people sleeping in
large bins—they go down a chute and sleep in the bins overnight.
One of the worst effects of Thatcherism in the 1980s was that in the
west end of London thousands of young men and women slept rough on the
streets and on seats. I think that we will see a return to that
situation, and the ability of people and charities to protest outside
the House of Commons as they see fit, and in a way that causes no
disruption, should be
respected.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000134">&#160;</a>

which the debate has been undertaken, and the genuine desire on both
sides of the Committee to address what has been an issue for some time?
The hon. Member for Gedling set out the history of the issue quite
well, referring to court cases, the distinctions between each different
part of the square—the front footway is owned and maintained by
Westminster city council, while the gardens are part of the Greater
London authority—and the distinctions and variations in the law.
His contribution setting out the context was useful. I also appreciate
the comments made by the hon. Member for Cambridge, and the
entertaining but well-made points raised by the hon. Member for Vale of
Clwyd, even though I was concerned that we might have to get some
oxygen for my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase part of the way
through his contribution.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000136">&#160;</a>

our commitment to restoring the right to non-violent protest, we seek
to repeal sections 132 to 138 of the Serious Organised Crime
and Police Act 2005. We considered that they imposed unnecessary

                           </div>restrictions on the right to peaceful protest around Parliament and have
had an almost chilling effect on that right, which has in some ways led
to a breakdown in trust between the Government, the police and those
who wish to protest. Those sections have criminalised non-disruptive
peaceful protest, but have done nothing to prevent the abuse of our
public spaces by a determined few, to the detriment of the enjoyment of
those spaces by the wider public. I think that that is at the core of
the issue, and I will seek to address a number of questions posed by
hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
law has not worked as some hoped it might, as we have heard this
morning, and as the Metropolitan police have acknowledged, and it has
created a bureaucratic burden into the bargain. We see no reason to
retain the provisions, and I note—I think that the hon. Member
for Gedling accepted this—that the previous Government had
almost come to that point. When the issue was looked at in the draft
Constitutional Renewal Bill in 2008, it was accepted that SOCPA was not
the right way forward and that repeal was necessary to ensure that
people’s right to protest was not subject to unnecessary
restrictions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
certainly welcome and recognise the consensus in Committee this morning
that the current law did not work as intended and is not fit for
purpose, and that we therefore need to move on from that situation.
However, repeal of the provisions does not mean that anything goes in
Parliament square. In relation to protest, the police will once again
have powers under section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 to impose
conditions on public assemblies of two or more persons to prevent,
where necessary, serious public disorder, serious disruption to the
life of the community, serious damage to property or intimidation of
others. The police will therefore have the same powers to deal with
demonstrations around Parliament that they have for the rest of the
country. Additionally, members of the public who wish to use the
Parliament square gardens for a protest or rally will still need to
seek the permission of the Mayor before they do so, in line with the
byelaws that apply to the grass
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000139">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will come on to single protesters, because
I accept that it is one of a number of points that are probably easier
to deal with in this stand part debate, together with the broad
headline points, rather than when we get into the detail of the
drafting. I accept the point that the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd
raised about dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s. We
have been looking very carefully, with our lawyers and our legal team,
at how the provisions are prepared, recognising that, as we have seen
from previous legislation, it will be subject to challenge, and that
there will be those who look for opportunities around that. I hope that
from my comments, both on this stand part debate and when we get into
the detail, hon. Members will see the consideration that we have given
to a number of those points in order to test and to make sure that the
provisions are a robust

                           </div>way forward. Obviously, we can test that in detail when we come to
subsequent clauses and some of the amendments that I know have, quite
fairly, been
tabled.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are clear that everyone must have the right to protest peacefully in
the area around Parliament, and we believe that the police should have
the same powers to police protests in that area as they do in the rest
of the country. Understandably and rightly, Parliament square is a
focus for protesters, but it is a limited space, and that is why we are
bringing forward the provisions—so that everyone can access the
square equally and enjoy its amenities. I know that that is the
strongly-held view of members of the Committee and—as I know
from conversations I have had outside the Committee with MPs—of
Members across the House.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The approach
that we are taking is to apply the law to everyone, not just
protesters, in order to clarify that the issue being addressed is the
taking over of public space. Our provisions are not about dictating who
can and cannot be in Parliament square, or how long they can be there;
they are about ensuring that the minority does not usurp the rights of
the majority. As long as individuals are abiding by the byelaws that
protect the Parliament square gardens and are not committing any other
offences, we are not concerned if individuals choose to remain on the
square.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">By
limiting the area to which the provisions apply and the type of
activity that is prohibited, we intend to take a proportionate and
targeted response to a documented problem of encampments in a specific
location. In doing so, we are focused on addressing an evidenced harm.
The area around Parliament is, understandably, one of the most
protested-in areas in the country, and the measures are about ensuring
that the right to protest is respected, in a proportionate way, while
addressing the issue of encampments and fair access to the space. I
stress the interrelationship between the provisions in the Bill and the
byelaws that operate in the square and the surrounding areas. When we
come to later provisions in this part of the Bill, the importance that
we place on clause 148, which is on the enforcement of byelaws and the
power of seizure, will speak to some of the displacement issues raised
by Westminster city council. We believe that there is a mechanism in
place to deal with its concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000144">&#160;</a>

in the High Court. Westminster city council has served notices of its
intention to issue proceedings regarding the current encampment on the
pavement directly in front of the House of Commons. Some individuals
left following those notices, and Westminster city council has
indicated that it intends to issue proceedings in respect of the
notices that have been served. That is the latest information that I
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000145">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Certain stop-gap measures may be applied, but that may be based on
specific individual circumstances. The clear indication that we have
received from all those agencies and partners, and the view from the
House—I have had a number of discussions with the House
authorities about Parliament square and setting out this long-term
position—is that we need to create a sustainable, long-term
position, which is what the provisions, as they relate to the byelaws
and the strengthened byelaws that may follow thereon, are intended to
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000147">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Gedling also highlighted the 1839 Act and how some of
these provisions relate to old law. The Sessional Orders are viewed by
the Lords authorities as providing a good indication as to expectations
on access and certain other issues, which highlights the fact that, in
many ways, there are practical issues that need to be considered.
Sometimes, setting things out in statute does not necessarily deal with
some of those practical issues. We are in discussions with the
Metropolitan police and the House authorities on those specific
provisions on
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue of security has been raised. We have to be careful about blurring
the line between security and protest. Separate provisions in the
Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 relate to security as
distinct from protest. Blurring the two is not the right way to proceed
on the matter, because, in essence, security issues arise from large
gatherings, whether they be protests or otherwise. I will talk more
about some of the issues that the Metropolitan police highlighted, but
it is important to make that broader, high-level,
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Gedling highlighted the specific matter of noise
amplification versus drums, and so on. Parts 3 and 4 will prohibit
activities that Parliament and the public find offensive and
disruptive. I accept the hon. Gentleman’s point about the noise
and disruption caused by drums. It is worth mentioning, however, that a
Greater London authority byelaw requires people to have the
Mayor’s permission to use any musical instrument in Parliament
Square gardens. There is, therefore, an interrelationship between
existing byelaws and the specific issues with which we seek to deal.
Noise amplification is the concern that hon. Members have highlighted
the most in recent years, which is why we address it in the Bill. We
recognise, however, the ancillary powers under byelaws, which cover
other issues that the hon. Gentleman has
highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000150">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge expressed concern about
retrospection in relation to section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986,
which applies to public assemblies. The measure is not retrospective at
all, but deals with a transition point from SOCPA to section 14 of the
1986 Act. It is about setting out that transition clearly and is not
about
retrospection.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000151">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Gedling mentioned some of the points that the
Metropolitan police service raised on the provisions, which I shall
address specifically. I do not underestimate the enforcement challenges
that are involved in securing the enjoyment of Parliament square for
all. Determined individuals will try to circumvent the measures and
there are genuine challenges in balancing different rights. The
Metropolitan police service, the

us, however, and their input has helped to frame our current
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
people have said, “Maybe you should have taken more robust
measures— maybe you should have extended them further.”
This, however, is a question of proportionality and balance. We think
that the provisions strike that appropriate balance in how they are
framed and how they are intended to operate. One of the key drivers for
repealing SOCPA is that the position on protests should apply to the
area around Parliament in the same way that it does to any other area
in the country. I hope that such a position will help operationally by
applying the same law across the Metropolitan police districts instead
of applying one law on one side of the line, and another on the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
someone wants to protest overnight, they may do so. The Government do
not accept, however, that they should be entitled to erect temporary
structures and take over public space to do so. Discretion and balance
must be applied, and we will continue to discuss that with the
Metropolitan police service. We recognise that any new law will be
robustly tested by determined individuals, so we have tried to capture
the attempts to circumvent the legislation that were raised by the
police. I am sure that we will look at those in detail as we debate the
Bill’s substantive
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000154">&#160;</a>

absolute clarity, is he saying that overnight protest in Parliament
square will still be allowed under the provisions? Is he also
saying—this is where there will be some difficulty—that
protesters will not be allowed to erect any sort of structure? I
appreciate the point about “overnight” and we will come
to what is meant by “permanent”, but it is important that
people understand that overnight protest will be allowed. There is a
problem about what is meant by
“structure”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000155">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but
tents and overnight structures are the issues that have been
highlighted. We can look at the relevant clauses in relation to the
directions power that exists for the police. The Government are clear
that it is important that there should be a discretionary element to
the provisions. That is consistent with the police service’s
wider call to return discretion to the police and to trust the
professional judgment of officers in that regard. It is important to
make that point in this
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have considered lone individuals—I said I would come back to
this point—and have decided that the power to deal with lone
individuals is not deemed necessary in the rest of the country.
Following the principles of providing clarity for the police, the
Government see no compelling reason for the police to have specific
powers to control an individual who is protesting around Parliament.
That does not mean that they are immune from the wider criminal
law—for example, obstructing the highway, committing public
order offences, breaching byelaws or failing to comply with the
proposed new directions in the Bill. It is appropriate to have the same
operation of law outside Parliament, in the same way that it applies in
the rest of the country. I have not been persuaded of the need to make
separate provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will return
to the issue of preventing security. We need to be careful about
conflating protest with terrorism, when there is no evidence that the
protest, more than any other large gathering, poses a distinct security
risk. To do so would be at odds with Her Majesty’s inspectorate
of constabulary report “Adapting to Protest”, which was
clear that the police had sufficient powers to manage public order and
that changes to the law were unhelpful. As far as I understand it, the
security issues around SOCPA have been used to limit the size of Brian
Haw’s encampment, out of concern that devices could be hidden in
tents. That is why tents are prohibited under the Bill. This measure is
about dealing with any of those security
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Since
sections 132 to 138 of SOCPA came into force, physical security
measures around Parliament have been increased. There are operational
measures in place for the protection of certain areas and it is fair to
say that Whitehall is probably one of the safest of places. That is why
Lord Carlile said that he was not convinced of the need to have special
powers to operate around Parliament. We need to be careful about
conflating the two issues, and ensure that we are focused on the
problems that we have heard about this morning, as well as being quite
distinct when looking at
protest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of issues will need to be carefully considered as we examine the
specific provisions of this part of the Bill. The proposals that we
have set forth are proportionate and address the concerns expressed by
hon. Members and by others outside the House. I recognise the points
that have been made, and it is important that Parliament has its role
in the consideration of these matters, given that the provisions affect
Parliament so

welcome our debate in the broad sense. It is important that we as a
Committee, and Parliament in general, examine the provisions properly
and consider them carefully. I hope that, on that examination, the
Committee and the House will recognise that the provisions strike the
right balance, will be effective and address the concerns that have
been highlighted for some
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000161">&#160;</a>

points arise from it. I love the explanation of these measures being
not retrospective, but transitional. I would love to delve deeper into
that, but there we are—I shall have to leave it at
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister said that the Government do not want the provisions to apply
to individuals, despite what  the police have said. One problem
is that there could be 15 individuals outside Parliament. Also, he did
not deal with what is meant by “permanent”, so we will
have to come back to that. All members of the Committee agree that a
permanent protest that becomes an encampment is a cause for concern. We
have already established that it is possible for people to stay
overnight in Parliament square, provided that they do not use a
structure. That is a step forward, and that is clear from what the
Minister
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Without
being silly about it—I would be interested in what other members
of the Committee think—I do not think it unacceptable for people
to stay for two, three or four nights. I appreciate that, at some
point, a protest turns into a permanent encampment, but as we go
through the legislation, we need to explore what that means. The right
of people to protest for a period is a

			Column number: 614<a class="bkMark" name="Column614">&#160;</a>
                           </div>difficult matter, although the Minister might say it is a discretionary
matter for the police. Notwithstanding the discretion that he wants,
Lynne Owens was clear that the police want clarity about what
Parliament expects of them in enforcing the
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
legislation is still not clear, however. How long is it acceptable for
someone to stay in Parliament square and protest in a democratic,
non-violent way? That will become an issue somewhere along the

problem. We have established, and the Minister has agreed, that an
overnight protest in Parliament square is appropriate and allowable,
provided no structure is used. The key question is exactly as my hon.
Friend says: we could have a rolling programme of different people
coming for 58 nights, 365 nights or whatever. Although there may be all
sorts of possibilities and maybes, we face real difficulties when we

permanent, and of course I do not want somebody trying to use loopholes
to overcome the intention of the legislation, but we are scrutinising
the Bill, and highlighting loopholes and potential problems is part of

no definition of “permanent” to starting to address what
it might mean. The Minister says that someone can stay outside for a
long time, provided that they do not breach the law. That is a
statement of the obvious, but it is helpful to have it on the record,
because I am sure that when people read the report of our proceedings,
they will see what he has just said—a

			Column number: 615<a class="bkMark" name="Column615">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I agree with
the Minister that this has been a worthwhile and interesting debate.
The Committee is united in saying that the SOCPA provisions should go
and that we need to put in place a workable solution. He is absolutely
right to say that, as far as possible, what we have outside Parliament
should replicate the law in the rest of the country and that we do not
make special provision unless it is necessary. I am sure that when we
discuss the later clauses in Committee, and when the Bill is considered
further on Report and in the other place, there will be significant
debate on the issues, but our debate on individual protests and whether

amendment follows on from the discussions that we have just been
having. Given that we had such difficulty defining the area that we are
trying to protect and preventing the types of protest that we find
unacceptable, I am trying to understand, through the device of the
amendment, how the Government came to define the prohibited area under
the clause. I am also trying to understand whether we can be confident
that that will be sufficient to meet the Government’s intentions
and not simply move the protest to some other part of the area or an
adjacent street. Rather than deal once and for all with the problem
that has bedevilled us for several years, will it be shifted to another
location, where the whole routine may start
again?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000177">&#160;</a>

is a basic and simple probing amendment. I am trying to understand how
the Minister arrived at the definition of the prohibited area under the

do the job this time and whether he recognises the anxiety that the
problem could simply be transferred
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000178">&#160;</a>

                           </div>difficulties, which we will come to later, is that the pavement is
controlled by Westminster city council but the grassed area by the GLA.
I want to reiterate this point because my hon. Friend’s
amendment is important: the Minister needs to explain why someone will
not simply cross the road to avoid the provision. If I have my tent and
other structures—my umbrella on a post, which will presumably be
a structure under the legislation—and go to the other side of
the road, is the Minister confident that the powers that the hon.
Member for Northampton North mentioned can deal with
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will say that Westminster city council’s existing
byelaws can deal with the issue. The problem for the Minister is that
the people responsible for the byelaws do not agree with him;
Westminster city council says that there is a problem. The argument is,
“The hon. Member for Gedling doesn’t have to worry,
because the byelaws are sufficient to deal with it”, but that is
not what the council responsible for the byelaws says. The Minister can
turn round and say that there is no problem, but I am simply telling
him what Westminster city council says. I do not propose that we should
accept this, but the council map covers a fairly wide area. The
Minister will be able to tell me whether it is bigger than the existing
area. It points not only to the pavements across the road but to the
gardens down the road; supposing the protestors all pitch up there? I
do not know if that is Westminster city council’s
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000180">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Who
owns College green? The media put up their tents there, so are they
affected by the measures? I bet the Minister does not get the media to
take their tents down. The serious point is that Westminster city
council raised the issue of College green, the gardens next to
Parliament and the pavements. It is a serious problem. We are not
trying to destroy the Bill; we are saying that the unintended
consequences will be exploited. We have seen that the protestors
outside Parliament are extremely adept at using the law and loopholes
in the law to avoid being moved on and, in many ways, to thwart the
will of Parliament and MPs to deal with the issues sensibly and
proportionately.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000181">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why does
Westminster city council say that there is a problem, if the Minister
says there is not? Does the council have it wrong? Does it not
understand its own byelaws? Is it because the GLA owns or controls that
area? I may have missed them, but I have not seen any representations
from the GLA with respect to the grassed area. If I have missed
something from the GLA, will the Minister correct me? What is the
GLA’s view about the grassed area?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000182">&#160;</a>

point I am making to the hon. Member for Cambridge is that the
amendment was tabled to see what the Government’s thinking is on
the problems that Westminster city council raised. The alternative is
for us all just to sit here and wave the Bill
through, but scrutiny is not about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Westminster
city council has clearly and properly raised a problem with the Bill,
because, in line with the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, all that will happen is that people
will cross the road. The Minister and the hon. Member for Northampton
North say that will not happen because there are byelaws to deal with
it. That is a reasonable point and it holds water except for the fact
that the council that enforces the byelaws says they do not work. It
will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say, and no doubt
we will respond
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000188">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I note the way the amendment was moved. One
of the reasons why we sought to define the area was to deal with
“highway” in that context. The controlled area under the
clause is deliberately small. Members of the Committee will be aware of
the map at the back of the explanatory notes, to which the hon. Member
for Gedling rightly drew attention. We could have left things open for
the sake of drafting, but we considered it important to provide further
clarity on what the controlled area encompassed. Clarity is vital, and
the area covered by the amendment would not provide the public with a
level of general clarity. The amendment aims to broaden the controlled
area to the roads and pavements around the island, but our approach is
premised on a proportionate, targeted response; it is the minimum
necessary to deal with a particular misuse of tents and structures on
Parliament square gardens and the footways, which have been well
documented.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
want to ensure that the area where the new regime applies is as small
as possible so that it targets the problem of the unique situation of
Parliament square, without extending matters further than necessary to
strike a focused and proportional balance. However, we recognise
worries that the controlled area is small by its nature and that the
effect of such measures could displace disruptive activities to
footways beyond the controlled area. Displacement is a risk, and I do
not underestimate the determined individuals who will be looking at
different ways to challenge new measures that we seek to bring into
force. I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman’s point, but we
have been working with Westminster city council and the GLA to ensure
that relevant byelaws are strengthened to deal with disruptive activity
in the wider
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obstruction
of the highway will more clearly apply to the roads and pavements
around Parliament square, given their far greater vehicular and
pedestrian usage, and footfall. Our approach is aimed at targeting
specific problems in the Parliament square area, empowering local
authorities to take action by giving them the ability to enforce
relevant byelaws more effectively. In the context of what the hon.
Member for Gedling said about Westminster city council, I have met the
council on several occasions and am well aware of its
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I say to the hon. Gentleman that at my recent meeting with the council,
after the note that it circulated to the Committee, it supported
strengthening 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 618<a class="bkMark" name="Column618">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and amending the byelaws to deal with the displacement issue. It
recognised that that was an important way in which it could address the
issue. From subsequent discussions with the council, I think the
position has moved since the note was prepared. I am not seeking to
push the hon. Gentleman, but there have been ongoing discussions on the
issue and the clarity that we have given Westminster city council may
have dealt with its
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman inquired about the GLA. I draw his attention to
paragraph 5 of Committee document PR58, the memorandum from the Greater
London authority, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000193">&#160;</a>

powers—indeed, I think that came up in the evidence—but
we are not talking about dog fouling or littering; we are talking about
the policing of protest, so there is a significant difference in
context if we are giving people who are not warranted officers the
power to do certain things in those circumstances. When we read all the
clauses, as members of the Committee will have done, we see that an
authorised officer has quite significant

understand that the power that an authorised officer has, in Parliament
square in particular, is limited; he cannot do many of the things that
a warranted officer does outside Parliament square, and the Bill
effectively excludes and leaves out the authorised officer.
Notwithstanding that, there are significant powers that an authorised
officer can use, including, in Parliament square, the use of reasonable
force. Given the agendas of the hon. Members for Edinburgh West and for
Cambridge in particular, I find it difficult to understand that they
can actually support authorised personnel, who are not warranted police
officers, being able to use reasonable force to police protest. It is
an incredible increase in the powers we are willing to give people who
are not warranted

legislative framework, and with a significantly negotiated police
regulatory structure and a misconduct procedure. The provision on the
use of force would make us nervous. At the moment, when people are

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the point raised by the hon. Member for Northampton North, I said at
the beginning that this context is different. It is the policing of
protest in some of the most controversial and difficult circumstances,
which is a completely different ball game from dog fouling and, with
respect, from the valuable work that security people in supermarkets
do. It would be perfectly fair if he disagreed with that because that
would be his point of view, but this is different.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
potential for real problems of a democratic clash between people of
different opinions. Look at the difficulty that warranted police
officers—some of the most experienced police
officers—sometimes have outside Parliament. Yet we are saying
that in Parliament square, one of the most symbolic areas of our
country for obvious reasons, authorised police officers will have the
power of seizure and forfeiture, and will be able to use reasonable
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000238">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In her
submission to the Committee, Lynne Owens made a particular point that
is relevant to the comments made by the hon. Member for Northampton
North:<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000239">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        <p>She
wrote that about police officers, but I think it can be applied to
authorised officers. If the measure is a concern with warranted police
officers, with all their training, it is a huge concern with authorised
personnel.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000241">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Further to the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Vale of Clwyd, is it not the case that people such as
bailiffs or doormen are regularly involved in physical confrontations
with the public? Was that not one of the arguments for introducing the
Security Industry Authority, which I am sad to see is to be abolished?
Surely the one thing that we do not want to happen in Parliament square
is a series of physical confrontations; the whole object of the
legislation is to try to clear away the current problem and reduce the
potential for future ones.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000242">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is absolutely right. Obviously, a police
officer can use reasonable force in any legal, proportionate and
appropriate circumstances, but we are giving authorised
officers—council officials and employees, or others—and
warranted police officers the right to do so in Parliament square. The
measure is a big extension of power.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I return to
the point that was reasonably made by the hon. Member for Northampton
North. I cannot for the life of me see how the present
situation—with all the various ways in which people can use
powers relating to bailiffs, dog fouling, littering, security personnel
and so on—translates into meaning that it is okay for people to
be involved in the policing of protests outside Parliament. That is a
completely different ball game. I can only begin to imagine some of the
consequences of council employees going out with their badges and
trying to clear tents or structures. That is a real
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000244">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend refers to highly trained and
experienced police officers sometimes getting into tight situations.
There was a death last year of someone who was not even a
protestor—he was a newspaper man—and there was Blair
Peach in the 1980s. If such police officers can sometimes get it wrong,
what chance do those authorised people have of getting it right? They
will be in stressful situations—there is a mob mentality out
there. If authorised people are not highly trained and experienced, it
is a recipe for disaster.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does the
Minister agree that the measure might be regarded as a back-door way to
fill police and police community support officer numbers? If we are
cutting back on such trained personnel, perhaps this is a way to get
hundreds of authorised people in through the back door nice and
cheaply.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000246">&#160;</a>

have had a number of discussions with the Minister about the issue,
trying to understand how he understands the role of such alternative
officers. We give police officers certain responsibilities and allow
them to use force and violence under controlled circumstances. That is
a hard thing to manage, and it is tough for the police to work out.
They do not always get it right. I am sure that all hon. Members would
agree that it is a tough balance for the police. They struggle to get
it right in all cases, so there are
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000260">&#160;</a>

would have the skills, and I, too, think there are questions about
that. I have spoken

                           </div>to the Minister previously about training, which I am sure he will
comment on later. There is also the question of what a reasonable
member of the public would expect. Nothing in the Bill states that such
authorised officers should be uniformed, be trained, have particular
identity cards or have evidence of what they can
do. In addition, there are a number of questions regarding which powers
officers will be expected to
use.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000261">&#160;</a>

understand the hon. Gentleman’s comments about the amendment and
his concerns, but there are a number of ways in which the Government
may address them other than through the amendment. I would rather hear
from the Minister a range of different solutions to the problem. If one
took in all the possibilities, I would have real concerns. If they are
constrained—whether by changes in the legislation, which the
Minister might wish to continue with, or by clear guidance and controls
on such people as a secondary option—then the concern rightly
raised by the hon. Member for Gedling could be dealt with in another
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000262">&#160;</a>

an authorised person? It is clear when one is being approached by a
police officer. They are either in uniform or carrying a warrant card.
Most members of the public are clear about how to complain if they are
unhappy about the treatment that they have received at the hands of a
police officer. I am not sure that that will necessarily be the case if
they are approached by a non-uniformed, non-ID-carrying member of

particularly in difficult and pressurised situations. Police officers
are trained to a high standard and receive training that allows them to
deal with such situations, but the highly pressurised environment of a
protest can prove difficult even for uniformed police officers. I
expect that it might prove even more difficult for a less well trained,
less suitably qualified authorised person and might actually inflame
situations further when that need not necessarily be the
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000269">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We heard the
comments made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West during the evidence
session. He made the good point that certain situations can be
difficult even for police officers, and that we must be careful when
people are protesting not to inflame the situation further by handling
it inappropriately. There is a far greater risk of that happening with
an authorised officer acting on behalf of a local authority than with a
police
officer.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not quite sure how all the provisions make for a consistent picture
of Government thinking. As I said earlier in an intervention, the
Government tell us that they want to roll back powers where they feel
that local authorities have overstepped the mark, such as in the use of
the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. However, in this
instance, they are seeking to expand the powers of particular local
authorities or local authority staff. I do not understand how those two
things fit together. Will the Minister clarify
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000271">&#160;</a>

to take on those onerous positions, does my hon. Friend think that that
could lead to undue pressure on council staff? They may be forced into
situations that result in conflict and violence. Such undue pressure is
unnecessary, if those are truly the functions of police
officers.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000272">&#160;</a>

the Minister tell the Committee which local authority officers he
intends should carry out such functions? Which people is he talking
about? Is it civil enforcement officers such as traffic wardens, or the
people who issue tickets for dog fouling or littering? It is a big leap
from that to policing protests in Parliament square. Will the Minister
explain who will carry out those
functions?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not understand the consistency. It is important to have adequate
safeguards in place so that when the public are approached by someone
claiming to be operating on behalf of a public body—for example,
a council—they are confident of the identity of that person and
can ask for identification if required. It is important to have
suitable safeguards in place should they wish to complain about the
conduct of that person, if such an occasion were to arise. There are
several serious issues at the

                           </strong> At the outset, I should say that it is
interesting how the measure has been characterised in terms of
authorised officers policing protests. We need to be very clear about
the provisions in the Bill and the power to seize property in clause
143. We have not got on to that clause yet, but it is important to
stress the context of how such power will be vested. Suggesting that
there will be an overarching power of delegation to local authorities
to manage widespread protest is wide of the mark. It is important for
me to explain the basis upon which we have sought to provide that power
in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000276">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Benton. As I was saying, as the
Committee is aware, the GLA manages the central garden, including the
two footways, and Westminster city council controls the other two
footways, opposite Westminster abbey and the Palace of Westminster. The
GLA and Westminster city council are effectively responsible for what
goes on in their areas, including ensuring that byelaws protecting
those areas are complied with and that highways are not obstructed. The
police’s role is to maintain the peace and prevent crime. We
have always said that the provisions in part 3 need to work in tandem
with strengthened local authority byelaws, which will need to be
amended to bring them into line with the provisions of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By removing
the ability of the GLA and Westminster to enforce the new provisions on
prohibited activity on their land, it would leave enforcement entirely
as the police’s responsibility. In practice, that would mean
that where, for example, a GLA heritage warden sees a person erecting a
tent on the garden, he or she would be unable to direct that person to
stop what they are doing, and would have to ask a police officer to
issue the direction instead. That seems bureaucratic, time consuming
and puts the onus entirely on the police. By way of another example, a
person operating a loud speaker, in breach of any conditions imposed by
either the GLA or Westminster, under the authorisation scheme provided
for in clause 145, could not be directed by either the GLA or
Westminster to cease operating the loud speaker. Enforcement would be
left to a police officer.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
provisions require a collaborative approach to enforcement by the
Metropolitan police, the GLA and Westminster city council. That is a
key to making our provisions work. By removing the ability of the GLA
and Westminster to enforce the provisions, they are unlikely to work

Committee that authorised officers, employed by the GLA, such as the
heritage wardens, who are authorised to enforce the Parliament square
byelaws, are readily identifiable to the public. Heritage wardens carry
identification and wear a uniform. From the GLA, I understand that, to
date, there have been no issues with their identification for the
purposes of implementing the byelaws. From Westminster city council, I
understand that its enforcement officers carry, as a matter of course,
photo identification which they produce on demand and often routinely.
They also carry documentation setting out their powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000286">&#160;</a>

officers, who exercise the powers in part 3, are clearly identifiable
to members of the public, and that the public understand what those
officers are empowered to do and on whose authority. In that context,
we are also considering the issue of complaints and clarity on how
complaints may be made on authorised officers, if there is any question

also point out to the Committee that the enforcement of rights of
seizure is not new. Officers authorised by Westminster city council
already have many seizure powers, including in relation to unlicensed
street trading and selling counterfeit goods, and so does the GLA,
under its existing trading byelaws. Both the GLA and Westminster city
council already deal with issues of identification, visibility and
complaints in that context. I have been provided with a long list of
various statutes under which rights of seizure already
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000288">&#160;</a>

is itself a new power of seizure—an accurate
one?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000291">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was seeking to draw a parallel and to make
it clear that a local authority’s right of seizure is not new.
Therefore, some of the points that have been highlighted in this debate
are equally applicable to those rights of seizure in connection with
other existing powers under byelaws and certain other statutory
provisions that local authorities currently exercise. It is important
to note that the proposed provision needs to work in the context of
existing byelaws and other statutory provisions and that such a
collaborative approach is required.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I again draw
the attention of hon. Members to the comments of the Mayor of London,
who particularly supported the vesting of officers with powers of
seizure in respect of these provisions. Both Westminster city council
and the GLA recognise that such powers of seizure are important in
terms of ensuring that the provisions are enforced
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000293">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, I
agree about the need for a collaborative approach and attendant
training. Having a memorandum of understanding between the police,
Westminster city council and the GLA is key to how that approach is
intended to work and it will be developed further as part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000294">&#160;</a>

seizure.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000298">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 625, in clause 141,
page 96, line 1, leave out
‘mattress’ and insert<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000324">&#160;</a>

I should start by saying to the Minister that, like my previous
amendment, the proposal under discussion is a probing amendment and I
am not planning to press it to a Division. I want to be clear whether
the definition under the Bill will have the effect that the hon.
Gentleman intends. Dos we define “sleeping equipment” as
narrowly as a sleeping bag, a mattress or something similar? Would that
enable ingenious people desperate to get round the Minister’s
aim to thwart his intentions by producing other material and equipment
that might strictly fall outside the definition that could be used for
the same purpose?<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000325">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I ask that
question because I would not like a series of silly and pointless
disputes to take place when people argued that the equipment they were
carrying were intended to be used for a solely different purpose. I
have not had quite as much experience as the hon. Member for
Northampton North, but I have spent enough hours in juvenile courts in
the past to hear some ingenious excuses for pieces of equipment that
individuals happen to have on their person at particular
times.<a class="bkMark" name="11021547000326">&#160;</a>
