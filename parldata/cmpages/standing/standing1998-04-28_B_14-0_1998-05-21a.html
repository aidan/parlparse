<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 321, in page 101, line 44, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A)In sub-paragraph (2)(a) of that paragraph after the words `convicted by the court of the offence' there shall be inserted the words `but a drug treatment and testing order may not be revoked within the treatment and testing period of such an order unless under (ii) above the court proposes to deal with the offender by way of a custodial sentence which prevents the offender from continuing with treatment and testing under the order.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 322, in page 102, line 11, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A)In sub-paragraph (2) of that paragraph after the words `convicted by the court of the offence' there shall be inserted the words `but a drug treatment and testing order may not be revoked within the treatment and testing period of such an order unless under (6) above the court proposes to deal with the offender by way of a custodial sentence which prevents the offender from continuing with treatment and testing under the order.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments relate to the revocation of drug treatment and testing orders, which is part of the subject matter of schedule 4.
<P>
The schedule amends the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Without going into too much technical detail, it would appear that when a magistrates court or a Crown court revokes a drug treatment and testing order, the person to whom the order applied could be dealt with in any of the ways that were originally available to the court. He could be given a custodial sentence or sentenced to any of the non-custodial alternatives.
<P>
It is likely that revocation would be sought when a defendant was being sentenced for other matters. The amendments accept that a drug treatment and testing order may be revoked within the treatment and testing period if the defendant is taken into custody, which would prevent him from complying with the order. Obviously, we would hope that he would continue to receive treatment while he was in custody. However, Opposition Members can see little merit in a drug treatment and testing order being revoked within the treatment and testing period only to be replaced by another non-custodial sentence, such as community service or some form of supervision or probation. It does not make sense. In such cases, priority should be given to the continuation of treatment and testing.
<P>
That is our understanding of the matter, but we look to the Minister for guidance.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> The hon. Gentleman has tabled a reasonable, probing amendment. I think I can respond to it fairly simply.
<P>
People who breach a drug treatment and testing order are dealt with under other provisions. The paragraph applies to those who remain within the terms of the orders, not to those who breach them. We want to ensure that there is the maximum flexibility to deal with the offender in the most appropriate way.
<P>
The order can be revoked and replaced by another form of sentence only with the agreement of everyone involved. That would include the service providers, the probation officer and the judge. It could not be done casually.
<P>
In most cases, we would share the view of the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison): a period of treatment should continue, to ensure that the individual had not come off drugs only for a short time, but that his or her pattern of behaviour had genuinely changed. However, there might be circumstances in which the individual had fully complied with the order and had made progress. It would, therefore, be sensible to substitute something different to confirm that changed pattern of behaviour. For example, community service, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, can help to change people's behaviour for life.
<P>
The provisions for the revocation of orders are not intended to be used casually, and that is emphasised by the fact that agreement has to be given by the judge and others involved in the case. The provisions are not intended to be used when an order has been breached. If someone has committed another offence the court can make a judgment. Criminogenic matters might well be better addressed under a probation order, the drug problem being less than originally thought. The point would not be to lessen the emphasis on preventing continued drug use, but to increase the impact of a sentence on other elements of the person's needs or behaviour that presented more urgent problems.
<P>
The court would not be required to revoke a drug treatment and testing order after a further offence if a non-custodial sentence was imposed. The hon. Member for Hertsmere rightly said that where a custodial sentence was imposed revocation would be necessary, but one would hope and expect that the prison regime would include appropriate continuing treatment. My colleagues with direct responsibility for the Prison Service and prison regimes are keen to pursue that approach.
<P>
I hope that what I have said will reassure the hon. Gentleman. To some extent the matters are technical. I confess that I had to spend some time in discussion to be sure; however, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the provision is intended simply to allow the courts flexibility. There is to be no lessening of impact or stringency in applying drug treatment and testing orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's courteous and considered response. It was our understanding also that we needed to discuss what would happen not in the case of breach when the offender had failed to comply with the order but when for other reasons the court wanted to revoke the order. We thought that that would commonly be because the[Mr. Clappison]
defendant had committed other offences and had to be sentenced for them.
<P>
I take the Minister's point about flexibility and agree with it as a general proposition. I shall take the liberty of putting that in the bank for later on; the question of flexibility will be relevant later in the Bill. We want courts to be free to pass the sentences that they think fit according to the circumstances of the case.
<P>
I am grateful that the Minister recognised the reasonableness of our proposition that in the relevant cases it is important to continue treatment if possible. Often the drug habit is at the root of offending and needs to be tackled, along with any other problems the offender has. In view of the Minister's observation that he saw sense in our argument, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 4 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reprimands and warnings</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 256, in page 47, line 43, leave out "and".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 257, in page 48, line 2, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and
(f) the constable considers it inappropriate to deal with the offender by way of informal caution.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendments Nos. 256 and 257 explore the position of informal cautions within the new system of reprimands and final warnings with which the Government plan to replace cautioning. We understand that past practice has been for informal cautions to be administered by police officers in certain circumstances and not to be recorded. Clause 61 sets out the conditions that have to be fulfilled before a reprimand or a final warning may be administered. The conditions are cumulative and amendment No. 257 would add the condition that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the constable considers it inappropriate to deal with the offender by way of informal caution."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to add that condition in order to explore the position or informal cautions in the system.
<P>
We shall come to the substance of the new system later, and we will have some comments to make about it. At present, we want to know where informal cautions stand in the new scheme of things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying the amendments. He made a perfectly reasonable point.
<P>
In recent years, the former system of cautioning has fallen into disrepute with the police and with the public. It was felt that the pattern of repeat cautions gave the message that nothing would happen as the result of a caution. That view has been expressed to me by many police officers. Some cases in which a caution would have been appropriate were dealt with informally in order to avoid what was seen as a waste of time.
<P>
In recent times, the Home Office has given guidance to tighten the use of repeat cautioning, but that has not rescued the system. Uncertainty exists at the lower end of the scale. We want to avoid that because we want the system to operate consistently in local areas and across the country. The new system will make it clear where cautions and reprimands stand in the hierarchy.
<P>
An informal caution does not really exist as an arrangement. However, one needs to apply common sense. If a group of youngsters is causing a nuisance on the streets at night, police forces in some areas send a note to the parents. For example, they might tell the parents that their youngster is one of a group causing a nuisance on the green and they will ask the parents to take responsibility for their children's behaviour and where they are at night. Such advice does not need to become part of the formal system. I hope that it will provide the correction that will prevent youngsters from reaching the stage of receiving a reprimand or final warning.
<P>
I do not want to be so prescriptive as to say that there should never be any informal advice given to parents about their youngsters' behaviour. That would be so prescriptive as to be unworkable. We want to ensure that there is not a half-understood system of informal cautions, which are not really cautions. No account is taken of them.
<P>
If a youngster receives a reprimand, it should be known that that is the first step and that appropriate steps will follow. When a youngster commits one, two or three minor offences, that may provide an opportunity to bring him up short and avoid the development of further patterns of misbehaviour. The clause is designed to ensure that the system is clear, crisp and well understood by offenders and their parents as well as by parliamentarians and the courts.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand that it is the Government's intention to replace formal cautioning with a new system of reprimands and warnings. We will come to that shortly, but will the Minister now tell me whether the Government intend the system of informal cautioning to continue under the new system? Will there still be informal cautions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The difficulty is that informal cautions do not exist within the system. I tried to make that clear. In some places, there is a feeling that the system of cautioning does not mean very much and that cautions or words of advice have been given to cut down on administration.
<P>
I do not want to be so prescriptive that words of advice cannot be given in the sort of cases that I mentioned, but equally I want to make it clear that reprimands and final warnings should be part of a formal system. It would be unfair for a youngster committing some minor offences to be merely ticked off by the police without anything being recorded. Over a period of time, he could become part of the drift that was the mischief that undermined the previous cautioning system.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Let me just respond to the hon. Member for Hertsmere's points. I am trying to paint the background against which we are seeking to introduce these measures.
<P>
The amendments would introduce an additional hurdle to nipping matters in the bud for young offenders. They would formally introduce a system of informal cautions, which is a recipe for delay. In addition to the current criteria, an officer would have to establish whether it was appropriate to deal with an offender by means of an informal caution before he could give a reprimand or a warning. We are trying to tighten control of young offenders but the amendments would be a recipe for reintroducing drift and neglect.
<P>
I do not recognise the concept of an informal caution. I do recognise that in certain circumstances where an offence has not been committed but there is a pattern of activity in a particular area which gives rise to concern, reminding parents of their responsibilities makes sense and might prevent the need to move on to a reprimand or the warning system.
<P>
We initially considered the possibility of moving on to the final warning system to make it clear to youngsters that once they were given the final warning, that was it the next time it would be straight to the courts. At the point of the final warning we wanted intervention to work out what was going wrong in the youngster's life in order to deal with any problems. However, we subsequently saw the need to differentiate between really trivial offences and those in which it was clear that a word with the youngster's parents would be beneficial for future behaviour. That is where the reprimand comes in. It fills the gap that would be left if we completely discouraged and sort of informal cautioning while dealing with the problem within a properly thought out system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I recognise in particular the importance of dispensing with the bad practice of repeat cautioning and of the need not to become too prescriptive. However, I ask the Minister to reconsider the issues before Report. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is right about the danger of introducing an extra element of formality and especially extra paperwork. I was worried when I heard the Minister's concern about matters not being recorded. Surely the advantage of the old informal cautioning system, when used sensibly, was that it did not involve paperwork. Police officers appreciated the ability to issue informal cautions, which were not prescriptive and did not involve paperwork and bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I regret that the hon. Gentleman has got it wrong. There was no system of informal cautioning. The attrition or drift that undermined the old system was caused by repeat formal cautions coupled with the introduction of informal cautions. Over several years there was a move towards regarding some offences as so trivial that there was no need to do anything about them, yet those offences could be the precursors of more serious offending.
<P>
There is a big difference between that which I have described and youngsters being rowdy near pensioners' cottages with police officers pointing out that they are causing a disturbance. Those police officers are not giving an informal caution, but a word of advice. Informal cautions are inappropriate for offences such as minor incidents of shoplifting. They must be given within the system.
<P>
Inevitably, there is a grey area. We have catered for that by making provisions for youngsters who do not commit an offence, but who demonstrate disturbing behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman wait a minute, please? As I was saying, in such instances police officers can exercise common sense to head off that behaviour.
<P>
When an offence is committed, it must come within the formal system. In many cases, the final warning will be the youngster's first experience of the system. That will depend on the seriousness of the offence. However, a reprimand may be made in the form of a ticking off from a police officer and the family. I think that is what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) means by an informal caution.
<P>
We must ensure that we do not sow the seeds of future difficulties. We do not want to undermine the system of making the reprimand a low-level way of giving guidance on the youngster's future. We want to avoid vague and floppy provisions that are not even part of the system or anything formal. There must be a clear line indicating that actions start when an offence is committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand the intention behind what the Minister seeks to do. However, the phrase "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" may be pertinent. There is a great danger that the Minister's proposals, however well intentioned, may remove discretion from policemen on the beat and the officers to whom they report.
<P>
The Minister is introducing an unhelpful element of bureaucracy. The police are already worried about the amount of paperwork that they may have to do. The Minister speaks of the need to bring cautions within the system, but he misses the point. Police officers must have some discretion. The Minister may be right to say that a system of informal cautions never existed. However, officers should have the discretion to act sensibly, telling youngsters off and dealing with them informally when appropriate. Actions should not always have to be brought within a system that is a fundamental difference between the Minister and me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I agree that it is a fundamental difference. I reject the hon. Gentleman's approach. In youth justice, we have gone down the road to hell, and it was paved with informal and repeat cautions. That is what has allowed the drift. There was a pernicious belief that preventing youngsters coming within the criminal justice system was meritorious. However, a good achievement is keeping youngsters out of the further reaches of the criminal justice system by[Mr. Michael]
stopping them offending. That is why the Bill is clear about the purpose of the youth justice system.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman does not understand the changes to the system that will be brought about by the introduction of the final warning scheme. The administration of the final warning will be crisp and precise, cutting out the paperwork and delays inherent in having to go to an advisory panel. The final warning, or, in appropriate circumstances, the reprimand, should follow speedily on the commission of an offence.
<P>
In debating such matters up and down the country, I have repeatedly made the point that one deals with the wrongdoing of one's own children immediately. One does not wait until the next day, and one certainly does not wait four and a half months, which is the average time it takes to bring offending youngsters to court.
<P>
A crisp, clear approach will allow the final warning to be administered quickly. Work may then begin to find out why the youngster has offended. Is a pattern of offending behaviour beginning? Does the youngster have problems which can be dealt with, thus preventing him from being drawn into further offending? We want to turn off the tap supplying young offenders, which, in the longer term, is the source of serious adult offenders.
<P>
I accept that there is a difference of opinion between us, but I invite the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to consider the whole picture. The police and those who work with young offenders increasingly accept that a signal at an early stage is helpful to a young offender. It prevents him from falling into the pattern of offending and convictions that has such an impact on his life. It is crucial that the system is correct, speedy and crisp at that early stage.
<P>
The Opposition's amendments would restore the concept of repeat cautioning that we wish to end. We want to provide a more progressive response to offending behaviour, in which defendants know with certainty that each subsequent offence will result in a more substantial response. When I was sentencing, I had the experience of telling youngsters that if they offended again, they would be in real trouble. Such warnings do not mean anything. Youngsters in communities where there is much delinquecy know what they can get away with. Unfortunately, the system has almost acted as an encouragement and an accelerator to offending. It should be preventing offending, and that is the backgroung to the clause.
<P>
The clause is necessary if we are to prevent repeat and inconsistent cautioning. The hon. Member for Hertsmere will accept that inconsistency undermines public confidence in the youth justice system. People want to know what happens to offenders, and the system has to be clear. Cautions need to be carefully targeted to ensure that they are effective in preventing further offending.
<P>
By putting the option of informal cautions into the Bill, the amendment would be likely to give the impression that the decision to take informal action should be a standard response to offences. We do not believe that it should. That impression would in turn give impetus to the use of informal cautions in cases that would previously have been dealt with by cautions. That would mean a continuation of the practice of inconsistent, repeat caution, albeit informally. We would have no record of what had gone on. That would be a recipe for reproducing the disaster of rising youth crime that we have experienced in recent years. We have no intention of repeating the previous Government's mistake.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the amendments were designed to probe our intentions and he asked whether the clause will take discretion away from the police. In fact it will remove a mess and provide police officers with a crisp set of options that will deter repeat offending. That will take a different pressure off the police and it will do so quite quickly.
<P>
The decision to take informal action of any sort should be taken very sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances. Such action could be taken if an offence has not been committed but when advice is offered to prevent problems on an estate or in a street escalating to the point where offences have to be dealt with.
<P>
I suspect and hope that the hon. Gentleman does not want to press the amendment. If he did, I would argue in stronger terms. I have assumed that it is a probing amendment by which he wants to tease out the Government's precise intentions. I hope that I have provided him with the information that he seeks.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is correct to assume that I will not press the amendment particularly hard. My opening remarks made clear what I wanted to do. I will discuss the formal system when we debate later amendments.
<P>
The amendments are designed to find out whether it is the Government's intention that informal cautioning should continue. I take it from the Minister's remarks that it will. I appreciate that it is difficult to discuss informal cautioning, because, by its nature, formality is not attached to it. However, those who have considered the matter, including the Select Committee on Home Affairs, have been able to identify the existence of informal cautioning. Although the Committee made certain recommendations, it certainly did not advocate the end of informal cautioning and a number of bodies, including the Law Society, described its benefits. The Law Society told the Committee that the informal caution
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"has the advantage of being a more immediate means of showing society's disapproval of the juvenile's actions without creating a record which may be cited in subsequent court proceedings."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important consideration.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister has distinguished between informal and formal cautioning. He referred to the use of formal cautioning in cases in which there was evidence of wrong-doing, and he described other cases in which informal cautioning could be used.
<P>
The amendments are not intended to extend the use of informal cautions. The Opposition want to ascertain whether informal cautioning will continue on the same basis under the new system. We want a direct answer from the Minister. We understand from his remarks that cautioning will be replaced with what he described as repeat cautioning I shall discuss that in a moment. The new system of reprimands and final warnings will replace the formal cautioning side of the cautioning system, but informal cautions will continue on the existing basis.
<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee if the Government propose to change the practice on informal cautioning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to clarify the situation, but I think that he is confused.
<P>
There is no system of informal cautioning. Police officers exercise their discretion to use the powers available to them under the existing system. In general, we do not think that there should be systems for informal cautioning. On some occasions, common sense leads a police officer to offer advice. I have already spoken about that. If we were to go further than that, we should need to set up an informal structure of informal cautioning. That would not be wise and we do not want to do it. We would be led into the very fudge and muddle that we are trying to get away from.
<P>
It would be barmy to introduce provisions for a system of informal cautioning. I realise that the hon. Member for Hertsmere has said that he does not intend to press the matter, but it would be unwise for the Committee to encourage the idea that police forces should establish such systems.
<P>
The Law Society may believe that, by not dealing with the situation in ways that are recognised by the law, we are putting off what it regards as an evil day. However, it is a virtuous day, if it leads to the positive intervention that the final warning is intended to produce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Whether or not we describe informal cautioning as a system and let us say, for the sake of argument, that there is no system will the Minister tell the Committee whether informal cautioning will continue on the same basis as it did before the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think not, because there have been circumstances in which informal cautioning has been used inappropriately.
<P>
It would be wrong for one young person to be given an informal caution which does not go on the record but for another youngster, in another area, to receive a final warning in exactly the same circumstances. A final warning is on the record and it is formal. In both cases, the treatment of the young people might be unfair. If a youngster was given an informal warning, with no intervention to address the roots of the offending behaviour, he or she might be disadvantaged as a result.
<P>
We want to intervene positively and to nip things in the bud. That is the point of the final warning procedure and of the whole system by which we deal with the first stages of offending by young people. The previous system unintentionally permitted delay and drift. That was to avoid involving young people in the criminal justice system, but it neglected society's responsibility to correct their behaviour early enough to let them know where they stood.
<P>
I invite the hon. Gentleman to set aside all ideas of informal caution, as if an informal parallel universe could exist beside the formal system of reprimand and caution. He should recognise that police officers will and should use their common sense in dealing with activities that are not offences and which could lead to either negative or positive developments depending on whether they are handled badly or whether a quiet word is had with youngsters and their parents. That is not an informal cautioning system. It is proper police involvement in crime prevention and reduction through dealing in a common-sense way with matters as they arise. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the common sense of that approach, and not try to plant in anyone's mind the idea that there should be a system of informal cautions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The Minister said that the present system was a fudge and a muddle, and I think that our debate this morning has also been fudge and muddle. Not a great deal separates the Government and the Opposition on the issue that we are discussing.
<P>
I back up the Minister and understand what he is trying to achieve, because when I used to visit juvenile courts I believed that they were not working properly and I still do. The reason was that young offenders were being brought into a system involving the full panoply of the court the royal coat of arms on the wall and the rest of it and, in many cases, receiving repeated warnings, or cautions in effect, such as those the Minister described administering when he was a magistrate in juvenile courts. The whole system has fallen into disrepute and lost the sense of fear and hierarchy.
<P>
What the Minister wants to achieve is right. However, I still do not understand everything that would happen. I understand the Minister to be arguing that a system of informal cautioning would of course exist, to the extent that the police would be able to tick off a child who, for example, caused trouble outside an old person's cottage; but that if such a youngster committed an offence, such as stealing from a shop, the police would not be able to indulge in the old system of repeat cautioning. I understand the reason for that. The system got out of control and the Minister wants something more structured.
<P>
I agree with the Minister to that extent. However, an important point is raised in the briefing from the Law Society, which has considerable experience in the relevant matters, and whose point of view is not, I think, that silly. It accepts the need for change. The briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A police officer should have a discretion to warn rather than charge an offender in these circumstances to avoid the offender being taken to court unnecessarily."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain the word "unnecessarily" in that context?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am not the Law Society, but let us think the matter through. Presumably, on occasion, a youngster commits an offence for which he deserves something more severe than a ticking off in the street from a policeman, but for which bringing him to court might be problematic. The evidence might be weak, the child might be very young, there might be mitigating circumstances or he might have been led astray by elder brothers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to explore a serious issue. Having engaged with it for several years, I have to say that he needs to study it more carefully.
<P>
If the evidence is weak, the reprimand or final warning cannot be used. There must be enough evidence to justify the likelihood of success in court and the offence has to be admitted before the final warning can be used. That is why I asked the hon. Gentleman to clarify the terms I know that they are the words of the Law Society rather than his own. Minor offences can be precursors to more serious offences. That is the whole point of incorporating a graduated response in the system it should neither be too heavy at the outset nor allow matters to drift.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I know precisely what the Minister is seeking to achieve. However, bringing a youngster to court too early may have precisely the opposite effect. The punishment inflicted on a youngster by the court may be small, because the offence is small or the individual is very young or there are mitigating circumstances. Bringing a youngster to court unnecessarily in those sort of cases can be harmful because the youngster will be dealt with lightly and may well say, "I have committed this so-called crime and been to this place where they have severe-looking people on the bench staring down at me" people such as the Minister or you, Mr. O'Hara. I would be very frightened if you were sitting on a bench staring at me; you are looking very grand there in your great seat of power and authority over our Committee 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is hardly relevant to this morning's debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> But I am making a serious point. I have seen it time and again with youngsters: they are brought to a juvenile court and they are frightened but are let off too lightly. That is why it is unnecessary for them to go before the courts. The old system of caution may have worked against that problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not yet understood the system. If only a ticking off is needed, the reprimand provides the opportunity. If a youngster has committed a minor offence but it is evidence of a pattern of behaviour, the final warning will mean not only a ticking off and the involvement of his parents, but the necessary intervention the youth offending team will examine his life and seek to intervene to stop him drifting further into a pattern of bad behaviour.
<P>
If a youngster has to face a court, it will be either because the police feel that the offence was serious enough to justify it that would exclude trivial matters to which the hon. Member for Gainsborough referred or after a previous final warning, which means that there has been a pattern of bad behaviour. Either a punishment or further intervention will then result. We put the arguments forward in our White Paper "No More Excuses", which was intended to provide the basis for a coherent system. I would have hoped that the hon. Gentleman could see the virtue in that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is becoming clearer. I am glad that I made my few remarks, which will have clarified the situation for me and other members of the Committee. From the Minister's viewpoint, the Law Society is wrong to say that the police should have the discretion to issue more than one warning, because the Minister wants it to be a final warning. I presume that the Minister would tell the Law Society that the police can issue more than one reprimand 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister is now shaking his head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The key point is that the system should be progressive: a final warning comes when a further offence is committed after a reprimand, or, if the police judge the case to be serious enough, the final warning can be issued immediately. Repeat final warnings cannot be given, except in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
We agonised over the problem. There may be truly exceptional circumstances in which a second final warning might be permitted. We allowed that discretion to remain, but only after some heartsearching because we do not want the drift to second and third final warnings to become the norm rather than the exception. I prefer to describe the norm as a crisp pattern in which the police consider the seriousness of an offence to decide whether a reprimand or final warning should be given and where there is a natural progression from one sanction to the other. The fact that youngsters have committed more than one offence makes it even more important to intervene. Of course, the system can deal only with those youngsters that have been caught. They may represent the tip of an iceberg.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister's interventions are becoming longer than the speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister's comments are of far more interest to the Committee than my own. He has the power to implement the Bill. My contribution is designed to tease out of him better and fuller particulars of what he hopes to achieve. I am happy with his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister referred to informal cautioning. May we take it that informal cautions will be possible under the new system? It does not matter whether one calls informal cautions a system; my first question is whether they will be possible in future.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister has not given us information about any new guidance that he is giving to police forces about informal cautions. Can we therefore take it that no further guidance will be given to police forces about them?
<P>
If we can establish what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) describes as those further and better particulars, I shall not say any more. Otherwise, we will be in danger of jumping to the next group of amendments. If my understanding on the two points I have raised is correct, I give notice that I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> This has been a helpful debate that has teased out some of the issues involved in the final warning system. The language used must be clear, because one of the problems is that people can get easily confused. I am not prepared to say that there will be a system of informal cautions. I said earlier that police officers should use their discretion and common sense when using the powers available to them.
<P>
However, there are dangers in an informal cautioning system. The hon. Member for Gainsborough mentioned the example of a youngster committing a shoplifting offence on the spur of the moment. Problems arise if such behaviour is not nipped in the bud. The youngster may have been tempted on one occasion or he may have been tempted many times in the past and ticked off by a police officer as a result. The hon. Member for Hertsmere would describe that as an informal caution. If that youngster receives such a caution, the whole purpose of having a crisp system that pulls offenders up short is undermined. They will receive the message that police officers will tick them off every now and then, but that nothing much happens. They will think that they will be able to get away with offences if they burst into tears.
<P>
It is difficult to distinguish between a genuine case I understand the example given by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and a case two or three steps down the primrose path. Therefore, we must leave the position as I described it earlier. Police officers will be able to use their discretion sensibly to deal with certain behaviour when offences have not been committed. Such discretion can be used to prevent that behaviour developing into further offending.
<P>
I do not want to suggest that we have fettered the discretion of the police in an absolute way. I want the Committee to understand that we will introduce a clear, simple system that will allow discretion to be used, especially when deciding to give reprimand rather than a final warning. That system will enable action to take place progressively and predictably. That is the best way to give young people a framework for knowing that action will be taken if they break the law and if they affect the community through their offending.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that I have tried to give him a positive response. I have tried to choose my words carefully because I do not want to say anything that may subject the crisp, fair, progressive system that we are putting in place to the sort of attrition that has occurred in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I wish that I had never used the word "system". I did not use it with any particular weight or deliberation it was merely a form of shorthand.
<P>
Perhaps I can clarify matters by saying that informal cautioning will continue. The Minister described how, and said that the Government will give no new guidance to the police. The Minister looks slightly alarmed do I take it that I am correct? I made the point in my original remarks, but the Minister did not address it in his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I can certainly confirm that guidance will be given to the police about the application of the reprimand and the final warning. That guidance will clarify the discretion that the police may use in deciding whether to impose a reprimand or final warning, or indeed, to go straight to a court appearance. That will depend on the seriousness of the offence and on surrounding circumstances.

<P>
We will try to deal clearly with the point about informal contact with youngsters and with matters raised by the hon. Gentleman in what has been a useful debate. I choose my words deliberately. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's formulation, because I think that it creates the potential for confusion. However, I believe that we both understand the point that we have reached in our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall have many questions for the Minister about guidance on reprimands and warnings when we come to debate on a later amendment. However, I think that we have gone as far as we can. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 48, line 5, leave out from "if" to end of line 11 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"he considers the offence to be not so serious as to require a charge to be brought and if 
<P>
(a) the offender has not previously been warned; or
<P>
(b) where the offender has previously been warned, the offence was committed more than two years after the date of the previous warning and the offender had not been reprimanded prior to the previous warning.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 217, in page 48, line 30, leave out "(b)."
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come to more substantive matters concerning the new system of reprimands and warnings, including the repeat reprimands and warnings that the Minister has already described.
<P>
Amendment No. 216 deals with the question of how many reprimands and warnings an offender may receive. We understand that an offender may receive a reprimand under the new system, unless his offence is to serious and merits an immediate warning. An offender who commits a further offence will receive a warning. He cannot receive a reprimand, as he has had one already. The warning brings into play assessment for rehabilitation.
<P>
We understand that an offender who offends yet again will not normally receive a further warning. Our understanding of clause 61(3) is that an offender who has received a warning may be warned again if the new offence is committed more than two years after the first warning. Subsection (3)(b) states that such a warning may be given if, in addition,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the constable considers the offence to be not so serious as to require a charge to be brought."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that under the new system it will be possible for an offender to receive a total of up to three reprimands and warnings, in addition to any informal caution that he may have received in the circumstances that the Minister has just described?
<P>
The Minister cannot argue too much with that, because he will be arguing with what he has already said.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has now made the case for not having informal cautions. I tried to[Mr. Michael]
persuade him of that in our earlier debate. Following the trial that he suggests would lead to the old evils. That is why I rejected the use of the words "informal caution".
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It would be possible, in the circumstances specified by the Minister, and in those that I have described, for an offender to receive a reprimand and two further warnings because there would be no record of an informal caution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not want to discuss reprimands and final warnings at the moment, but I must make it clear that I have not accepted any suggestion for a system of informal cautions. The hon. Member for Hertsmere insists on using that phrase, but they are his words, not mine. Such a system has no place in what we are proposing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to get into an argument. In his speech, the Minister said that it would be possible for a defendant to be given an informal caution and then to receive a reprimand and two further warnings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman returns to an earlier debate and seeks to confuse matters. I made it clear that in circumstances that did not involve offences, informal advice might be given. I did not admit of circumstances in which informal cautions would be used in the way that the hon. Gentleman described.
<P>
The previous system had no statutory basis and that permitted the dangers that existed in that system. We are trying to avoid them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to go back over the previous debate. The Minister's words will stand and those who read the reports of our proceedings will seem them. I deliberately referred to what the Minister had said. Surely, he would accept that the situation that I described might arise. I was not suggesting anything that was different from what the Minister said about informal cautions or however he wants to describe them.
<P>
I should like to return to a discussion of how the Government propose to replace cautioning with reprimands and warnings. I refer to subsection (3) and the second warning. It is fair that a two-year break in offending by a young offender should be a significant factor. However, repeated cautioning may produce a mindset in the offender that he can offend again and again without being taken to court. Opposition Members are worried about that.
<P>
Would the Minister agree that, in the circumstances described in the clause, three cautions would be too many? The amendment would prevent an offender from receiving three cautions. The Minister may describe it as a reprimand and two warnings; we can use whatever labels we like. In effect, there would be three such incidents. We seek to restrict the administration of a second warning to cases in which there had not been a reprimand.
<P>
The new system might be well-intentioned, if we strip away all the rhetoric about repeat cautioning. However, it will itself generate a fair amount of repeat cautioning, in the circumstances to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough has referred.
<P>
The Opposition are not too impressed by the changing of names; we are not taken in by that. We hope that too much weight will not be placed on changing the names of what were cautions to reprimands and warnings. We also hope that no Labour Member will fall into the trap of saying "We have abolished cautioning", or "We have abolished repeat cautioning". Pinning a new label on something will not change it. We must consider the activity that takes place.
<P>
The Opposition are worried about the future. The Government should be more cautious then they have been in the use of rhetoric about repeat cautioning. The Minister chose to speak about reducing repeat cautioning this morning, but there is evidence from the Government's parlimentry answers that the practice has been going down during recent years.
<P>
I share the Minister's anxieties about repeat cautioning and he is right to try to avoid it. However, we must stick to the facts and evidence, and get away from the rhetoric. I asked the Government to get the answer from the horse's mouth what their view was about the evidence relating to repeat cautioning. I asked the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"how many offenders aged 10 to 19 years to whom one caution has already been administered have received (a) a second and (b) more than two cautions in respect of further offences in each year since 1994."
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall read the Minister's reply verbatim. I apologise to the Committee for doing that, but I shall be as quick as I can. The Minister stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Data routinely available centrally do not include details of repeat cautions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For a sample of offenders cautioned for standard list offences in ten police forces during one week in November 1991, a record was submitted centrally on their first subsequent caution over the next two years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From this sample, it is estimated that 20,800 offenders aged 10 to 19, who were administered a first caution for an indictable offence in 1991, received a subsequent caution for a standard list offence in the next two years. An estimate relating to those cautioned for summary offences is not available.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It should be noted that concern about repeat cautioning led to revised guidance being issued in March 1994 ... to discourage the use of repeat cautions. In a sample of offenders cautioned for standard list offences in all but two police forces in November 1994, the proportion of those aged 10 to 19 who had one previous caution was 11 per cent. The proportion with more than one caution was 6 per cent. In a similar sample collected in 1991, the respective proportions were 16 per cent. and 10 per cent." [Official Report, 12 December 1997; Vol. 302, c. 695-96.]</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reply then told me that information about offences included in the standard list was given in the appendices of the criminal statistics.
<P>
The reply demonstrates that action was taken in 1994 and that it had some effect. Under the existing system of cautioning, repeat cautioning was going down. The figures speak for themselves. The Opposition appreciated the intentions behind the new system, but we are worried that it will reverse the downward trend by giving the green light to repeat cautioning. It might become common, if not the norm, for a reprimand to be followed by a warning. The change of name will lessen the impetus for a charge to be brought after the first offence. I hope that I am wrong about that.
<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee whether he thinks that the number of cases in which both a reprimand and a warning are given will be larger or smaller than the number of cases in which two cautions are given? Let us not bother abut changing names, or pinning new labels on things. Will there be more repeat cautioning, or less? I put the Minister on notice that we shall monitor these matters carefully, to see how the new system works in practice, away from all the rhetoric.
<P>
We want to avoid repeat cautioning, and we would like some more details on the link between the seriousness of offences and the use of reprimands or warnings. In one of our earlier debates the Minister said that inconsistency undermines the criminal justice system. I agree with that. Bearing those words in mind, will the Minister tell the Committee whether there will be Government guidance on the matter?
<P>
The Opposition are especially concerned about the attitude that will be taken towards different categories of offence. Will the Minister tell us what guidance will be given about the seriousness of offences? Will it be by offence type, or by features of the offence? What will be the attitude towards drugs offences under the new system? Will guidance be given on such issues as the possession and supply of class A and class B drugs? We hope that the Minister will allay our concerns about those matters.
<P>
The Minister spoke in previous debates about the development of tariffs and how one thing leads to another in the criminal justice system. We are worried that what is proposed will simply become a ladder that offenders will climb, receiving automatically a reprimand, then a warning, then sometimes, perhaps, after a two-year gap, another warning. That looks like repeat cautioning to us, call it what one will. The mindset that that will induce in some young offenders and the example that it will set to others worried us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> In probing our intentions the hon. Gentleman is in danger of talking himself into a rather odd corner. It is not the names that are changing; it is the system, the framework and practice that will change as a result of the measure. The change is very significant and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will do nothing to undermine its effectiveness by trying to introduce confusion in the name of Opposition probing.
<P>
There is not an equivalent to the final warning in the present system of cautioning. The point of the final warning is that it would not be just a ticking off. Intervention would follow immediately. Something would be done to confront the young offender and his parents with the relevant behaviour, and to involve a wider group of people, perhaps in the family, the school, a young organisation or a church, in considering how to ensure that the young man very often it is boys who offend grew up into a healthy citizen rather than an offender. That question would be posed as a direct consequence of a final warning, but would not have resulted from a caution.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should be aware, after the earlier debate, that we do not know that cautioning is decreasing. He quoted my answer which referred only to formal cautioning. He acknowledged the existence of informal cautioning and I explained my worries about it, which his remarks seem to justify. The total amount of cautioning that is done may fluctuate so may repeat cautioning. As a result of national concern about repeat cautioning, the Home Office issued guidance and some reduction followed, but it was not sufficient. I made that clear before and after the general election. Repeat cautioning has been reduced, but not ended.
<P>
It is important to understand that the police need not administer a reprimand. For that matter, they need not give a final warning on the first relevant occasion. They have discretion. If their common sense tells them that the seriousness of the offence, the circumstances or the general context require the matter to be dealt with in court rather than by reprimand or final warning, they can decide accordingly.
<P>
It should also be understood that the reprimand could not be repeated. It is intended not as the first stage, but as a way to deal with the issue that we covered in the previous debate circumstances in which common sense leads the police to feel that only a ticking off may be necessary. The reprimand would be a safety value in that context. The police's first decision would be whether the case merited court or a final warning. If they thought it trivial, or if, having seen the response of the youngster and his parents to the accusation, they thought that a reprimand would suffice, they could use that simple and straighforwrd approach. They would not be forced to do it but would use their judgment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> As I understand it, the usual pattern aside from occasional, very serious offences, which are rare would be reprimand, warning, court. However, even in exceptional circumstances, on the nature of which we might speculate, the police could not give more than one reprimand. Is that right?
<P>
Of course we do not want repeat cautions. We all accept that. However, I wonder why the Minister is so insistent that the police should never have the option of repeating a reprimand in some circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I hoped that I had explained that, but I shall try again. It is our belief that offending behaviour that comes to police attention shows that something is wrong. Sometimes the problem may be a one-off and the final warning or reprimand may deal with it. If youngsters do not get into trouble again, they will not go to court. Often a caution has proved to be the end of the matter. The reprimand would keep to that simple approach but only for a narrow group of offenders, who did not reoffend.
<P>
Clearly, the same attitude cannot be taken to a second offence, which by its nature cannot be considered a one-off. It must be at least a two-off, and could be the tip of an iceberg. It is therefore important to intervene. That is why we do not allow for a repeat reprimand. I suspect a difference in approach and philosophy between the hon. Members for Gainsborough and for Hertsmere on this point.
<P>
Reprimand is available if the police consider a case not to be serious enough to demand a court appearance[Mr. Michael]
or a final warning, with the intervention associated with that. The reprimand is, on one occasion, an option.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has now closed the door on the possibility of a second reprimand. What if the second offence was of a very different nature from the first? For example, the first offence might be minor shoplifting and the second might a minor act of violence towards a classmate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Then there would be two indicators of something going wrong. If offending is seen as a sign of something wrong in a youngster's life as well as an action affecting a victim two such episodes could give rise to more concern, not less.

<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's thinking, but I think that he is considering the matter as a barrister and focusing on the critical elements of reoffending and increasing seriousness of offences. Our point of view is that low-level offending, at the beginning of a youngster's offending career, is a sign that something needs to be dealt with, both for the sake of the youngster's future and to nip the offending in the bud. The beauty of the system is that it joins those issues together rather neatly, I like to think.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman gave an example in which three incidents would give rise to reprimand and final warning. I have explained that there could be only one reprimand, and that would have required the police to take the view that the offence was trivial, or that the offender was clearly not going to offend again. On a second occasion, because of the previous reprimand, the police would have considered whether to take the offender straight to court or give a final warning, and decided that the right approach was to move quickly to a final warning, with its associated intervention and assessment. Let us assume that the two incidents happened within a fairly short period when the youngster was aged between 10 and 11 an entirely plausible scenario. If he subsquently faced prosecution as a 17-year-old for another relatively minor offence, such as riding a bicycle on a pavement, or a minor theft, it would not be possible to administer a reprimand, but a further warning could be given, because of the time that had elapsed. That is the sort of exception that the two-year rule is intended to cater for.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Even though the offence committed at the age of 17 is not a serious one, the police have the choice to decide to administer a further final, final warning on the basis of the discretion in the clause but may not do so because it is only the tip of the iceberg. If the police want to, they can take the case to court straight away. Their discretion is not fettered in any way. A second warning after a two-year gap is not a right, but a matter for the discretion and judgment of the police.
<P>
Both the introduction of the reprimand and of the possibility of a second final warning in exceptional circumstances are the consequence of much thought and consultation on the part of the Government. We decided that there should be a safety-valve to prevent the police feeling too fettered without the capacity to make a sensible judgment. Two years seemed a reasonable period. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, two years is a long time for a youngster in that age group.
<P>
I repeat, however, that the police do not have to use the discretion given to them: it is there to deal in a common sense way with circumstances outside the normal pattern of final warnings being followed by court. It is for circumstances in which the police judge that even the final warning and the intervention are not needed. The equivalence with the old cautioning system is only between the caution and the reprimand not with the final warning.
<P>
We use the term "final warning" although it is just "warning" in the Bill because we want to make it clear that it will normally be final. Normally, if the offender offends again after a final warning, and after having had an opportunity to put matters right through intervention, he will go straight before the courts. I hope that hon. Gentlemen will agree, on reflection, that we have devised a rather neat system. In allowing flexibility and progression, it is far better than the slightly barmy idea of allowing an unlimited number of informal cautions preferred by the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have not said that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am sorry if I misrepresent the hon. Gentleman but he wanted to allow the possibility of informal cautions, which I was careful to point out was inappropriate. He insisted on making that suggestion; I should be glad to hear him if he wants to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is slipping in his standards here. I made it perfectly clear in our debate over the previous group of amendments that I wanted to know whether the Government intended informal cautioning to continue. I wanted to know the Government's intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I have told him repeatedly about the Government's intentions. The hon. Gentleman has repeatedly tried to smuggle back in some system of informal warnings and I have explained that we are not going to allow it. I used carefully considered words to explain that it was common sense for the police's ability to exercise discretion not to be taken away from them. I am satisfied that I have got it right and that the police will recognise it.
<P>
We published a consultation document last year which received a positive response from the police and indeed others. Repeating final warnings again after a two-year period would take place only in circumstances in which the police considered it appropriate. They have discretion but they are not pushed to exercise it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As I have said throughout the debate, we must be precise about terms and we must examine facts and evidence in the light of them. Without moving any goalposts, let us be clear about the proposals. The criteria in the clause are similar to the criteria used for cautions in the past they apply to police action when an offence has been committed but the offender is not taken to court. In other words, cautions are actions that fall short of prosecuting the offender.
<P>
Unless the Minister is suggesting that cases charged in the past should be shifted to warnings and reprimands under the present system, the broad outlines of the older system remain in place. When there is evidence that an offence has been committed, we are talking about police action that falls short of taking the offender to court. The Minister, who has been painting with a broad brush, is aware of the concern expressed in the past that such action was taken too often and generated a sense that the offender had got away with it. We shall come to rehabilitation programmes when we debate a later amendment, but we fear that action short of prosecution will still be taken when offences have been committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is constructing a case based on the criteria used in the past for giving a caution and which will be used in the future for giving a final warning. He should not confuse the issue. There is a considerable difference between a final warning, and its inseparable associated intervention, and the old system of cautioning. The old system was not statutory and did not involve anything other than the caution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hope that I was taking sufficient care to distinguish between the criteria for action and the nature of the action that follows once it has been decided not to take someone to court. The cases are similar, and the criteria for administering a caution and the broad criteria for reprimands and warnings are the same.
<P>
Let us set aside the rhetoric. We are concerned that, in some cases, the clause will institutionalise cautioning. Whatever label one chooses, reprimands and warnings are both actions short of taking someone to court and prosecuting him. The same was so of cautions in the past. Whether one calls it a first caution and a second caution or a reprimand and a warning, the sanctions are similar and meet the same criteria.
<P>
We are not too impressed by pinning new labels on things. Will the Minister be as brave as his words? Does he think that, under the new system, the combined number of reprimands and warnings will be greater or fewer than the number of repeat cautions in the past? That is the criteria we must use in determining whether the clause will be successful in doing away with repeat cautioning.
<P>
There is the danger of a disjunction between what the Government are trying to do and their rhetoric. They are introducing a new system of reprimands and warnings while claiming to be doing away with repeat cautioning. We must consider the action being taken and not the labels being pinned on it. Will the Minister put his hand on his heart and say that he will judge the success of the system in doing away with repeat cautioning according to whether the combined total of reprimands and warnings is greater or fewer than the number of repeat cautions in the past? That is the acid test that we shall apply.
<P>
The Minister told us how the system will operate. He said that a second warning, after a reprimand and a warning, would be given in exceptional circumstances. No doubt that is true, but I suspect that what the Minister has described as repeat cautions would have been administered in such exceptional circumstances. I do not know whether that is so, and the Minister may not, either. However, I suspect that repeat cautions were often given in such exceptional cases. If so, that shows the danger of painting with a broad brush when referring to repeat cautioning.
<P>
We have weighed up the factors that the Minister has described and the desirability of avoiding what, in effect, will be repeat cautioning and creating in an offender the mindset that he can commit offences without being taken to court. Whatever the interval between the offences, the danger of creating that mindset is such that it is more appropriate to reprimand and warn someone twice rather than three times. The Minister was fair enough to accept, as we do, that time is a significant factor. Even taking that into account, it is desirable to avoid the mindset whereby someone thinks that he can commit an offence three times and avoid prosecution. I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that under the new system albeit in what he described as exceptional circumstances it will be possible for someone to receive three combined reprimands and warnings.
<P>
I have set out our warnings for the future and put the Minister on notice of how we will examine the success of the new system. However, I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I should make one further point to the hon. Gentleman. I have gone to some lengths to explain that the circumstances that he described would have to be entirely exceptional. The police would have to use their discretion and make a judgment about the seriousness of an offence on three separate occasions. However, I must point out that the hon. Gentleman could be introducing a recipe for delay.
<P>
I understand what the hon. Gentleman means when he says that a further final warnings might give the impression that nothing will happen. However, he has not understood the nature of the final warning; that is the problem with the hon. Gentleman's mindset.
<P>
I gave the example of a youngster who has committed a trivial offence and received a reprimand. He is then given a final warning for a second trivial offence committed at the age of 10 or 11. That triggers an assessment of what has gone on. At the age of 17 he may commit another minor offence, but it would take some time for him to arrive in court. If he is given a final warning at that stage, there will be immediate intervention and people will ask him why he has committed a further offence after being given a final warning a few years earlier.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has understood the sophistication and effectiveness of the scheme that we are putting in place. I would not like him to be wrongly informed about our intentions or the effect of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I know that it is dangerous to use shorthand, but when I used the term "nothing happened", I meant that the offender would not be taken to court. What the Minister has said about rehabilitation may all happen and it might be a sophisticated scheme. He knows that there have been sophisticated caution-plus schemes and that a change of label is being applied to them. However, all such schemes take action that falls short of the offender being prosecuted and being[Mr. Clappison]
taken to court. I shall spell it out in precise terms: whatever happens in the rehabilitation programmes or in the interval, we fear that offenders will develop the mindset that they can commit offences and not be prosecuted or taken to court.
<P>
The Minister spoke of the exceptional circumstances in which someone will receive a second warning a third combined reprimand and warning and said that that was a matter for police discretion. That is all very well, but the type of offences that received third cautions in the past may have been exceptional. Is he suggesting that the police did not exercise discretion in those cases or did not consider them carefully? He knows from the figures in his written answer to me that such examples formed a tiny percentage of cases in the past. I suspect that second warnings will be administered in only a tiny percentage of cases in the future, but it will still be possible for offenders to receive what is, in effect, a third caution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Whatever label is being pinned to it, it will be a third caution because it will be the third time that someone has committed an offence and not been prosecuted and taken to court. Action falling short of that will have been taken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is misleading of the hon. Gentleman to compare a caution and a final warning. There is no comparison. If he examines the scheme he will realise that what it says is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The nature of the two are different. However, there is no difference in the circumstances in which such cautionings are ordered and administered. Those are circumstances in which an officer decides to take action against someone who has committed an offence that stops short of taking that person to court. The Minister does not do his system any credit if he pretends that there is a difference.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
There may be a difference in what happens the Minister may make the case for that. Cautioning means cautioning, and, whatever label the Minister uses, I suspect that members of the public would regard it as such.
<P>
We will examine the reality of the situation and the activity that takes place. We will shortly come to the question of rehabilitation. However, I warn the Minister that we are not taken in by rhetoric. The Government should not make bold claims about doing away with repeat cautioning. Those claims are not borne out by careful analysis and they may jeopardise the good will that exists towards the system's merits. I will not press the matter further, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 218, in page 48, line 14, at end insert

<P>
(4E) Subject to subsection (4C) above a warning may not be administered by a constable unless the constable has received a report from the youth offending team indicating that they are satisfied with the manner in which that person has participated in the rehabilitation programme.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 219, in page 49, leave out lines 7 to 20 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1) The Secretary of State shall publish, in such manner as he considers appropriate, guidance as to what should be included in a rehabilitation programme arranged for a person under section 61(4B)(b).".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We seem to have the unhappy knack of jumping ahead of ourselves, and amendment No. 218 has been well-trailed. It deals with interventions that may follow warnings.
<P>
Clauses 61 and 62 establish a scheme in which an offender who receives a warning will be referred to a rehabilitation programme. In the past, a similar scheme known as caution plus operated in several areas. It was examined carefully by the Home Affairs Select Committee in the report to which I have already referred.
<P>
The Bill gives statutory backing to the scheme. The Bill makes provision for an offender who receives a final warning to be referred for assessment by a youth offending team. He will be expected to take part in a rehabilitation programme, unless there are reasons that make it inappropriate for him to do so.
<P>
We are anxious about the lack of an effective sanction in the event of an offender failing to complete the rehabilitation programme. Clause 62(3) states that the Secretary of State will publish guidance on how such a failure is to be recorded and who is to be told about it. We are not certain what that will mean for the offender.
<P>
Subsection (5) states that failure to participate
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may be cited in criminal proceedings"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for a subsequent offence. The court that comes to sentence the offender will be concerned about the seriousness of the new offence. It will also take into account the offender's circumstances.
<P>
Will the Secretary of State's guidance and the threat of citation in subsequent proceedings induce the young offender to take rehabilitation seriously? We are anxious that a number of rehabilitation programmes may not be completed. That matter requires careful examination, and must be monitored in the future.
<P>
We are worried that offenders who most need to complete rehabilitation will not be given sufficient inducement to do so. Amendment No. 218 would enable offenders to be referred for rehabilitation before being given a warning. The decision not to prosecute would be conditional on the satisfactory completion of rehabilitation.
<P>
We suspect that that would concentrate the minds of young offenders on the task in hand rather more successfully than the Government's proposals. The offender would know that if he did not complete the programme properly he would be taken to court, prosecuted and sentenced.
<P>
On a more emotional level, a mere caution or warning an action short of being brought before the court should not be given to someone who cannot even be bothered to take part in a rehabilitation programme. Those who are unwilling to do so have not earned the right to receive more lenient treatment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I should like to advise the Committee that the clause has made it difficult as some hon. Members have noted to speak to some groups of amendments without encroaching on others. At an appropriate point, I shall suggest that we move on to clause stand part without further debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Again, the hon. Member for Hertsmere has not understood the full import of our proposed changes, which amount to more than a statutory implementation of the cautioning-plus scheme. I remind the hon. Gentleman that in recent years we sought to implement it I recall moving amendments on that basis to what became the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. I moved such amendments on other occasions. We have now moved further than that and given much thought to the system that is being introduced by the Bill.
<P>
When a final warning is given, a youngster will have an explanation as will his parents of its seriousness. He will be told that the warning is not the end of the business: there will be intervention and consideration will be given to various issues in conjunction with the youth offending team. Even more importantly and this is why the early administration of the warning is so crucial it will be made clear that any further offending behaviour will result in the offender being taken to court. That warning must be given as quickly as possible.
<P>
I am rather surprised at the amendments, which would mean that a clear signal to the youngster that it is his final warning before he is sent to court would be put off until some point in the future after discussion of problems and an exercise in rehabilitation. The present system involves convening a panel for a social work view to emerge about whether the youngster should be warned or taken to court, but we are doing away with that in order to get straight to the business. That is why a clear, crisp approach is so important.
<P>
Procedures for the administration of the final warning are set out in the Bill and reflect the critical importance of administering warnings quickly, thus establishing a clear link between crime and punishment in the minds of young offenders. We want the warnings to affect their behaviour straight away. We also want any necessary intervention to take place. I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will therefore appreciate that his suggestions I accept that they are well meaning would put the cart before the horse and have a damaging effect on the clear signal that we want to send to young people.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. We want the rehabilitation programmes to succeed. They are desirable elements of warnings and may help the necessary intervention to take place. The argument is about finding the best mechanism to encourage the young person to undertake rehabilitation.
<P>
The Minister makes a fair point about the potential for delaying subsequent court proceedings and we weighted that in the balance. However, we also have to weigh the desirability of the youngster being encouraged to take part in the rehabilitation programme. We fear that those who most need it could be those with the least motivation to take part in it, and we want to assist in the process of rehabilitating such marginal cases.
<P>
The best way to achieve that would be to maintain the sanction of further court proceedings hanging over young offenders. In that case, the youngster will know that if he does not take part in the programme, he will automatically be taken to court, prosecuted and sentenced. Avoiding the necessity to go to court will be well understood by the young offender. That is why I took care to contrast that sanction with those in the Bill, which will not be so immediately understood by young offenders.
<P>
The Minister has taken a view on the matter. I hope that he understands our reasons for proposing the amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 48, line 34, after "constable", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be not lower in rank than the rank of inspector".
<P></UL></FONT>
The amendment can be dealt with briefly. We are told that the Secretary of State is to publish guidance regarding
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the category of constable by whom reprimands and warnings may be given".
</UL></FONT>
<p>It is crucial for offenders to be left with the impression that these are serious matters and we would like the Government to clarify their intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. All who have experience of the criminal justice system and its effect on young offenders I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough has had experience of juvenile courts, and that some hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have practised either as solicitors or at the Bar are well aware of the way in which juveniles need to have brought home to them the seriousness of the matter. That is an important part of the crisp system to which the Minister rightly refers.
<P>
Juveniles must not be able to laugh off the caution. Many of us with experience of the courts will know of people who have suffered from the abuse of the[Mr. Hawkins]
previous system repeat cautions. Some juveniles do not take matters seriously even when they are brought before the court: they want to poke fun all the time at the entire system. Conservative Members share the Government's intention to bring home to young offenders the seriousness with which their offences are being treated.
<P>
The amendment would be helpful. Even if the Minister cannot accept it I hope, of course, that he will I trust that he will tell us that he is prepared to reflect on the issue further or include it in guidance. Insisting on a senior officer inspector or above to administer cautions helps to bring home the majesty of the law. That is what is meant when we talk about crisp warnings to shock young offenders into keeping within the law in future. On the basis of my experience, it would make a big difference.
<P>
Young people who have committed a first offence of shoplifting truly need a disciplined approach. It is important for parents too to realise that because a senior officer is involved the matter cannot be taken lightly, trifled with or laughed at. A senior officer bringing home the seriousness of the situation would be most helpful to those youngsters for whom it is in the balance whether they will remain on the straight and narrow or fall into a cycle of bad company and repeat offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I can respond sympathetically. I feel instinctively that a senior officer undertaking this duty will provide additional weight, so I am happy to give an assurance to take account of the point in guidance. I am uneasy about incorporating it in the Bill because it may be inappropriate in certain circumstances. I shall provide two examples. First, it might bring about undue delay in rural areas, when we want warnings to be given as close to the offence as possible. Secondly, the sergeant in a rural area who is well known to the community may be a greater authority figure than a superintendent in a distant central location.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I recognise the force of the Minister's point about the sergeant and I welcome his general response to my comments and to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. Does he recognise our anxiety that such matters should not be left to a police constable, whose authority might not carry the same weight?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. There is a danger that such matters will become routine and will drift down to a person who does not happen to be doing anything else at the time. There must be an investment of care, attention and authority on the part of the police, if the measure is to have a long-term effect.
<P>
Another possibility might be for a police force to involve personnel who had specialised in youth justice. Such people would have some authority because of that work. PC Ron Ashe, for example, was the local youth justice computer in Cardiff for many years. He knew the ways and the language of young people far better than many more sophisticated and senior individuals.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members will accept the principle behind my points. The administration of a final warning must be undertaken seriously and it would normally be carried out by a more senior officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Minister reminds me of another police officer, who was well known in my former constituency. He was also a constable, with the same kind of authority as PC Ashe. A man with the size and international rugby reputation of PC Wade Dooley carried considerable weight. Any caution administered by him would have been taken seriously by the youngster concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> There seems to be a considerable meeting of minds on that point. In view of my comments about guidance, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. He made some fair points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I support the Minister. When he writes to my hon. Friend to set out the advice that will be given on these matters, will he and my hon. Friend bear in mind the fact that in one part of my constituency in north Lincolnshire there is only one inspector covering 700 square miles?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is what I meant when I said that the Minister made some fair points. We do not want to introduce inflexibility in these matters; we want to send out the message that the administering of a warning should be seen as a serious occasion and that everything should be done to make that possible.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 259 in page 48, line 44, leave out from "if" to "is" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"all reasonable steps have been taken to secure the presence of a person falling within paragraph (a) or (b) and no such person".</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall speak briefly. The Opposition believe that it is important that an appropriate adult should be present when the reprimand or warning is administered. It is especially desirable that the parents of the young person should be there. The amendment reflects that.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Michael:</B> My response will also be brief. The amendment would change the section of the Bill that defines an appropriate adult. That definition was designed to mirror the existing appropriate adult provisions under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
<P>
I agree that it is desirable for the parents to be present. In my work in courts, I always tried to encourage that and would urge the police to take that approach. I give an undertaking to the hon. Gentleman that the guidance will make it clear that, wherever possible, the police should ensure that the parents, or the adult responsible for the young person, should be the appropriate adult present when a warning or a reprimand is issued. However, it would be going too far if we changed the definition given by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. With my undertaking about the guidance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am happy with the Minister's response and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 61 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<h4><center>Clause 62</center></h4>
 <h4><center>Effect of reprimands and warnings</center></H4>
 <p5>Mr. Clappison: I beg to move amendment No. 274, in page 49, line 10, after "above", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and in particular shall assess whether or not the offending behaviour of the person was linked to controlled drugs".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 275, in page 49, line 13, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and, where an assessment has been made that the offending behaviour of the person was linked to controlled drugs, may arrange for him to receive such treatment or counselling in relation to controlled drugs as they consider to be appropriate".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendments relate to the assessment of offenders for rehabilitation programmes and the content of such programmes.
<P>
Amendment No. 274 requires a youth offending team carrying out an assessment of an offender to decide whether the person's offending behaviour is linked to drugs. If the assessment is that the behaviour is linked to the use of controlled drugs, the amendment provides that the youth offending team would arrange for the offender to be referred for counselling or treatment.
<P>
We must recognise, sadly, that the offending behaviour of a number of 10 to 17-year-olds will be linked to drugs. The strategy document issued by the Government's anti-drugs co-ordinator states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Drugs misuse is most common amongst people in their teens and early 20s, but the average age of first drug use is becoming younger."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The anti-drugs co-ordinator the drugs tsar described the consequences of drug abuse for young people in that age group. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For early to mid-teenagers, there are strong links between drug problems, exclusion or truancy from school, break-up of the family and initiation into criminal activity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The consequences for older teenagers might be equally bad.
<P>
Against such a background, offenders should be assessed for drugs problems. If drug counselling and treatment are not part of a rehabilitation programme, it is likely to fail, however well intentioned it might have been.
<P>
Drug abuse is often linked to other problems. The abuse and the underlying problems must be addressed; if one or other is ignored, problems are likely to continue. For example, there have been some alarming figures recently about the link between shoplifting and drug abuse. Those statistics lead us to infer that there are many young offenders who steal to feed a drug habit. Drug abuse must be assessed and addressed as part of the warning and rehabilitation programme.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I support my hon. Friend. All members of the Committee are aware of the scourge of drugs, especially on young people, and, sadly, will recognise the truth of his comments.
<P>
The amendments offer a helpful additional provision. The Minister gave a constructive response to our comments this morning and perhaps he will reflect on the amendments in the same way. I hope that he will consider returning to these matters on Report or that he will, at least, issue further guidance. The amendments have been tabled in a constructive way to help to solve the problems caused by the sad increase in drugs-related offences committed by young people.
<P>
I commend to the Minister the work of drug action teams. He will probably know that in Surrey we have an effective team, with which I have worked during the past two years. The team is led by Tony Blowers, a dedicated man, with a long record of public service. I have held a number of conferences for the team in the Palace of Westminster, and that has shown the importance of their work in helping the authorities with rehabilitation programmes. That team has all-party support. There are similar teams in other parts of the country, staffed by dedicated people. Such teams can be of great help. I hope, therefore, that the Government are able to accept the spirit, if not the letter, of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sure that the Minister will say that the team woiuld of course want to carry out the relevant assessment, though he perhaps does not want that to be specified in the Bill. Subsection (2) provides for an assessment to be made of every young offender and for referral to the youth offending team as soon as possible.
<P>
I want to take this opportunity to ask that the Minister means by the rehabilitation programme mentioned in the helpful notes on clauses that he sent to us at the beginning of our deliberations. As the rehabilitation programmes are to be provided by youth offending teams, presumably they will be particularly concerned with drug-induced behaviour. The notes on clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The rehabilitation programmes will be established across England and Wales and will build on the best practice of existing non-statutory `caution plus' schemes, such as those operated by the Northamptonshire Diversion Unit and the Thames Valley Police."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What are caution plus schemes, and what is the experience of Northamptonshire and Thames Valley?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for the way in which they have made their points. I disagree with nothing that has been said.
<P>
I do not think that I should take up the Committee's time by responding to the question of the hon. Member for Gainsborough with a description of rehabilitation programmes now. However, those programmes tackle the offending, the incidents that led up to it and the background that may to some extent have caused it. In both Northamptonshire and the Thames Valley, reparation has been an important element of the projects. Youngsters have been faced with the fact that their offending has damaged another human being. That sounds obvious to us who know the damage that crime does to victims, but I have heard what youngsters had to say after meeting victims. One youngster spoke as if light had shone on him for the first time, after an old lady whose home he had burgled told him about her[Mr. Michael]
experience. He said to me that that had really hurt her; she did not feel safe in her home.
<P>
Rehabilitation must encompass youngsters' minds and attitudes and their understanding of their behaviour, as well as work on dependency on drugs, alcohol or other substances. We want a comprehensive approach which targets a youngster's individual problems and needs, in addition to his or her problematic behaviour.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere was right to stress the importance of dealing with the link between drugs and offending. Clause 62 provides that, following a warning, a young offender should be referred to a youth offending team withut delay. The team would then assess him or her and draw up an appropriate rehabilitation programme to tackle the offending behaviour. The clause also enables the Home Secretary to issue guidance on the contents of rehabilitation programmes, and it will obviously be necessary to draw attention to the frequency of the link between drugs and offending.
<P>
Drug and other substance abuse is a key risk factor associated with youth offending. Dealing with those problems will therefore be a basic part of the teams' work with young offenders, including those referred following a final warning. It will be possible for a young person's assessment to include an assessment of drug or other substance misuse, and a rehabilitation programme will be to include action to tackle those problems. That could include referring the youngster to a local drug treatment or counselling project. There would also be scope to include a drug worker in the youth offending team at the outset, to do assessment and intervention work without the need for onward referrals. That would obviously depend on the extent of the problem in any area and the assessment of how best to deal with it.
<P>
We do not think it necessary or appropriate to specify assessments relating to drug misuse in the Bill. I recognise how significant a factor it can be, but other significant risk factors are associated with youth offending. I chaired the all-party group on alcohol misue for some years, and we frequently held joint meetings with the all-party group on drug misuse, precisely because of the frequent overlapping of problems.
<P>
We want the link between drugs and crime to be clearly understood, and I undertake that it will be followed through clearly in guidance. I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will feel ready to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response. The simple point that we wanted to establish was that great importance should be attached to dealing with drug problems. In some cases, if those are not tackled, whatever other factors are involved, the offender is unlikely to benefit sufficiently from the rehabilitation programme. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Promising work has been done with reparation orders, which can be made by the court following conviction. We are particularly aware of what has been done in the Thames Valley. The availability of reparation as a way of dealing with offences has potential.
<P>
My view is subject to two comments, one general and one more specific. First, we are a little concerned, with respect to sentencing, about the proliferation of orders, each compartmentalised away from the others, that a court will be able to make. We wonder whether a single over-arching order under which various activities could be required reparation among them would be better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We want the options of a wide-ranging order that could work in various ways over time, and clear, narrow and focused orders. The option that the hon. Gentleman referred to could be built into the supervision order. We would see reparation as a normal part of a longer period of supervision in many cases. However, a reparation order is intended for cases when it seems necessary to focus on reparation over a short time. I think there is little between us on this point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is true, as far as the sentences that we want to be available in practice are concerned. My point is about the form of the sentence and the order made by the court. I am interested in the possibility of a single order, which could specify different activities, rather than several different orders reparation orders, supervision orders or action plan orders. A single-order system would have the merit of simplicity and avoid restrictions involving different types of sentences.
<P>
I take the Minister's point about flexibility. Earlier, when he mentioned the need for flexibility with respect to sentences I said that I would put that point in the bank for later, and I intend to cash it in; but that will be in debates on later amendments, so I shall not stray in that direction. At present I am concerned with the procedure followed before a reparation order is made particularly from the victim's point of view. The victim's feelings and predicament should be borne in mind.
<P>
Subsection (5) makes it clear that the victim's consent is required before a reparation order is made. That is entirely right. However, through the amendments, we want to explore the granting of consent. It should take fully into account the feelings of victims, especially older victims.
<P>
Amentment No. 276 would require a court to inform a victim after a reparation order has been made. The victim's consent will be sought, but it would be sensible for the victim to be informed after the order is made. We imagine that the Government intend that that should happen, but will the Minister clarify that?
<P>
Amendment No. 236 relates to clause 64, which requires a court to obtain a report prepared by a probation officer. Subsection (1) states that the report should outline
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) the type of work that is suitable for the offender;
and 
<P>
this is the important part 
<P>
"(b) the attitude of the victim or victims to the requirements proposed to be included in the order."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision should go a little further. It should not just canvass the victim's attitude to the requirements on the order, but to whether an order should be made. It is clear that the consent of the victim will be obtained, but knowing that the victim approves of an order being made would provide an additional safeguard. There would be no doubt that the victim was giving his full consent to the making of an order.
<P>
That provision is particularly important for older people, who are dealt with in amendment No. 265. Special attention needs to be paid to them when it comes to the granting of consent for a reparation order. We fear that some older people will be nervous or afraid of coming into contact with their perpetrator of the crime against them. They can withold their consent under subsection (5), but they should be fully aware of their rights to do that should they so wish.
<P>
Some older people are very much in awe of anything that appears to them to be official. It is important to make it as clear as possible to them that they have every right to refuse reparation should they wish. Of course, some older people will want reparation, but other will not want. They may have a variety of feelings and a mixture of emotions about the process. It should be spelt out that they have the right to refuse reparation.
<P>
Amendment No. 265 would require the consent of older people to be in writing and accompanied by a declaration that they were aware of their right to refuse reparation. We want to be satisfied that an older person is fully aware of his right to refuse. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This debate, which is on the sensitivities of older people and on whether and how they should give their consent, provides a useful opportunity to ask the Minister about the philosophy behind the reparation orders. I have nothing against the reparation orders they are valuable but we are in danger of deluding ourselves that they will achieve more than they will for the elderly people who are often the victims of crime.
<P>
Modern crime and punishment, as it has developed over the past 100 years, has focused on society punishing the criminal directly for his wrongdoing. Before that, systems of criminal justice were based more on offenders giving reparation directly to their victims. That is the thinking behind concepts such as blood money. We are now moving away from 19th and 20th century concepts of society taking on the burden of dealing with criminals. We believe that it is a good thing to oblige young offenders to make reparations directly to their victims. On the reparation orders, the notes on clauses state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Reparation under this order will be in kind, rather than financial, and might involve the offender writing the victim a letter of apology, reparative work to the victim or repairing criminal damage."</font></ul>
<P>
The amendment relates to elderly people giving their consent and being informed. I am slightly worried because many elderly people will not want to feel under moral pressure to have anything to do with the person who caused them such anguish. They do not want to receive a letter of apology. Will the offender know the address to which the letter is sent? If he does reparative work, how much contact will that involve between the offender who caused the grief and the elderly victim?
<P>
The Minister understands my point. Before we get too enthusiastic about such new concepts, which are good in themselves, we should take stock and question the Minister further.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): The amendments would create an unnecessary tier of bureaucracy and introduce delay into an important process. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath referred to the Thames Valley police work on reparation orders. The diversion unit in my constituency has also had practical experience of operating them.
<P>
I wish to refer to an example that relates to the issues covered by the amendments. Two boys aged 11 and 12 were referred to the diversion unit after committing offences of criminal damage. They were well known in their area. They went into a church in Northamptonshire carrying water in plastic cartons and they threw it about. They took Bibles outside, threw them and broke the stained-glass windows. They also used a slingshot to fire stones at the windows and broke one of considerable historical interest. The total cost of the damage was more than 2,000. The boys then went to the local women's institute hall and broke windows and crockery.
<P>
The boys had not thought through the consequences of their actions. However, through the work of the diversion unit, they started to appreciate the damage that they had caused and its cost. They decided that they wanted to make reparation and the work that was organised involved their doing work in the church grounds. They also made a payment and bought a children's Bible as a gesture of reconciliation to the church. At the women's institute, many of whose members are likely to be over 65, they carried out work in the garden and offered to replace the crockery that they had smashed. They were cautioned by the police and, most important, they have not re-offended.
[Ms Sally Keeble]
<P>
That case highlights two features that are relevant to this group of amendments. The first is the positive attitude of victims towards reparations. Much of the work of the diversion unit involved reparation orders, and 76 per cent. of the victims were extremely satisfied or satisfied with its work. Many had direct contact with the offenders. I noticed that Conservative Members did not provide any figures on the attitudes of victims towards offenders and making reparations. In this case, the figures showed that 76 per cent. were satisfied with the outcome of the diversion unit and 63 per cent. preferred it to the court process, so it was obviously valued.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is wrong to erect artificial barriers as suggested in amendment No. 265, which also assumes that the ages of all victims can be identified. In the case of the Women's Institute and the Church, from whom would the written consent be obtained, given that several people might be over the specified age?
<P>
Amendment No. 265 and the later amendment No. 266 deal with the issue of speed. A diversion unit typically takes three months from the beginning to the end of the process to deal with young people, which is part of the nature of this type of work. The Opposition's amendments would potentially limit it, so I hope that they will be withdrawn and that the Committee will accept the clause.
<P>
Finally, to give a plug for my local area, I also hope that the Government will look favourably on the bid of the diversion unit to pilot some of the measures set out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and, more particularly, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. I shall not repeat his point which was made with enormous eloquence, but I want the Minister to respond to it.
<P>
The Thames Valley police experiments on restorative justice led to its chief constable, Charles Pollard, visiting the House to meet Conservative Back Benchers with an interest in home affairs. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and other colleagues were present as well as myself. At that meeting, I expressed grave concerns similar to those expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough today. The Thames Valley chief constable gave various assurances about the way in which the force was trying to operate restorative justice and said that elderly people would always have the option not to get involved in it.
<P>
However, I am worried that the Government's reparation orders are once again seeking to institutionalise a practice that, like so much of what the Government are doing, may have a worthy motive but has grave dangers. Elderly people are particularly likely to be worried for the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough.
<P>
There was a sequel to the Thames Valley chief constable's visit to the House. Within a few weeks of his reassurances, I had a constituency surgery case a painful case, the details of which it would not be right to discuss today in which restorative justice had been used, but my constituents felt that it was inappropriate and they were deeply unhappy about it, although they praised the work of the police.
<P>
It is difficult for me to explain without going into details my constituents would not want me to precisely why it was inappropriate. However, I could see immediately that it was inappropriate and I wrote at once to the Thames Valley chief constable. Unusually because although my constituency is not in the Thames Valley area, the offender was it was investigated by Thames Valley police. My constituents are probably the only ones with experience of restorative justice, but I have to say that it was a disastrous experience for them and it reinforced my anxieties.
<P>
I shall write to the Minister later with the painful details of the case so he will have an opportunity to respond by letter. I appreciate that my caution this morning limits his scope for a detailed reply. An inspector in the chief constable's office informed me that the chief superintendent responsible for restorative justice would examine the facts. I wrote back asking if the chief constable was to be made aware of that, given the concerns expressed to him during his visit to the House.
<P>
I hope that I will be able to exchange correspondence with the Minister before the Bill is reported so that he can take into account my constituents' concerns. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) made some serious points about reparation, especially for the elderly. I hope that the Minister will examine those points and take account of them in guidance that he may give or amendments that he may table on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful for hon. Members' contributions, which have injected practicality into the proceedings. I was interested to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) describe a particular case, because I met representatives from the women's institute and the church at a meeting in Northampton.
<P>
In that case, different youngsters were dealt with in different ways, as appropriate to their backgrounds and circumstancs. The church and the women's institute were enthusiastic about that. They engaged with the fact that youngsters in their community had done enormous harm, damaging the confidence of people in the community. The reparation process gave the church and the women's institute an opportunity to speak out about that behaviour. They could be certain that their expressions of hurt were heard by the offenders.
<P>
Cases will remain in which things go wrong. However, we want to keep such cases to a minimum. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath said that he supported the general principle of reparation, but that he wants to ensure that it is not used in inappropriate circumstances. I would be happy for him to write to me with the example that he mentioned. Indeed, examples of things going wrong should be drawn out so that guidance and the exchange of good practice can minimise such problems.
<P>
I discussed with chief constable Charles Pollard the willingness of Thames Valley police to extend boundaries and to take risks to find out whether measures would work. In genral, those measures have worked. We can learn from successes and from failures that is the approach taken by the chief constable. It is surprising that more things have not gone wrong, given the newness of the scheme. It has been surprisingly successful and has been largely welcomed by victims.
<P>
I welcome the conversion of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and his support for the reparation order. I cannot resist reminding him that he voted against it on many occasions when, as the Opposition party, we moved it in amendments in Committee and on the Floor of the House. The inclusion of reparation in the order and in other kinds of sentence, such as supervision, should become an underlying principle of our criminal justice system and, more particularly, of our youth justice system
<P>
Individual victims are not always involved, as our debate has illustrated. That highlights problems in the principles set out in the amendments.
<P>
I will respond to the hon. Member for Hertsmere by saying that a range of orders will simplify matters. A single order with the title of a supervision order under which are grouped a variety of alternatives would not make it clear to the offender, to the victim and to the wider community what has happened as a result of the court's decision. Circumstances may arise in which various matters must be dealt with over an extended period. That is when the longer supervision order is appropriate. We want to give a range of options to the court that can be understood by the wider public.
<P>
I understand the points that the hon. Member for Hertsmere is making in the amendments and I have some sympathy with them. It is entirely right that the victim should be informed of the court's decision. That can be dealt with by guidance. Individuals will have been consulted about the possibility of reparation, and it is entirely right to report the court's decision to them
<P>
I want to reflect on the matter of written consent for those over 65. In guidance, we may suggest that written consent is appropriate in most, if not all, cases, rather than limiting it to over-65s. The underlying principle is that we believe that those who are vulnerable, such as elderly people, women living on their own and so on, should be dealt with sensitively. Risks as well as the positive benefits of making a reparation order should be assessed. I accept the serious point that the hon. Member for Hertsmere makes and hope that he agrees that we should deal with the matter in guidance rather than in the Bill.
<P>
The test will be whether re-offending occurs, which will be assessed over time. Another test will be the satisfaction of victims. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North said, we are allowing victims to feel involved and important in the process. That point has been reinforced by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I hope that he agrees that having had a useful debate to clarify the issue, it would not be appropriate to include the amendments in the Bill.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It has been a useful debate and I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their contribution. I was grateful for the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough on the point that I made about elderly people. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath spoke fairly about cases going wrong. Things go wrong under any system and we need to bear in mind what happens when they do.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his response. He has accepted the underlying concern that motivates the amendments. We are worried about elderly people and the Minister fairly mentioned others who might be vulnerable, such as ladies living on their own. We hope that the Government's guidance will reflect those concerns. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 262, in page 50, line 14, leave out from "proposes" to end of line 19, and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to pass on him a custodial sentence.
<P>
(4A) Subject to subsection (4) above a court may make a reparation order under subsection (2) above instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way".
<P>
We now come to the cashing-in time on my point about flexibility of sentences. The Government have introduced reparation in the Bill in a way that will make it difficult, if not impossible, to combine it with other sentences when a reparation order is made. I appreciate that we shall later discuss action-plan orders and supervision orders when reparation can be ordered as part of the sentence. We think that it might have been better in the first place to allow other non-custodial sentences to be combined with reparation orders.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Michael:</B> I wonder whether I can help the hon. Gentleman. Reparation in one form or another will be available as a part of each of the orders listed in clause 63(4)(b). There should, therefore, be no need for the courts to make a separate reparation order when one of those other orders has been made. The hon. Gentleman's objective, with which I concur, that reparation should be combined with other disposals is allowed for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. If I have misunderstood, I shall be happy to take the matter no further.
<P>
I have a particular concern that I have not yet mentioned. I agree with the Minister that reparation can be included under a supervision order or an action plan order. Clause 63(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court shall not make a reparation order in respect of the offender if it proposes 
<P>
(a) to pass on him a custodial sentence"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then goes on to list the various orders. Therefore, if a reparation order is made, one of the other non-custodial sentences cannot be combined with it at the same time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I see what has led the hon. Gentleman to that conclusion. We are saying that a reparation order should be used only when it is necessary to have a narrow order rather than a wide one. The effect is the[Mr. Michael]
same. I shall be happy to outline it in writing if that would help the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate the Minister's courtesy about that, but there are two sentences that I draw to his attention.
