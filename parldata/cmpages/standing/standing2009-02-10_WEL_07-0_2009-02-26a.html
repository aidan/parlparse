Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): Amendment 70 seeks to deal with the
situation in which all the services are not totally devolved. In the
case that I quoted of someone going to university, it obviously made
great sense for direct payments from the health authority, the local
authority and the university to be put in one pot to provide a service.
That worked out cheaper in the end, and also meant that only one group
of people was looking after his needs. I welcome what the Government
are
planning.</div><a name="09022678000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022678000245"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): The hon. Gentleman
outlined a particular constituency case of his in which a great deal of
effort was taken to get organisations working together. One of my
concerns stems from a point that was raised during an evidence session
in which Paul Davies specifically talked about the difficulties that
his organisation had had in integrating Access to Work funding. He said
that the officials that he works with in the Department for Work and
Pensions</div><a name="09022678000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;worked
their socks off to make it
work.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Welfare Reform
Public Bill Committee, </i>10 February 2009;  c. 8,
Q4.]</div><a name="09022678000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
there was no lack of desire to make it work. It was simply that within
the rules and regulations, it could not be done. That is why I want to
ensure that the Bill gives Ministers the power to set the regulations
so that officials, despite wanting to make it work, are not hamstrung
by rules and regulations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div><a name="09022678000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000246"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There are two
scenarios. In the previous clause, we dealt with a situation in which
an authority is not willing to allow direct payments to be introduced.
When it comes to clause 29, where we are talking about relevant
services, the question is how we ensure that the various packages are
available. As I have said, the process will not be appropriate for
everyone&#151;not everyone will want to access direct
payments&#151;but we must ensure that where there are circumstances
in which someone needs to do something, the Minister, through the
pilots and hopefully on to the general, has the wherewithal to ensure
that that happens. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09022678000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000247"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan
Shaw):</b> I thank the hon. Members for Forest of Dean and for
Rochdale for raising these issues. There is a consensual spirit on the
right to control. By talking about his constituent going to university,
the hon. Member for Rochdale gave us a helpful illustration of the
benefits that people could derive from such a scheme. He advised me in
the margins that his constituent is now in his second year, and we wish
him every success. The hon. Gentleman showed us how the measure can be
practically applied, and the difference that it can make. His
constituent is now in the driving seat; he is the one with the power.
That may have been inconceivable only a few years ago, when we focused
on what the producer provided. Public policy has shifted, and now there
is a consensus that we want to empower the individual.</div>
<a name="09022678000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talked why social care was not on the face of the Bill. I
will come to that point later, but it is important to note that he
talked about the primary care trust, which is about the health budget,
rather than the social care budget that goes to the local authorities.
I will explain later what we are doing about that. One can envisage its
being easy to identify particular parts of a health budget that an
individual is receiving. For example, one can see how chiropody
services could be personalised. Dialysis, on the other hand, might be
more difficult. I am talking here about providing that service to a
particular community. The hon. Gentleman and I had a discussion about
that outside the Committee. If a dialysis operation is to be economic,
the number of people receiving the operation must be sufficient to
allow expertise to be built up. I think people can understand the
practical differences. That is why the Health Bill, which is now
passing through the House of Lords, will provide opportunities for
those pilots. In comparison with social care, it is a little less
tangible and a bit more difficult to identify particular funding
streams within the PCT budgets that one can put into a right to control
individualised budgets.</div>
<a name="09022678000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
experience in relation to social care. The hon. Member for Forest of
Dean mentioned the pilots that we have already undertaken and we have
had some evaluation of those, which in the main has been positive. It
is not the promised land for everyone and we should not get too heady
and think that this is the solution for every single one of our
constituents, because it is not. In the pilots, a number of elderly
people in particular found it difficult to manage such budgets. We
perhaps need to find other ways to ensure that they are still in the
vanguard in terms of shaping services. Again, there is a consensus in
terms of public policy that that is what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>we want to do. So there is provision within existing legislation that
allows us to direct for personal social care budgets. It is important
for me to get some points on the record. Those were the immediate
issues that arose from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution, but I
will make some further detailed remarks. Of course, I would welcome any
interventions from hon.
Members.</div><a name="09022678000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned in the evidence that I gave on 12 February, to which the
hon. Member for Forest of Dean referred, the exclusion of community
care in the Bill is to ensure that we do not duplicate or cause
confusion with existing powers. The Bill makes provision for disabled
adults and therefore excludes community care and other care services
that apply to people under the age of 18, as we discussed this morning.
Disabled children have different needs.</div>
<a name="09022678000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legislation
relating to community care services is defined in the National Health
Service and Community Care Act 1990, which is an Act that I remember
well because I was completing my training as a social worker at that
time. Indeed, an interesting parallel between that piece of legislation
and the Bill is that there is a political consensus. That bodes well
for the people who are recipients of services. However, although we
celebrate some consensus in terms of ensuring that the services are
better delivered and of a higher quality for our constituents, it is
important to remember that the Bill does not suit everyone. One of the
criticisms of the 1990 Act was that there was perhaps too much of a
consensus and not enough questions were asked&#151;the hon. Gentlemen
may consider that an
invitation.</div><a name="09022678000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government set out their vision of the personalisation of public
services generally in the cross-government concordat, &#147;Putting
People First&#148;. Local Authority Circular DH/2008/1 set out what
that would mean specifically for adult social care. It
states:</div><a name="09022678000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Everyone,
with support if necessary, will be able to design services around their
own needs, within a clear personal financial
allocation&#148;.</div><a name="09022678000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circular recognises that</div>
<a name="09022678000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;With
self-directed support, people are able to design the support or care
arrangements that best suit their specific
needs&#148;.</div><a name="09022678000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circular also sets out the system of personal budgets that will deliver
choice and, importantly, control. The changes detailed in that local
authority circular mirror the changes that the Bill sets out in order
to achieve better public services. The right to control and the current
changes to the delivery of adult social care will together enable the
implementation of the Government&#146;s commitment to empower
disabled people, and ensure that choice and control are recognised as a
right.</div><a name="09022678000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000248"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The Minister refers rightly to the steps that were
taken in the adult social care area in relation to personal budgets and
direct payments. One of the striking facts&#151;I know he is aware of
this&#151;that came through in the evidence that we had from Paul
Davies from Oldham metropolitan borough council was that of the 1.75
million people across the country who use adult care services, only
10,000 have a personal budget. The Minister is quite right: a personal
budget, and the direct payments that may or may not go with it, is not
the solution for everyone. However, only 10,000 people out of that 1.75
million have a personal budget, the evidence shows the benefit to many
people of having one, and fully one fifth of those 10,000 people were
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>Oldham. So, with the legislation that is already in place and the
welcome concordat that he discussed, does he think that we are going at
the pace whereby, although those disabled people may never want to use
the right, they will have the right&#151;that those who want to use
it will genuinely be able to exercise it under the current legislative
arrangements?</div><a name="09022678000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000249"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely reasonable
point. My constituents have individualised budgets, and I was speaking
to a constituent recently. He fired his carers and got some new ones,
whom he has had for the past 18 months and for whom he is full of
praise. That is inconceivable for the majority of people who will not
be in that advantageous position, so I say to all local authorities
that if they can get on with such work, they should. A balance must
always be struck, because there is a consensus around devolving power,
and around authorities making those decisions for the people whom they
represent, while the Government work in partnership with
them.</div>
<a name="09022678000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale talked about the PCT and health budgets, and the
hon. Member for Forest of Dean referred to the Access to Work budgets
and to the budgets for disabled children, so there is quite a lot going
on. By finding out what works best, we shall be in a strong position to
show the overall picture. If we do not play our part and adopt the
approach that we have advocated, things will happen more slowly. We do
not want example after example of the cases to which the hon. Member
for Rochdale referred; we want everyone&#151;not just local
authorities, but disabled people and their organisations&#151;to be
very clear about the situation. I shall talk more about the health
budgets in a minute.</div>
<a name="09022678000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000250"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The Minister referred to the balance between
directing local authorities to do things and giving them the powers,
and we touched on it during the evidence-taking sessions. He is quite
right that there is an emerging consensus around the importance of
localism, but that is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. It
is about whether we believe that if central Government give local
authorities more control, individuals will receive better services,
because that is the end goal. It is all very well giving local
authorities the powers to do things, but if disabled people want
something to happen but the local authority is not very keen to get on
with it, we must ensure that the disabled person gets the powers and
the local authority does not stand in the way. How does the Minister
think that the balance will be best achieved, remembering that the goal
is to benefit the citizen, not necessarily the local
authority?</div>
<a name="09022678000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000251"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is the
consumer&#146;s interests not the producer&#146;s that I have at
heart, but we believe that instituting pilots for the different funding
streams will give us a better picture, so that all the arrangements
that one can envisage being available to everyone in a few
years&#146; time will be available more completely and readily. I do
not go to the Department every morning thinking, &#147;How can I stop
this measure?&#148; and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that;
I go to the Department to work with my colleagues across Government to
deliver it as quickly and speedily as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>possible, but with the complete picture, so that we do not experience
the frustrations that the hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned.</div>
<a name="09022678000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to talk about health budgets, but they are separate from
social care budgets. We should also accept that the way that we
organise society and the institutions that provide such services are
not really the preoccupation of our constituents: the
consumer, the individual, the citizen&#151;call them whatever you
want. Their preoccupation is how they live their lives, the care and
support that they receive and access to employment or college, for
example; they rely on a number of different
services.</div><a name="09022678000218"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09022678000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
we want flexibility to be available through a range of services, and
that means exploring options available in many areas. The Department of
Health is currently introducing legislation to pilot health budgets
that will allow people to take direct payments, with patients being
given a budget to manage themselves, with regulations providing clear
guidelines. That is important. Personal health budget money may be
spent, for example, on social care where it is likely to improve health
or well-being. I think that all Committee members would support
that.</div><a name="09022678000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the right-to-control trailblazers we will be exploring the more
flexible use of funding streams, too. People will be able to have more
choice and control over how they achieve their outcomes. We will be
looking for alignment or collocation with other similar pilots, such as
on individual budgets for children and health budgets. We hope to
present as seamless a provision of services as possible for
people&#151;for the customer&#151;receiving social care direct
payments, personal health budgets and a right to control
services.</div><a name="09022678000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000252"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I am grateful for what the Minister just said. Will
he seek to ensure that some of these pilots are coterminous with the
health
pilots?</div><a name="09022678000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000253"></a>Jonathan
Shaw:</b> Yes, we will, most certainly. We will be piloting
personal health budgets at the end of 2009 until 2012 and the aim is to
build on the success of the social care individual budgets to give
people greater choice and control over the money
spent.</div><a name="09022678000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Personal
health budgets could work in many ways, which could include having a
notional budget held by the commissioner or a budget managed on behalf
of the patient or by a third party. That is an interesting point in
respect of children and those people who need a power of attorney, such
as someone who has dementia, in which case the budget could be run by
the family rather than the state. Safeguards are needed there, too,
because there are advocacy issues to consider. It does not always
follow that a family will act in the best interests of their
relative&#151;I am sure that we are all aware of such cases. In the
vast majority of cases, of course, that is not so, but we have to
safeguard against such
eventualities.</div><a name="09022678000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Primary
care trusts already have extensive powers to offer such provisions, but
we will be seeking powers in the Health Bill to allow the pilot for
direct payments for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>health care. To date, PCTs have used existing powers to create personal
health budgets in relatively few cases, which bears out the comments
made by the hon. Gentleman. Those that have done so have demonstrated
that they can be
successful.</div><a name="09022678000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
on how the pilots for personal health budgets link with the
right-to-control trailblazers, we will be exploring whether at least
some of the right-to-control trailblazer sites can be collocated, as
the hon. Gentleman asks, in selected pilot areas. It would be folly to
miss that opportunity and the hon. Gentleman would be correct to say so
if we did. We will certainly do
that.</div><a name="09022678000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
social care and other direct payments be pooled with personal health
budgets? We hope to present as seamless a provision of services as
possible for people receiving social care and other direct payments and
personal health budgets, and those things should be pooled as far as is
practical and legally possible. Doing so may require some level of
auditing.</div><a name="09022678000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. I welcome
the opportunity to put what I have said on the record. I invite the
hon. Gentleman to ask leave to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000254"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> This has been a useful debate. I am grateful to
the Minister for his assurances about the pilots. I urge him to do more
than just commit to looking into this, and to ensure that at least some
of the pilots use all the different funding streams, not just personal
health budgets, and that we wrap in the pilots that the Department for
Children, Schools and Families is conducting, and try to get them all
working together.</div>
<a name="09022678000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point
is seamlessness. In response to a question from the hon. Member for

he said that, in the experience of the metropolitan borough
council,</div>
<a name="09022678000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where one is
able to integrate those funding streams into that single delivery
vehicle, wrapped around the individual, with that individual having

things out, and not always

streams, is to make things seamless for individuals, so that they can
live their lives in the way that they want to live them, rather than
trying to fit them into departmental silos. However, the test is
whether that can be done without making the system so complex that it
either costs an extraordinary amount of money to manage, and we have to
put lots of money into administration instead of service delivery, or
simply breaks down and does not work. If it is too complicated, all the
organisations that have the power to deliver what is required might
find that so hard that none of them will do it, in which case millions
of the people who could benefit from the system might be in a similar
position to those in adult social care, relatively few of whom have had
the chance to access such opportunities.</div>
<a name="09022678000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has made it clear that his plan is to work closely with other
Departments on the pilots and to ensure that there is proper
integration and that lessons are learned. With that in mind, my final
comment to him is that if it becomes clear, shortly after the pilots
have started running, that things work, we should not necessarily run
them to full length before rolling out the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>system. In those circumstances, it would be useful to take stock and see
whether we can move earlier than that. Given those assurances, I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000255"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 79, in
clause 31, page 38, line 21, at
end insert</div> <a name="0902274000002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;including, in
particular, making arrangements with voluntary organisations to provide
disabled persons with assistance in connection with direct
payments.&#146;.</div><a name="09022678000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause gives Ministers the power to make provision enabling the
exercise of greater choice and control, so it is one of the excellent
clauses that relates to the very thick book containing all the
regulation-making powers that was produced by the Minister for
Employment and Welfare during Tuesday&#146;s sitting. The amendment
responds to the concern that has been expressed about people receiving
direct payment to spend themselves, and whether they are receiving
appropriate advice and support on how to manage that money correctly.
That concern was expressed by Liz Sayce, the chief executive of the
Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, during an evidence
sitting, and by RADAR in its brief to the Committee.</div>
<a name="09022678000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have recognised the need for peer support and advice on
managing direct payments, and there are other options if people do not
want to receive their individual budgets as direct payments. The report
of the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit, &#147;Improving the
life chances of disabled people&#148;, included a commitment to
having a user-led organisation in every local area by 2010. I
understand that we are quite a long way off that target and, given that
2010 is not a long time away, it might help if the Under-Secretary of
State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Glasgow, North, updated us on
progress towards getting those user-led organisations in every local
area. The Department of Health has carried out some capacity-building
programmes, but it would be very helpful if the Minister gave us an
idea of how many local authorities have a good user-led organisation
that people can access for advice on how to use their direct
payments.</div><a name="09022678000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand from the briefing material supplied by RADAR that the
availability of support and information can make a huge difference in
the take-up of direct payments. There is a direct correlation between
take-up and the availability of
support.</div><a name="09022678000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Ministers have suggested, people who have not used an individual budget
and a direct payment before may have many questions about how to spend
the money, and whether they really want to take on the responsibility,
perhaps of employing people directly. Actually, learning from people
who have done that successfully about creativity and the different
solutions that one can come up with is helpful. As RADAR has
stated:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div><a name="09022678000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Being
able to access quality support services&#151;be they to broker
services or manage payroll&#151;will in many cases make the
difference between someone feeling able to take a direct payment and
just feeling it could all be too much
hassle.&#148;</div><a name="09022678000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Under-Secretary outline where we are in respect of user-led
organisations in local areas? What further steps will the Government
take to roll out such services, specifically as part of the pilot, and
will Ministers ensure that peer support and advice are there to help
people to make the best use of their individual budget and direct
payments? If she could reassure the Committee on those issues, it would
be
helpful.</div><a name="09022678000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000256"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I support the amendment. We have talked a great
deal about the provision of quality services and how some things are
not appropriate for everyone, which will always remain the case.
However, pilots provide the Government with a unique opportunity to
trial various models of operation, which, in our view, might include
some independent support to enable the transition. I very much hope
that the Government will look at different models when they design the
pilots.</div><a name="09022678000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an officer in Rochdale who is employed by Manchester and Rochdale
councils jointly. His job is to get direct payments out to people, and
he spends a great deal of his time advising and supporting individuals.
An alternative appropriate model might involve voluntary organisations.
In some towns, there are many groups that might take on such work
collectively. If something like that could be included in the pilots,
it would go a long way towards ensuring that this initiative will be
the success that we all want it to
be.</div><a name="09022678000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000257"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> I welcome the debate on the amendment, which
has raised important points about engagement with the voluntary
organisations that have been central to moving the right-to-control
agenda forward over the past few
years.</div><a name="09022678000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
31 contains powers that will deliver real choice and control for
disabled people. It enables regulations to be brought forward that will
allow disabled people to require an assessment of the amount used to
provide a service, and to require that the authority consults them on
how that money is used. This is intended to deliver our White Paper
commitment to increase choice and control for disabled people in
decisions about how public money is spent to meet their needs and
aspirations.</div><a name="09022678000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commitment was informed by responses to consultation and by advice
received from disabled people and their associated voluntary
organisations, which made it clear that the right to take a direct
payment, which currently exists for those eligible for adult social
care services in England, is not, by itself, sufficient to give people
more choice and
control.</div><a name="09022678000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the amendment is permissive, it would signal a firm intention to make
such regulations with regard to voluntary organisations. We believe
that the right to control should be widely accessible, and, as has been
mentioned in Committee, that means that there has to be the provision
of adequate advice and brokerage services. That will be an important
consideration during the trailblazer project. Such services are also an
important part of the implementation of Putting People First, our
policy in England, and that will support the transformation of adult
social care.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="09022678000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the important role that the voluntary sector can play. The report,
&#147;Improving the life chances of disabled people&#148;, which
was published in 2005, clearly recommended improving the availability
of advice and advocacy services, and it put an emphasis on the role of
organisations that are led and controlled by disabled
people.</div><a name="09022678000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can confirm that the report set out a commitment that, by 2010, there
should be a user-led organisation in every locality in
England&#151;locality being defined as an area covered by a council
with social services responsibility. My understanding is that that
timetable remains in
place</div><a name="09022678000219"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09022678000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">User-led
organisations are key both to delivering personalisation and achieving
independent living. The Health Department in England is investing
&#163;1.65 million in ULO development funds to support the
development of up to 25 action and learning sites. Such sites will
share best practice with organisations interested in becoming a ULO, or
in supporting the development of one in another local authority
area.</div><a name="09022678000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
action and learning sites will focus on developing ways of becoming
organisations that meet the life chances recommendation, and they will
share that learning with other groups across the country.</div>
<a name="09022678000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Rochdale
made the important point that it is not a case of one size fits all,
and that it is important to consider different models. Moreover, we
have to remember that disabled people will not always wish to look to a
voluntary organisation to support their use of direct payments. In the
evaluation of the Department of Health-led individual budgets, it was
found that many participants took the opportunity to involve their
family and friends in deciding how to spend their budget to meet their
outcomes. As we develop the personal health budgets pilots, we are
placing an emphasis on avoiding prescription with regard to how
information and support service are provided. We will be following that
model for these particular
provisions.</div><a name="09022678000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Key
principles in developing the right to control are consultation and
co-production. We want public authorities to take the initiative in
provision. We want to engage with local expertise to apply as much of
that as possible to the provision of advice and information that we
give. That is why I am keen for legislation to avoid setting out
prescription.</div><a name="09022678000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000258"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Before the Minister concludes her speech, may I
take her back to the point from the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy
unit report? She mentioned that the timetable to have a user-led
organisation in each area, which she clarified as one that is served by
a council with a social services function, is still on course to
achieve its target of 2010. I did not hear the update on how many areas
there are and how many have user-led organisations. How many milestones
have we passed on the way to 2010? Alternatively, will everything
happen at the back end of the process?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="09022678000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000259"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I will provide the hon. Gentleman with an update
on that before the end of the Bill&#146;s consideration in Committee.
I do not have the information with me today, but I will make
arrangements to ensure that we can provide it for
him.</div>
<a name="09022678000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000260"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance.
It would be very acceptable to receive the information before the
Committee rises.</div>
<a name="09022678000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
happy with what I heard. Part of the reason for tabling this amendment
was to get a sense of how Ministers envisaged voluntary organisations
providing such advice and support. The Minister said that the
Government believed that voluntary organisations had a clear role, but
she said that there should not be a prescription that people should
have to use them. I just wanted to ensure that the provision was in
place. As she said&#151;and I know that this has been the case with a
number of people to whom I have spoken&#151;some people decide things
for themselves, some talk to friends and family, some take advice from
the local authority, some use voluntary organisations, and some have
used all those sources to put together a package. We must ensure that
such flexibility remains. None the less, if people want to take
advantage of advice, there should be an organisation in place to
provide it. Given the Minister&#146;s assurances, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000263"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> One or two of the amendments in the group are on
separate subjects, but amendment 80 is the one on which I want to
focus. The amendment effectively rewrites a provision of clause 31, and
I give credit to RADAR for providing the wording. This probing
amendment was tabled to enable us to have a useful discussion about the
thinking of Ministers in the Bill, as compared with in the White Paper.
The amendment would turn around the measures setting out what an
authority will provide for a disabled person so that the disabled
person would be in control and the organisations would be effectively
serving the disabled person&#146;s needs, rather than the other way
around.</div>
<a name="09022678000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
behind tabling the amendment is that the policy intention in the White
Paper was very much a system of individual budgets, based on
self-directed support, with which the disabled person would have
options for exercising greater choice and control, including, but not
limited to, the receipt of direct payments. I concur with RADAR that
clauses 31 and 32 more closely resemble a request just to get a direct
payment and do not go towards providing self-directed support. Clause
31(2)(a) states that the local authority will &#147;carry out an
assessment&#148; of the disabled person&#146;s needs, which
suggests that the old model will be followed in which the professionals
will tell the disabled person what their needs are, rather than the
disabled person carrying out their own assessment and saying what they
need. The White Paper said that the intention of the right to control
was to reflect that the disabled person was the expert in their life,
so surely clause 31 should reflect that intention. The purpose of the
amendment is therefore to turn around the power so that the assumption
is that the disabled person is at the centre, that they will assess
what they need and that the authority&#146;s job will be to help them
in doing that&#151;that would be very much putting the disabled
person at the centre.</div>
<a name="09022678000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The White Paper also said that
disabled people would be told their resource allocation&#151;either
the resources available to be paid to them directly, or the resources
spent on providing services to them&#151;up front, but the measures
in the Bill simply enable the disabled person to require authorities to
provide that information. In my view, the disabled person should not
have to do anything to trigger notification, and the authority should
provide that information as a matter of course. The amendment is
important because clause 31 will be used to set out the
pilots&#151;when we get to the pilot section of the Bill, we will see
that this framework will be used to run those pilots. If we are to
learn as much as possible from the pilots, it is important that they
should be set up as we want the system to work, and as the White Paper
said that it should, which is to put the disabled person at the heart
of the arrangement, rather than having local authorities deciding what
is going on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div><a name="09022678000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apropos the
discussion that we have had about making sure that these things happen
and that more people use the service, the benefit of amending the
clause would be to tell the disabled person that they have the right to
decide what they need and to make their own assessment, and that the
relevant organisations have to support them. That would put pressure in
the system, from the bottom up, enabling disabled people to say,
&#147;I can organise things better myself,&#148; and to pull local
authorities with them. With sensible direction from the Government
above&#151;the Minister has laid out the direction of
travel&#151;as well as such pressure from below, the amendment would
make the Bill better able to help disabled people who want to control
services to do so, and we would move further and faster, which would be
welcome.</div>
<a name="09022678000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
today&#146;s purposes, amendment 80 and the two consequential
amendments are probing, so I do not intend to press them to a Division,
but I would like the Under-Secretary to think about what the White
Paper said about disabled people being at the centre. I would also like
her to think about whether the clause does that and whether the
Government should move an amendment on Report to make that
change.</div><a name="09022678000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
26 refers specifically
to</div><a name="09022678000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person with a disability caused by mental health
problems&#148;.</div><a name="09022678000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not going to press that amendment to a Division either, because its
purpose is to elicit from Ministers an explicit undertaking that when
we talk about disabled people, we do mean not only those with a
physical disability, but those with a mental health problem and those
with a learning disability, whom the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley
and others have mentioned. We should be explicit and encompass everyone
with a disability so that it is clear to disabled people themselves and
to the various authorities that we mean the measure to apply to
everybody. Interestingly, the move towards individual budgets and
direct payments was started as a result of parents of children with
learning disabilities feeling that the provision of services was not up
to scratch. I know that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley has been
championing the cause of those with learning disabilities throughout
our proceedings but, in fact, it was the parents of children with
learning disabilities who kicked a lot of this off. It would therefore
be welcome if we made sure that there was an explicit commitment from
Ministers that people with learning disabilities and those with mental
health concerns were explicitly included in this
process.</div><a name="09022678000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other matter to which I wish to draw attention is the one that we
briefly touched on earlier. Amendment 45, which, if I may say, is
elegantly drafted, is better placed in this group. It would ensure that
relevant authorities and services had a duty to co-operate. I know that
the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Chatham and Aylesford, is keen for that to take place. In the evidence
session, he said in that local authorities were at different stages. He
also set out the direction of travel and said that the Government
wanted local authorities to work together. The amendment would make it
explicit that the duty to co-operate was there. Again, I do not intend
to press the amendment to a Division, but the Under-Secretary of State
for Scotland, the hon. Member for Glasgow, North, needs to say whether
she thinks that the powers already in the Bill put sufficient pressure
on local authorities and primary care trusts, which the hon. Member for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>Rochdale mentioned, to ensure that they work together to try to deliver
a seamless provision. It would be most welcome if the Minister could
reassure the Committee about that.</div>
<a name="09022678000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000264"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Again, I support the sentiments of the hon. Member
for Forest of Dean. In many respects, there is all-party agreement on
this aspect of the Bill, and we all want to see it work. I particularly
want to focus on amendment 26 because mental health and learning
disability issues are important. It is acknowledged that people
suffering from mental health problems suffer, and feel that they
suffer, discrimination, perhaps in terms of getting a job and so on.
The Bill is designed to do something to help to alleviate
that.</div><a name="09022678000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
developing the powers for direct payments, it is important that the
needs of that particular group and those individuals are not forgotten,
although I am sure that that will not happen. However, when we consider
the pilots, perhaps certain individuals and organisations could be
worked with to ensure that a pilot specifically targets children with
learning difficulties, or people with mental health problems, so that
we can see how the measures will work out, because their needs are
different from those of people with a physical
disability.</div><a name="09022678000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000265"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I welcome the debate, which raises important
issues about how we think that the provisions on right to control will
operate.</div><a name="09022678000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I will deal with amendments 80 to 82, which would substantially
restructure the aspect of clause 31 dealing with the powers to give
greater choice and control and remove particular powers relating to
direct payments. The amended version of the clauses would actually set
out a more rigid structure for the right to control than that in the
Bill. Amendment 80 would make clause 31 less flexible. The amendment
assumes that the disabled person, in all cases, could be proactive,
whereas clause 31 allows for other
circumstances.</div><a name="09022678000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has always been our intention that a disabled person accessing the
right will be at the centre of the process and that they will have a
range of options for how support is delivered. We recognise that
disabled people are experts in their own needs and how they are best
met. Self-assessment and self-directed support are therefore essential
to the right of control. We believe that we need to take a bottom-up
approach, and to work closely with disabled people, public authorities
and other stakeholders to achieve that. We certainly do not see this as
a top-down
process.</div><a name="09022678000220"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09022678000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments do not capture some of the vital aspects of right to
control. They would not allow the outcomes of the service to be agreed,
in partnership, between the authority and the individual. That
partnership is important, because it means that the individual has
choice and control over support, but that resources are available to
meet a set of agreed outcomes. The local authority remains ultimately
responsible for the statutory outcome and can provide further
assistance or security if required. We certainly do not see local
authorities making the primary direction&#151;this is about them
working with disabled people.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div><a name="09022678000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the amendments would remove many of the powers that make the
framework for direct payments. Without clause 32(2), we would have no
express power to specify in regulations how and when direct payments
should be made. We would also not have an express power to make
regulations about when a request for a direct payment should be
complied with. I think that it is important to be up front about the
fact that circumstances will be
prescribed.</div><a name="09022678000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we would normally expect a request for a direct payment to be granted,
there might be certain exceptional circumstances in which a providing
authority could reasonably challenge that expectation. We have
committed to consulting on what the circumstances will be, but they
might include cases where a person has deliberately misused a previous
cash payment. Without the express power to make regulations or to issue
guidance, we would risk creating confusion about what was intended by
the direct payments
legislation.</div><a name="09022678000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
framework of the right to control is deliberately broad. It is designed
to encourage innovation and to reflect our commitment to co-production.
We want the right people to design how this will work: disabled people
themselves, voluntary organisations, agencies, and authorities that
deal with these services every day. I know that the vast majority want
to ensure that the system works better for disabled people. Being too
prescriptive at this stage would mean that we would fail our commitment
to co-production and
consultation.</div><a name="09022678000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I do not support the amendments for the reasons I have stated, I am
certainly interested to hear suggestions about how the initiative could
be taken forward and how the regulation-making powers in the Bill might
be put to
use.</div><a name="09022678000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now turn to amendments 26, 27 and 45, which would have three key
effects, although it is worth pointing out that if amendment 80 were
agreed to, amendments 26 and 27 would be redundant. First, the
amendments explicitly state that individuals who have a disability
caused by a mental health problem would be covered by the right to
control. Secondly, they would introduce an explicit power to require
authorities to co-operate on delivering the right to control. Finally,
they would remove an important clarification that the right to control
will be available only in the circumstances prescribed in regulations.
I shall briefly address each of those effects in
turn.</div><a name="09022678000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
mental health, I can confirm that all disabled people who are eligible
for the services brought within right to control will be able to
exercise the right. We see it as important that people with learning
difficulties are included in the trailblazer project. The evidence
presented to us by RADAR and others highlighted the transforming
difference that choice and control over services can have for people
with mental health problems or learning disabilities. We are committed
to enabling those people to have the right to control and to ensuring
that the right is as widely accessible as
possible.</div><a name="09022678000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the right to control will apply to disabled people who receive
specified services, rather than to particular groups of disabled
people. The framework of the Bill is therefore inclusive, and I would
not wish to single out a particular group of disabled people within the
broad framework.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div><a name="09022678000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The evidence
that we heard from Paul Davies of Oldham borough council emphasised the
need for different public authorities to co-operate in providing
disabled people with greater choice and control. It is vital that
people understand all the different ways in which they can choose to
receive support. We certainly expect authorities to provide such
information, and we can issue guidance requiring them to make it clear
to disabled people what choices they have and the different ways in
which they can receive
support.</div><a name="09022678000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the trailblazer projects, we will expect public authorities to work
closely with each other, as well as with individuals and service
providers, to manage the delivery of the right, and we will carefully
monitor the effectiveness of the working
arrangements.</div><a name="09022678000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 45, we already have mechanisms in the Bill and elsewhere to
ensure that authorities work together on specific matters. Local
authorities in England and their partners are already under a duty to
co-operate in developing and acting on local area agreements that
respond to a local area&#146;s priorities. Hon. Members will
appreciate that different legislation applies to local authorities in
Wales and
Scotland.</div><a name="09022678000108"></a>

gave us. When the hon. Member for Rochdale asked
him,</div><a name="09022678000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Should
a duty to co-operate be included in the

Q22.]</div><a name="09022678000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">His
contention was that what was already in the Bill did not amount to
that. I am grateful for the Under-Secretary&#146;s clarification that
when the pilots are run, authorities of different sorts will be
encouraged to work closely together. However, will she give a
commitment that if, during those pilot schemes, it is found that the
current arrangements are not satisfactory, the Government will look
again at whether the powers need to be strengthened and whether a duty
needs to be introduced, albeit with a recognition that, as I suspect,
the authorities in the pilot areas will be those that are keenest to
make this work? The problems will probably not occur in the pilot
schemes, but will become apparent when the Government try to roll out
the provision more
widely.</div><a name="09022678000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000267"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments. We certainly would prefer people to work together in
partnership, and voluntarily, because that will give a greater level of
service and provision to disabled people. However, he is right that we
will be looking closely at the trailblazers to consider whether we need
to make further
regulations.</div><a name="09022678000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill gives us the power to provide for regulations requiring
authorities to work together on specific matters so that they share
information or vary conditions attached to financial assistance for the
purposes of the right to control under clauses 31(4) and 31(5)(b).
Clause 31(6) also contains a power to require authorities to have
regard to guidance, which will allow us to take account of the
experiences of users and authorities in the trailblazing phase and set
out further ways in which authorities should co-operate, both in
general and in particular.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div><a name="09022678000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 27
would remove the phrase &#147;in prescribed circumstances&#148;
from clause 31, thereby removing an important clarification from the
Bill. It is important for people to understand that the primary
legislation is a framework and that secondary legislation will set out
how the right should work in practice, including by clearly defining
any boundaries to the right to control. It is important that these
boundaries are referenced in the primary legislation to avoid
misleading people. I therefore have serious reservations about an
amendment that implies that we are making the right available without
limit and in all circumstances. It is not difficult to conceive of
circumstances when the right to control may not be appropriate, such as
when a service is universally
available.</div><a name="09022678000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
intend to consult fully on the regulations so that disabled people and
their organisations, providers and authorities can tell us how they
want to manage these issues. Their advice will be crucial to how we
take this matter forward. The consultations will allow us to work
together to deliver a strong, inclusive and supportive regulatory
structure. Given what I have said, I urge the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000268"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> As I said, the purpose of amendment 80 was just to
test the Government&#146;s intention and see whether they felt that
the Bill properly carried out the intention in the White Paper. I am
pleased with the hon. Lady&#146;s assurances about the
Government&#146;s intention. I welcome her suggestion about working
together on how the regulations are drafted. Perhaps a useful step
forward, as we move towards Report, might be for us to have a little
more flesh on the bones in respect of the regulations that will be made
under the powers in the clause than we have in the document that the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform gave us earlier in the week.
I should like a little more detail about how the regulations are going
to be framed. If we had that, we would be a lot clearer about the
Government&#146;s intention when we reached
Report.</div><a name="09022678000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000269"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> We will see whether that is possible. However,
the regulations also apply to Scotland and Wales, and there is a
different position with regard to local authorities, particularly in
Scotland. The powers are given to the Scottish Government and if they
want to mirror this type of trailblazer project in Scotland, they can
do so. However, it is not our intention that the Bill should prescribe
to local authorities in Scotland and Wales&#151;that is a matter for
the devolved
Administrations.</div><a name="09022678000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000270"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Given devolution, we will clearly see different
arrangements emerging in the different parts of the United Kingdom.
That is not necessarily a bad thing, because one public policy
advantage of devolved Administrations is that they give us the
opportunity to try different policies in different parts of the
country, much as in the United States, where some states are able to
try out policies to see what works. Effectively, we are being given a
pilot scheme in a particular part of the United Kingdom, and although
there are many downsides to devolution, that is at least one positive
point. Of course, everything will depend on the extent to which the
Scottish Government grasp the opportunities in the Bill, but I should
like them, and the Welsh Assembly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>Government and the Administration in Northern Ireland, to do so and to
use these opportunities to the greatest possible
extent.</div>
<a name="09022678000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000271"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I am pleased to confirm that we are working
closely with the devolved Administrations and that we have an agreement
in principle on this matter. Obviously, they are advancing at different
times, but the point of devolution is that we learn from different
experiences, and, as I said, we will leave the door open to those
Administrations to have similar pilots in their areas. However, I am
pleased to confirm that, on the general principles, we have consent
from all the devolved
Administrations.</div><a name="09022678000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000272"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> That is very gratifying news, because disabled
people throughout the United Kingdom will want to see how the pilots
work. It will be advantageous to see if there are different lessons to
learn from areas with different arrangements for delivering such local
services.</div>
<a name="09022678000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
that the Under-Secretary raised about our conversation on mental health
problems and learning disabilities, I must say that the reason why we
tabled amendment 26 was to probe Ministers so that they were explicit
about the measure. There was no intention to press the amendment.
Indeed, it would have been an example of undue specificity, as the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform is fond of saying&#151;we
do not want too much specificity in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09022678000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
45, I was reassured by what the Under-Secretary said about how the
Government intend to proceed during the pilot, and, as I said, we would
welcome a look at how it works in practice to see whether more
prescription will be required in the regulations. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000274"></a>The

amendment 29, in
clause 32, page 39, line 48, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) Direct
payments legislation must include a prescription for any providing
authority to take account of potential long term and multi-agency
savings when considering what represents an &#147;unreasonable
financial burden&#148; under subsection
(3).&#146;.</div><a name="09022678000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000275"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The clause includes provisions for, and gives
powers to Ministers to make regulations about, direct payments.
Amendment 28 addresses the extent to which a local authority is able
not to allow a direct payment, and to what extent a disabled person can
demand direct payment, because in the circumstances, the local
authority will not have to pay. There is a range 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>of reasons, if we are being generous&#151;excuses, if we are
not&#151;why local authorities can refuse to comply with a request
for an individual budget to be converted to a direct payment, and there
is a question about whether or not that gives the disabled person
enough freedom to spend the money. The clause, by my reading, enables
an authority to make direct payments in respect of the person securing
the provision of the equivalent service, instead of their having to
provide the service itself. The question is whether that, rather than
giving them the money to spend, will give the disabled person enough
freedom. What I want from the Minister is an understanding of the
extent to which the presumption will work. If the person has their
individual budget&#151;their resource allocation&#151;will they be
able in most cases to take it as a direct payment, or will the local
authority have too many reasons or excuses not to comply?</div>
<a name="09022678000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 29
addresses the provision allowing a local authority not to provide a
direct payment. It considers the words</div>
<a name="09022678000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unreasonable
financial burden on the providing authority&#148;.</div>
<a name="09022678000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment, which
was proposed by Mind among others, suggests that when measuring undue
financial burden, one should take a proper long-term perspective. What
we do not want is for a local authority to say, &#147;If I fund a
service in the current year, it may well be expensive this
year.&#148; However, it could result in long-term savings. For
example, it may enable the person to be more independent, and to get
back into work, which would effectively support the welfare reform
agenda that both sides of the House share. Moreover, savings may accrue
in later
years.</div><a name="09022678000221"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="09022678000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
making a judgment about the undue financial burden, we want the local
authority to weigh up the short-term cost against those long-term
savings rather than just looking at the present-year cost and saying,
&#147;Because it is a bit more expensive this year, we won&#146;t
do it at all.&#148; That effectively would mean giving up those
long-term savings. It would be perfectly possible for the local
authority to say to the Government that in return for some extra
funding this year and next, there will be some long-term financial
savings. That would be in everyone&#146;s interest, affecting local
government and health spending, for example.</div>
<a name="09022678000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue that could influence the extent to which local authorities roll
out the scheme is the funding and costs of parallel running. That came
through very clearly from what Paul Davies and Liz Sayce from RADAR
said in the evidence session. Liz Sayce said:</div>
<a name="09022678000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
of the issues that has been raised with us is that it can be more
costly to double-run different
systems&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Welfare
Reform Public Bill Committee, </i>10 February 2009; c. 19,
Q20.]</div><a name="09022678000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">A system
in which we have individual budgets, direct payments and the existing
provision in one area could be more expensive than moving
wholeheartedly to a system of individual budgets and direct payments
for most people. In the present economic environment, the focus of all
parties will be to spend resources in the wisest and most
cost-effective way possible to provide sensible outcomes. We do not
want to set up two parallel systems that will create extra costs and
burdens. The thrust of both amendments is to look at whether Ministers
have correctly assessed that, whether local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>authorities will use that as an excuse for not doing such things and
whether we are giving them too many tools to slow down the process.
Moreover, when we are making cost decisions we must ensure that we
consider not just present-day costs but costs in the future.</div>
<a name="09022678000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Real benefits
can be derived from the success of the right to control. If we do all
the things that I listed in clause 29, such as allowing disabled people
to get into further education, higher education, employment and
training to a much greater extent than today, we will find that as well
as improving their quality of life and their life chances, they are
also likely to be in a position to make a greater contribution to
society. Hence, the cost to society will be lower, and disabled people
will have a better quality of life. We should bear that in mind when we
consider the Bill. I fear that we are giving local authorities too many
reasons to say no, rather than giving them the reasons and incentives
to say
yes.</div><a name="09022678000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000276"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I should like to ask the Minister a question about
the clause, and the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Forest of
Dean. I particularly want to ask about subsection (3) and what is
deemed to be unreasonable. Given that we are not talking about care
services or health services, but about many of the services that will
be provided by external providers or by universities or colleges, what
thought has the Minister given to the definition of unreasonable and
how will it be determined? As the hon. Member for Forest of Dean said,
there might be a high initial cost, such as paying expensive fees up
front when someone goes to university or college, but there will be a
long-term saving if that person contributes to society during their
lifetime, particularly by paying more tax. In the context of Jobcentre
Plus and some of the programmes that are being run, how will the
definition of what is unreasonable be
exercised?</div><a name="09022678000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000277"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I welcome the discussion on these amendments.
There is a balance to be struck between financial accountability and
sustainability, and extending the rights of disabled people as much as
possible. The simple answer is that we must ensure that there is no
threat to public service provision. Clearly, local authorities have
statutory duties as well as duties to their electorate. The right to
control is currently untested, and we want to use the trailblazers to
find out how to balance both short and long-term considerations, which
the hon. Member for Forest of Dean has rightly pointed out. The Office
for National Statistics has estimated that for those who have a right
to control, perhaps 15 per cent. more are likely to find the ability to
go into work, but we need to evaluate the trailblazers over time, so
that we can calculate where the long-term savings are. The clause is
about affordability and is meant as a backstop to ensure the
sustainability of services. It is not intended to be an artificial
barrier that can be used without giving due consideration to disabled
people&#146;s rights.</div>
<a name="09022678000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000278"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> May I press the Minister on her comment about the
protection of public service provision? It is clearly important that
local authorities should retain the ability to ensure the provision of
public services, but if we roll this system out, the type of services
that are currently provided will not necessarily stay the same. From
memory, the evidence from the pilots on social 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>care was that half the money that is currently spent is not spent on
things that the disabled person would choose to spend it on. If we roll
out the system more widely, we will see&#151;as we might see when we
do the pilots&#151;that what people choose to spend the money on will
not be what it is currently spent on, so local authorities are likely
to find that they will not be providing those services any more because
people do not want them.</div>
<a name="09022678000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
a tension&#151;we have all seen what happens if a day centre
closes&#151;but if a day centre closes because most of the people who
go to it, when given the choice, would rather spend the resources on
something else and do not then want to go to it, it is right for it to
close. It would not be right for the local authority to say, &#147;We
want to keep the day centre open and to keep people employed
there,&#148; if the disabled people who use it do not want to go to
it. I know that would bring tension and make things difficult, but we
have to put disabled people at the centre, so I was a little worried by
the Minister&#146;s comments about protecting local authority
provision. When given the choice, disabled people might want something
quite different from what is already being
provided.</div><a name="09022678000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000279"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. He is
right that there is a degree of tension because providing a day care
centre involves a built cost&#151;the capital and revenue costs of
maintaining the building&#151;and if someone wants a service provided
to them in their home, or at some other location that is not owned or
controlled by the council, that balance will have to be struck. That is
why we want the trailblazers and the consultation process to continue
throughout that period, so that we can build a body of evidence to
allow us to make appropriate judgments on what regulations might be
required if it is rolled out throughout the
country.</div><a name="09022678000200"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
clause means that an authority will be freed from its duty to make
direct payments if those payments would impose an unaffordable burden
on the service or support. The Bill&#146;s framework ensures that we
can clarify in secondary legislation and in guidance what could be
interpreted as an unreasonable cost. We wish not to be too prescriptive
in primary legislation, but to develop workable guidelines in
discussion with public authorities and disabled
people.</div><a name="09022678000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022678000280"></a><b class="B">Meg
Munn</b> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op): I seek to clarify
this issue a little more, as I think we are dealing with two different
issues. There is the point that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean made
about the shift of services, and the implications for local authority
services of moving money around, and there is the separate issue that
any service provided by local authorities, if it were based just on
people&#146;s desires and needs, could ultimately overwhelm their
budgets. Legislation, such as that covering community care, children
and the matter before us, needs some protection to ensure that local
authorities do not find that they are expected to pay for absolutely
everyone&#146;s wish.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000281"></a>Ann

Obviously, local authorities must be able to provide services to those
who are eligible under statutory provisions, and they must have
sufficient resources available to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>meet that statutory obligation, in addition to trying to meet
citizens&#146; aspirations for the sort of service that they want in
general. Their statutory duties and their ability to provide them must
remain, and the sustainability of services, protecting public resources
and ensuring that the right is affordable must be at the centre of the
rights. There is no intention of preventing disabled people from
exercising the right to control in all circumstances. Authorities will
be expected to provide clear and compelling reasons for refusing a
direct payment, and we will issue guidance to make the intentions of
this clause
clear.</div><a name="09022678000140"></a>

illustrate some of the tensions that could arise when the provision is
applied more widely. A case in Oldham hit the national press, and I met
the people involved. A direct payment holder and his wife decided that
part of the money that was given to him would be used to employ a carer
to take him to watch Rochdale football club on a
Saturday.</div><a name="09022678000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022678000283"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): Waste of
money.</div><a name="09022678000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000284"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Some might say that. The press picked up on that
and used it as an example of someone wasting public money. It was not.
His wife had an afternoon off when she did not have to care for him.
The carer who took him to the football match was not interested in it,
but he wanted to go to it. When moving to direct payment, such issues
arise and one person&#146;s &#147;reasonable&#148; may be another
person&#146;s &#147;unreasonable&#148;. The press&#151;I think
it was <i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he Sun</i>&#151;thought that that was unreasonable.
I thought that it was reasonable, but that was not the media&#146;s
attitude.</div><a name="09022678000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000285"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and I
have nothing against those who decide that retail therapy is better
than going to a football match on a Saturday. The point is that carers
are entitled to respite. That is the key element, not how the respite
functions. There is a choice of how the respite is taken, but a carer
who looks after someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week is entitled
to respite. That objective incorporates the personal desires of the
disabled person, their family and the people who care for
them.</div><a name="09022678000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000286"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The person to whom the hon. Member for Rochdale
referred was a guy called Gavin Croft, and I had the pleasure of
meeting him when I visited Oldham metropolitan borough council to meet
some of the people with individual budgets. Apart from questioning his
judgment about which football team he supported, as the hon. Member for
Glasgow, East did, the example was a good one of an agreed outcome,
which was not the success of Rochdale football club, but giving his
wife a respite break. That was the objective, and it was achieved at a
much lower cost, so it was a much more effective use of finance than
some other
cases.</div><a name="09022678000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley said, it is right that there
should be a back-stop to prevent unreasonableness, but the Minister was
right to say that the objective is achieving agreed outcomes. Nothing
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>the process should drive costs higher, and the evidence from the social
care pilots showed that when people were given transparency in the
funding spent on them and a choice in the way the money was spent, in
most cases people were realistic and motivated, and better outcomes
were achieved at less cost. In terms of financial success, and in the
difficult environment that we are in, the measure is a good thing and
we will often get better outcomes at a lower cost than we are currently
providing.</div><a name="09022678000222"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09022678000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000287"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I entirely agree with the conclusion reached by
the hon. Member for Forest of Dean. Often, the alternative provision
will be achieved at lower cost and will provide better quality. In
turn, that will provide more funds for other areas of care that that
person may want. Ultimately, that is our objective. We are trying to
work in a way that gives us a basic framework that people know we are
working within, and that, over the next few years, as the trailblazers
start to succeed, allows us the flexibility to get into the detail of
how this will operate in practice and establish how we are going to
measure outcomes. It is not difficult in most cases to measure what
those outcomes will be. An outcome where someone gets respite care that
meets their individual taste is clearly more desirable that a
one-size-fits-all approach. That is the aim of the
Bill.</div><a name="09022678000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000288"></a>John
Mason:</b> Although I support the idea of more right to
control&#151;as other hon. Members do&#151;does the Minister agree
that it is a matter of balance? We need to consider the needs of the
individual, but local authorities are under a lot of pressure these
days and their budgets are tight. They are elected and have a certain
amount of authority, so we have a duty to protect them from having
their services chopped up into
bits.</div><a name="09022678000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000289"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> With the greatest respect, local authorities are
there to serve the public who elect them and who reside in their area.
The idea is to provide the best quality of services at the best value
that can be reasonably obtained, using the services and skills of the
many local authority workers, particularly in social care. The aim is
also to work alongside voluntary organisations that operate within that
area, and with disabled people and their
families.</div><a name="09022678000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is about achieving the best result for the taxpayer and the council tax
payer in terms of level of service. Local authorities should not be
afraid of that challenge or of co-operation. As hon. Members will be
aware, in Scotland we have approached the matter in a somewhat
different way in that, through the community planning partnerships, we
are trying to get public agencies to work together in a better way and
be more accountable to the people who pay for the services and vote for
them. On that basis, I urge the hon. Member for Forest of Dean to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000290"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> We have had a good discussion, with a number of
interventions. Certainly, from what the Minister has said so far, I am
reassured that there will be some clarity about what unreasonable costs
are in the regulations and guidance. It is welcome that the Minister
recognises the tension that will inevitably arise as disabled people
make choices about what services they want compared 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>with what services are currently provided. That will be one of the clear
lessons of the pilots. Indeed, as those pilots are run, it might be
helpful to engage with the media and explain that people will make
different choices and that there will be creative solutions.</div>
<a name="09022678000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interesting thing about the case of Mr. Croft and his wife
was that&#151;I had not seen the report in <i class="I">The Sun</i> that the
hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned, but it was certainly covered in
other national newspapers in much more balanced way&#151;feedback
from Mr. Croft, his wife and organisations indicated that
this was a good way to achieve the outcome, and if the outcome is
achieved at a lower cost than that of the official way of doing it,
what is wrong with it? There was more balanced reporting of that case
than I had thought might occur, so I think that we can be a bit more
optimistic about the way that some of this might be reported. People
are more open-minded than we might think when they consider what is
successful and what is cost-effective, while remembering that it has to
be for the agreed outcomes that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley
correctly put her finger on.</div>
<a name="09022678000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
useful debate and the reassurances that the Minister has given about
the guidance and the way that the regulations will be made, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000291"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I beg to move amendment 30, in
clause 34, page 41, line 15, leave
out paragraph
(c).</div><a name="09022678000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000292"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 31, in
clause 34, page 41, line 20, leave
out subsection
(6).</div><a name="09022678000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000293"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I shall try to move through the amendments
reasonably quickly, because we have discussed pilot schemes at the
evidence sessions and in an earlier debate today. The clause provides
for such schemes, making it clear that, under the previous clauses,
Ministers can make regulations for a pilot scheme and time-limit it for
a period not exceeding 36 months. These are probing amendments, and
amendment 30 tests how the schemes will run and what we may learn from
them.</div>
<a name="09022678000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4)(c) defines whom the scheme applies to, and it can apply either to a
geographical area or to a specific class of individuals. The provision
that I seek to delete states that the scheme can be applied even more
narrowly&#151;to particular people by reference to prescribed
criteria or on a sampling basis. One danger with pilot schemes is that
if they are chosen to run in an area that is particularly hospitable to
them, where all the local authorities, primary care trusts and other
statutory bodies are gung-ho about making it work, it may be successful
but that will not give us a realistic view of what will happen if we
introduce it throughout the country, where those factors may not all
hold true.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="09022678000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
if we narrow too much the group to which the pilot applies, we may not
fully see what will happen in the real world. For example, if it
applies to a small number of people, other services, such as brokerage
and advice services, are unlikely to arise, because there will be too
few people to access them. Another problem is that if the local
authority has a small number of people to whom the new provisions
apply, but it still has to provide all its other services, it will
incur the costs of parallel running.</div>
<a name="09022678000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">What areas
are the Government looking at for the schemes? Will they be only in
areas where the local authority and other statutory providers are
volunteers? That would be helpful, but it would not give us a very good
impression of what might happen if we introduced the scheme throughout
the country. The Minister alluded to the specified class as a person,
and, to see what works, we must ensure that different categories of
people are given the chance to use the services. For example, we want
to ensure that the schemes cover a significant number of people with
mental health problems and learning and other disabilities, so that,
across the range of disabilities, we get a fair picture of what works,
what does not and what might need to
change.</div>
<a name="09022678000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 31
would leave out an objectionable aspect of the clause&#151;subsection
(6). The Minister knows from the evidence-taking sessions that I have
some impatience with pilot schemes&#151;perhaps it is just from being
in opposition, and it will be knocked out of me in due course. I object
to the fact that once a pilot scheme has been running for up to 36
months, it can be replaced by a further pilot scheme making the same or
similar provision. I have a vision of perpetual pilot
schemes&#151;without our ever coming to a decision. If we are going
to run a scheme, we should run it and then, at the end, or earlier if
we have some clear data, make a decision. We should decide either that
something does not work or is not practical and therefore stop doing
it, or that we have enough evidence, on the balance of probabilities,
to move forward&#151;we should not have another pilot
scheme.</div><a name="09022678000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thing that pilot schemes miss, which we kicked around a little in the
evidence sessions, is balance. It is right to make sure that, when we
roll out a new system of anything, it is well designed and will work.
Equally, we might have evidence, which we do from the pilots on social
care, that that way of designing things has good outcomes for most
people&#151;it can deliver better outcomes at lower cost. There is a
cost involved in running lots of pilots and not rolling the system out
across the country for three or four years. The cost is for the
hundreds of thousands&#151;perhaps millions&#151;of people who
would be entitled to the new way of doing things, possibly giving them
better outcomes at lower cost to the taxpayer, but they are prevented
from doing so, because instead of rolling it out across the country we
are running a number of pilot
schemes.</div><a name="09022678000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
recognising that we need to get things right, we should also recognise
that we have already piloted individual budgets between 2005 and 2007
on the adult social care side. Those pilots have been evaluated and the
Department has the evidence. Certainly for working age adults, the
evidence was clear. As the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford, said earlier,
there were some concerns and some issues raised with older
people&#151;in some cases the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>pilots were not entirely successful. However, there is a fair bit of
evidence already that the stuff works, and that came through in our
evidence session, both from Liz Sayce and Paul
Davies.</div><a name="09022678000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new pilots in the Bill will only commence in 2010 so, if they run for
the full three years, we are looking at the system not even starting to
be rolled out across the country in 2013. In the four years between now
and then there will be many people who could have benefited who will be
prevented from doing so. We need to have that at the back of our mind
as we press to go further and faster. I know Ministers want to do that,
but unless we push a little harder, we are in danger of never quite
getting to where we want to
be.</div><a name="09022678000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we look at some of the other organisations involved, there is clear
pressure from outside about making this go faster. Sue Bott, the
director of the National Council for Independent Living, has said that
the pilots would cause &#147;unnecessary delay,&#148; given the
Department of Health&#146;s piloting of individual budgets between
2005 and 2007. She said in a
brief:</div><a name="09022678000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
feel that if there&#146;s an acceptance of the principle, then
let&#146;s get on with it and make
it&#148;</div><a name="09022678000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">work.</div><a name="09022678000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There&#146;s
enough information on the
ground.&#148;</div><a name="09022678000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anne
McDonald, programme director for community well-being at the Local
Government Association, involved in the delivery of such services on
the ground, said that there was a danger that people could feel
&#147;piloted out&#148; and that the new pilots needed to be clear
in what they set out to
achieve.</div><a name="09022678000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister responds, she could set out&#151;perhaps not in detail
now&#151;what the objectives of the pilots are, so that we could know
when they have been successful. It would be helpful if the pilots in
the clause could only run for up to 36 months&#151;it would be
interesting if the Minister could give us an indication of how long the
Government expect pilots to run for, and an assurance that if, as those
pilots are running, there is evidence early on about what works, there
would be no necessity to run the pilot right to the end. Ministers
should reserve the right to say, &#147;We know what works, we know
what is successful, so we are going to get on with it and do the
job.&#148;</div><a name="09022678000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final authority that I would pray in aid would be the Equality and
Human Rights Commission, which I mentioned in my remarks this morning.
It stated
that</div><a name="09022678000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is disappointing that the
Bill&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09022678000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">or

proposes that this will be piloted in 2010 in a small number of
&#145;trailblazing&#146; public authority
areas.&#148;</div><a name="09022678000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
EHRC clearly wants the process to go faster as well. I am sure that
Ministers are keen for it to do so, but the key is getting the balance
between caution and making it happen on the
ground.</div><a name="09022678000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the essence of my amendments. In conclusion, I again quote
Mr. Davies, when giving us
evidence:</div><a name="09022678000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
can well understand why people would want to feel the comfort of a
pilot and see how that worked; I just do not agree with it. There is
more than sufficient evidence to justify going straight
ahead.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Welfare

<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div><a name="09022678000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a man who has
delivered such things on the ground. He is not a visionary in a

of adult social care at an authority with a fifth of the national
coverage of people with individual budgets, making this stuff work on
the ground and delivering those services. He is clear that there is
enough evidence to move ahead. Perhaps the Government could be a little
more ambitious about the timetable.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000294"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I would like to pick up where the hon. Member for
Forest of Dean left off and ask the Minister whether the Department has
identified a budget for these pilots and if so, what it is. Also, how
many pilots does she envisage and what is the time frame for them? As
was said in evidence, there is a lot of keenness to see this rolled out
across the country as quickly as possible.</div>
<a name="09022678000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000295"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The aim of the trailblazing is to test robustly
how the right to control can be made to work in practice. To do that,
we want to retain maximum flexibility in how the trailblazers are
designed. We also wish to have the ability to collect additional
evidence from further trailblazers, if necessary. The broad powers in
the clause are intended to achieve that.</div>
<a name="09022678000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
Government&#146;s intention that the trailblazer phase will involve
eight local authority areas. We have not yet chosen the locations and
we want to discuss that with our advisory group, disabled people and
authorities. No decision will be announced until the Bill receives
Royal Assent. However, we have allocated &#163;5 million on the basis
that the trailblazers will commence from 2010 in England and we
anticipate that the results will be available in 2012-13. That is the
time frame we are currently working within. I hope that that reassures
members of the Committee. We have not yet invited applications for the
involvement nor have we considered the terms of the tender but we want
to allow evaluators of the right-to-control trailblazers to use their
expertise in designing the form of the evaluation.</div>
<a name="09022678000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Forest of Dean expressed some concerns about amendment 31. I
can reassure him that it is not our intention to run additional pilots.
The provision would allow a new trailblazer to be set up if the planned
trailblazers highlighted the need for further information or, for
example, if there was a gap between the expiry of a trailblazing scheme
and the national roll-out of the right to control. We would not want
local authorities to be faced with a gap when they were not offering
that service. The provision is designed for a certain amount of
flexibility and to allow part of the trailblazer to start at a later
stage if we find in our evidence and evaluations that we need to look
further at different aspects of the right to
control.</div><a name="09022678000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000296"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> May I press the hon. Lady on that? Her first point
was that subsection (6) was designed to enable a new pilot scheme to be
run when more evidence was required. That relates specifically to a
pilot scheme being replaced by further pilot schemes making the
same&#151;or similar&#151;provisions. That sounds like we are
talking about rolling one scheme on, not setting one up. I am trying to
tease out some different information, and I am not sure that that point
is entirely convincing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div><a name="09022678000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
argument cited was very unconvincing. I do not want the roll-out of the
scheme throughout the country to be avoided just by rolling pilots
forward. If we have run a pilot for three years but are not at the
point at which we can roll it out, we will not want Ministers to have
the option of rolling the pilot forward. We want pressure to exist so
that they have got to get things working. If we allow for excuses, we
could be limiting ourselves to a few pilot phases, and when we hit
inevitable difficulties&#151;there are bound to be stumbles on the
way&#151;there would be a danger that we would resort to the pilots,
rather than making the scheme work.</div>
<a name="09022678000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000297"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> We certainly do not intend to cause undue delay.
However, there could be a genuine problem if, for example, the
Government agreed to roll out the programme in 2014 and a local
authority found that the 36-month period of its test ended in October
in the previous year, because that would mean that there would, in
effect, be a three-month gap. We intend to cover that possibility, not
to provide an excuse or an undue delay. We want to cover technical
issues during an interim period.</div>
<a name="09022678000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right that, to attain maximum flexibility, the provision
would allow us to conduct a further trailblazer in another area. We
want further information, not the same set of information for which the
original trailblazer was set up. We want to ensure maximum flexibility,
which is why all the regulations will be subject to the affirmative
procedure. However, we also want to ensure that we are working closely
with local authorities, disabled people, voluntary organisations and
evaluators to ensure that we get the best possible evidence&#151;I
hope the hon. Gentleman accepts my reassurances on
that.</div><a name="09022678000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000298"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that assurance.
One point of tabling amendments is to have a discussion and set some
boundaries, and to make clear to Ministers what will happen when they
bring measures forward.</div>
<a name="09022678000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
good discussion about the nature of the pilots. I urge the hon. Lady,
when the Government think about which areas to choose, not to look
simply at areas where there are willing volunteers. If the pilot is
going to be successful, we need to test it in areas where at least one
part of the mix&#151;it could be the PCT or the local
authority&#151;is not mustard keen and needs a bit of cajoling. Given
what has happened with adult social care, that could be more
representative of the challenges that will be faced than if everyone is
a willing
volunteer.</div><a name="09022678000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the hon. Lady&#146;s reassurances and what she said about the
Government&#146;s intention to move along quickly, I beg to ask leave

clause 35, page 41, line 37, leave
out subsection (3).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div><a name="09022678000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
in clause 35 that caught my eye was subsection (3), which
states:</div><a name="09022678000216"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
power of the Secretary of State to make regulations under section 31 is
exercisable only with the consent of the
Treasury&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="09022678000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">why?</div>
<a name="09022678000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
understand why the Treasury would want to give approval when
regulations made under section 31 would apply to the whole country,
because clearly that could have significant public expenditure
implications and it is supposed to be the Treasury&#146;s job to
control public expenditure, although it has not being doing a super job
of that in the past few years, given the state we are in, but we will
leave that to one side. The flaw is that regulations to run the pilot
schemes are also made under clause 31. Therefore, subsection (3) says
that, even to run the pilot schemes, the Treasury has to say yes. The
Minister told us that &#163;5 million would be available for the
pilot schemes, so it is already approved. I am confused why, if the
&#163;5 million has been okayed, the Treasury is still
interfering.</div>
<a name="09022678000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
said, individual budget pilots deliver better outcomes at lower cost.
What is the nature of the Department&#146;s conservations with the
Treasury? Where is the Treasury coming from? Is it nervous because it
secretly thinks that the provision will cost a huge amount? Is that why
it is retaining control? What has already been agreed with the
Treasury, given the &#163;5 million budget that was talked about? To
be clear, when the Minister talked about the enthusiasm of the
Department, he was obviously speaking for the Government. We do not
want to see that everyone is gung-ho for the proposal only for the
Treasury to come along and say, &#147;No you can&#146;t do it, not
even the pilot scheme.&#148; The Committee would welcome some
reassurance on that, which was the reason why I tabled the
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000300"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> This will sound like I am a game show host, but
I am not. The &#163;5 million is in the bank&#151;it is sorted and
protected. Even if we accepted the amendment, the &#163;5 million for
the pilots would still be there, so the hon. Gentleman&#146;s undue
suspicion and uncharacteristic cynicism is misplaced. Beyond that, the
actual phraseology is lifted from hundreds and thousands of pieces of
UK statute legislation. The provision is simply a recognition that
things cost money. It is focused on national implementation, not
roll-out. Shame on the hon. Gentleman for even using such a
strangulated form of English. The national implementation needs
Treasury approval, as well as approval across Government. I would read
no more into the phrase. I ask that it stays in there to copper-bottom
the enthusiasm of the entire Government, including the Treasury, for
what is outlined in clause 31. In that spirit I ask him to return to
his polite and courteous ways and withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022678000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022678000301"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am very pleased to be able to reassure the
Minister. I had not realised that I had deviated from my polite and
courteous ways. The purpose behind tabling the amendment was to get
that reassurance. I am pleased that the Minister has been able to make
it clear to us that the budget for the pilots is in the bank and sorted
so that the Department will be able to move ahead swiftly. As I said, I
recognise that for the national 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>implementation of these proposals, it is essential that the Treasury is
on board because there might be significant implications. I was just
concerned that there should be no stumbling block because the pilot
scheme regulations are going to be made under clause 31. The Minister
has adequately reassured me about that. Certainly, if he is satisfied
with the Treasury and he is perfectly able to deal with it, I am sure
that we can be satisfied. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
