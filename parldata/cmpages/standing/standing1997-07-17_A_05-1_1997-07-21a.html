<P>
On again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that, at the close of this morning's sitting, Mrs. Liddell was on her feet, but Mr. Clifton-Brown was about to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> I was intervening because the Minister said that I had said that the reduction in corporation tax is welcome, which indeed it is. I made it clear in my speech and in subsequent interventions, however, that the overall increase in the burden of corporation tax, which the Budget proposes through other measures, is a signal to industry that the Government are on trial over whether there will be long-term economic stability for the business climate. Will the Minister give the Committee some assurance that she recognises that it is necessary to keep the overall burden of taxation on industry low if it is to prosper?
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) for his intervention: it enables me to remember where I was in my speech.
<P>
It would be a very foolish Government who attempted to project future tax rates, which are based on the economy's performance. We are committed to fair taxes, which means that we are also committed to reducing tax avoidance. A number of the hon. Gentleman's points, including those in relation to the Red Book, applied to clauses that we will discuss later, under which the Government propose measures to ensure that opportunities for tax avoidance are reduced. The Government are committed in all their actions to creating a stable environment for economic investment and growth, through not only the reduction of corporation tax, but long-term monetary policy.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement of the Government's wisdom in drafting the clause, but he made remarks that led me to believe that Opposition Members have rather a relaxed view of tax avoidance. That view is not shared by Labour Members. It is important that taxes are seen to be fair, and that we do not have a climate in which tax avoidance is built into the operation of the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Does the hon. Lady accept that Opposition Members are as imbued, as I am sure she now is, with the Revenue's understanding of the position--in the words of the learned judge--that no taxpayer should expect to have more than the smallest possible shovel put into his stores. That was, I think, the basic understanding of tax avoidance. If she has evidence on that matter, I am sure that she will bring it to our attention and we will consider it in due course.
<P>
Does the hon. Lady agree that it is also of the greatest importance to ensure tax compliance and the deterrence of tax evasion, and that members of this Committee should set an example? Is she satisfied that all Labour Members subscribe to the doctrine that when taxes are legally imposed and levied, they should be paid?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Yes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold, who has now disappeared, claimed that there was potential for a ``tax haemorrhage''. He gave no justification for his statement; it was not backed up by any evidence. I gained the impression that the hon. Gentleman was merely treading water. I regret that he is not now present because he made a number of points about research and development expenditure that were not only sweeping but ill-informed.
<P>
Certainly, many companies with large distributive profits also spend a considerable amount on research and development, mainly because they are very large global companies. I would put it to the hon. Gentleman if he were in the Room that one of the most critical ways in which we can help companies that have the potential for growth, especially those at the leading edge of technology, is to allow them to retain more of their profits so that they can use them for research and development. Retained profits are a much cheaper source of funding than raising high-risk finance in the wider marketplace. There is an impeccable logic in that, and it is regrettable that the hon. Gentleman dismissed these growing companies, which are vital to our long-term economic well-being.
<P>
Another absent Member, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), asserted that Labour is anti-dividends. That is absolute rubbish. Labour has acted to change the climate in which there are subsidies in favour of dividend distribution. In removing those subsidies, we can free resources that will allow a reduction in corporation tax, thereby adding to the value of a company.
<P>
Hon. Members asked whether the Government intended to reduce tax deductions for research and development. I can say quite categorically that we have no such plans.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold pushed his luck with his claim, based on the Red Book, that unemployment would stay at 2 million. If he reads the rubric in the Red Book, he will find that the Chancellor was prudently using the actual levels of unemployment in the Red Book, unlike his predecessor who made assumptions about falls in unemployment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb: </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Am I right in saying that the National Audit Office report, published on 19 June, revises assumptions for the Budget projections and assumes that there will be no fall in unemployment during this Labour Government?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The NAO report was published considerably before the Budget. We hope to have a full assessment of labour market statistics within the next few months, which will allow us to track unemployment more accurately. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a new Member, but he should be aware that anxiety has been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House about the computation of unemployment levels. That does not, however, detract from the erroneous nature of the hon. Member for Cotswold's assertion about the Chancellor, who was in fact using actual levels of unemployment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) intervened on the hon. Member for Cotswold to make a point about increased pension contributions being ignored by the Red Book. Conservative Members are making so many interventions that they are losing track of them. The hon. Member for Daventry should read paragraph 2A.7 on page 46 of the Red Book, which has a specific reference to the yield from abolishing tax credits as computed after allowing for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a fall in corporation tax resulting from companies increasing their contributions to pension funds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for reminding me of that. Will she quantify the anticipated fall?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I will return to that later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), who has just joined us at an apposite time, was also scaremongering about dividend payments. He quoted rather selectively from a City university business school study; that study accepted that tax credits created a distortion. The clause is concerned with reducing corporation tax. I have no intention of going further down the tax credits route, except to say that, unlike the previous Government, we have used the abolition of tax credits directly to help business. The previous Government reduced their level purely to fill a hole in the public sector borrowing requirement.
<P>
Opposition Members have dangled many red herrings about incorporation and small businesses. It is clearly assumed among Opposition Members--as demonstrated by the hon. Member for Ashford and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)--that Government Members emerged into Parliament from behind a cabbage patch. If the hon. and right hon. Gentlemen check Vacher's for Labour Members, they will find that many have come from small business. It should be clear that tax levels are only one part of the decision to incorporate. Administrative arrangements and limited liability--in which I mischievously tried to get the hon. Member for Ashford involved--are as important, sometimes more so, than tax levels when companies decide whether to incorporate. The hon. Member for Ashford is not breathtakingly naive--perhaps he was just running out of steam.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also talked about the link between the small firms rate of corporation tax and levels of income tax, but there is no formal link between them and there is no reason why there should be. However, since 1983 there has been a relationship and they have been the same only since that year.
<P>
I normally enjoy the speeches of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), but his latest was confused. He accepted and welcomed the clause, and then argued himself full circle. He welcomed the proposal, but wanted more. When a wish list does not have to be implemented, anything can be wished for. When decisions have to be taken, that luxury is taken away and much more common sense is needed. The Government will decide future tax policy according to the performance of the economy, and will aim to secure stability and growth.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton also referred to my distinguished predecessor, John Smith, whose seat it is my privilege to hold, citing his belief that corporation tax cuts should take second place to more favourable capital allowances. We have done both. The hon. Gentleman has failed to recognise that. Indeed, the economic climate is moving from boom and bust towards stability, and makes our logic impeccable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the tax cuts through allowances are temporary, is the Economic Secretary suggesting that the corporation tax reduction will also be temporary? I hope not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a distinguished Member of Parliament and has been around for a long time. No one can every say what the future holds. I say to him and to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that our proposals on small companies will benefit 99 per cent. of the companies in the UK, whether they are incorporated or not. He should not dismiss these measures, which are important for the future of small businesses.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wanted a timetable for the introduction of a basic tax rate of 10p. I must say again that the hon. Gentleman is operating a wish list. The time will come when we can introduce a lower rate of tax of 10p. We have not yet been in government for three months, but we have already moved a long way towards fulfilling our manifesto commitments. However, when we came into government we were not given a magic wand with which to undo 18 years of economic mismanagement. When we have dealt with that, we will be able to move to a lower basic rate of income tax.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): A 10p tax rate is not on the wish list of the Liberal Democrats. We believe that the most progressive way to cut income tax is to increase the allowances, as that would take the lower-paid out of taxation. The wish list for the 10p tax rate is in the Labour Party manifesto. I asked the hon. Lady to clarify the timetable for her wish list, not for mine.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I think that I gave the hon. Gentleman the answer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about the unit trust rate and the alleged imbalance for trusts investing in bonds. We had a full discussion about unit trusts--I think it was a couple of days ago, but I now feel that I am in a time warp. I am sorry that he was unable to pose the question then, as I am sure he was listening at the time. I can, however, confirm that the authorised unit trust rate will remain at 20 per cent., because it is aligned to the lower rate of income tax. The hon. Gentleman should be clear that although some AUTs specialise in bonds, that is not usually the case for investment trusts. The tax rates paid by authorised unit trusts on bond income remain significantly lower than the rate paid by investment trusts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)--I am trying to take these points chronologically, so I hope that I am not repeating myself--spoke about the alignment of the lower rate of corporation tax with income tax, to which I referred a few minutes ago. He has misunderstood the situation. He also talked about tax loopholes. I have no doubt that there is an army of people beyond this House looking for opportunities to get round various taxes.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary talks about tax avoidance--I welcome the statement from the hon. Member for Daventry that we have a joint interest in ensuring that the tax system is fair--but we will not allow the creation or the perpetuation of tax loopholes; that is not in the interest of the taxpayer. I recognise that the previous occupation of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton involved a legitimate search for loopholes, but we will ensure that that legitimate search has to go round in circles before it ends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My point was that breaking the link between the small companies lower rate of corporation tax and the basic rate of income tax--there was such a link, whether or not it was formally written into the legislation--will create legion opportunities for tax avoidance. Conservative Chancellors always maintained the link precisely because if it is broken, a hole is created through which a coach and horses can be driven. To stop the avoidance--as the hon. Lady seems keen to do--a plethora of anti-avoidance legislation will have to be put on to the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point as it allows me to expand on the relationship between corporation tax and income tax. As I said earlier, there is no formal link; indeed, one of our main reasons, in opposition and in government, for examining the full structure of corporate taxation is because there are distortions and inequities. The corporation tax network has, like Topsy, ``just growed'' and it needs reform. Our proposed change must be viewed as part of the wider restructuring.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned the further element of small businesses run as companies and those run on self-employed lines. The hon. Gentleman probably knows more than me about the impact of different kinds of income tax, but the position of the two is not wholly comparable, and not just because of the different structure of corporation tax. Once a company makes sufficient profit to pay corporation tax at the main rate, all its profits are taxed at that rate. A self-employed person who pays income tax retains not only the benefit of the lower, basic, rate of tax but is subject to the corporation tax structure.
<P>
I was surprised by the sweeping assertion of the right hon. Member for Wells, who gave the impression of trying to match the longevity of his hon. Friends, that Labour Members are not concerned about small businesses. I am sure that he did not mean to be offensive--he is probably unaware of the expertise among Labour members of the Committee.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman claimed that we are trying to dismember imputation, which stretched credulity a litte far. The reduction in corporation tax will enable companies to invest better for the future. Furthermore, distortions and subsidies are being removed, thereby ensuring that companies distribute profits when it is not in their best long-term interests to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The hon. Lady will have noticed that her bill goes much further and plans important changes for 1999. She says that there is no intention to dismantle the imputation system, but the double taxation relief, which is at the heart of the imputation system, is ended by the Bill. We must have some clarity, especially as the hon. Lady built an edifice on the proposition that the Government want to ensure stability and clarity and to give taxpayers a glimpse of future plans. Will she describe the end result of the fundamental changes to the imputation system and allow those outside to plan their business affairs more accurately and in accordance with the Government's intentions?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We are about to debate clauses on the abolition of ACT; many of the right hon. Gentleman's points are covered by those clauses. Ordinary shareholders who previously did not pay tax are not adversely affected by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is an extraordinary statement, because under the proposals for 1999, on which we are legislating, non-taxpaying shareholders will not be able to reclaim the cash credit that, hitherto, they have been able to claim. Although we shall debate the proposal at greater length, especially in the light of the Minister's extraordinary and, I suggest, misleading statement, an important difference remains. Non-taxpaying shareholders want to know where they stand under the Labour Government and we want clarification of the Minister's statement that non-taxpaying member of the public will be able to receive their tax credits.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Minister replies, I must point out that we are still debating clause 18; it would be a good idea if members of the Committee stuck to that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
Members of the public watching the conduct of the Committee could have received much more information about how the Bill will operate if we had not taken up so much time on relatives, English wine, geography, Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) made a specific allegation. He alleged that the cut in corporation tax would not take full effect until 1999-2000. I said at the beginning of my comments that companies will gain by &#163;1.6 billion in 1998-99. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not want to obfuscate and that he is aware that mainstream corporation tax is not paid until some nine months after the end of the accounting period. We are becoming hung up on a detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is important that there is no misunderstanding. My point was a fair one. I was contrasting the delay before the full cost is met by the Government or the full benefit is received by the corporate sector, with the immediate hit to income as a result of indirect duty increases which took effect on Budget day and the advance corporation tax credit which has an immediate effect on pension funds.
<P>
I want urgently to seek clarification of what the hon. Lady said earlier about non-taxpayers not being disadvantaged by the changes to corporation tax. It is urgent because we shall not discuss the clause in question for some hours. Those outside the Committee and some members of it have been confused and, perhaps, misled by what the hon. Lady said. Will she correct that or elaborate because the matter is urgent and important?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I refer to the right hon. Gentleman to the Official Report. We discussed the matter fully on the Floor of the House not 10 days ago. I remember the discussion clearly.
<P>
It is now 4.55 pm and we have been discussing clause 18 stand part since 10.30 am. I would be most surprised if Opposition Members were to vote against it. A number of forthcoming matters are of great concern and interest to business and in the interests of full scrutiny we want to discuss them in some detail. It is bizarre, to say the least, that we have spent so much time on an aspect of Government policy which is of huge benefit to British business--and which has been recognised as such by both sides of the House--when we could have discussed more fully Opposition amendments to future clauses. Those outside the House who are looking at the performance of the Committee will come to the inescapable conclusion that the Labour Government have the best interests of British business in mind and the Opposition are intent merely on playing games, scaremongering and obfuscating.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment would undo a gross injustice in the tax legislation and for business caused by clause 20(2). It is one of those injustices that has emerged because of the undue haste with which the Finance Bill was prepared and the undue speed with which it has been published and is being debated. Had there been a little more time between publication of the Bill and discussion by the Standing Committee, there would have been more time for consultation with outside bodies. More importantly, if the Government had left more time before publishing the Bill, they might have avoided falling into traps for business such as that in subsection (2).
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to spend a few moments discussing section 242 of the Taxes Act 1988, which clause 20 would abolish. That provides relief for claiming franked investment income tax credits against losses in a company. That is part of the imputation system, properly called the partial imputation system because there is a disparity in the credit rate of 20 per cent. on the full corporation tax of 33 per cent. or 31 per cent. That means that double taxation is not altogether avoided, but the aim of the partial imputation system is to avoid companies being taxed more than once on their profits. A United Kingdom company that receives a dividend from another UK company does not have it taxed. Part and parcel of the imputation system is the avoidance of double taxation on company profits. The dividends received are thus known as franked investment income--the income has been franked and had tax paid upon it.
<P>
The essence of the system is that profits are taxed only once. In addition to the avoidance of double taxation being implicit in the system, ACT tries to avoid a double cash flow effect. People confuse ACT with the double tax credit system. ACT--advanced corporation tax--is simply a cash flow facility so that the Government can avoid having to wait nine months after a company's year end before they receive any corporation tax. ACT is payable 14 days after the end of the quarter in which a dividend is paid--the quarters are March, June, September and December--with an extra one for each company's applicable year end. The ACT is paid to the Government as soon as a dividend is paid.
<P>
Where one UK company receives a dividend from another and then pays that dividend to its own shareholders, if it were not for the franking of dividends the companies would have to pay out that cash flow disadvantage twice. A dividend would be paid by the first company, which would pay ACT to the Exchequer. The dividend would be received by the second company but, when that company paid the dividend to its own shareholders, it would, theoretically, have to pay another chunk of ACT. To avoid that disadvantage arising, the imputation system has a system of franking the dividend that is paid, so that franked investment income coming from the first company can frank the dividend being paid to the second. In effect, there is no requirement for the second company to have to pay any ACT.
<P>
We have heard a great deal from Labour Members about the distorting effect of the imputation system, but it is not a distortion.
<P>
Suppose that a company generates lots of profits, but the managing director decides, for some reason, that instead of distributing profits to the shareholders as he should, he will invest the money in some groundnuts scheme in Africa. That managing director is, in effect, defaulting on the people who lent capital to him, just as if one borrowed money from a bank and failed to pay the interest on it. Dividends are no different from interest on a loan.
<P>
The consequence of failing to pay a dividend is that a company's share price will fall. If a share price falls and the company seeks to raise further capital in future, it will find that the cost of capital rises because it has to issue new shares at a greater discount to take into account the fact that dividends were not paid on previous capital. Investors will want some form of risk premium to compensate for that. The whole notion that paying dividends is somehow distorting or bad for business is utter nonsense. The concept in Will Hutton's ``The State We're In'' that raising funds through the equity markets is in some way an Anglo-Saxon method of raising capital and is not as good as the continental method, by which businesses are funded by debt, is utter nonsense. There is no real distinction and the equity method of raising capital is very effective.
<P>
It is far better for companies to pay out dividends--as they should do and as they have committed themselves to do--than for the capital markets to decide where best to reinvest that capital in the future. They may well be totally satisfied with a company's record and they may be happy to reinvest capital in the company in a future rights issue or in a future shares issue, but they may decide to invest their capital elsewhere in the stock market; they may decide to invest the dividend flows in venture capital--in emerging companies that are just starting up.
<P>
The essence of the imputation system is central to the success of British business. It means that flabby, inefficient management is not allowed to succeed and that aspiring, new companies with new ideas are able to raise capital in the marketplace.
<P>
If a company has a loss and is not able to pay a dividend, section 242 of the 1988 Act provides it with effective relief during that difficult phase. The essence of the relief, which clause 20 will abolish, is that the company can offset the franked investment income credit against the loss and obtain repayment from the Exchequer of the tax credit, which is effectively equal to 20 per cent. of the amount of the loss that it has given up in exchange for the repayment. That is useful relief for companies that are going through a difficult phase. Of course, those companies hope to be able to return to a profit in the future.
<P>
Section 242 is an unusual relief because it can be undone in due course--when a company decides that it is no longer in a loss-making position, and most companies hope that they will not remain loss-making for ever. The relief can be undone, the tax credit can be repaid to the Exchequer via the ACT bill and losses can be reinstated and offset against future profits. Companies may want to do that because the temporary relief that can be claimed under section 242 gives relief only at 20 per cent. for losses, although corporation tax losses are really worth 33 per cent.--or they will be worth 31 per cent. when the Bill is enacted. Claims are made in the knowledge that they can be undone, that losses can be reinstated and that full relief will be available in the future at 33 per cent. or at 31 per cent.
<P>
Clause 20 will abolish that valuable relief for accounting periods beginning on or after 2nd July. The unwinding provisions that I have just described end straight away on that date. Many companies in this country have put in claims under the provisions of section 242 to have their franked investment income credits offset against their losses and they have received the 20 per cent. relief, but they put in the claims in the full expectation that in due course--in two, three or four years' time, when they return to profitability--they will be able to undo the claim, to reinstate their losses and to obtain relief at the full corporation tax rate. Had they known that the Government were going to abolish the ability to undo that claim, it is very likely that almost no company in this country would have put in a claim in the first place.
<P>
It is grossly unjust for the ability to unwind claims to be removed forthwith on 2 July 1997. That provision is the result of the Bill's hasty preparation--it is, in effect, the result of the Government's failure to consult with professional bodies. I do not understand why the Bill is being rushed through. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales believes that there is no need for haste, and it is not required as a result of the terms of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales commented on clause 20(2) as follows. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``To avoid retrospection the provision should apply only to claims made after 2nd July 1997. Where a section 242 claim was made before 2nd July 1997 and has not yet unwound that subsection should continue to apply so that the taxpayer remains in the position that he would have expected when the claim was made.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is the opinion of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
<P>
Let us consider the views of other professional bodies. The Institute of Directors is highly critical of clause 20(2). It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Section 242 was a useful way of helping companies over cashflow difficulties during a loss-making period and the pre-claim position was normally restored in later years when dividends were paid. It is not at all clear that the withdrawal of this relief was a necessary consequence of the withdrawal of tax credits for pension funds.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A company which had claimed this relief a few years ago and obtained loss relief at 20 per cent. expected to have the opportunity to reverse the claim and obtain relief at the full corporation tax rate but will now find that it can never do so. Had the company known that the change in the rules was likely, it would probably never have made the original claim; it would have waited for ordinary loss relief by carry-forward against today's profits.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Institute of Directors then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We consider this freezing of the position to be unfair.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Now let us consider the view of the revenue law committee of the Law Society. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that clause 20(2) will operate unfairly. There will be many instances where, prior to Budget Day, section 242 claims had been made by companines who expected their financial position to reverse in the future, with the result that their losses would be restored under section 245(5).
<P>
 They will now find that that restoration will not take place|This frustrates legitimate expectations and cannot be justified.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>All those professional bodies--the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Directors and the Law Society--are against clause 20(2), which the amendment would remove. It is clearly an unjust subsection, so I hope that the Government will accept my amendment. Had the Government consulted with those three professional bodies before publishing the Bill, they would have realised how unjust the subsection was. I hope that Labour Members will support the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are now moving deep into technician territory and, to change metaphors, I feel the waters rising over my head. I will seek the Committee's indulgence if it is necessary for hon. Members on either side to bail me out on some technical matter. Nevertheless, it may not be wholly unhelpful for a lay voice to supplement that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, a distinguished practitioner, who has just introduced his amendment. It is entirely consistent with the amendments that we have tabled and it raises an important issue.
<P>
A few moments ago, I said, in a slightly self-deprecating way, that I found myself somewhat uneasy considering such detailed tax matters, but having read the submissions of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, I take comfort from the fact that it did not find the clause entirely easy at the first read. We are grateful for the notes on clauses, which are helpful--but even so the position is not too clear.
<P>
I noticed that perhaps somewhat impishly, the Scottish institute says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There appears to be little influence from the Tax Law Rewrite team in this Finance Bill. Examples of tortuous impenetrable legislation includes schedule 7 `Restrictions on Group Relief'''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which we have not yet discussed--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``elements of the corporation tax provisions such as clause 20, and even limited self-contained measures such as clause 17''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which I recall discussing in the Committee of the whole House. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland also made some interesting points on avoidance, which we shall debate later. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton rightly explained, we are concerned about the unfairness of the sudden guillotine on claims made for loss relief under section 242 and other relevant sections, which will in turn create a real unfairness in practice.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am pleased that one of the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I mirrors the representations of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The spirit of our argument, which is put at greater length in amendment No. 40, is that if a company acts reasonably in accordance with the law of the time, its reasonable expectations--also mentioned by my right hon. Friend--should not be frustrated by the sudden change of a provision.
<P>
It would be useful to stand back a little and explore what lies behind the Government's intentions--that is one of the Committee's important roles. The Government have expressed some concern about the payment of tax credits not merely to individual taxpayers but to companies. The Red Book clearly sets out the data. It shows that the beneficiaries are, first, pension funds--not companies, but corporate institutions; secondly, other insurance companies of the subsidiary company; thirdly, other companies and institutions; fourthly, foreign companies; and, fifthly, the personal shareholder.
<P>
If what the Government are trying to do has any merit--though, in practice, I doubt whether it has--it is to try to remove some of the consequences encountered when different receivers of dividend income, and therefore of payable credits, are judged at different personal tax rates. Given our imputation system, it is difficult to relate the tax paid by a corporation to tax paid by an individual. That is a problem in any system and one that we could debate at greater length and more appropriately another time.
<P>
The immediate concern arising from the Government's decision is that they are anxious that there is no messing about. They want to avoid remaining institutions being used as recipients of the money. If such companies also bolted on to themselves losses from elsewhere, they would create a tax neutralising and--from the Revenue's point of view--a tax losing situation. I note that the Economic Secretary is nodding at my lame exposition. My main point is that there are tax losses in trading companies around the world and that dividend income is attracting tax credits. If the two can be put together through a series of devices--whether artificial or natural--the Revenue would be less well off. That is the substance of the debate.
<P>
We will be discussing--the Economic Secretary mentioned this at least twice--the anti-avoidance provisions in clause 28. It seems to me, as a non-technician who has read the submissions of learned bodies, arguable that clause 28--which provides general dispositions to prevent people creating artificial arrangements to receive a tax credit through, for instance, a discretionary trust--would be sufficient to catch any anticipated artificial problems. I hope that it does catch those problems, but by withdrawing the general right to allow losses to be set against franked investment income in defined conditions, the Government have created the real inequity referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.
<P>
I should like to go a little further--if only to satisfy the Committee and myself that I understand the issue. Provisions in section 242 and other relevant sections have meant that trading companies and investment companies--the two are indistinguishable for the purpose of the amendments--can trade. We shall discuss investment companies when we deal with amendment No. 29.
<P>
Companies receive income from a variety of sources. They pay out expenses in relation to their business activities. In broad terms, subject to all reliefs and allowances, companies' business expenses are offset against their business income. That produces a taxable profit that is subject to corporation tax.
<P>
I have already said that those companies may also be in receipt of dividend income. That arrangement is perfectly normal and has nothing to do with elaborate scams to reduce their tax burden. They may be loss making but in receipt of dividend income. Until now they have been able to set off the franked income, which has attracted tax elsewhere--there is no question of their avoiding tax--against their trading losses. A separate but related issue is that the investment companies, in defined circumstances, can do something similar with their management expenses. We shall return later to that subject.
<P>
In general, however, companies have been able to make that trade-off which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has already said, has been restricted to tax credit rates of 20 per cent. Normal corporation tax, however, which was at 33 per cent., will drop to 31 per cent. if the clause is accepted. Those companies, however, do not currently get the whole lot back but have been provided with some relief when they have been in difficulty.
<P>
There are two problems with the Government's proposal: first, that relief is cut off, although that may be a political decision, and I should like the Economic Secretary to explain why she feels that generally it should be cut off. Secondly, there is an immediate transitional problem, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spoke with his characteristic expertise--what has been described in other contexts as what happens when the music stops. In perfectly good faith, with no question of tax avoidance, companies experiencing a temporary trading difficulty, might have availed themselves of the opportunity of offsetting their franked investment income to the current 20 per cent. level but now, with the fall of the guillotine, they cannot reinstate their losses to get the 31 per cent. relief. 
<P>
No board of directors would have chosen to make that application without good reason had it known that such a change would happen--and that that change would be retroactive, if not retrospective. If directors, acting on advice, were to do that--in which case they would need to tackle their advisers--or if directors took that action off their own bat--in which case, shareholders might have something to say about it--they would have been reckless.
<P>
Companies find that the basis from which they started has changed and they cannot restore their losses. That, as my hon. Friend has eloquently said, gives them a real hit now. There is nothing to help them in the legislation as drafted. I hope that the Economic Secretary will consider that problem and consider making an amendment. Amendment No. 40 relates to intentionality. Amendment No. 39 and others try to introduce objective tests that would stop that problem from arising or that rely on an incontestable basis. That may create a problem because people may avail themselves of the relief when they originally had no intention of doing so.
<P>
My hon. Friend cited some of my cases--I intend him no disrespect--and mentioned the Institute of Directors. The Chartered Institute of Taxation takes a similar line of argument on this matter, which is that companies proceed from one basis; the date came down arbitrarily on 2 July; and those companies cannot alter their arrangements to the new basis. That creates an inequity for them. Whatever one's view of the general provision of the clause--something that we shall no doubt discuss during the clause stand part debate--companies which are in that position, which have acted in good faith, with no suggestion of even tax avoidance, have been unfairly treated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the clear way in which he explained the position--much more clearly, I must say, than the garbled way in which I tried to explain it.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that merely removing subsection (2) would have no overall effect on the clause? Whatever one's opinion of clause 20, removing subsection (2) would have not effect on the essence of the clause. Once the relief provided under section 242 is removed--which the clause will do--in the years ahead, once all the claims that have already been made unwind, there will ultimately be no more claims. Removing subsection (2) will leave no scope for tax avoidance. It would merely prevent an injustice that the subsection will create.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is my reading of the amendment, and of the clause as it would be if amended. The Economic Secretary owes the Committee an explanation of whether what she is about is anti-avoidance, as she sees it, and if so, why that cannot be captured in a later clause. I would be grateful if she could expand on that.
<P>
Whatever view one may take of the clause and its concept, as my hon. Friend has said, on the particular issue of old section 242 claims that cannot be restored, such claims cannot be repeated in future, because it will not be possible to enter them. It is therefore difficult to imagine avoidance occuring from now on, because there will be nothing to avoid. If the Economic Secretary could speak to that specific point, she would reassure me. The issue has given rise to a great deal of concern among professional persons, and it seems to me not beyond the wit of man, and not to create any embarrassment for the Government, for the Minister to say that perhaps the Government can refine and modify, and that it would be fairer if they did so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I wish to make a few brief points to support what my hon. Friend has said. As we have already said, the essence of what the Government are attempting to do has largely been born out of a certain prejudice towards companies' dividends and profits. The impact of the advance corporation tax changes that we have already debated more generally will especially hit larger companies which have downsized greatly during the recession years--former nationalised industries in particular. Earlier, I mentioned the National Coal Board pension fund of &#163;20 billion and the Post Office pension fund of &#163;12 billion, and so on.
<P>
The clause will bang another nail in the coffin of the pain that those companies and their pension funds will suffer as a result of the ACT changes. If I may, I shall refer to a few of the companies that will be most affected, many of which are located in the constituences of Labour Members. At present, ICI's pension fund is only 94 per cent. funded. The impact of the ACT changes could mean that it will be funded by as little as 84 per cent. However, such companies are now to be denied relief under section 242 on dividends with ACT.
<P>
We all know that under the Government funding requirement for pensions, if a pension fund falls below 90 per cent. funding, it is obliged to make up the difference within one year. The disappearance of relief such as that provided under section 242 will further compound the problem.
<P>
Some capital goods industries will suffer no less than a treble or quadruple whammy. Not only are they to be denied relief during difficult times, their pension funds will be hit expecially severely when they have many pensioners but fewer pension contributors paying into the funds. They will also be hit, as we know, by the surge in the value of sterling and its effect on their exports. Only last week, we saw a report showing that engineering export levels have fallen to 1990 figures.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is real pain being felt in important British industries, many of which are located in constituencies in the midlands, which are represented by many hon. Members on the Labour Benches. The Government must surely take notice of a very sensible amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which would spread out a little of the pain felt by industry.
<P>
We spoke earlier about the effects of dividend pay-outs and investment levels. I cite a report from the Lombard Street Economic Review, which is a worthwhile independent economic body, which pointed out that in the past 18 years, retentions and investment have moved in opposite directions on eight occasions, so it is highly debatable whether dividend payments have acted to the detriment of investment. That is a subject that we shall go into in more detail.
<P>
I support the amendment. If the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is sincere about the qualifications of Labour Members in the Committee and about their being hand-picked because of their experience in industry and small business, I am sure that she and her colleagues will be very sypathetic to this sensible and practical amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the general anti-avoidance protection in clause 28. That clause is aimed at those who have artificially created arrangements to secure the benefits of tax credits indirectly. In other words, they are seeking to avoid legitimate taxation. Clause 20 deals with situations that will usually not be artificially created. It will remove an existing relief which, in the natural course of events, gives pension funds and others the benefit of tax credits by an indirect route.
<P>
All three amendments relate to the unwinding provisions that apply after claims that have been made by companies for payments of tax credits. I must correct one point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, although I am sure that he did not intend to mislead the Committee. This is an unbelievably complex and arcane part of the tax legislation and provides a case that is probably more effective than any other for a review of corporation tax, and I am grateful to the Inland Revenue for having taken me through it all with great patience.
<P>
The unwinding provisions stop from the end of the first accounting period ending after 2 July, which could be as late as June next year. If companies are likely to suffer so dreadfully from missing out on unwinding, they can arrange for it to be unwound in that accounting period. I must confess that taxation journals are not my normal bedtime reading, but I understand that there has been some acknowledgement of that provision in the professional press. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is much better read than I am on such matters.
<P>
The amendments very much go together in that they would apply after claims have been made by companies for payments of tax credits. It is ironical that having discussed loopholes in the previous clause, we immediately move on to this one. It is quite clear that those claims had to go at the same time as the abolition from Budget day of payable tax credits for pension funds. That is what the clause will achieve.
<P>
The amendments seek to preserve the unwinding provisions. It is at times like this when I hope that those dealing with the modernising of the House of Commons might allow the use of overhead projectors to help us with some of the more complicated parts of the Bill. The point is that the relief that companies receive for their losses by claiming payment of tax credits on the dividends that they receive depends on the level of tax credit. That can be lower than the relief that the company might have received if the losses had instead been carried forward and set against future profits in the normal way.
<P>
That complex set of unwinding provisions has the effect of restoring the loss and clawing back the payment of tax credit in a later accounting period. As I said to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, those provisions put the company back into substantially the same position as if it had never claimed payment of tax credits. The amendments seek to continue the unwinding provisions indefinitely--the first for all claims, the second for claims made after Budget day and the third for certain specific claims. Their practical effect is much the same--the unwinding provisions are extended, whereas the clause will turn them off for the accounting period beginning after 2 July.
<P>
The amendments would introduce another distortion and irregularity into the system. The argument is advanced that companies may have made claims in the knowledge that they would later be unwound and that the benefit should continue to be available to them indefinitely. The point to bear in mind is that those companies have already received relief for their losses, a point made by the hon. Member for Daventry. The companies have already received relief for their losses, but they want to retain the possibility of obtaining some greater relief at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady is right. I understood my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to say in an intervention on me that there will be no new claims for relief. The debate is about companies that have already claimed relief under section 242 that might wish to convert that relief under corporation tax. That, however, is a conditional relief. Those companies claimed it on the assumption that it could be reversed. Perhaps the hon. Lady believes that those companies should not have been allowed an each-way bet. They reasonably expected that they could not lose by making a claim under section 242, but they now find that they might. That is unfortunate.
<P>
The hon. Lady might reflect on whether those companies might be allowed to trigger their claim immediately. They would have to make a decision within a reasonable time; it should not unwind indefinitely so that they could withhold it for a number of years. Not being a technician, I am not clear whether the loss relief is allowed. Perhaps the hon. Lady will bear in mind what I have said, now and in our subsequent consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I must reiterate what I said earlier, that those companies have already received relief. The hon. Gentleman referred to an each-way bet, but there is no justification for retaining such particularly complex provision. Doing so would create its own problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): I completely fail to follow the hon. Lady's argument. Surely, those companies have received relief at the ACT rate of 20 per cent. They have not received, and under the Bill will never receive, the full rate of mainstream corporation tax of 31 per cent. The argument is disingenuous--I have to use that word again--to say that they have received relief. They have received relief at only the 20 per cent. rate, not at the full corporation tax rate. Is not that correct?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Like the hon. Member for Daventry, I am not a technician in these matters. Having been trained as an economist, I am probably thought to be an enemy in some respects. The hon. Gentleman seeks to make a case for giving double relief to companies that have already had the opportunity to offset their loses. Perhaps I am being particularly dense, but--
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> But this is the hon. Lady's Bill, not mine. Will she answer a simple question? Is it not the case that those companies have received relief only at the ACT rate of 20 per cent., not at the full corporation tax rate? I asked that question earlier, but I did not receive an answer. Can I please have an answer to it now?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am aware that the hon. Gentleman was not in Committee when we started these discussions, but we are discussing the amendments that were tabled by his hon. Friends. We shall come later to the clause stand part debate. I wish now to return to the point that I was making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Economic Secretary keeps saying that the companies have received tax relief. But is it not a fact that they have only received tax relief at 20 per cent.--at the ACT rate--not at the mainstream corporation tax rate? That is the difference, or have I misunderstood the hon. Lady's Bill? She obviously knows what the position is because it is her Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> When we reach the clause stand part debate, it will become clear that the relief has already been given to companies. We are seeking to close a particular loophole that was created because of the unwinding provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The exchanges have been illuminating. Will the Economic Secretary confirm my understanding of the position? If company A had a loss in a previous accounting year and claimed relief under section 242, latterly that relief would have been restricted to 20 per cent. If the same company makes a loss in its next accounting year on its trading activities, and then claims a loss, it will be able to claim that relief at 31 per cent., against mainstream corporation tax. Does the hon. Lady consider that that effective outcome is equitable between the two periods in which the losses were made?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Perhaps it will help the hon. Gentleman if I return more or less to first principles. I apologise if I bore the Committee by so doing. If, in an accounting period subsequent to that in which a payment of tax credits was made, a company had a surplus of dividends paid out over dividends received, the loss that the company used in its original claim will be restored to it to the extent of that surplus. The loss can then be set off against profits in the normal way.
<P>
Secondly, I turn to the clawback of the tax credit paid. The clawback is effected by reducing the advance corporation tax normally available for set-off against corporation tax in subsequent accounting periods to the extent of the tax credit paid to the company--the point made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford.
<P>
Let me take a specific example of when a company, in year one, makes a trading loss of &#163;1,000. It also has dividend income for that year of &#163;1,000--a cash dividend of &#163;800 with an associated tax credit of &#163;200. I can see some eyes glazing over in Committee, but I shall continue. The company makes no payment to its shareholders, but makes a claim for payment of the tax credit. As a result, the &#163;1,000 dividend income is treated as income against which the loss of &#163;1,000 is set and the tax credit of &#163;200 is paid to the company.
<P>
I shall now move on to year two in which the company makes a trading profit of &#163;500--I am sorry if my explanation is beginning to sound like O-grade economics or accountancy. The company receives no dividends and, again, pays none to its shareholders. In year three, the company makes a trading profit of &#163;2,000. It receives no dividends, but makes a franked payment to its shareholders of &#163;1,000--a dividend of &#163;800 on which ACT of &#163;200 is accounted for. Because the franked payment exceeds the company's dividend income for that year by the same amount as the trading loss set off in year one, that loss is then restored to the company with effect from the end of year two.
<P>
The trading loss of &#163;1,000 is, therefore, brought forward to year three and set against that year's trading profits of &#163;2,000, which are liable to corporation tax. The ACT of &#163;200 on the franked payment is, however, not available to set against that corporation tax liability because of the clawback provision.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I congratulate the Economic Secretary on reading paragraphs 15, 16 and 17 of the notes on clauses to clause 20 with enormous clarity. However, that splendidly clear numerical example proves precisely what my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford has just said: clause 20 will deprive companies of the full relief at the corporation tax rate and allow them relief only at the lower, 20 per cent. ACT rate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> To cut a long story short, Opposition members want certain parts of the corporate sector to have a double bite of the cherry which is not available to ordinary taxpayers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> If the Economic Secretary really wants to cut a long story short, why did not she just give a one-word answer--yes--to my previous two interventions? She declined to give a one-word answer, but read out an arithmetical example which merely proved that the answer to my initial question was yes. Why spin out the proceedings of the Committee in that way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman regrets that I take his inquiries seriously. He is a distinguished Member, and I believe that any point that he chooses to make must be regarded with some seriousness. Indeed, had he been in the Room earlier, he would know that I referred at length to the interventions that he made in the debate on clause 18. Obviously, he is making up for lost time now.
<P>
I shall give way for the last time, as my colleagues are complaining that I am wasting time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for giving way. I apologise for misreading the date on which the measure will take effect given in subsection (2). However, the point remains that claims that a company has made in the past can be unwound only when the company pays a dividend. That is likely to be outside the date given in subsection (2).
<P>
I am concerned about the response that the Economic Secretary gave to the amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). If that is the Government's response to my pointing out a clear injustice, the Government are doing themselves and, indeed, the public an injustice. This is a serious point, not a debating point. I hope that the Economic Secretary will return to her officials to find a better response to give the Committee. It is wrong to say that such a company has already had the benefit of the relief; it has had only a partial relief of two thirds the level--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am chairing the Committee. Mr. Gibb, you are making an intervention, not a speech. You will have an opportunity to put further points later. Please make your intervention brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Winterton.
<P>
It is important that the Economic Secretary gives the Committee a full response. The response that she gave was inadequate and did nothing to deal with the points on the relief that Opposition members have made.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman thinks that my response was inadequate. We shall discover whether it was adequate when we vote on the amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry summed up the matter when he said that companies are seeking an each-way bet. That is specifically why it will not be possible for the Government to accept the amendment. The obscure way in which these provisions works means not only that the unwinding mechanism can result in relief being given at a lower rate because of that unwinding, but that relief already given can, in effect, be removed. That has been a long-standing weakness in the rules. I was trying to make that point when the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford intervened.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 would deal with that by saving the unwinding provisions only for companies that were ``reasonably expecting'' to obtain later relief, but that begs the question what a company's expectation might have been and what rate relief might have been given.
<P>
The Government believe that it is best to remove the rules at the earliest sensible point. They will continue to run to accounting periods that began before Budget day, but after that they will stop. That seems the most sensible way forward and I am therefore unable to accept any of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had some useful exchanges, although I remain depressed by them and I am about to invite my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has revealed that the Government are thinking, ``We should never have offered the option in the first place, so now we are not going to. If people thought that they could avail themselves of it, they have another think coming.'' That is not a satisfactory answer.
<P>
The Economic Secretary mixed up the complexity of the tax rules--we are all suffering because of that complexity--with the inference that only elaborately rich fat-cat types would avail themselves of the benefits. The benefits, if they so be, are available to commercial trading companies and even manufacturing companies that happen to have some investment income but that are making a loss. They are also available in related ways--we shall discuss this further when we consider a subsequent amendment--to investment companies, which can set off some management expenses.
<P>
That is what is actually happening, but, in response to a point that I made, the Economic Secretary said that, previously, companies had been offered an each-way bet.To dissect her argument, let us imagine that she were a bookie--I hope that she does not mind the analogy--and I had taken out an each-way bet with her. If she then said, ``I've had another thought about this; you can have only one side of the option and we have decided which it is'', I would have a phrase for it and it would not be Scottish--

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before the Committe was suspended, I was drawing my remarks to a close. I had just said that an option that had been open in the past should continue, because companies have the reasonable expectation that it should do so, even if there were changes in the rates or to the structure of the corporation tax regime. Those elements of intentionality and reasonableness are behind my amendment No. 40. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton spoke extremely well to his amendment and I am sympathetic to it.
<P>
In the absence of any concession by the Economic Secretary, I invite my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division. I do not know whether the hon. Lady will wish to speak further on it, but I hope that she will reflect on the changes and ask her officials to examine with her, in a more relaxed atmosphere than is perhaps possible in Committee, whether they contain some elements of inequity that could be catered for without derogating from the principle of the clause or from an orderly winding down of the previous arrangements. She could then perhaps come back to us on Report. I am discouraged that I see no sign of that happening at the moment; I do not wish the clause to be amended because of any political argument--the issue of whether we have the measures in the clause or a change in advance corporation tax is for debate elsewhere--but because of the strong endorsement of the professional bodies for some measure of alleviation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that subsection (2) is a gross injustice; hundreds of companies up and down the country have submitted claims under section 242 of the Taxes Act 1988 in the belief that once their company turned into a profit-making concern and they started to pay dividends, they would be able to unwind their claims so that they could obtain relief at the full rate of corporation tax of 31 per cent. or 33 per cent.; however, the only relief that they have so far obtained from those losses was paid at the rate of 20 per cent. The answer that the Economic Secretary gave was inadequate: I do not blame her for that, but the briefing she was given by officials. I was hoping that she may have had the opportunity, while the Committee was suspended, to discuss further with them--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend agrees that one way to solve the dilemma would be to have a longer transitional period so that those companies that had made their plans on the basis that they would be able to return the tax credit would have longer to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. That would indeed be a partial solution to the problem. One problem is that it is difficult for a company to know when it will be able to pay dividends in the future, so any extension of the transitional period will alleviate the injustice to some extent. Eliminating the injustice altogether requires a very long transitional period in order to ensure that all the companies that are to turn from loss-making to profit-making organisations--and, thereafter, to paying a dividend--have materialised.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The answer given by the Economic Secretary was inadequate. She said that companies that had made that claim had already received relief for their losses. The truth is that they have had relief at 20 per cent. when, following the passage of clause 18, their losses are worth over 31 per cent. That may seem an academic point to the Government, but to companies it is a loss of hard cash; those losses do not only appear on paper, but have been generated pound for pound by hard cash being paid out on wages and raw materials by companies that are struggling to survive in the marketplace.
<P>
Companies have always understood, and it has always been the position in our tax law, that those losses are available to be carried forward indefinitely to a time when they become profit making. The fact that under section 242 they have temporarily cashed in those losses for a mere 20 per cent. relief, instead of 33 or 31 per cent., should be irrelevant because they made that decision in the full knowledge that they could unwind that position once the company became profit making. They would then start to pay dividends; they could unwind the position and get full relief for those losses to the value to which they were entitled.
<P>
It is not correct to say that companies have had relief for those losses and they should put up with that and thank goodness that they have had anything at all. That is the wrong approach for the Economy Secretary to take and it is an arrogant approach. It is disappointing to hear that the Government is making no serious attempt to deal with what is a perceived and genuine injustice that has been pointed out by professional bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Directors and the Law Society. The response of the Economic Secretary, who was briefed by her officials, is not good enough. I hope that there is some mechanism by whih she can return to the Committee with a full answer and provide some way of alleviating an injustice that has been created by her Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Quite frankly, to list to the Opposition one would think that talk of unwinding relief means nothing but good for companies. Unwinding was compulsory and for many companies it was unwelcome and a lottery. The Opposition have not made a case and I oppose the amendment because it contributes nothing to the legislation; it would create anomalies that would make it difficult to operate the legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 13, line 28, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8) Subsections (1) to (7) above shall not apply to a company which is approved as an investment trust for the purposes of section 842 of the Taxes Act 1988 for an accounting period.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The tenor of the debate makes it clear to my hon. Friends and me that the Government are on the run and it is only a matter of time before we administer the coup de grace. The amendment would exclude investment trusts from the clause. There has been discussion, on and off, about members of my family--for example, my mother--who have investment trust shares, as do many people outside the Committee, and probably within it. They are a very popular collective investment vehicle.
<P>
We received a helpful technical briefing. The amendment deals with investment trusts. I am well aware that they are not the only collective investment vehicle; another obvious one is unit trusts. A less obvious one, not least because I never quite know whether I am pronouncing it correctly, is OEICs--open-ended investment companies. They are more flexible and do not have the company structure. They all, however, add up to the same thing--a vehicle for investors to pool their risk.
<P>
The Government--this is consistent with the tenor of their arguments on the previous amendment--seem to feel that many people who invest in the various collective investment vehicles are looking for a tax advantage and that that explains a growth of corporate investment in those vehicles. In other words, what started off in the early days of M and G as unit trusts for the people--I am sure that the Government will find that phrase resonant--has been transformed into outdoor relief for persons or companies of substance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that one of the largest investment trust companies, the foreign and colonial investment trust, has 100,000 shareholders and that 50 per cent. of the company's value is held by individuals? Such vehicles are, therefore, very much geared towards individual savers throughout the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am pleased to say that I was aware of that for a number of reasons. One of my close friends was formerly the manager of that trust. It so happens that my children have been investors in it for some time, and I look with admiration on the way in which it has tried to re-establish the position of the private shareholder. The amendment is, however, not a puff for that investment trust; it tries to give a perspective to the collective investment movement.
<P>
One important point for the Economic Secretary to consider is that these collective investment vehicles may, for particular reasons, be appropriate for substantial professional investors to invest in, whether they are sourced from within the UK or outside it. It might be reasonable for institutions from abroad to have direct shareholdings in BP, ICI or British Steel. If, however, they wish to invest in smaller companies or in areas such as the south-west, it may be sensible for them to consider a collective investment vehicle. I hope, therefore, that the Economic Secretary will not jump to the conclusion that companies' use of such collective vehicles is automatically designed to protect their tax position.
<P>
I am setting out the background to the amendment, and want now to consider the tax position itself. Frankly, I was a little shocked by a letter that the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds sent to the Economic Secretary following a meeting, a copy of which was sent to me. In the letter, which was dated 17 July, the association mentioned several concerns that it continued to have about the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised some of those matters on clause 17 on the Floor of the House, so I shall not repeat them. There was, however, a feeling that the Economic Secretary had not met the association's concerns adequately. 
<P>
It is necessary to mention one point relating to the tax treatment of the collective investment vehicles in order to set the scene for the amendment. Clearly, unit trusts and OEICs are not companies; investment trusts are companies and have a share capital. While I reminded the Committee that it was not part of my purpose to redesign the exact relations between those organisations--although the Economic Secretary will remember that I asked about the different tax treatment of their bond interest--I hope that a tax review committee will one day consider the matter in the interests of all parties. It is, however, important to recognise--this seemed to be somewhat in dispute at the Minister's meeting with the association--that unit trusts and, indeed, investment trusts--the specific subject of the amendment--already have a different tax status, which is not surprising. The first and obvious difference is that they have traditionally received large quantities of franked income. I was somewhat depressed when the Financial Secretary was unable to give me a response when I raised this issue during the Budget debate and again on Second Reading. We never obtained a clarification; indeed, unit trusts and investment trusts had to ring the Treasury to obtain clarification regarding franked income.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As well as franked income, such trusts receive some bond income and, in certain cases, income from property and other sources. They have an obligation to pay out that income because they are required by statute to pay up either the whole or sometimes 85 per cent. of their income. They are also separately regulated under the Securities and Investments Board. Therefore, their situation is considerably different from that of industrial or manufacturing companies. that is why it is important--and I am pleased--that the grouping of amendments has provided for a separate debate on these investment vehicles.
<P>
Philip Warland, the director general of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, wrote to the Economic Secretary following his meeting with her to explain how unit trusts are often an appropriate vehicle for the investment of pension funds and for other financial institutions. He states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We note your comments that unit trusts are treated for tax purposes like companies. This may be true in theory, but in practice it is far from true. There are some twenty pages of legislation which amend corporate taxation to take account of the particular nature of unit trusts and open ended investment companies. During a previous Finance Bill seven pages of detailed amendments had to be agreed because of unintended effects of changes to company taxation on unit trusts, and the need to take account of the differences''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I need not belabour the point, but I use it as evidence that there is a need--and, I submit, always will be a need--for the Treasury and the Revenue to be sensitive to the special conditions that the various collective investment vehicles will encounter in relation to their tax affairs as against conventional companies. That will apply whether or not we get rid of the existing partial imputation system, which is already being severely modified by the Bill.
<P>
I accept that, certainly in the Committee this evening, there is little future in trying to produce an exact parity or precise equality for all the various players. But I put it to the Economic Secretary that there will be a real impact on both unit trusts and investment trusts because they typically receive income, most of which is franked, and which they are largely or wholly obliged to pay out. That is over and above other concerns that they may have about whether they are authorised and how that affects their ability to conduct pension business.
<P>
I now want to deal with the position of investment trusts because the amendment specifically refers to them. They are hit particularly hard, or at least they have expressed a stronger concern about clause 20 and the withdrawal of section 242 than even the unit trusts. I suspect that the reason for that--although I cannot verify it--is because their management expenses are, their being companies, ipso facto more explicit. On the other hand, a unit trust has several elements--a fact that people sometimes complain about and want to see changed--including the charges and the spread, which may make it a little harder to determine what is going on. Again that is another debate for later.
<P>
The fact is that investment trusts receive mainly franked income, for tax spreading, which they are then obliged to pay out. As they pointed out to me, the system under section 242--which will effectively be withdrawn by the clause--operated as follows. First, an investment trust company could use only surplus--meaning over and above its own liability to advance corporation tax--franked investment income for a section 242 claim. Secondly, the investment trust company can use only excess allowable expenses; and thirdly, when the company has both surplus franked investment and excess expenses, they can be put together and, in lay terms, knock each other out.
<P>
The effect of abolishing section 242 will be an increase in the effective rate of tax in the accounts because companies will not be able to relieve so many of their expenses against it. A build-up of surplus franked investment is perhaps rather similar to unrelieved overseas tax when a surplus has been built up. There will also be a build-up of excess allowable expenses against which no tax relief will be given. Investment trust companies will be able to function less easily; it will be less affordable for the shareholder; and there is likely to be a build-up of income and expenses that cannot easily be managed. That is likely to discourage long-term United Kingdom equity investment, which the Economic Secretary said that she did not want to occur.
<P>
The Government said that they wanted more profit retention, with less being paid out. But that is difficult for investment trust companies and other collective vehicles because they are often obliged to pay it out. There is a further problem with split capital trusts.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> While he is talking about the effect of the abolition of section 242, will my hon. Friend say whether he agrees that it is one more example of the systematic attack by the new Labour Government on collective savings in general in this country? In particular, it is an attack on the return to be enjoyed by investors in investment trusts. As I said, it amounts to a systematic attack on savings vehicles and it can be seen running right through the Budget. That can only have a damaging effect on the savings ratio and, over time, on the strength of this country's economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point and I shall advert to it in drawing my remarks to a conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The connected point to that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford is that the provision is not only an attack on collective savings vehicles that affects the savings ratio, but affects the City of London internationally. This and other measures will have a devastating impact on the future prominence of the City of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Well, indeed.
<P>
I return to split capital trusts. We all have views about how well they work--sometimes better than others. It must be difficult for those who direct the trusts to know how best to set out their investment strategy in order to ride the interests of the two participants--those looking for capital growth and those looking for income. It is incontestable--and it is referered to by the Association of Investment Trust Companies--that many people investing on the income side and not worrying too much about capital growth will be older investors: retired people on a pension. Such people are not interested in capital growth, which is another way of buying an annuity indirectly. They want income and they will be hit directly by the proposals. My concern is thus a subset of the concern expressed by my hon. Friend for Grantham and Stamford.
<P>
In conclusion, whatever the Government want to do about tax credits and the allowance of loss, they should think hard about how the provision will apply to collective investment vehicles. These are not the typical vehicles of the large, sophisticated investor or the multinational company. They operate directly to represent the interests--literally--of smaller shareholders and unit holders and are also, indirectly, an appropriate way for the larger shareholders or institutions to diversify their activities. Ultimately, it comes down to small savers and individual savers.
<P>
I should like the Economic Secretary to comment on the specific point about split capital trusts, as well as answering these point. First--and I think that the answer is buried in the figures in the Red Book, but I have not been able to disaggregate it--how much will these moves cost investment trust companies, unit trust companies and OEICs in a full year? What is the effect of the restriction of loss relief and on their management expenses likely to be?
<P>
Secondly, how would the Economic Secretary rebut the argument that such moves are likely to discourage long-term equity investment, particularly in London, or through funds managed in London?
<P>
Thirdly, can the hon. Lady explain how--whatever her wish to retain profits for commercial and manufacturing companies through these changes--she believes that it is possible to force collective investment vehicles to retain profits under the tax regime when they are not allowed to do that, unless the rules on their retentions are relaxed, and that is not being canvassed?
<P>
I have to agree largely, if reluctantly, with my hon. Friends who have made the point that this is another example of an attack on the smaller investor and also on the City of London. It is very important for this country--clearly, the associations are not satisfied by the Economic Secretary's response--that we should provide an attractive investment climate for people to come to London with their funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is not another point that these investment trust companies are specifically designed for long-term investments? The Budget is meant to be about promoting long-term investment and against short-term investment, yet in this provision the Government are attacking the very vehicle that is specifically designed for long-term investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Sadly, I feel that that must be true. There is a paradox here: we have a Government who wish to encourage long-term investment and popular participation in our economy, yet these measures are likely to discourage long-term investment, penalise vehicles that are the most natural form of long-term investment for the smaller shareholder, and create a less attractive investment and funds management climate in London for shareholders throughout the world. Whether that is deliberate or inadvertent, I am not sure. Even if we give the Government the benefit of the doubt, it seems to have happened as a result of a side wind from their haste to get the Bill through.
<P>
I am convinced that the interests of unit trusts and investment trusts will be damaged. Again, I invite the Economic Secretary to say whether she is prepared to give some relief for their special circumstances and, better still, to drop her proposals as they effect these collective investment vehicles, along the lines suggested in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I first disclose an interest as a former--and still, partly, current--employee of a merchant bank. It is one of the largest providers of investment trusts and was founded on forming an investment trust in the last century.
<P>
I want to speak specifically about the detrimental treatment that investment trusts will suffer. I fear that this is another example of the Government choosing the wrong target because of their haste in dealing with the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friends referred to the importance of the investment trust sector, both to the City of London and as an increasingly popular form of investment for private individuals. It is the largest sector on the stock market and it is increasingly integral to pension schemes. My company is a major provider of pension funds based on investment trusts. Holders of pension schemes will suffer an added whammy when advance corporation tax credits are lost.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The attraction of investment trusts--they appeal precisely to people of lesser means--is that they are an ideal vehicle for spreading risk among a wider basket of investments, including overseas markets and a range of sectors in the United Kingdom market. The investment trust sector is at a disadvantage to the unit trust sector because it pays corporation tax at the corporation tax rate when unit trusts are taxed at 20 per cent. It is also prejudiced, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, because investment trusts are obliged to distribute more than 85 per cent. of the income they earn. Investment trusts do not have the flexibility of trading companies, engineering companies and pharmaceutical companies to determine and change their investment policy or expansion plans and claim the concomitant tax relief that goes with that. They are very limited in terms of the tax criteria whereby they can take advantage of a more favourable tax climate.
<P>
It is no surprise that the investment trust sector has been one of the worst performing sectors in the stock market since the Government came to power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Am I right in thinking that the investment trust sector is the largest quoted sector--that is, collectively the number of quoted companies that appear in the stock exchange list is the largest of any sector on the stock market?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Indeed, my hon. Friend is right. The sector is a growing one and earlier this year new investment trusts were coming to the market all the time.
<P>
The Labour party constantly flags the success of the stock market as a measure of how popular and successful its policies and especially its Budget have been and it should take the matter seriously. In the past few days we have seen the FTSE 100 index fall by more than 70 points on Friday and more than 50 points when I was last able to check it today. The Labour Government's acclamation of their wonderful economic policy has been sorely lacking in the comments from Labour Members.
<P>
The sector is in real trouble and those in the City who invest in the sector know that the investment trust industry is being unfairly treated and the holders of investment trusts are being prejudiced. That is another nail in the coffin of that tax treatment.
<P>
There are other implications from the changes. From now on, investment trust management will not be able to deduct management charges from profits from United Kingdom dividend income before working out the tax bill. That will result in a reduction in the average yield of investment trusts by some 0.3 per cent.
<P>
There is a second hit because investment trusts, unlike unit trusts, are allowed to gear up. Typically, the gearing factor on investment trusts is about 113 per cent. on average at the moment. Now, the interest will no longer be able to be used to cut the tax bill, so there is a double whammy on the charges, which is likely to result in loss of income to investors of more than 0.5 per cent. That is ironic because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, a number of investment trusts concentrate on providing above average income. Split-level income trusts are part of that sector and produce incomes of between 7 and 8 per cent. with high levels of constant income flow. That is particularly relevant to those of lesser means and pensioners who rely on that income and do not have the advantage of being able to have a higher risk profile by looking for capital growth. Split level investment trusts will suffer particularly. They will not be able to change their investment policies, which are narrow in what they have to achieve--a high level of income. That will be exacerbated, too, by changes to ACT.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton clearly showed that there are repercussions and a domino effect from ill-thought out and rushed legislation. The investment trusts that will be hit particularly hard are UK-equity invested investment trusts because of the new treatment of taxation of UK equities as opposed to overseas equities. That is another charter for investing outside the United Kingdom from a Government who are supposedly committed to long-term investment in this country.
<P>
These measures will not in any way help a growing part of the stock market or help an important revenue earner for investment trust providers in the City of London.The Proposals will in no way help UK equity investment because they provide incentives for investment in overseas equities. They will not help to provide a constant income stream for those of modest means who rely on safer, less risk-prone vehicles, such as investment trusts and collective investment vehicles, for their pension income in later life. There is the added confusion, which we have yet to discuss, about what the successors will be to personal equity plans and savings schemes.
<P>
The clause does not help private investors at all. The Government should reconsider it and allow themselves, for once, to be shown that they were perhaps a little hasty. They should take on board the amendment rather than putting the dampers, yet again, on a successful part of the investment world.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I support the amendment because the clause is a hugely disproportionate response to a potential problem. However, I see two arguments against the amendment, which I expect the Government to advance when they respond. The first is the revenue raised by the proposal. One of my hon. Friends has already asked how much that is likely to be and my understanding, which I hope the Economic Secretary will confirm, is that it will be in the region of &#163;250 million a year. One can see that removing this form of tax privilege would give a relatively small but significant boost to the Revenue, but a boost that is nowhere near proportionate to the damage that will be done to inward investment, the reputation of the City of London and, most importantly, the needs of small and medium-sized investors.
<P>
The second argument that I imagine Labour Members will deploy is equity, in the non-technical sense. Just as it was always the case that an investor should be no worse off investing through an investment trust than in the underlying securities, so the logic of the Government's position presumably is that an investment through an investment trust should not be unduly privileged when compared with investment in underlying securities.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have made clear earlier in the debate, that second argument falls, particularly where the Government are interested in encouraging savings and a long-term attitude to saving.
<P>
Private investment has spread beyond the more traditional means, including building societies, into equity-related vehicles. That has been a great advance over the past 18 years or so, and it has now become non-controversial. That is good because it gives people a wider spread of their investments and it gives individuals access to those periods of higher growth in income that equity investment offers over fixed-income investment. It also gives people a more direct stake in the prosperity of British industry as a whole. For those reasons, I doubt whether the Government would seek to discourage the vehicles that encourage private individuals to invest in equities.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that investment trusts and other collective investment vehicles, including unit trusts, are the ideal introduction to that means of equity investment. The traditional aunt Agatha--I am not sure whether my hon. Friend has an aunt Agatha, but if he has I am sure that we shall hear about her at some stage in this debate--and the traditional small investor have always been advised not to choose individual shares. Their introduction to the stock market should come through such collective investments.
<P>
I make half a point to the Government. I might be argued that one of the current problems for small shareholders in equities in this country is that those investments are probably too greatly skewed towards the privatised companies. Many millions of people have held on to the individual shares that they were sold--probably at a discount--during the period of privatisation, and they do not now have a sufficiently balanced portfolio. The stage after individual equity investments--which will come round again with the various flotations of building societies, which will allow millions more people to hold individual equities--is typically the collective investment vehicle, which should have privileged tax treatment. That is precisely what the Government are seeking to deny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that over &#163;60 billion is invested in those investment trust companies, which represents 4&#183;5 per cent. of the total value of the stock exchange? Significant investments by ordinary people are involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has expertise in this area, for adding some figures to my argument. He is right. Extremely large vehicles are involved--they are both safe and admirable vehicles for small investors to invest in.
<P>
In debates such as these we often overlook the fact that the vehicles will not be unduly privileged. If the amendment is agreed to, investment trusts will not get a completely free ride. They can reclaim their tax credits only if they give up some of their tax-allowable expenses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that higher-rate taxpayers who have investment trust shares will have to pay additional tax anyway? Those shareholders' affluence will be picked up in the overall amount of tax that they pay, whether or not the regime is adopted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a good point. As long as the vehicles remain successful--and pay out the dividends that increase the income of those who hold the underlying shares--the Revenue will not lose out too much.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are numerous arguments against abolishing section 242 of the original Taxes Act 1988, which the clause will abolish. As has already been said, investments in UK equities will be put at a disadvantage. The problem is that those vehicles do not have taxable income against which to offset allowable expenses, which will put them at a disadvantage. After a long period when inward investment in Britain--both direct investment and investment through equities--has been so successful, it seems bizarre for the Government to pursue a policy that will not only discourage foreign investment, but will possibly actively encourage British investors to look abroad for investment opportunities. No doubt the Government will argue that that will happen only at the margins and that there are many other strong reasons for investing in Britain. All that is true, but it seems odd to skew the tax system in a way that encourages investment overseas.
<P>
The Government have argued that they want to remove the bias in favour of distribution in the form of dividends rather than the retention of profits for investment. The Economic Secretary and I have already discussed the City university business school analysis, in which she claims to have found support for her argument that tax credits distort investment decisions. After some time reading this report, I found one half sentence that could be so construed, but having re-read the report, it seems to argue overwhelmingly that those companies that distribute a large part of their profits in dividends also invest most and grow most because of their commitment to research and development.
<P>
In relation to investment trusts, the Government's idea that companies should retain profits for investment rather than distribute them is irrelevant because, by law, investment trusts are required to pay out the vast majority of their income as dividends, Given that they are required to do that, it would seem to be an unusually punitive and unfair use of the tax system to punish them for doing so. I trust that the Economic Secretary will consider the proposition that, as a general principle, expenses should be allowable for corporation tax purposes. The effect of the clause will be that UK equity-based funds will be the only significant body of taxable entities that do not attract relief for their expenses. That is unfair and damaging to those extremely important investment vehicles.
<P>
The hon. Lady is not so much using a sledgehammer to crack a nut--although there is an element of that in her proposals--but in trying to reduce everything to a level playing field, the problems that she is creating, compared with the problems that the clause tries to solve, are disproportionate. If the Government are determined to follow that course, they must fine tune their approach and consider what they are trying to achieve in terms of promoting the interests of the City, promoting long-term savings for British industry and promoting the growth of private sector investment in equities and, through them, British industry.
<P>
I hope that the Government are as committed to those aims as the previous Government were and Conservative Members still are. If so, I urge them to accept the amendment, which, at the cost of a relatively small amount of revenue, will allow small and medium-sized private investors to continue to enjoy tax privileges for important collective investment vehicles that have proved extremely successfull and provide a very effective way of channelling private money into British industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment exposes yet another of the unintended consequences of the Bill and, indeed, the second unintended consequence so far identified in the clause. The clause would cause severe damage to investment trust companies. For capital gains purposes, investment trust companies receive those increases in capital tax free, although they are taxed on every other item of income. As a quid pro quo for that benefit, they are not permitted to distribute those capital gains. They are compelled, however, to distribute 85 per cent. of their income. Investment trust companies are not taxed on dividends they have recieved.
<P>
Another aspect of investment trust companies is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has pointed out, they can borrow. They tend to gear up and borrow so that they can engage in further investments. That is why they are especially attractive to amateur investors, whose investments can be increased substantially by the fact that the vehicles in which they invest can borrow, invest in further shares and make other investments. Investment trust companies will not only have a significant dividend income--which will give rise to significant surplus franked investment income--but significant interest expense and management expense items. They have massive surplus franked investment income combined with massive unrelieved interest and managment expense, and they offset one against the other. They offset their surplus expenses with their surplus franked investment income and obtain a repayment of the tax credit. Under the clause that will no longer be possible and the rate of return available to them will be substantially reduced.
<P>
As I pointed out earlier, it is ironic that those vehicles are specifically designed for long-term investments. The people who invest in them--the 100,000 investors in the foreign and colonial investments trust, for example--want to leave their money in those trusts for a significant time. Because those trusts are close-ended, the investment managers know that they will not have to sell investments short term to repay the investments to their shareholders, and those managers can happily make long-term investments in the knowledge that they will not have to pay out capital, just the income when it arises. Those investment trust companies represent &#163;60 billion of assets which, in turn, represents 8 or 9 per cent. of the total of &#163;650 billion of pension fund assets. A colossal sum is invested in long-term assets--some 4.5 per cent. of the total capitalisation of the stock exchange.
<P>
The clause will damage the long-term investment possibilities of the City of London. That is extremely damaging. To give the Government their due, however, I suspect that their measure was not deliberately intended to have that effect--it is another consequence of the fact that the Bill's drafting was rushed and that the Government have not considered the consequences for investment trust companies.
<P>
There are four principal reasons why clause 20 is bad for investment trust companies. First, it will discourage long-term investment in UK equities. There is no relief for expenses, which will damage the UK's prospects as a centre for collective investment. Many fund managers who want to run such funds will have to take their collective funds overseas to jurisdictions where they can obtain a reduction for their interest and management expenses. That is the only way for them to restore the rate of return required for those investment trust company vehicles to remain competitive.
<P>
The second aspect which my hon. Friends mentioned earlier is the notion of profit retention. One of the Government's mantras is that paying out dividends is bad for investment and for the success of the economy. The reverse, of course, is true. The Government propose to create a distortion--at the moment, the distribution or retention of profits is neutral--in the capital markets by creating an artificial incentive for companies to retain their profits.
<P>
I do not know why the clause has been inadvertently applied to investment trust companies. We all know that they are obliged by law to distribute 85 per cent. of their income. What is the point of a clause designed to discourage companies from distributing their profits when investment trust companies are obliged to distribute their profits? Applying that measure to such a company is bound to have huge unintended consequences. It will render the vehicles uneconomic and severely damage the way in which they are marketed in the City of London.
<P>
It could be argued--and this brings me to my third criticism--that investment trust companies could shift their investments to capital growth-based investments to avoid the problem. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry explained, many capital investment trusts are not able to shift their investment patterns because they are obliged to pay out and the people who invest in the trusts are reliant on income received from them. The Government might be establishing an inequitable bias against those investors who have deliberately set out to acquire an income-producing vehicle. They cannot deal with the problem in such a way.
<P>
My final point involves the anti-avoidance element of the clause. No doubt the Economic Secretary will say that the clause is essential because without it section 242 relief will be used by investment trust companies to avoid the provisions in clause 19 that remove the tax credit on dividend income. The provisions in section 242 have allowed relief for a long time and go beyond 1988--the 1988 Act merely consolidated many ancient Acts of Parliament. To remove the relief just for an anti-avoidance measure is intolerable. The anti-avoidance measures in clause 28 will deal adequately with the problems that the Government want to avoid. That clause is specifically designed to avoid the problem created when people artificially apply the tax credits to another party who would otherwise not have been able to benefit from them.
<P>
That is the gist of my argument why the clause is inappropriate for investment trust companies. I very much hope that the Government will accept the amendment which, by adding subsection (8), would remove the effects of clause 20 from investment trust companies. It will do an enormous amount to prevent damage being inflicted on the City of London and on hundreds of thousands of investors. The Government will be grateful in the long term that the anomaly has been pointed out-both by Opposition Members and by the Association of Investment Trust Companies, which has set out the unjust nature of the effect of the clause on its industry. It would help the City of London and the country if the Government could for once swallow their pride and accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the next hon. Member to speak, I advise the Committee that in view of the wide-ranging debate on the amendment and, indeed, on the previous group of amendments, I am minded to exercise my powers under Standing Orders to prevent debate on clause stand part. I hope that that information is helpful to hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Before you take a final decision on that matter, will you listen to representations?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, I fear not. The decision will be mine. I am giving the Committee prior warning for the simple reason that it may be helpful to all members of the Committee who want to speak. They will be able to incorporate into their remarks anything that they would wish to say in a clause stand part debate. I am trying to be helpful, but I shall make the decision come the time.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Further to that point of order, Mrs. Winterton. Obviously, it would be nice to know whether you have already made that final decision or whether you are simply contemplating making it. The two amendments we have tabled to the clause have dealt with relatively narrow areas of its potential impact--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The decision will be made by me. I have said what I am minded to do. I also said that although the amendments have been quite narrowly drawn, our debates have been wide ranging. I am perfectly within my powers not to allow a clause stand part debate. I gave notice of that possibility to try to be helpful to members of the Committee; perhaps in future I shall not try to be so helpful. I now call Mr. Davies to make his speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must take that as an invitation to make such remarks now as I would wish to make both on amendment No. 29 and on the clause as a whole. I should not want to refrain from making my general remarks in the hope of there being a clause stand part debate later and then find that I was precluded from speaking to the clause. I trust that I have correctly understood your wishes in the matter, Mrs. Winterton. Perhaps I may be so bold as to take your silence for consent.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. You are always bold, Mr. Davies. You make your judgments and I will make mine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In the circumstances, I think that it would be sensible for me to adopt a low-risk strategy.
<P>
I had not intended to try to catch your eye to speak to the amendment, Mrs. Winterton, until I heard the excellent speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, for Ashford and for East Worthing and Shoreham. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has evidently inherited from his distinguished predecessor not merely his constituency but his knowledge of complex financial matters. We all had the privilege of hearing his predecessor on such subjects, and it was always worth while.
<P>
The reason I wanted to speak to amendment No. 29 is that it seems to me worth while to hold up to public view for a little longer what is the emerging picture of this Budget and its impact on savings in this country. The point has been well made, over and over again, that the effect of the Government's measures will be to reduce the aggregate return on savings, and therefore to reduce savings, which is the opposite of what the country needs.
<P>
I want to focus for a moment on a matter that I would have thought would be close to the heart of the Labour party--it certainly used to be in the days of old Labour-- which is the distributional impact of the Government's selection of savings measures in the Budget. As I hope to demonstrate to the Committee, that impact will be extraordinarily perverse and unjust. Most small savers who have any equity hold only privatisation shares. Millions of people--about half of the 9 million shareholders in this country--hold only privatisation shares, so the poorest and smallest shareholders will be hit by the windfall tax. We have spoken about that in earlier debates. The broad range of people--millions of people--who have any sort of interest in a pension fund, endowment policy or life insurance will also suffer from the Budget.
<P>
As my hon. Friends said in their excellent and lucid analyses of clause 20, there has been a significant impact on collective savings vehicles such as investement trusts, which are designed primarily for the small saver. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that the estimated reduction in their potential yield would be high: 0.3 per cent. for a general investment trust and 0.8 per cent. for a trust with average leverage. Those are significant elements in the total return.
<P>
If that was not enough, we have discovered that the investors who will suffer most will be those who have bought the income stream of split-level investment trusts, not the higher-risk, perhaps more sophisticated investors who have bought the capital gains in a split-level investment trust. There will be a direct and invidious impact on people such as the mother or maiden aunt of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
That seems to be part of a pattern and, over the next two days, we need to establish definitively whether it is deliberate or whether it is the consequence of an unintended muddle. We owe it to the country to make clear beyond peradventure the origin of these extremely damaging measures, which will have harmful consequences in aggregate on the economy and unfair consequences for individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend is making an interesting argument. He is absolutely right to say that the clause will damage smaller investors--precisely those who were advised by a number of IFAs to invest in the income proportion of the split trusts because such high-income trusts were deemed to be the most beneficial for personal equity plans. It is the smaller investors who will be hit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for endorsing my interpretation. Let me again interpret silence as consent--not yours this time, Mrs. Winterton, but that of Labour Members, who are making no attempt to dispute our analysis of the potential impact. Despite the admirable and astonishing success of the Mandelson propaganda machine in preventing the British people from appreciating the full impact of the Finance Bill when it was first published, I have no doubt that, in the weeks and months to come, the public will realise quite how badly they have been served.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware of the letter to the Chief Secretary from the chairman of Brewin Dolphin Holdings plc investment trust company? The chairman points out that the company structured its split-capital trusts in the full knowledge of section 242 claims, only to find that suddenly the claims are no longer available. He says that, as a result of the change, the trust's
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``policies and managements aims have now been sorely upset to the detriment of their long term shareholders''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am afraid that I was not favoured by the chairman of that investment trust with a copy of his letter to the Treasury, but I am not surprised that he sent such a letter. The trusts find themselves in an invidious position. They have been established and have sold their shares, which are now in the hands of the public. The management of the investment trust have fiduciary responsibility to make the best of a bad situation, but they must fulfil the terms of the articles of the Association of Investment Trust Companies and the policies set out in the prospectus, so they can do nothing to protect their investors from such a retrospectively imposed levy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Are you, Mrs. Winterton, also aware of the letter written to the Chief Secretary from Brewin Dolphin Holdings? It raises several important points, to which some of my hon. Friends have referred--particularly the point that we have seen referred to consistently throughout the Budget, namely the Government's appalling haste and lack of consultation and the way in which they have ignored representations. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It has taken a few days for some Trusts and their management companies to get to grips with the problems that have arisen''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the problems, that is, that have arisen as a result of the Budget--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``during which time we have been in close touch with some of the most `extreme' cases where the lack of a 242 claim will bite hard.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford has had the chance to consider how serious an impact those changes will have on the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward). It is astonishing that we have not yet discovered the truth of the matter, but it is inconceivable that even such an incompetent Government would embark upon an attack on section 242--as the Government have done--without wide-ranging consultation. It seems the most elementary prudence to consult on such a matter in some depth before putting pen to paper. Members of the Committee also do not know--and I think that the Economic Secretary should tell us--whether the hon. Lady is in the business of putting up a front of defiance in Committee while preparing behind the scenes for a retreat by tabling amendments on Report or later, or whether the Government are committed to those invidious and discriminatory measures that my hon. Friend's have so effectively exposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is may hon. Friend aware of any consultation between the Government and the venture capital industry? Some of the largest investment trusts are invested in venture capital and small start-up businesses--3i, for example, is quoted on the FTSE index as on eof the largest investment trusts. The measure will be a serious attack on fledgling higher risk but higher return businesses, which are the life blood of the small business sector that the Government have been telling us the Budget is designed to encourage. Yet again, small businesses wil fall foul of the ill-though-out red herring that is being dangled before us.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Again, I am not aware of any representations from the venture capital industry. People may have written to me, but I have either not received the letter or not had the opportunity to read it. However, I can imagine their concern on behalf of their members.
<P>
The two amendments to the clause with which we have dealt demonstrated the appalling impact of the measures, but they dealt with only a limited part of the range of the clause. Amendment No. 10, which unfortunately was defeated, was an attempt to preserve the position of companies that had sought and received relief for excess ACT at 20 per cent.--the Economic Secretary eventually agreed that it was at only 20 per cent.--and which are now to be disbarred from claiming the full relief due to them at the mainstream corporation rate unless they are given a period in which to revoke their earlier claim for relief or otherwise establish their entitlement to full relief. However, that is a temporary issue that deals with the position of companies that find themselves trapped because they operated rationally and properly under the previous regime, but which now find that the system is to be retrospectively changed to their disdvantage.
<P>
We then had the debate on amendment No. 29, which deals with the position of investment trusts. However, serious though those matters are and serious though the impact of the clause will be on those two separate groups of companies, they represent only a tiny part of the problem because all kinds of company--potentially, all the companies in the country--will be affected by the destruction of section 242.
<P>
<H5>7.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Again, we must ask why that is happening and what the consequences will be. As I read the clause--I am sure that the Economic Secretary will let me know if I am misreading it--all companies will find themselves unable, if they run into losses, to gain the benefit of ACT interim relief. Indeed, a company that makes a loss and does not in future become profitable to the extent of having to pay mainstream corporation tax will never be able to claim that relief. New Labour has dreamed up an extraordinarily perverse and anti-progressive, even regressive, form of taxation, under which the least profitable companies will pay tax at a higher rate and the most profitable companies, which will ultimately pay mainstream corporation tax on their profits, will be able to gain the full measure of relief.
<P>
It will not have escaped the attention of the Economic Secretary that, on that basis, some companies will go under. Those companies that make losses will be unable to gain the benefit of the 20 per cent. relief on their ACT that they can gain today, which is deducted from dividends received. That financial contribution, that cash-flow contribution, might have made all the difference to their survival.
<P>
What the Economic Secretary has conceived in clause 20--it is an effective achievement--will increase the volatility of the earnings of British companies, removing what might otherwise have been an effective smoothing of their earnings, thereby increasing the risk of bankruptcy. That is not a very positive achievement, but it is remarkable. The new Labour--or, if she prefers it, socialist--Economic Secretary has brought to the House a piece of regressive or anti-progressive legislation, which will result in companies paying tax at a higher rate if they do not make a profit or if their profits are lower. That is an extraordinary state of affairs. [Laughter.] The Economic Secretary laughs. Is it a laughing matter for the Labour party? When the Economic Secretary reads this description of the Bill in Hansard tomorrow, will she expect the public to be amused by what the Government are doing? Or will she see a way to defend herself? It is a serious matter, not a laughing matter. The country demands a clear explanation. The Economic Secretary should explain in detail why the Government decided to make an attack on section 242--she still has not told us.
<P>
The Economic Secretary slightly let slip this afternoon that she thought that that was a necessary counterpart to the abolition of the dividend tax credit. Can she explain why? It is not clear why those two factors are necessarily linked. When she decided to attack section 242, did she anticipate the entirely perverse and illogical consequences that my hon. Friends and I have endeavoured to point out this afternoon? If she did not, will she do something about it and, if she did not consult, now consult urgently? If the hon. Lady did anticipate those consequences, she should take full responsibility for a piece of thoroughly destructive and utterly disgraceful legislation. The one consolation is that the Government's reputation in the business world is unlikely ever to survive.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This might be a convenient moment to suspent the sitting for dinner. I suggest that we return at 9 pm, which gives us five minutes under and hour and a half.
<P>
<H5>7.35 pm</H5>

Sitting suspended.
