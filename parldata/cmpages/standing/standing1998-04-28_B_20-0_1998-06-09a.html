Clause 88 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Extended sentences for sex and violent offenders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 450, in page 63, line 4, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995'<P>

<P>
and insert `1995 Act'.
<P>
This drafting amendment will improve the wording of the clause. The relevant Act is defined elsewhere in the Bill as the 1995 Act, so the more detailed description is redundant.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 63, leave out lines 7 to 12 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a violent offence, the court may, if it (a) intends to pass a determinate sentence of four years or more; and'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 229, in page 63, line 18, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Where a person is convicted on indictment of a sexual offence and the court proposes to pass a determinate sentence of imprisonment the court shall pass an extended sentence on the offender unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstance which would justify not extending the period (if any) for which the offender would, apart from this section, be subject to a licence.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Laing:</B> The Minister said that Government amendment No. 450 was designed to make the clause clearer. These amendments have the same aim. Like many Opposition amendments, they are designed not to change the Bill's effects but to improve it and to make it clearer.
<P>
The amendments have the same aim as the Bill except in one respect. They would give the courts further discretion in dealing with sexual offenders and the power to take into consideration the exceptional circumstances that might arise when someone is convicted of a sexual offence.
<P>
The Bill treats violent offences and sexual offences in exactly the same way. Amendment No. 299 would give the courts more discretion, because we recognise that sexual offences are committed in a wide range of circumstances and for a wide range of reasons. Mere punishment is not always necessary. Sometimes remedial action should be taken to protect the community and the person accused of the crime. That person may need remedial help rather than mere punishment.
<P>
Amendment No. 299 would give the courts greater discretion and it would allow them to consider exceptional circumstances. At present, the Bill does not do that.I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Extended sentences, especially for sex offenders, will play a crucial part in reassuring the community. It is to be hoped that such sentences will also help the offenders. It is clear that society is still taking time to come to terms with certain crimes, especially sex offences against children, and needs to find an understanding of how to deal with them.
<P>
There are regimes, such as that in Peterhead prison, based on Canadian models, which seem to have some beneficial effects. Given some of the recent crimes that have taken place in the north-east, people would be reassured to know that there was some way of breaking the cycle of offending. In some cases in my constituency, it has been shown that if that cycle cannot be broken, the offending becomes worse at the next offence. I await the Minister's comments about whether the amendments would achieve the goal of breaking that cycle of reoffending.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) suggested that these are technical, drafting amendments. Despite her valiant effort, I think that they are more than that. However, I accept that we are discussing difficult and sensitive areas of criminal justice. It is a tough matter.
<P>
There are problems with violence and sex offending in society. However, the amendments would require the courts to impose an extended sentence on all sex offenders on whom a sentence of imprisonment was to be imposed, unless there were exceptional reasons not to do so. In the case of violent offenders, the courts would retain discretion about whether to impose an extended sentence.
<P>
The Government intend that extended sentences should be imposed only when it is considered that the period for which the offender would otherwise be subject to a licence would not be adequate to protect the pubic from serious harm from the offender. The existing law provides for automatic post-release supervision for all those sentenced to four years or more. In some cases, that might be all that is needed. Courts should not be required to impose an extended sentence when they have no reason to do so. If there is no indication when convicting a person for a sexual offence that there is any need for the period of supervision to be longer than normal, the court would have no justification for imposing an extended sentence.
<P>
In relation to violent offences, we are considering four-year sentences, plus supervision for up to five years. However, in relation to sex offenders, the sentence could be of any length with an extension of up to 10 years.
<P>
I accept the point made by the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) about sex offenders, that during both the period of imprisonment and the period of supervision there should be a requirement for the provision of treatment and rehabilitation. In that area of criminal justice, there has not been a good success story. However, the scheme at Peterhead is valuable and imaginative and I hope that that work will soon be extended to other Scottish prisons.
<P>
The Government have achieved the right balance on extended sentences and I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> After listening carefully to the Minister's remarks, I appreciate that we all aim to achieve the same results: namely, that people who have been found guilty of a sexual or a violent offence should not merely be punished, but should also be supervised. The length of the period of supervision should be such that members of the local community feel safe and have confidence that a person who has been found guilty of a sexual offence and is likely to offend again, especially when children are concerned, should be adequately supervised.
<P>
I accept the Minister's reassurances on the matter and, given the number of Members on the Government Benches, I realise that there is little point in pressing the amendment to a vote. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 451, in page 63, line 19, after `sentence' insert

<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> These are truly technical and drafting amendments. They would clarify the intended effects of the clauses about extended sentences for Scotland, with particular reference to the definition of an extended sentence as a sentence of imprisonment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 452, in page 63, line 22, leave out `under' and insert `by virtue of'. [Mr. McLeish.]

<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 453, in page 63, line 30, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A court shall, before passing an extended sentence, consider a report by a relevant officer of a local authority about the offender and his circumstances and, if the court thinks it necessary, hear that officer.'
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 457.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> The amendment would bring the Scottish provisions into line with those already considered with respect to England and Wales, by requiring the court to obtain a pre-sentence report before an extended sentence could be imposed. In England and Wales the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides for that, so no express provision in the Bill is needed.
<P>
A report would clearly be necessary if an extended period of supervision were being considered, given that the court would need to reach a view about the risk posed by the offender and how long a period of additional supervision might be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I welcome the provision for pre-sentence reports, but what soundings has the Minister taken among the relevant offices in Scotland? Some concern is felt in England about the possibility of delays caused by pre-sentence reports, where the probation service is insufficiently resourced to produce them in time. Reassurance that the process will be a speedy one would be useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I can give the necessary assurances. We want extended sentences to be based on risk assessment. That is not an exact science, but we are, like the other concerned bodies involved in criminal justice social work and the court system, aware of the importance of the issue. We are serious in our intentions. There is no point in setting up an elaborate court process without the reporting and other procedures that are necessary to it.<P>

<P>

<P>
Intensive consultation took place in the run up to the Bill. More work will follow and I hope that by the time the Bill is implemented we shall have a better idea of the extent of the information required. Risk assessment is critical. The big problem in Scotland is public protection. Concern about sex offending is widespread. The provision is only part of a wider strategy to ensure that the public feel safe in their communities, streets and homes, and I have no doubt that we are making significant progress in England, Wales and Scotland. The reports are crucial to the relevant prisoners' well-being, and to the court system.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 63, line 32, leave out `shall not' and insert `may.'

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 454 and 455.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I shall not try to convince the Minister that amendment No. 296 is simply technical. Although the amendment is short, its effect would be significant.
<P>
Proposed new section 210A(4) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 states:<P>

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The term of an extended sentence passed for a statutory offence shall not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment provided for in the statute in respect of that offence."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would substitute "may"	 for "shall not"	. That would enable the court to impose an extended sentence that exceeded
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the maximum term of imprisonment provided for in the statute in respect of that offence."	
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Proposed new section 210(A)(1)(b) provides for an extension of the licence to protect the public from serious harm. Therefore, the length of the extension that the court can impose should not be limited. If the court believes that the period of a licence for someone who has been convicted of a violent or sexual offence should be longer than the maximum to protect the public from harm, it should be allowed to extend that period. It does not make sense to claim that the intention of the clause is to protect the public from serious harm while tying the court's hands by preventing it from protecting the public indefinitely, if the court considers that necessary.
<P>
The amendment would give the court further discretion. It would not impose a specific length of sentence, but would allow an extended sentence for a statutory offence to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment by replacing the words "shall not"	 in line 32 of the clause with "may"	. If the Government seriously want to effect the clause's main purpose, which is to protect the public from serious harm, they should not constrain the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's argument. The words "shall not exceed"	 tie the court's hands. That is undesirable. Substituting "may"	 for "shall not"	 gives wider discretion, which will be more useful to the courts.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for making the point so succinctly.
<P>
If the Government intend to protect the public from serious harm, how can they limit that protection to a specific length of time? It is not for the Committee to determine the length of time for which the public should be protected from potential serious harm from a person who has been convicted of a serious sexual or violent offence. That discretion should belong to the court, which has all the information that it needs to decide the length of time for which the public deserves to be protected from serious harm from a particular offender. Let us remember that, to a great extent, the term "the public"	 in our discussions means children who are potentially at risk from sexual offenders.
<P>
The court should have full, not limited, discretion to protect the public, which is the primary intent of the clause. I therefore commend the amendment, as it serves that purpose.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> It might help if the Minister could clarify whether, if it became apparent towards the end of an extended sentence that a sex offender was still potentially a threat to society, the chief constable could apply for a sex offender order to provide the public with the protection that would no longer be available from the sentence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I support the amendment because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest pointed out, it would be enormously helpful for the courts to have the maximum discretion in this area. I do not see that there is any great support for any limitation of the court's discretion. If the public were asked, they would undoubtedly support our amendment giving the courts the maximum discretion rather than limiting it in any way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I listened carefully to the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest. They carry great force and were delivered with vigour and enthusiasm. Is there one good reason why an extended sentence should not exceed the maximum term? I can think of none.
<P>
I should like to give an English parallel, although I am not sure that it applies in Scotland. The maximum sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse, which we shall be considering later today, is currently two years. There are tremendous varieties of culpability for that offence, ranging from the very serious to the moderately minor. A repeat offender might merit a much longer, extended sentence, but at present he could not be given a term longer than the maximum two-year sentence.
<P>
Why should not the extended sentence, on occasion, exceed the maximum? There must be occasions when it would be merited. What is the justification for saying that it must never do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Before responding to the amendment,I shall move the Government amendments in thatgroup, amendments Nos. 454 and 455. These drafting amendments remove a possible ambiguity about the extent of sheriff's sentencing powers in relation to the extended sentence.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendments can be dealt with formally at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I turn now to the amendment No. 296. As was highlighted by some hon. Members, the situation in Scotland is appreciably different from that in England. Most of these offences are dealt with under common law. Very tough life sentences are available in the High Court and, under solemn procedure in the sheriff court, there is a limit of three years. The position of the initial sentence differs from that in England and Wales in that the judge is allowed enormous discretion about the severity of punishment that can be meted out.
<P>
We must distinguish between that initial sentence and the extended sentence in the clause. The amendment would enable the courts to impose extended sentences on sexual and violent offenders without regard to the maximum statutory penalties thought appropriate by Parliament and laid down in legislation. It is not the intention that the courts should be given the power to ignore the wishes of Parliament in relation to specific offences by imposing longer sentences in such cases. The existing wording of the clause is therefore intended to ensure that the maximum sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum penalty. Similar provision is made for England and Wales by clause 55(5).
<P>
If it were thought necessary to increase the maximum penalties for statutory offences, the appropriate means to achieve that end would be by amending the provisions in the relevant legislation. It would not be appropriate to increase the maximums by amendment to the extended sentence provisions.
<P>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment, especially in light of the tough approach that has already been taken. The Bill introduces significant new powers to deal with violent and sexual offenders. It is vital that the courts operate within the framework laid down by Parliament, but they have enormous discretion. Judges in Scotland use that discretion, and I have no doubt that they will continue to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I advise the Minister that, although he will be requested to move Government amendments at the appropriate time, he should speak to them before amendment No. 296 is disposed of. If he has anything further to say on the Government amendments grouped with amendment No. 296, he should say it in this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest made an interesting point, but I wonder whether she could reflect further on it. The Minister has made a valuable contribution, and Parliament should decide what the sentences should be. If the amendment were accepted, it would enable the courts to override Parliament. That would be a mistake.
<P>
It is an interesting probing amendment, and it was important to have this debate. We must, however, preserve the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and not allow the courts to use the mechanism of extended sentences to impose sentences that are far greater than Parliament intended.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I want clarification on the order in which things may occur. At what point can a chief constable apply for a sex offender order? Will he be able to apply for the order while the sentence is being served, or will he have to wait until it has ended?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> A breach of the extended sentence provision will provide a basis for reconviction before the end of the sentence. Sex offender orders will cover those who have been guilty of serious offences. If there is any concern in a local community after a sentence has ended, the chief constable and the police may act in conjunction with the local authority to apply for a sex offender order. However, I shall write to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine to clarify the points that I have just made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine to wind up the debate, may I inform the Minister that now is the appropriate time to speak to Government amendments Nos. 454 and 455.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I am sorry that I created confusion, but I attempted to speak to them earlier.
<P>
Amendments No. 454 and 455 are drafting amendments that remove a possible ambiguity about the extent of sheriffs' sentencing powers in relation to extended sentences. Sheriffs sitting with a jury may impose a custodial sentence of up to three years and the maximum extension period that they may impose with a custodial sentence of any length is three years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation and to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), who referred to an important point of principle with which I do not disagree.
<P>
The clause still worries me and I seek further reassurance from the Minister. What powers will a court have to deal with someone convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence if the public need to be protected from that person for longer than the statutory maximum sentence provided for in the Bill? The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine made a good point about the operation of sex offender orders and, in principle, all members of the Committee are in favour of the Bill's provisions in that matter.
<P>
However, I am genuinely concerned that without amendment No. 296 the courts will not have the discretion to protect the public for as long as it is considered to be necessary. That is not a political point, nor a drafting point. If the Minister can reassure me that the courts will be given that discretion by other means, I will happily withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that the situation in Scotland is quite different from that in England and Wales. I accept the Minister's comments about the situation in England and Wales, as I am not fully aware of it. My point is purely practical.

<P>

<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I cannot give the hon. Lady any reassurance about the discretion of the courts. There are formidable powers in the Scottish court system, under initial sentencing; first, to impose punishment which is the essential aim and, secondly, to take some cognisance of the need for public protection.
<P>
The Government's measures, north and south of the border, would take the public protection issue much, much further than has ever been done before. That should reassure the hon. Member for Epping Forest. We are proposing a period of 10 years as part of the extended sentence for sex offenders, regardless of the initial sentence length. That is a formidable power. The current powers in the High Court and in the sheriff court, and the discretion to award extended sentences of up to 10 years for sexual offences and up to five years for violent offences will provide an array of weapons for the courts and the judiciary and will protect the public.
<P>
My response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough is that there must be a sentencing framework, however it is defined. The framework should be set out in Parliament, in statute, and discretion can then be exercised in the court system.
<P>
The bottom line is that the Government want to make a greater attempt to protect the public. That is why we have introduced these clauses. I can reassure the hon. Member for Epping Forest that in Scotland, as in England and Wales, there will be a tough range of powers available to the judiciary. That is as it should be. Parliament lays down a framework of statutes and the judiciary implements its powers within that framework.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 67, line 6, leave out `16' and insert `12'.
<P>
The amendment is similar to others considered in recent weeks, and would make the clause apply to persons aged 12 years or more, rather than 16 or more. The argument has been rehearsed under other clauses, so I shall not go into great detail. As I said in our previous sitting,I appreciate the differences between the system in England and Wales and that in Scotland for dealing with young people who are under 16. Children's panels operate differently from the system in England and Wales. The amendment does not try to bring the clause into line with provisions for England and Wales. We appreciate that a clause that applies to Scotland should be drafted differently.
<P>
We are worried by the high proportion of serious crimes connected with drugs that are committed by people who are under 16. The amendment draws that to the Committee's attention. Are the penalties that can be imposed on young adults who are dependent on drugs sufficient; and is enough help given to them? According to justified public opinion, people do not feel safe from young adults who commit the sort of crimes that we are considering.
<P>
We are not discussing children aged 10. Someone aged 10 or 12 is still a child, but a young person, especially a young man some weeks before his 16th birthday, is not a child, but a young adult, who has the physical strength and intellectual outlook of an adult. While I appreciate the difference between children's panels in Scotland and the system in England and Wales, we believe that the law should be strict with people aged between 12 and 16. They should not always be treated as children. Discretion should be used for example, when 14 or 15-year-olds clearly show that their behaviour, lifestyle and outlook are that of adults, and that they pose adult dangers to society.
<P>
We want to ensure that help is at hand for someone aged between 12 and 16 who is convicted of a serious drugs offence. There should be nothing in the Bill that, because of the existence of children's panels, prevents people under 16 from receiving the help, advice and guidance that they deserve and need to protect not only themselves but society.

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Perhaps it would be appropriate, Mr. O'Hara, to welcome the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) to the Committee and to his new job.
<P>
As a new Member, I am slightly disappointed that, although we had the debate on age in relation to an earlier amendment and came to terms with the different way in which things operate in Scotland, the principle was not accepted in this case. As the age limit drifted up towards 16, I could sense the hon. Member for Epping Forest beginning to accept that there could be misunderstandings at the lower end of the age scale, especially for 12-year-olds. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I join in welcoming my hon. Friendthe Member for Eastbourne to the Committee. The Opposition will no doubt continue to be toughly and tightly whipped for the remaining stages of the Committee and, where necessary, we shall force Divisions 
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne has a fearsome reputation, and that now that he has arrived our sittings may be extended well into the night?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I counsel caution before proceeding too far down that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I hope that we shall have a wide-ranging debate on a matter of principle. The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution missed earlier sittings of the Committee, but I can tell him that a key issue was the relationship between drugs and crime. It was common ground across the Committee that drugs are the most serious problem facing the criminal justice system. Anecdotal reports that I made to the Committee have been backed by official figures showing that, in much of England, up to 50 per cent. of crime is drug related. Those who sit in the Crown courts and stipendiary magistrates courts in London will tell one anecdotally that well over 50 per cent. of burglaries are committed not to have the benefit of those goods, but to sell the goods to raise money to buy drugs. If we could get drugs out of our country for ever, it would have a dramatic effect in reducing crime and the misery caused to families and society by drug use. The Minister will be interested to know that we debated those matters at some length when we talked about drug treatment and testing orders in relation to England and Wales.
<P>
Alarming figures have been released recently showing that in England we have a much greater problem with drug taking among young people than is desirable indeed, a much greater problem than we thought we had. A report that was published just before Christmas showed that England is almost top of the European league table for drug taking among young people. Alarming numbers of young people have experimented not only with cannabis but with harder drugs such as cocaine, LSD, heroin and the like. Those class A drugs are much more dangerous than class B drugs. The focus of the Committee's earlier discussions was on how best to provide support for youngsters who are involved in drugs.
<P>
I strongly support the amendment, as I am sure do my hon. Friends. There is a serious argument for applying drug treatment and testing orders in Scotland to youngsters aged 12 or over instead of restricting it to those aged 16 or over. The years between 12 and 16 are a critical time when outside influences may be at their strongest, youngsters are at their most vulnerable, and a great many of them may dabble in drugs and crime. Anything that can be done to stop that and my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest talked about help at hand anything that we can do to provide help will be vital.
<P>
With those general words, may I ask the Minister to tell us a little I have scant knowledge about parallel problems in Scotland? Does he believe that the Scottish problem is as serious as that in England? Where are the worst areas? Is it right that the centres of one or two Scottish cities have as big a youth drugs problem as we have here?
<P>
I do not know much about the methods of punishment and treatment in Scotland, but are they very different from those in England and Wales? Do we need to learn any lessons from Scotland? We would be glad to do so. Are there any innovative schemes in Scotland, or approaches to young people and drugs from which we could learn? Do Scottish schools have the same sort of education and training about drugs as we have in England and Wales? In short, I ask the Minister to give us some idea of how matters stand in Scotland as compared with England and Wales. The Minister will know that there is a serious problem in England and Wales; he will know why Opposition Members want the age limit for drug treatment and testing orders reduced to 12. I should be grateful for his observations on the Scottish scene generally and on how relevant Opposition Members' comments are to the position in Scotland.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said, the Liberal Democrat party does not believe that this amendment is the right approach. The Scottish criminal justice system uses its children's panels to deal with youngsters of that age.
<P>
We are worried about under-16s with drug problems. Recently I visited an excellent youth justice project in Sheffield which deals with serious repeat young offenders. The project workers had a remarkable success rate in reducing the frequency of offending and in stopping offending altogether except for two 14-year-old heroin addicts, upon whom they were unable to have any real impact. There was a clear correlation between their heroin addiction and the fact that this otherwise excellent programme had no influence on them at all.
<P>
A small number of under-16s with serious drug problems require treatment. However, we have to question the suitability of any treatment for under-16s, given that the Children Act 1989 and other legislation require specific provision to be made for them. The treatment programmes that are available for adults are often deemed not to be suitable, and there are very few treatment centres in the United Kingdom for under-16s. I would be interested to know from the Minister whether places are available or will be made available north of the border. There are also adult programmes for needle exchange and the prescription of heroin substitutes, which may make drug users less prone to go out on the streets and seek illegal sources of drugs. We must also discuss whether we should provide needle exchange or methadone to youngsters aged under 16.
<P>
Throughout our debates on drug treatment orders the key issue has been making treatment available. We ask the Government to show us that they have the will to make available treatment for under-16s as well as over-16s. The 14-year-old heroin addicts whom I mentioned earlier cannot wait the one or two years for treatment that perhaps a 30-year-old stable addict who is on heroin substitute could wait. People of that age must be treated immediately.
<P>
There is a correlation between the poorest in society and the most disadvantaged areas and much of the anecdotal evidence about drug use. For example, drug use in Scotland is related to areas of serious deprivation, especially in the cities.
<P>
Drug addiction is a factor in multiple deprivation. Those of the age of 14 with a serious drug problem may miss out on school, build a criminal record and end up in custody. It is tragic that their lives may be ruined at that age when we know that we could have helped them if we had been prepared to face the issue. Those youngsters can be offered treatment if we do not turn away from the problem because we find it too difficult to face. In the past, we sometimes found the problem too difficult, but we hope that the Bill will represent a turning point. However, we seek reassurance that treatment will be available for everyone of whatever age, but particularly for young people who have their whole lives ahead of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest on moving the amendment. Although we can debate whether 14 or 16 should be appropriate age and although the Minister can explain how Scotland differs from England, the debate has been important because it has focused the Committee's attention on the most serious law-and-disorder problem facing society dependence on drugs and the impetus that that gives to crime.
<P>
Only last week a distraught mother came to a surgery in my Gainsborough constituency and described the case of her son. He had been brought up in an exemplary household, but had acquired the drugs habit while at college. He had progressed on to heroin and, to feed his habit, he committed burglaries. He was due to appear before Lincoln Crown court and there was no doubt that he would be sent to prison.
<P>
On inquiring about the treatment available to such young people, the distraught mother was told, "This is Lincoln. There is no treatment available. If you are lucky, you might be able to apply to go to York or somewhere else."	 That case illustrates the problems people face.A young man from a good family fell into bad company perhaps through no fault of his own. He formed a drug habit, the fangs of which grip the person involved. One cannot get rid of the habit and one resorts to burglary. The addict's life and those of other people become a misery.
<P>
The addict eventually gets caught; perhaps, because he is an incompetent burglar. The court rights takes a serious view of the offence and locks him up. He is sent to a local prison where no proper treatment is available. After a few months, when society feels it has done its duty, he is let out and the whole process starts again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend paints a graphic picture. Is it not also possible that, when the offender is in a local prison, he finds all the drugs that he wants?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I recently made a day-long visit to my local prison of Lincoln. I make no criticism of the prison; I am sure that it is as good as any other local prison. On that visit, the governor showed me a striking collection of instruments I find it difficult to describe them that are used to make drugs. He described the extreme difficulty that the prison system has in keeping drugs out of prisons. Nothing is gained by sending offenders to such prisons, because they enter a vicious circle. That is why this debate is important.
<P>
We must find ways of breaking the drug habit. Drug treatment orders may be and probably are the right approach. We need to put the young people involved with drugs into a secure environment and provide them with sophisticated treatment when they are in, and after they leave, custody.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) made a graphic point when he said that there is no point in making provisions for England and Scotland and in putting fine words in the Bill if the resources are not there to deal with the problem. The sort of treatment that I have been describing, which is being pioneered in places like York, is expensive. I do not know the situation in Scotland and the Minister should tell us.
<P>
The Minister should not just dismiss the amendment with a few loose words to the effect that it is inappropriate because there are children's panels in Scotland and that the age in the Bill is good enough. If we do not want to go down as low as 12, certainly 14 would be appropriate. At 14, these youngsters are big boys and can cause alarm and fear. It is not just anecdotal evidence; we know that these 14-year-old boys are already gripped by dangerous habits.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Many girls are also sucked into the drug culture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is absolutely right. I hope the debate will focus our attention on exactly what resources the Government are making available and where. We have already had the debate on England and so have to limit the debate to Scotland; it will nevertheless be useful.I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will agree that, on Report, when we are dealing with not just Scotland but the United Kingdom as a whole, we can question the Government about exactly what is going on and what resources they can make available to deal with this, the most important problem facing society at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I shall be guided by you, Mr. O'Hara, as to how far we extend the debate. I agree with the sentiments and substance of the Opposition contributions. Drug taking is a menace and evil in modern society. Whether north or south of the border, it is the same problem. It varies in degree because of culture, geography and a range of other factors. It is at the heart of both the reform of youth justice in England and Wales and the review of the children's hearing system in Scotland. It has been linked to other issues that have been raised such as social exclusion.
<P>
There is a wide area of activity that I could speak about but I shall be brief. I would like to send hon. Members an extensive letter that will give details of programmes, alternatives and treatment and a whole range of activities that could go some way to tackle the issue. Our rejection of the amendment is not a rejection of the sentiments that have been expressed. Scotland has a different criminal justice system. We have a different set of provisions, procedures and institutions for the under-16s, but that should in no way be interpreted as a soft option on drugs or on anything else. Drug treatment and testing orders for the over-16s will be tough in themselves and an absolutely essential alternative to custody. The problems are very real.
<P>
The drugs tsar recently talked about education for five-year-olds. Although drug education is for life, that is an indication of the seriousness of the problem. Hon. Members also mentioned drug-related crime. If the figures in England and Wales are worse than in Scotland, they must be pretty high. The position in Scotland is not good. When people go to prison they go as punishment for their crime, but the real issue is often not so much their criminality as their drug dependency. The problem both in Scotland and in England and Wales is breaking the vicious cycle.
<P>
The amendment has been rejected by my English and Welsh colleagues. It is not appropriate for under-16s in Scotland, because we already have a broad range of provisions to tackle that issue.
<P>
I accept the seriousness of the points made by hon. Members, and we could discuss them for a long time. However, I wish to curtail my comments and will write to members of the Committee about the different jurisdictions and procedures in Scotland. I hope that my letter will be illuminating and that it will reinforce the need for all political parties, in the new Parliament in Scotland and in the Westminster Parliament, to work together to tackle the menace of drugs. That menace lies at the heart of much that is evil in society and I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed by Opposition Members.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> It is a great pleasure to hear the Minister say that he agrees with the sentiments of Opposition Members. We are all aiming for the same results and the amendment was designed to strengthen clause 81, not to change it.
<P>
We all recognise the importance of the fight against drugs and the extreme importance of the need to protect young people indeed, very young people from involvement in drugs in the first place. If people are helped and protected at an early age, when the worst damage occurs, the problem does not grow.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said that we had considered the substitution of the age of 12 for the age of 16 in other parts of the Bill. However, there are two reasons for a particular examination of the difference between 16 and 12 in relation to the clause. The first is that the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office did not hear the arguments made about other parts of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I was referring to our earlier debate about the different system for dealing with under 16-year-olds in Scotland. I thought that it was understood that if we were to change that system, it would be part of a major review of the Scottish criminal justice system and that it could not be done by a one-line amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman. I realise that the Minister heard the arguments that were made about under 16-year-olds in the Scottish system. However, it is only fair that he should also hear the arguments relating to that issue in other parts of the Bill. I do not criticise the Minister for not attending all the meetings of the Committee; he has had another Bill to deal with and at great length on the Floor of the House. However, he should be aware of the Opposition's deep anxiety about provisions relating to people aged between 12 and 16 under this Bill.
<P>
My second reason for wanting to examine the age provisions under clause 81 is because the clause relates to help for young people, not to punishment. The Minister said that he will write to members of the Committee to explain how the existing children's hearing system will ensure that there is help for young people and protection for the public in Scotland.
<P>
I am glad that the Government have not rejected the sentiments behind the amendment. We are all in agreement about what we want to achieve. I look forward to receiving the Minister's explanation and hope that he can convince us that the existing provisions, under the children's panel system, are sufficient. If we are not convinced, we reserve the right to revisit the matter at the next stage of consideration of the Bill. However, having heard the Minister's reassurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 68, line 12, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) The Secretary of State shall within two years of this section coming into effect and every two years thereafter publish a report on 
<P>
(a) the operation of drug treatment and testing orders, and
<P>
(b) until such time as they are available as sentences for courts throughout Scotland, the areas in which drug treatment and testing orders are available as sentences.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may discuss clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Amendment No. 295 is constructive.It would improve the Bill without changing its effect.It proposes that, every two years, the Secretary of State should publish a report on drug treatment and testing orders, and their operation in some parts of the country. It is not necessary to explain at length, the amendment's importance. The report that it proposes would draw the operation of the clause to the attention of the public, the authorities, Parliament, the new Scottish Parliament and everyone involved in drug treatment, and afford an opportunity for reflection on potential improvements and changes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The amendment would give the Minister the opportunity to tell us every two years about the provision of financial resources. There is no point in including worthy intentions in the Bill without providing the resources with which to effect them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. We intend to hold the Government to account for their promises to make funds available to tackle drug abuse. The amendment proposes a mechanism for achieving that.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government do not mind being held to account because we all agree about what we want to achieve. It is the Government's duty to realise intentions; it is our duty to hold the Government to account and to ensure that promises about funding for tackling the problem are kept, and that resources are used effectively. The amendment would facilitate that.
<P>
I have taken much time to discuss amendmentsNos. 297 and 295. Therefore, I am satisfied that I have made all the necessary points on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I welcome the amendment, although its wording may need to be tougher on Report.
<P>
The clause will play an important part in breaking the cycle of drug crime, which constitutes a serious problem in the north-east of Scotland. I praise the work of Grampian police in establishing a police box scheme to provide resources to local schools, raise awareness of drugs and thus help children to understand the problem, and to avoid drugs. Grampian police were also praised in a recent inspector's report for their work in tackling a serious drug-related crime wave in the north-east.
<P>
I stress to my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam that the drugs problem is created not only by deprivation but by wealth. The wealth of some of the north-east of Scotland's industries has led to all sectors of the community being dragged into drug crime. Much serious dealing and related crime has developed. Treatment is therefore crucial. However, as the hon. Member for Epping Forest pointed out, unless the Government make resources available, the provision will merely be pious words.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (3)(a) seems to be a let-out clause. The orders will become available only as, when and if the Government provide the necessary resources. Will the Minister reassure us that that is a transitional provision and that it will become irrelevant once the resources become available? It would be disastrous if arrangements were not in place. The problem would become even greater if resources were available in some parts of Scotland, but not in others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> These matters will be devolved. Therefore, is the hon. Gentleman disappointed that, as the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, he will have no say on them and nor will we? If he remains a Member of this House, he will be able to debate drug treatment orders in England, but not those in his own Scotland.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I advise the hon. Gentleman to ignore that point.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I will say that I welcome the fact that the Government will be held much more accountable for implementing the Bill than they would otherwise have been. Such accountability is crucial. Asking a random Scottish Office Minister questions once a month is notan effective means of holding the Government's implementation of the Bill to account. A Scottish Parliament's ability to monitor the Government on a daily basis and to hold them accountable is much more likely to ensure that action is taken and that the Bill does not just sit on a shelf gathering dust.
<P>
I want reassurance that resources will be available and that subsection (3)(a) will not damage the Bill's aims. We want to help those who have not yet been sucked into crime. My concern is that the Bill will Channel resources away from those seeking treatment before they enter a life of crime and who wish to deal with their drug habit. It would be disastrous to skew resources towards dealing with those who have already committed crimes if that meant that new offenders entered the loop. Will the Minister assure us that resources will be available for those who have come to terms with the fact that they need to do something about their drug habit? At present, resources for drug treatment are not exactly available for those who voluntarily seek it, so what will happen when the courts include treatment as part of a sentence?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to answer my questions. Like the hon. Member for Epping Forest,I recognise that he may wish to return to these matters on Report, but I hope that he will give us a clear idea of how the Government see the availability of drug treatment orders developing in Scotland. I want reassurance that offenders, and those who have not yet offended, will have reasonable access to treatment. It is only by breaking the cycle that we will be able to deal with drug crimes and their related problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I am normally regarded as being courteous and generous when I am at the Dispatch Box, but I think that you, Mr. O'Hara, will forgive me if I do not extend my comments to deal with some of the subjects that have been suggested. the clause is about drug treatment and testing orders and a specific group of serious drug offenders. We are trying to deal in a novel way with the problems that they cause.
<P>
Many of the comments that have been made about accountability require an effective Opposition. I like to be accountable; that is one of the privileges of being in government. However, that is also a matter for the Opposition. They should examine what is happening in the country, get in touch with Ministers, table parliamentary questions and examine the whole range of reports published by Government. We should not get too bogged down in how things will work, other than to establish that we want resources to be applied. The financial memorandum to the Bill reveals that about1 million is required. We intend to set up a pilot project and to conduct the fullest consultation with all concerned in the spheres of criminal justice, health, the courts and many organisations. There is no reason why information could not be made available at that stage to Opposition Members.
<P>
There is no need for us to be anything other than open. The measure is innovative and will do immense good.A pilot project is ahead, for evaluation purposes before the scheme is extended to all Scotland. On that basis I can say that we shall be accountable.
<P>
While drug treatment and testing orders are an important issue, on which Opposition Members should be informed, they are part of a wider range of measures involving the community and alternatives to custody. How do the Opposition expect to keep abreast of developments concerning sex offender orders, anti-social behaviour orders or the new racial harassment offences? There should be continued dialogue between Government and Opposition. Continuity is vital. There is no point in the Government pursuing policies that are fundamentally opposed by Opposition parties. Whether in this House, of elsewhere, if, next May, I am fortunate enough to go to another place not next door, but in Scotland I shall be happy to be accountable for what we have put forward in the Bill.
<P>
We do not want anyone to be excluded from the initial full consultation. In Scotland I am not sure what happens in England comparative figures are published for disposals in courts, with reference to the jurisdictions. That information is publicly available. When the orders are up and running, beyond the pilot stage, there will be an opportunity to discover which sheriffs use them as an alternative to custody. As well as the Secretary of State's reports on prisons or criminal justice generally, there will be a bulletin in Scotland, as we announced last week. The Opposition will have an enormous range of opportunities to inform themselves.
<P>
In the spirit of openness and accountability, and in view of the wider practicalities of the Bill, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment, with our reassurance that we intend to keep nothing secret. The more openly every aspect of criminal justice is discussed, the better for Scottish society and, I have no doubt, for the whole United Kingdom.

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I accept the Minister's assurance in principle that he is happy to be held to account for the Government's promises about fighting drug abuse. I am certain that he is sincere. In this matter we look into an uncertain future.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Speak for yourself!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I meant that in a political sense. I hope that if the Minister goes to the other place at Holyrood, he will continue to have responsibility for the matters that we are considering unless of course it goes to one of my colleagues, or one of those of the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. We are, however, united in the hope that the responsibility will not go to certain other hon. Members none of whom are members of the Committee.
<P>
I will not stray further, Mr. O'Hara, except to say that I am certain that my colleagues, many of whom will be elected to the new Scottish Parliament, will take pleasure in holding whoever is responsible to account for the promises that have been made about actions against drugs. It is reassuring that we are all aiming for the same result. Let us hope that we achieve it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Requirements and provisions to be included in drug treatment and testing orders</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The clause deals with the treatment providers who will be carrying out the drug treatment under the orders. Concerns were raised at the English level which apply similarly to Scotland. Many of the current providers have a culture which is far removed from the criminal justice system. They tend to have a health-based culture and have no role in monitoring an order. There will be major implications for them in taking part in a new form of drug treatment which is part of such an order. Can the Minister assure us about discussions in Scotland with providers? Is there experience of existing providers and could that be included in the correspondence which the Minister is giving us about the current range of provision and that which is planned?
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I do not want to respond in detail. We are hoping that the pilot will start towards the end of this year. We have not decided where it will be but it will be done in consultation with all the various elements.I acknowledge the point that has been made about the culture. At present, prison is an option and there is obviously treatment and rehabilitation there. However, people who do not go to prison can get caught up in myriad organisation, including the health service and the voluntary sector. This brings the two together in an important way. It is an alternative to custody. We are seeking to root it in the best of provision that exists.
<P>
We want to consult various organisations, not just the health service, but drug problem centres, psychiatric services or, indeed, primary care to get the best treatment model for those who decide to be involved. The other crucial issue is that cultures cannot be changed overnight.I hope that what we are doing will not only appear to be tough but will be much more cost effective and will prevent people going to prison when their criminality is much less important than their drug-related activities which originally led them into crime. I hope those reassurances satisfy the hon. Gentleman.

<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 463, in page 70, line 22, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Where an application is made under subsection (1) above by the supervising officer, the court shall issue a citation requiring the offender to appear before the court.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 464 and 465.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Amendment No. 463 will allow a court to cite an offender to appear before it when it hears an application by the supervising officer for amendment of a drug treatment and testing order. This means the court will be able to dispose of the application directly, without the need for a further sitting.
<P>
Before amending or revoking a drug treatment and testing order, a court must first hear both the offender and the supervising officer. As presently drafted, the Bill would allow the court to cite an offender only once a decision had been taken to vary or revoke his order as a result of an application for amendment by the supervising officer. That would in practice mean that the court would have to sit twice, first to hear the application and then to hear the offender. This would be wasteful use of court time. We wish courts to be able to dispose of such applications without the need for further sittings and the proposed amendment will facilitate this. The other two amendments are consequential on amendment No. 463 which I ask the Committee to accept.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I hope that I have risen at the right moment. First, I wanted to check that the transitional arrangements under the clause will have no retrospective effects. That is my understanding and I am fairly certain that it is correct.
<P>
Secondly, depending upon events in another place, this might be the last time that a Minister will speak on a Scottish clause in a crime and disorder Bill in this House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Some hon. Members might disagree about whether that should happen, but I wanted to mark the occasion as it provides Scottish Members with an opportunity to speak 
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> When I said "hear, hear"	, I intended to lend force to the comments of the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. It is an occasion to be marked and I wish to reinforce the expressions of respect to the Minister made by other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> At that point, I will also give the Minister a moment to mark the occasion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, but with great sadness.
<P>
<B>Mr. McLeish:</B> Without wishing to stretch your indulgence by provoking your wrath, Mr. O'Hara,I should like to say what an enormous pleasure it has been to attend the sittings of the Committee. I had not realised that the discussion of the Bill, as it related to England and Wales, would be so enjoyable. I would have given up discussions on the Scotland Bill earlier, if I had known that such pleasures awaited me.
<P>
I, too, should like to capture the slight sense of drama and history expressed in the remarks of the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. This will probably be the last crime and disorder Bill that we will be involved with in this House as Scottish Members. None the less, valid points were made earlier about accountability in our democracy and I wish to allay the fears especially those of Conservative Members that matters will be dealt with less well in Holyrood than they are in this fine House.
<P>
Despite that epitaph, I fear that I might have to speak on the Bill later on and I hope that that will not come as too much of a disappointment to hon. Members.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O' Brien):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Truancy is a significant problem in all our constituencies Figures based on school registers show that at least 1 million children take at least one half day off from school a year without authority. However, a confidential survey makes it clear that in many ways the problem is worse than that. According to one survey, nearly one in 10 15-year-olds truant at least once a week.
<P>
Truancy is closely associated with crime. According to the Audit Commission, a quarter of school-age offenders have truanted significantly. A Metropolitan police study found that 5 per cent. of offences were committed by children in school hours.
<P>
The Government are determined to make it clear that truancy is unacceptable. It is intolerable for youngsters to congregate on street corners or in shopping centres, causing a nuisance and losing out on education, when they should be in school.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced a package of measures to tackle school exclusions and truancy when he launched the school exclusion unit's report on 11 May. As part of that package, we are giving the police an additional power to remove truants.
<P>
In many areas the police already co-operate with schools and local authorities to tackle truancy, but they lack explicit powers to do anything when they find a child out of school. The new power will enable a police officer to take truants back to school or another place designated by the local authority. It is not a power of arrest or detention, nor does it make truancy a criminal offence. Parents already commit an offence if they let their child stay off school. The objective is not to criminalise the child, but to deal with the problem and tackle mischief.
<P>
The new power will be used once the local education authority has designated a place or places for the purpose of the new provision and has notified the chief constable in that area. It will be used in support of local multi-agency efforts to tackle truancy in which the police, schools and local education authorities identify and discuss local problems and draw up strategies to deal with them.
<P>
The power will be exercisable only with the authority of a police officer of superintendent rank or above. It will not be exercisable by constables or sergeants who happen to be passing and see a child who is not at school. A senior officer will have to authorise use of the power. That senior officer will authorise the area in which and the period during which truants may be picked up. In coming to that judgment, he or she will obviously take account of the results of discussions with schools and with the local authority.
<P>
The power will be to remove the child to his or her school or to the designated place, at the discretion of the constable. In exercising that discretion, the constable will have to take account of the arrangements agreed between the police, schools and the local authority and the circumstances of the case.
<P>
The power will be exercised on the basis that the constable has reasonable cause to believe that the child is of compulsory school age and is absent from school without lawful authority. A child's absence from school will be taken to be without lawful authority unless it falls within section 444(3) of the Education Act 1996, which refers to leave, sickness, unavoidable cause or a day set apart for religious observance.
<P>
The child must be in a public place when picked up. That includes private premises, such as shopping centres and arcades, to which the public have access and where truants tend to congregate and make a nuisance of themselves.
<P>
The Association of Chief Police Officers has welcomed the new power to support a multi-agency approach to the problem. The new provision will extend only to England and Wales. The police in Scotland already have adequate common law powers to deal with truants. I hope that the Committee will endorse the Government's view that truancy needs to be tackled effectively and that the new clause will do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am not quite the only representative of the Opposition here at the moment. I am most grateful for the support that is behind me.
<P>
The Opposition accept that truancy is a serious and growing problem. The Minister's figures suggest that an unacceptably high percentage of young school children play truant. Something must be done about that. Therefore, I express a cautious welcome to the new clause. I hope that it works well in practice.
<P>
Truancy is not a modern phenomenon, but it is increasing. It is especially noticeable in inner-city high-crime areas. It is not unknown for children from deprived backgrounds, who attend schools that are not of a high standard, to find school life so intolerable that they play truant. Mischief then starts. When young people with time on their hands and nothing to do gather together, crime may result.
<P>
I understand why the new clause has been introduced and the general principle behind it. It recognises the problem of truancy and the Minister is right to try to tackle it. However, I want to refer to two general principles that might be slightly troublesome and that require explanation. First, although the new power does not involve a power of arrest, it involves the power of detention. Someone can be detained against his will when he has not committed a criminal offence. The second matter is the question of resources, and I shall come to that later.
<P>
A more specific concern has been raised with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and with me. It relates to the position of children who are educated at home. Many people do not realise that several thousand families in this country choose to take personal responsibility for the education of their children in accordance with section 7 of the Education Act 1996. Many thousands of children are educated outside the state and private systems and by their families at home. I do not criticise that, because that freedom exists and many parents argue not without force that their children achieve as much, if not more, than those who go through the formal school system.
<P>
Some of those parents have raised concerns about their children. They point out that many of them spend some hours outside their homes during what we would describe as normal school hours. Normal school hours vary considerably in different parts of the country. It is not a 9-to-5 system. Many schools start very early and there has been a move towards that. I regret it because it means that children are let loose from school early in the afternoon. If both parents are working, that creates problems for13 and 14-year-olds who leave school at 2.30 pm. There is no consistency in school hours. Although it is normal for a child to attend a day school from 8.30 am to 5.30 or 6 pm for five days a week, it is also normal nowadays for children to go to school from 8 am till 2 pm.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Parents who educate at home make the point that their children are often outside the home during school hours. The may be in libraries, or walking to and fromthe libraries, museums, theatres or sports clubs. The Government should tackle the anxieties of those parents. They are worried that children who are properly educated at home, and are lawfully strolling around the streets, might be picked up by the police for pursuing normal activities.
<P>
The position of children at private boarding schools often differs from that of children who attend day schools, because boarding school pupils lawfully wander around outside school during some parts of the day.
<P>
The police will probably not act in a specific locality unless they have been told by a school that its pupils regularly truant. They are unlikely to provoke action under the new clause; they will respond to anxieties expressed by an authority. Therefore, my fears may be unwarranted. However, the police will have to make important decisions. If they ask a child why he is wandering around, and receive the reply, "I go to so-and-so school, and I'm on my way from A to B"	, or, "I'm being educated at home and I'm going from A to B,"	 they will have to make a judgment in sensitive circumstances. They may need extra skills to deal with such circumstances. Will more resources be required? A confident young person could easily see the police off with some cock-and-bull story.
<P>
I want to move from children who are educated principally at home to a point of principle. The Minister rightly emphasised that the new clause does not create a power of arrest or detention. However, it enables a policeman to deprive a juvenile under 16 of his or her liberty. I assume that a policeman who formed the view that a child was playing truant from school would not be able to say that he was placing the child under arrest, or give any form of caution, and that no conviction would ensue. Nevertheless, a policeman will be able to say, "You are ordered to come with me. I have the power to insist on that."	
<P>
As well as the point about liberty, we should consider the relationship between young people and the police. It is terribly important to create an atmosphere in which youngsters and the police have a good and close relationship and that resentments are not built up. Is there a danger of too much resentment building up in certain localities?
<P>
I must challenge the Minister on this point. He must confirm that the police have the power effectively to deprive a juvenile under 16 of his liberty when such a person has not committed any criminal offence nor attempted to do so. What happens if the child says, "You can think what you like, police officer, but by advice to you is, `Push off, I am continuing about my lawful business.'"	? Do the police have the power to use reasonable force to take him to a designated place? If so we are moving rapidly into a criminal scenario. The youngster may or may not resist. Although one does not want to suggest scare stories, how far down the line can the police go with a 15-year-old who says, "Make what you like of it, I am going nowhere"	? Do they have powers to use handcuffs, even in an extreme case, or would they back off? Do they have any other powers to constrain?
<P>
There are other areas which my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest might raise, but the next area I should like to consider is the definition of designated premises. The clause states that the police will have a power to remove a person to designated premises. Will that inevitably be the child's school, that is if the child is willing to say which that is? Will it be the police station? Could it be any other place such as local authority premises?
<P>
That brings me to the possible resources to be spent as a result of the new clause. It is well known that the government are taking a firm line on public expenditure. It is not so well known that the probation service faces a huge cut, year on year, in its spending throughout county after county. Yet, in this Bill alone we have seen massive obligations put upon the probation service. How it will afford them, I do not know. It is not only the probation service, and if Surrey is anything to go by, the police have also had their budgets cut dramatically. That will continue. The Minister has a duty to tell the Committee whether the clause has any impact on public expenditure, upon resources or upon money being spent. If so where will the money come from? If not, how can the clause operate when it becomes a section?
<P>
Finally, the Minister was good enough to give us his definition of a public place. Certain places are clearly public such as the streets. The normal definition is places to which the public have access which would include cinemas and public swimming pools. I suspect, going slightly further down the line, that private members' clubs such as football and other sports clubs would fall within the definition of a public place. But I assume that the power does not apply to a child who, at the material time, is at home or at the home of a relative or friend, and that the police have no powers to go into such buildings.
<P>
I give the clause a cautious welcome. The Opposition understand the problem with truancy but we have queries about the resource implications and the freedom of the individual and we stress the need to proceed sensitively. There are practical questions about how the police will operate and the definition of a public place and where such a child may be taken. We do not speak against the clause but ask the Minister to answer some of our points, not least those put forward with some vigour in correspondence by parents of children who are educated at home.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The joys of being part of the new civil liberties alliance on the Opposition Benches is that our minds are frequently in tune. Many of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) were ones that I intended to raise. I shall try not to repeat his points but develop them further and throw in some of my own.
<P>
We are concerned that there may be a quick-fix response. The social exclusion unit has targeted this as one of its priorities. We share the concern but are looking for long-lasting solutions rather than quick fixes. Our immediate response is that the real solution is at the school end rather than in the enforcement of truancy law. Our existing truancy framework does not work and we question how far we can go with an additional power. We do not say the power is unnecessary but there are question marks over how far the additional power of enforcement will go when we have such a track record of failure within the existing, fairly comprehensive, legislation.
<P>
We also question the ability of some agencies to deliver. There are now fewer police officers than when the Government took office. There will be doubts about their ability to field the necessary officers to take part in these new initiatives. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that that trend is about to reverse. There is also the question of the multi-agency partnerships which are currently involved in youth justice and doing a sterling job in my area, involving organisations like Barnardos and NCH Action for Children. They are having difficulty coping simply with their responsibilities towards persistent young offenders. If, as I assume is the Government's intention, they are to pick up these new responsibilities and form the multi-agency partnership for dealing with truants, how will they be resourced? Most of them depend on project funding year by year from sources such as the single regeneration budget. If they are to take on this responsibility, they will be looking for the necessary resources.
<P>
We have similar questions to those raised by the hon. Member for Woking about the designated premises. Who will be expected to run them in normal circumstances and what will be the regime? How long will youngsters be kept there? Assuming that they are not schools and are some form of social services establishment, will they be kept until the end of the school day and then let go? Will it, in other words, be a school-hours detention scheme?
<P>
We have questions about the Minister's statement that this is not a power of arrest or detention. What happens if the youngster walks straight out of the designated premises? What if he becomes violent? Will we not effectively be asking social services staff to become gaolers of school-age children?
<P>
The real answer would involve examining the whole issue of temporary or permanent exclusions, in the school context. There should be better units at the schools. What would happen to excluded pupils under the arrangements? Would those who had been excluded from school be picked up and taken to designated premises? It is difficult to see how they could be playing truant, having already been asked by the school not to attend. Excluded children do not seem to be in the list of exceptions in subsection (4) of the new clause.
<P>
Excluded children are likely to be quite a large category. The road to truancy often begins with temporary exclusions and leads to longer periods away.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is also quite common for children who face extreme bullying at school to stop attending, without telling their parents. Different schools respond differently to bullying, but we should be gravely concerned about the prospect of removing bullied children back to the school from which they have sought escape, without some attempt to deal with the problems.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Government would consider an amendment on Report with respect to the group of children referred to by the hon. Member for Woking those educated at home. Perhaps subsection (4) of new clause 20 could be amended to refer to section 7 of the Education Act 1996, which makes specific reference to those children. Although I am sure that the Government do not intend that they should be picked up, the parents concerned should have the reassurance that their status in the law is recognised and they are not being overlooked. They are going about their business within the law and should not be interfered with by legislation as long as they respect the Education Act 1996.
<P>
We hope that the Minister will be able to agree to making that matter explicit in the Bill, and to respond to our other points. We want not to underplay the issue of truancy but to be an effective Opposition, ensuring that proposed measures have their intended effect and do not misfire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I thank the hon. Members for Woking and for Hallam for their cautious welcome of the proposal. They made some important points.
<P>
The Home Office and the Department for Education and Employment will, after consulting local education authorities and others, put forward guidance for the police and local authorities about the operation of the provisions. That will be an important safeguard.
<P>
Many children are properly and lawfully educated at home and the provision would not apply to them. A child who is not a pupil at a school cannot be absent without authority from it. There is no need, therefore, for an amendment. The power is to be used only with respect to children who are absent from school without authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The point on which I suspect the hon. Member for Hallam may be trying to intervene is how to distinguish between the two categories of children. That is what I was coming to. The power will be exercised by a constable in a specified area, for a specified period, on the authorisation of a senior officer. I suspect that there will be a fair amount of publicity before it is exercised, but I accept that some people may not see that. Things are not, as the hon. Member for Woking said, always straightforward.
<P>
The exercise of the power relies on the constable's having reasonable cause to believe that a child is absent from school without lawful authority. Constables would not be able to decide that children should be taken to the designated place just because they happened to be wandering in the street. In many ways, police officers are experienced in making judgments of that nature in the light of all the circumstances. They would no doubt question the child about whether he had left school because of bullying, or was excluded. In the latter case he would not be subject to the power, because his absence would be authorised, or rather, obligatory.
<P>
The power under the new clause is intended to be part of a multi-agency approach to the problem, including the sharing of information that would help officers to make judgments. The hon. Member for Woking is right to say that the power would probably arise after discussions between school and police about the perceived development of problems in an area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In the unfortunate circumstance that a child who was picked up explained that he was educated at home, but was not believed by the constable, who then made the removal, what would be the remedy? If the individual wanted to take the matter further, would there be a civil remedy similar to that available when an arrest is believed to have been wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The police would obviously be protected from civil remedies to the extent that they reasonably believed that the child was absent without lawful authority. If, however, they acted without a reasonable belief, without taking all the circumstances into account, so that a court would find that they did not act reasonably, no doubt the parent could pursue the ordinary remedies that are available in the courts, on behalf of a child who felt that he had been improperly dealt with.
<P>
The police officer would be entitled to use such reasonable force as was necessary in all the circumstances. The force would have to be proportionate to the child's power and behaviour. Resistance with violence would constitute an offence of assault, and other powers would come into play. The provision establishes a clear authority for police action, without the disadvantage of criminalising truancy. The reasonable force should be proportionate to the circumstances, and in practice a court would be very unlikely to regard, say, the use of handcuffs as reasonable. Existing guidance to the police about handcuffs is not normally to use them on juveniles in any event.
<P>
The designated place might or might not be a school. That is to be a matter for the local authority, on being asked to designate a place to which a police officer could take a child if there were grounds to believe that he or she was unreasonably absent from school, but the school could not be identified. Perhaps the child concerned would not say what school he attended. It is not anticipated that the designated place will be a police station. The local authority will decide on the best place: it might be a social services department, or even a school where there are suitable facilities and staff able to deal with children who might have come from other schools. Such children might be returned to their own schools at a later stage. The matter will be left to local authorities. The power to remove a child to a designated place will be exercisable only if a suitable place has been chosen by the local authority.
<P>
Local authorities and the police will each have their responsibilities. Police superintendents will decide how many of their officers will be used for any survey of the number of truants in their area. They will co-operate with local authorities, but each will have a distinctive role.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam asked who will run the scheme. The local education authority will run it and will determine how to deal with the young people. If a young person absconds from the centre, the LEA can decide to call the police, who will exercise their powers, or it can involve the parents, or it can handle the matter in another way. The authority would be in the same position, and have the same powers as a head teacher who saw a child walking out of the school premises.
<P>
The issue was raised that the provisions of the new clause might place extra burdens on the police. Youngsters who misbehave when they should be in school already place a substantial burden on the police. The powers will reduce the burden by making it easier for the police to intervene earlier.
<P>
In some areas, the police already work closely with schools on truancy reduction schemes, but such schemes do not have a firm legal base. For example, in Thanet some schools gave the Kent police authority the power to stop and question children who were out of school, and to return them to the school unless they had written permission for their absence. During that operation, truancy fell in the area and stayed down afterwards. The use of such power seems to have immediate and long-term effects. Even the threat of its use might have an effect; parents would ensure that their children were at school and children would think carefully before they decided to play truant.
<P>
Resources will be limited because the power will be exercisable for only a specified period and in a specified area. The police would have to consider what resources they could deploy, in negotiation with the schools. Pressure on resources would be reduced.
<P>
The hon. Member for Woking asked what is a public place and what would police officers do if they saw a child going into his home, but that child was not authorised to be absent from school. In that situation, the officers would not have the right to enter private premises, whether those of the child's parents or of his friends. The power extends only to areas to which the public have access.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam made several general points. He said that he did not want to see quick fixes. That is not what the Government propose. The new clause was drawn up after considerable study by the social exclusion unit. It creates just the right balance by giving the education authority and the police the ability to intervene when specific problems have arisen. It does not introduce general, widely embracing powers that might worry hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also said and the hon. Member for Woking agreed to some extent that the provision would not provide the solution to truancy. Of course it does not provide the solution. We must raise standards in our schools. The Government are committed to that and we are investing in the improvement of school standards. We need a broad approach that tackles the difficulties that cause truancy in schools and other social problems, but that also gives the police and the LEAs the appropriate powers.
<P>
Finally, a question was asked about excluded children. Such children are lawfully excluded and therefore the power does not apply to them.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to deal with most of the points made by Opposition Members. I hope also that they will support the new clause.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comprehensive response, but he failed to answer the point about the hours that children can be kept in the designated premises. I understand that that point will be covered in guidance, but that means that we are being asked to agree to something in principle when much will depend on how it is implemented.
<P>
I want to flag up another issue. Designated premises will be run by LEAs, and the Minister responded quite effectively about police resources. However, if an LEA is to maintain a designated centre on or off school premises we are pleased that it will not be a secure centre, but modelled on a school it will have to be intensively resourced. Many LEAs do not have the resources to provide pupil referral units or similar centres because they require high staff-to-pupil rations. However, designated centres will require significant investment. If they are done on the cheap, children will walk out of them and we will be back to square one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked about the hours that children will spend in the designated centre. It is not envisaged that young people will be detained as such. They will be in the designated centre much in the same way as they are at school. If they seek to leave, they will be dealt with in the same way.
<P>
How long children stay in the centre is a matter for the LEA. I envisage that it will wish to get them to their own schools as quickly as possible. If problems arise with a particularly difficult child, the LEA will be able to use the Children Act 1989, social services and various other paraphernalia. I do not think that we need worry about this issue unduly, because the LEA will treat the children in centres in the same way as they treat them at school. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the guidance will be important in determining how the provision works in practice.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's point about LEA budgets, the LEA will not have to make constant provision for a designated place. I hope that the power will not be used too often, but only for particular periods. We do not envisage LEAs making a long-term commitment. However, I take this good opportunity to remind the hon. Gentleman that the Government have put an extra 1.1 billion into spending on education. That will go into school budgets to raise standards. An extra1.3 billion will be committed to tackling repairs' backlogs and to modernise schools for the 21st century. In phasing out the assisted-places scheme 
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was just going through my list of the commitments that the new Government have made. However, I think that I have made my point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister accepts the intervention, I caution him about the route that he is beginning to take.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether his figures are adjusted for the new GDP deflator or are they just cash figures that to not take into account inflation?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The new figures enabled the headmaster of the largest secondary school in my constituency to open with the services of the local Member of Parliament a new technology centre with an investment of 148,000 from the new Labour Government, and to say in thanks to me 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I feel forced to repeat my counsel to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was trying to respond to the point made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. However, I accept your caution , Mr. O'Hara, and I shall not repeat that the headmaster insisted on thanking the Labour Government for extra resources.

<P>
Government amendment No. 423.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall speak in favour of new clauses 21 to 23 and amendment No. 423, and resist new clause 10.
<P>
New clauses 21 to 23 are aimed at making the police more effective in dealing with people who wear masks to avoid being identified when they carry out violent offences. The proposals have their origin in an amendment tabled earlier by Lord Carnarvon. He kindly withdrew it to give the Government more time to consider the fine detail.
<P>
The police can already take firm action when they have reasonable suspicion that people are committing, or are about to commit, offences. They currently lack a power to demand the removal of face coverings before trouble starts, and before they have a reasonable suspicion against any individual.
<P>
A power to demand the removal of face coverings without reasonable suspicion is potentially wide. People can wear face coverings for all sorts of legitimate reasons. The police need a discretionary power, which is tempered with reasonable safeguards. We propose to use the safeguards that already exist in section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. That section, as amended by section 8 of the Knives Act 1997, grants a power to search for knives and offensive weapons without reasonable suspicion. The power can be used only when authorised by an officer of the rank of inspector or above, and before he gives such an authorisation he must reasonably believe that incidents involving serious violence may take place in any locality in his police area, and that it is expedient to give the authorisation to prevent their occurrence, or that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons in any locality in his police area without good reason. The authorisation lasts for up to 24 hours. That can be extended by a superintendent for 24 hours if necessary.
<P>
The circumstances in which the police would wish to exercise a power to demand the removal of, or to seize, face coverings are similar to those envisaged by section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Section 60 gives the police the ability to go beyond their normal powers because violence is developing. The Government agree with Lord Carnarvon and the Association of Chief Police Officers that section 60 provides the right framework for a face coverings power.
<P>
We believe that an authorisation under section 60 should extend to a power to demand the removal of face coverings. It would be going too far to have a power to stop and search for face coverings they are not in the same category as knives and offensive weapons. However, it is reasonable for police officers to be able to seize face coverings that they come across while they are searching for other things, or because such coverings are being carried openly. New clause 21 would provide such a power.
<P>
We have given much thought to how to define face coverings. A wide range of objects can be used to cover the face, and people may wish to cover their faces for perfectly legitimate reasons I am thinking particularly of Muslim women who cover their faces for religious reasons, which we fully respect. We do not wish to interfere with that, or cause distress in any way. We have therefore arrived at the view that where the power is authorised, the officer exercising it must also reasonably believe that the person concerned is wearing a face covering wholly or mainly for the purpose of concealing his identity. That may sometimes be a difficult judgment.
<P>
We have concluded that what is proposed in new clause 21 presents the fewest problems. It is necessary to have the power. In most cases we do not envisage that it would cause any difficulties but it is possible to imagine circumstances in which it might. We therefore want to be open about the way that we see it developing but we anticipate that officers will see that it is for them to exercise the best possible judgment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am listening carefully to what the Minister is saying. He is putting forward the case that Government new clause 21 is better than new clause 10. But would he not agree that the limit that the Government have chosen to impose relates to the way in which section 60 power in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 talks only about.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"powers to stop and search in anticipation of violence"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
whereas new clause 10 talks about a much wider range of offences? Would the Minister not recognise that many Opposition Members feel that new clause 21 is inadequate because it does not cover a wide enough range?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I was beginning to explore what hon. Members in their perhaps more civil libertarian mode perceive as potential problems that could arise with the exercise of this power as we are putting it forward. We believe it is reasonable to get the balance right in this way but we also need to be sure that we do not create powers which cause greater civil liberties problems. We have entered into discussions with the police and have had substantial discussions in government about how to move forward with this proposal. It presents some difficulties and we should be straightforward about it. My concern about the proposals in new clause 10 is that they create too many difficulties.
<P>
New clause 22 provides for regulations to be made for the retention and disposal of articles seized under section 60. New clause 23 provides a power of arrest if someone fails to comply with the demand to remove his or her face covering. For Scotland, new clause 23 provides a power of arrest for the knives and offensive weapons provisions of section 60 as well as for the proposed face-coverings power. It corrects an anomaly: in England and Wales the police already have a power, under the general arrest conditions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to arrest someone who refuses to be stopped and searched for a knife or offensive weapon, but such a power of arrest without warrant does not exist in Scotland.
<P>
Failure to be stopped and searched for knives or offensive weapons attracts a maximum penalty of summary conviction of three months in prison, a level 3 fine or both. The Government proposal would extend that to the new offence of failure to comply with a demand to remove a face covering. Amendment No. 423 will extend the measures proposed in clauses 21, 22 and 23 for Scotland.
<P>
I can see the drift of new clause 10, but it does not really address the problem. Where an officer has the reasonable suspicion described in the clause he can already take firm action, by arresting the individual. The problem occurs where the police see people wearing balaclavas or other face coverings in a situation where they believe that trouble is brewing, but where they cannot demonstrate reasonable suspicion that the people concerned are going to commit offences. New clause 10 would not therefore fit the problem. I hope that the Committee will agree that the Government's proposal in new clauses 21 to 23 is the better approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall speak briefly in support of new clause 10, in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), for Epping Forest, for Gainsborough, for Mid-Sussex, for Beaconsfield and myself. I have heard what the Minister has had to say. The Minister will understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold has taken a great interest in this matter.
