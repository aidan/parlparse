						</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 18, in
clause 3, page 3, line 25, at

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) to adhere
to the race equality duty under section 71(1) of the Race Relations Act
1976 (c.
47).&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0701177000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
move on to a more narrow and technical amendment relating to the Race
Relations Act 1976. Amendment No. 18 seeks to insert an additional
provision into clause 3(3) whereby there would be the ability to
require persons carrying out probation services to adhere to the race
equality duty under section 71(1) of the 1976 Act, which
states:</div>
					<a name="0701177000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Every
body or other person specified in Schedule 1A or of a description
falling within that Schedule shall, in carrying out its functions, have
due regard to the need...to eliminate unlawful racial
discrimination; and...to promote equality of opportunity and good
relations between persons of different racial
groups.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
issue and some concerns were raised by the Commission for Racial
Equality, which stated in its briefing note on the
Bill:</div>
					<a name="0701177000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;NOMS, as
part of the Home Office, is subject to the race equality duty. The race
equality duty encompasses the General Statutory Duty...to promote
race equality under section 71(1) of the Race Relations Act as
amended...and accompanying specific duty to publish a Race
Equality Scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission also
said:</div>
					<a name="0701177000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Despite
repeated letters from the CRE and meetings with NOMS and the Home
Office over the last three years, there is no evidence that race
equality criteria have been built into procurement policies and
guidance for contractors or that the performance of contractors on race
equality is being actively monitored. It therefore raises questions
about the extent to which NOMS, through the Home Office, is meeting its
statutory responsibilities under the Race Relations
Act.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
tabled a probing amendment to highlight those concerns. Given the
comments made by the CRE, I consider the issue important. I want to
elicit a response from the Minister as to whether race equality
responsibilities are being properly adhered to and, moving forward,
what will happen on general compliance with that particular statute and
duty.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000334"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b> As this is the first time
that I have had the opportunity to address the Committee, I welcome you
to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, and look forward to your
chairmanship. I shall also take the opportunity to ask you to pass on
to your 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 97</div>fellow Chairman, Mr. Bayley, my best wishes for the
Committee. I also welcome all members of the Committee to our
deliberations. I am pleased to be here to support my fellow Minister,
who will be dealing with most of the proceedings, but I will be
makingthe odd&#151;not literally&#151;contribution, as and
when appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0701177000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say
to the hon. Member for Hornchurch that the Home Office and the National
Offender Management Service take very seriously all their
responsibilities under the law and seek to comply fully with all
aspects of legislation. I am glad to have the opportunity provided by
the amendment to discuss the crucial issue of diversity in both the
employment of probation staff and the delivery of probation services.
Although there is always room for improvement, the probation service
has a good employment record. A report by Her Majesty&#146;s
inspectorate of probation in 2004 found that 16 per cent. of members of
probation boards came from minority ethnic backgrounds. At the end of
December 2005, 12.1 per cent. of probation staff were from minority
ethnic backgrounds, compared with10.1 per cent. in the
previous year and 9.8 per cent. in 2000. We want to build on that
foundation.</div>
					<a name="0701177000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
is also crucial in respect of service delivery. Members of the
Committee do not need me to tell them that black and minority ethnic
groups are disproportionately represented among those supervised by the
probation service. Ensuring that the right services are available to
meet the needs of all offenders is part of how we will reduce
reoffending and better protect the
public.</div>
					<a name="0701177000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The benefits of
commissioning include a clearer focus on the offending-related needs of
the offender and innovative tailored service provision and delivery
that is more relevant than simply equal services to offenders
irrespective of their race, gender or other characteristics. That
should help to achieve greater parity of
outcomes.</div>
					<a name="0701177000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Commissioners
will set out diversity expectations and service delivery and say how
they will be monitored. The commissioning framework to which regional
commissioners and providers will be working as they negotiate
service-level agreements for 2007-08 sets four priority areas, of which
diversity is one. The aim is to deliver greater equality of access to
services provided for offenders in prisons or supervised in the
community, irrespective of their race, gender or other characteristics;
to achieve greater parity of outcomes where that is not the case; and
to promote greater confidence in the criminal justice system among
those groups where such equality of access is lacking or
weak.</div>
					<a name="0701177000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell the
hon. Member for Hornchurch that there is no dispute about the need to
act on diversity&#151;the question is whether we need explicit
provision in the Bill. I think that that is not necessary, as providers
are already covered by the 1976 Act and, indeed, by the full range of
other anti-discrimination legislation that is not mentioned in the
amendment. However, I accept that a consequential amendment is
necessary to section 71(1) of the 1976 Act, which lists local probation
boards as one of the bodies to which the race equality duty applies. It
does not need to be set out in the Bill in the way proposed, but in due
course we will table a consequential amendment to ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div>the relevant duties continue to apply when probation boards cease to
exist. In view of that clarification and assurance, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Brokenshire:

is my first opportunity to welcome him formally to the Committee, and I
look forward to future debates as we proceed through the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0701177000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to the Minister and was reassured by much of what he said. I
hope that his message about the importance of some aspects of the
proposal will be heard clearly in this Room and outside it. I agree
with him that there are two ways of dealing with the issue: by
amendment to the Bill now or by a further amendment on Report to amend
the 1976 Act.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000350"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> We move on to the power to establish
probation trusts and the authority that is given to the Home Secretary
by order to establish a probation trust, to alter its name and,
ultimately, to dissolve it.</div>
					<a name="0701177000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seem to be continuing the
theme of the top-down approach, in that this would see the Home
Secretary acquire powers that are currently vested in probation boards.
I hope that the Minister will be able to assist the Committee by
answering my questions. If I understood him correctly this morning, he
anticipates that the first probation trust will come into effect in
April 2008. He mentioned the figure 42, which, I think, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>was the total number of trusts. Will he clarify whether a maximum number
is envisaged, how they will be set up and what sort of rolling
programme he has in mind for their
establishment?</div>
					<a name="0701177000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
thing that is made clear in the explanatory notes rather than on the
face of the Bill is the fact that it is not intended that a probation
trust should be attached to a specific geographical area, which
suggests that trusts will be nationwide rather than being anchored to a
particular locality or geographical area. If that is the case, the
Minister needs to explain how the system will operate. It has been
suggested that there might be competition between probation trusts.
Again, how will that operate if there is no geographical issue? And how
will the framework or terms of reference be encapsulated with regard to
how trusts are intended to operate? If there is no local link, which is
what I understand by the reference to there being no geographical link,
how will the locality issues be assumed within the system?</div>
					<a name="0701177000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many hon. Members have stressed
the need for the provision of local services to maintain the positive
aspects of rehabilitation and local input in the system. However, that
does not seem to be assured in the Bill and the explanatory notes. The
Minister might say that it could be stressed in the contractual
arrangements or the orders establishing probation trusts, but the
importance of local links is loud and clear, particularly for
charitable and voluntary organisations, which are key players.
Maintaining a permanent link is the glue of the system, which is
important to its
stability.</div>
					<a name="0701177000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
said that the purpose of the trusts will be specified in the
establishing orders mentioned in clause 4(1)(a). Those orders will
include contracts for probation purposes, but not
exclusively&#151;subsection (2) states that they will include those
purposes. Will the Minister explain what other purposes are envisaged
for probation trusts? Will the purposes extend to prison services, so
that we might have the reverse of the previous situation with the
Prison Service being able to provide probation services? I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s response on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0701177000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3)(b) mentions the possibility of other specified activities being
carried out &#147;anywhere in the world&#148;. I wondered whether
that was a new land grab by the Home Office to extend the
extraterritoriality of its powers, but I understand that it relates to
the &#147;service courts&#148; mentioned in paragraph (b)(i). Will
the Minister confirm that that means courts martial or similar, or does
it have another meaning? It is not a phrase that I have come across in
this context, and clarification is needed of what is intended and
whether those courts are why subsection (3)(b) refers to activities
&#147;anywhere in the world&#148;. Are probation trusts to have
that strange extended reach given to
them?</div>
					<a name="0701177000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are various
order-making powers in the clause, and subsection (4) contains the
ability to restrict probation trusts in certain ways by prescribing
limited activities for them. Will the Minister explain why that was
felt to be required? One would have thought that the general
flexibility of the clause would be sufficiently wide to give such
latitude. Is the idea to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div>create a geographical or other framework? I look forward to confirmation
of the intention behind the
subsection.</div>
					<a name="0701177000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
technical note, subsection (5)
states:</div>
					<a name="0701177000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
purpose so specified which relates to the making or performance of
contracts includes the carrying out of any activities relating to a
contract of a relevant kind (including activities taking place before
it is made or after it is
terminated).&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes state that that power is needed to allow probation
trusts to bid for contracts and deal with post-completion issues.
However, bids might not lead to contracts. A bidder does not know
whether they will be successful, because they are tendering. The clause
and explanatory notes seem to suggest that the power is needed because
of activities occurring before a contract is made.</div>
					<a name="0701177000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a technical
concern&#151;if a contract is not made, as will be the case for
unsuccessful tenders, is there a gap in the wording? Should the
provision refer to prospective contracts as well as contracts? We
require clarification whether the additional power is needed by
probation trusts in order to make bids. Whatever we may feel about the
general nature of the issue, it would be odd from a technical
perspective if a probation trust were to act ultra vires in connection
with unsuccessful contracts, but were protected in relation to
successful tenders. There are certain questions that relate to the
clarity of the intention behind the clause. I look forward to hearing
the Minister&#146;s answer to my specific
points.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701177000351"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): As in this morning&#146;s
sitting, I would like to ask the Minister two questions, each of which
takes slightly longer than an intervention would
permit.</div>
					<a name="0701177000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I remind
the Minister of the debate about consultation that we had on Thursday.
I asked whether NOMS and the local management trust ought not to be
required to make arrangement for an advisory board of some sort, which
could be drawn from a pool of organisations provided by the Bill. Will
the Minister consider whether clause 4 would be the place to make the
requirement for an advisory board? It could just about be suggested
that schedule 1 is the place for that, but this is a bigger issue for
the main body of the Bill, rather than a schedule. I ask the Minister
for clarification on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0701177000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
probation trusts may be set up by an order under clause 4. What role
does the Minister see for Parliament in the scrutiny of an order that
might be made to set up a trust? My reading of the Bill is that three
kinds of order are contemplated. The first, with which we are all
familiar, is the affirmative procedure order, whereby a draft is
produced and both Houses have to vote positively for the order. The
second type, with which we are also familiar, is the negative
procedure, whereby the order must be published and Members can pray
against it&#151;there may or may not be a debate and a vote on it
later. The third kind is a purely administrative order made by the
Minister. In clause 28, in which the orders are explained, the order
that is crucial to the whole Bill falls into the third, administrative,
category, which I have just described. It is on a par with a
commencement order in that the Minister has only to make it for it to
take effect. Given the concerns that hon. Members have expressed about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 101</div>the lack of detail in the Bill on the big changes thatare being
made, and the desire of hon. Members to scrutinise the Executive,
should the order not be subject to an affirmative procedure, rather
than an administrative
process?</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701177000352"></a>
							<b class="B">Mark
Hunter</b> (Cheadle) (LD): I shall focus my remarks on clause
4 and the specific provision for the creation of probation trusts. I
will advance a couple of thoughts as to why I am not convinced that it
is the right way forward, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response. I have two main areas of concern. The first is the disruption
to the service that might ensue from the creation of probation trusts,
and the second is the equally important consideration of a lack of
local accountability.</div>
					<a name="0701177000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will deal first with the potential disruption to the service. A number
of hon. Members have already referred to the fact that NOMS has been
established for only a relatively short time, since 2000. There is an
argument that it has not had time fully to establish itself before
being changed again. Although there is no general dispute that some
improvement is required, we have concerns that the wholesale changes in
the Bill could result in an increased reoffending rate, rather than the
opposite effect, which it is designed to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="0701177000256"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">There is
also the possibility of even more people going missing while on
probation, thus adding to the general confusion. With an already high
reconviction rate among those on probation of 53 per cent., we cannot
afford to risk creating even more
confusion.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0701177000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="0701177000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are more
effective ways of effecting change without unnecessary bureaucratic
shifts. We have heard from hon. Members about the practice in Scotland,
where community justice authorities of local elected councillors
produce plans on how co-operation will be realised and how service
delivery can be improved and
enhanced.</div>
					<a name="0701177000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are still
not clear about how probation trusts will differ from probation
boards&#151;I hope that the Minister will address that&#151;except
that, according to the papers, they will be more
&#147;business-led&#148;. It would be helpful if the Minister could
say how business people will be recruited to sit on the trusts and
whether there will be some remuneration for the individuals involved.
The case for replacing boards with business trusts has not yet been
made. Probation boards should be community-led and should be a public
service, with the public interest in sight at all times, not their
wallets. The move away from probation trusts will stop that from
happening.</div>
					<a name="0701177000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the lack
of local accountability, probation boards had locally elected
councillors and magistrates on them, whereas, according to the
proposals, probation trusts will not. We need as many connections with
the local community as is practically possible to ensure that the
provision is community-led. Replacing boards with trusts will, I fear,
mean that there will no longer be any local accountability over how
they are run. Local people will no longer have any influence over the
probation service or how probation services in their local area are
run. I am sure that the Minister and right hon. and hon. Members agree
that it is hugely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div>important that the local community should have faith in its probation
services, in order to help with the rehabilitation of ex-prisoners and
their acceptance into the community after their sentences have been
served.</div>
					<a name="0701177000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
there is also broad agreement that magistrates need to be fully
involved in the process to ensure that courts are not unwilling to give
out community sentences. They need to be assured of their success and
effectiveness. I should be grateful if the Minister would address those
concerns in his
response.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000353"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I welcome you to this afternoon&#146;s
proceedings, Mr. Atkinson. I acknowledge the contribution
that the hon. Member for Cheadle has made to the debate. I should point
out to him that there is no confusion in relation to the Home
Office&#151;no matter how many times he says it, that does not make
it right. It is clear what we are about and what we are trying to do. A
number of problems are a cause for concern and need to be addressed,
but there is no confusion&#151;we are very clear. In July, the Home
Secretary set out where we were heading in the reform of the Home
Office. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that we are making
good progress, despite the odd hiccup.</div>
					<a name="0701177000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Hornchurch
tried to claim that the issue is about top-down processes and
centralisation, but it is not about that, although I know that I did
not convince him in the debate on clause 3 and that he remains
sceptical. We all agree that we want to achieve the same target, which
is to reduce reoffending, and we also all agree that we should adopt a
whole-community solution to offending. Tackling the problem is not just
a matter for the criminal justice system or the probation service. We
must adopt a whole-community solution if we are to deal with the issue
adequately.</div>
					<a name="0701177000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, I talked about the cost to the economy of reoffending. I say
that in the context of our debate about what clause 4 does. As has been
said, local probation boards will cease to exist in their current form.
Clause 7, which we shall come to later, makes the formal provision for
that. Under clause 3,</div>
					<a name="0701177000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Secretary of State
may make contractual or other
arrangements&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">with a range
of providers, including the voluntary, charitable and private sectors,
as we have said, but that does not mean the end of the public sector.
Duringthe break between Committee sittings, I met
representatives of the trade union Amicus and its members from the
probation service. They were firmly of the view that this was all about
privatisation. I was pleased that I could reassure them that that was
not the case; we then got down into a detailed discussion about the
direction of travel.</div>
					<a name="0701177000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal certainly is not
about getting rid of the public sector&#151;far from it. Clause 4
gives the Secretary of State the power to establish probation trusts as
the public sector provider with whom he may make these arrangements.
This will be done, as was said, by an order that will set out the name
and purposes of the trust. It is envisaged that trusts will continue to
be linked to, and named after, their local area. There is no grand plan
to take over the universe; it is about making sure that there is also
local accountability. However, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 103</div>order will not limit their activities to that area. So, a trust with
particular expertise in one aspect of service delivery might deliver
that service in another area as well as its own. The detail of this
will not be specified in the order, but will be a matter for the
contracts.</div>
					<a name="0701177000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
4(1)(c) also enables the Secretary of State to dissolve a trust by
order. There are two main sets of circumstances in which that might
happen. The first is if a trust failed to secure contracts, and the
second is if two or more trusts agree together that they would be more
effective by merging their operations. We would expect that sort of
initiative to come from the trusts themselves, and I make it clear that
there are no plans for mergers from the centre&#151;they would have
to be from discussions between the trusts.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000354"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> As yet.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000355"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman says that, but as we go on
to debate the criteria we believe that there may be opportunities.
However, they will have to be identified by local communities and
probation trusts in consultation with the wider community.</div>
					<a name="0701177000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 then goes on to give
more detail about what the purposes of a trust may include. The main
purpose, as subsection (2) makes clear, is</div>
					<a name="0701177000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the making or performance by the
trust of contracts with the Secretary of State&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">for the delivery of probation services.
Subsection (3)(a) confirms that the purposes may also include the
making or performance of contracts with another trust, or any other
party, for the delivery of probation
services.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701177000356"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I have been reflecting on
what the Minister has said about mergers and so on. It brings to mind
the plan for police mergers that was eventually withdrawn after the
most enormous amount of lobbying and effort. Can the Minister assure
the Committee that there will be no plans from the centre for mergers
of probation board trusts, and that any representations for changes in
structure will come from the bottom up, not the top
down?</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000357"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. He will know of the evidence heard at the Home Office by
the new Home Secretary. Having listened to the representations made, we
have not proceeded down that route of amalgamations&#151;although
discussions are taking place about how we can get greater effectiveness
and efficiency. As for the merger of probation trusts, we would expect
that to come from the bottom up&#151;the trusts themselves. However,
we are clearly creating the framework for that opportunity to
occur.</div>
					<a name="0701177000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
subsection (3)(a), which we believe is important because, as indicated
previously, we arekeen that providers develop partnerships
between themselves, and that not all contracts are held directly by the
Secretary of State. We want to have that innovation, and for people to
work with each other. Subsection (3)(b) clarifies that a probation
trust may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div>deliver probation services to service courts &#147;anywhere in the
world&#148; in the same way that probation boards do now. The hon.
Member for Hornchurch is quite right about the service court martial.
It is, in fact, a military court and the naval courts have that
facility. Meanwhile, subsection (3)(c) confirms that the purposes may
include other purposes set out in regulations.</div>
					<a name="0701177000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5) makes it clear
that a trust&#146;s purposes may include activities before and after
a contract is in place. In other words, a trust may be established to
bid for a contract in the first place, and may continue in existence
after a contract has ended for as long as is necessary to wind up the
businesses appropriately. It is worth pointing out here that the Bill
does not require all trusts to be created at once; that is not what we
intend to do. As I said this morning, this is no big bang and we will
not rush these reforms in overnight. We want a measured approach,
balancing the need for urgent improvements with the system&#146;s
ability to cope with change.</div>
					<a name="0701177000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Hornchurch
asked me to confirm that the first trusts would be in place after April
2008. I am happy to do that. The others will follow in phases
thereafter. We will shortly launch the consultation on the selection
process and the criteria to be used in determining which board will
move first to trust status. We want to work closely with the service
and with our key stakeholders throughout that period. The process will
be open and
transparent.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000358"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The Minister has kindly confirmed that it is
intended that the first trust willbe established on 1 April
2008. This morning, he mentioned the figure 42. Can he confirm the
basis of that figure, and whether it is intended to cover all the
probation trusts that he has in
mind?</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000359"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> That is the number of existing boards, and they
will have to meet the criteria if they want to become trusts. This is
about innovation, and if all42 boards want to become trusts
very quickly, I shall be very happy. There is nothing to prevent that
from happening, but the likelihood is that they will develop over time.
Their growth will depend on their performance, on the criteria that we
have set out and on the skills that they develop.</div>
					<a name="0701177000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Cheadle
asked who will be on the trusts and quoted a document that talked about
their being business friendly. We aspire to involve business in the
context of the wider community, not to prevent people from joining
trusts. When I took over this role, I was concerned that there seemed
to be a view abroad, particularly within the Probation Boards
Association, that we were trying to prevent people from sitting on
trusts and that all we wanted were sharp-suited business people who
would take the service over. We do not see that as a
solution.</div>
					<a name="0701177000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
trying to ensure that trusts are fully representative of local
communities, so when we talk about who is to be on them, we are not
trying to prescribe who should be there by saying that there is a list
of those who must be on them. We want to offer the widest possible
opportunities. We have just recruited the next set of chairs and
vice-chairs. They represent a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 105</div>strong and wide-ranging field&#151;councillors, business people and
people from the voluntary sector&#151;and I am happy about that,
because it adds to what we want to achieve through the
trusts.</div>
					<a name="0701177000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford has discussed consultation, which he also
mentioned the other day. I said that I would consider the idea of the
advisory board, because I have some sympathy with it. On scrutiny, he
asked about the order-making power. He is right to say that it is not
there but that it is, as he set out, similar to the commencement
orders, which are absolutely necessary for the contractual
arrangements. There might be commercial reasons for not wanting to go
back through the parliamentary process, but the scrutiny is in place in
so far as the Secretary of State has to report back to Parliament. I
would ask my hon. Friend to let me think about the issue in a bit more
detail, because I am not entirely convinced by my own arguments or by
the notes that I have received.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000360"></a>Mr.
Kidney:
						</b> Just to give an example from this very debate,
hon. Members have asked the Minister to give an assurance that mergers
will not be forced from the centre in the future. What if an order were
made in future to dissolve a couple of probation boards in order to
force through a merger? I think that Parliament would want to be able
to say that that was not what the Minister said at the time. The way to
consider such a proposal would be through the statutory instrument
procedure, which we will not have if this measure stays as it
is.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000361"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:

							<a name="0701177000366"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> We move to some of the more detailed
provisions on the functions and operations of the probation trusts. I
have some more general questions and queries on the schedule as a
whole, Mr. Atkinson, but if I am able to catch your eye and
if the debate does not wander too widely I hope to raise those in a
stand part debate.</div>
					<a name="0701177000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 7 would change the
minimum number of appointees for the probation trust. To a large extent
it is a probing amendment to find out how the Government arrived at the
number of four and, more generally, to probe the constitution of the
membership. It raises various questions. Under the Bill, a probation
trust will have a chairman and no fewer than four members will be
appointed by the Secretary of State. A chief executive will also be
appointed, but we shall come to that role in due course.</div>
					<a name="0701177000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be of benefit to the
Committee and more generally if the Minister were to explain how the
process is intended to operate. Will there be an automatic transfer of
existing probation board members if, as the Minister said, it is
intended to take a gradualist approach in converting the probation
board to a probation trust, or is it intended to have a more general
re-advertisement for its membership? What requirements will there be
for the chairman and ordinary members to have expertise, training or
other qualifications?</div>
					<a name="0701177000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the Secretary of State
will have wide-ranging powers to appoint the relevant members, it would
not be unreasonable to ensure clarity and certainty by providing that
members who are appointed should have relevant experience. The Bill
seems to be silent on that matter, and I would be grateful if the
Minister explained the Government&#146;s thinking. The Minister may
say that he wants as broad a range of people as possible&#151;indeed,
he has probably said so already&#151;but it is obviously important to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 107</div>
						understand the basis on which selection would take
place and whether it is envisaged that qualifications, expertise,
training or other requirements would inform the decision-making
process. We have already touched on the question of diversity. I am
sure that that, too, will be relevant.</div>
					<a name="0701177000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chairman and the other board
members will be appointed by the Home Secretary. My question is about
the pool of resources from which he chooses. The question was raised
earlier this afternoon, and mentioned in debates last week, whether
including specific lists in the Bill would be appropriate, and
particularly whether it would restrict or frame the choices.</div>
					<a name="0701177000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">A specific issue needs to be
addressed in the context of the relationship between the probation
trusts and the magistrates and judiciary&#151;a point to which hon.
Members have already alluded in their more general comments on clause
4. None the less, it is worth examining the question in further detail.
Turning Point highlighted the specific importance of magistrates in its
briefing notes. It said:</div>
					<a name="0701177000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Magistrates currently
play a central role in short prison sentences and the bulk of community
sentences. The National Offender Management Bill proposes ending the
statutory requirement for the judiciary to be represented on Probation
Boards. However no alternative representation has been considered. If
judges are not fully involved in the probation service, their
confidence in alternatives to prison will
decline.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
that certain changes have happened in this field, but that view
highlights concern about the implications if there is not an
established link between the activities of probation trusts and the
magistrates. If a formal link is not intended, as in our
amendmentNo. 8, what do the Government propose? What
arrangements do they envisage to promote that consultation and, indeed,
confidence between magistrates and probation trusts? When magistrates
give community sentences, for example, they have a relationship with
the probation trust and a confidence that services will be provided
appropriately. Therefore, magistrates can have confidence in the
decisions that they have
made.</div>
					<a name="0701177000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some people have
highlighted a concern about the relationship between community
sentences and other forms of disposal. I am sure that the Minister
would not be happy if an inadvertent consequence of the Bill would be
to add to one of his other problems, such as the ever-burgeoning prison
estate, which he is trying to manage. The overcrowding of prisons and,
therefore, the need for community sentences to be viewed with
confidence is key to the decisions that magistrates make&#151;based
on the facts before them&#151;as to the appropriate disposal for a
particular offence. That is assuming that the offence gets before the
magistrates and is not dealt with in some summary way, but we will have
that debate on another occasion and it may well not be ruled in order
in this
context.</div>
					<a name="0701177000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Comments also
touch on the need for confidence in the system in ensuring local and
locally accountable solutions. Rainer made the point well in its
briefing
note:</div>
					<a name="0701177000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Rainer
believes that both probation trusts and other providers contracted to
carry core offender management should have strong links with the local
community, criminal justice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 108</div>system and particularly the judiciary. Probation Boards are currently
required to include board members from amongst local magistrates and
local authorities. Rainer believes that such links should be maintained
and, indeed, widened to ensure that all agencies that have a core role
to play in public protection and reducing reoffending are regularly
involved in planning offender management. Trusts should appoint an
advisory group composing representatives from key
partners&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0701177000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">the note
goes on to list them.</div>
					<a name="0701177000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the Minister is prepared to consider the concept of an
advisory board. There is a need to ensure that there is some sort of
direct link with the community. Although the Minister has said that
probation trusts are intended to be wider in their viewpoint, they will
not necessarily be linked to a specific geographical location. Indeed,
they may be encouraged to partner with other probation trusts or to
develop certain specialisations that might have wider
application.</div>
					<a name="0701177000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
said, I still take it from the Minister that, at least currently, the
geographical link is intended to be maintained by way of the
contractual arrangements. In principle, a particular probation trust
may be responsible for probation services in a particular geographical
area. Therefore, my hon. Friends and I think that there is a need to
maintain some form of established link with the community
represented&#151;from within which the probation services are to be
provided&#151;to ensure accountability and to ensure that local
conditions are properly reflected. Obviously, the most effective way of
doing that is to have on the probation trust members of the community,
who will reflect its needs and aspirations. That is reflected in
amendment No. 27, in which we suggest that a probation trust should be
chaired by a judge of the High Court or Crown court to maintain
judicial integrity. It also suggests that the remaining members of the
board should include at least one of the persons listed&#151;a
district judge, a member of the local police authority, a qualified
psychiatrist from the local health trust or a member of the local
authority.</div>
					<a name="0701177000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
prescriptive; we are saying not that members should come only from that
list but that at least one member should. That would ring-fence a local
connection in a probation trust. There is no such latitude in the Bill
and all we have had is an indication from the Minister that he will
consider setting up some sort of advisory board or link. I am sure that
we shall return to the need for a local connection again and again, and
I hope that the Minister explains his thinking even if we do not agree
on how that connection should be
provided.</div>
					<a name="0701177000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that members of probation trusts have the widest possible
experience of the justice arena and a local community background.
Through the amendments we seek to promote such a structure and build
confidence in the judiciary, and greater partnership and shared
responsibility between agencies and relevant bodies to provide a better
service within the framework of the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000367"></a>Mark
Hunter:
						</b> I want to discuss amendment No. 38, although I
will take the opportunity to say that I am sympathetic to the
amendments in the name of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough
and his hon. Friends, not least because they touch on similar
ground.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 109</div>
					<a name="0701177000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment addresses the issue
of magistrates and local councillors being members of the new bodies.
That is important if local connections are to be maintained and
confidence in the system is not to be lost. I do not wish to plead a
special case for councillors and magistrates, although I confess that
some of my best friends are councillors and magistrates. However,
naming those two groups would guarantee that important local
connections were maintained. The amendment would create a legal
obligation for one member of a trust to be a magistrate for the
trust&#146;s area and another a local
councillor.</div>
					<a name="0701177000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is the
amendment needed? As we know, probation boards have local councillors
and magistrates on them, and as the Bill stands the trusts will not. To
be fair, the Minister has given every indication that he wishes them to
be inclusive and that no section of society should find itself
excluded. Nevertheless, guaranteeing the involvement of locally elected
representatives and magistrates would be a better way to achieve that
objective.</div>
					<a name="0701177000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Office says that trusts will primarily be made up of business people. I
know that the Minister has said that it is not his intention that they
will be people without local connections, appointed from on high and
from all over the place, but we must remember that they will not have
to come from the local area. Local connections are valuable and we
should not be keen to lose
them.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0701177000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0701177000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is at least
controversial that a probation trust will not be required to include
representatives of local businesses or of the wider community who would
be in a better position to represent the wishes of the local community.
The importance of the local community having faith in the probation
services to help with rehabilitation, as I mentioned earlier, cannot be
overstated. Does the Minister agree that we need to encourage the local
community to engage on a much wider basis than hitherto with
ex-prisoners to help in their rehabilitation process and encourage
local voluntary groups&#151;churches spring to mind&#151;to get
involved in this process if reoffending is to decrease?</div>
					<a name="0701177000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without that involvement,
frankly, so much of what we might hope to achieve is simply a wish
list. It is vital that those groups are involved if reoffending is to
decrease as we all want. We need as many connections to the local
community as possible to ensure that provision is community led. It is
local people involved in the probation service who understand the needs
of the service and who should be able to help form a service in their
own area which works according to the needs of the
area.</div>
					<a name="0701177000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why councillors
and magistrates? We would probably all agree that local councillors, as
representatives of their local communities, are best placed to ensure
that the views of the local community are heard on the probation board.
It seems that that would also create a level of local accountability in
the probation trusts similar to that on probation boards. That will
encourage the local population&#146;s faith in the trust and
encourage co-operation by the local community with the
trusts.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 110</div>
					<a name="0701177000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Magistrates, as the hon. Member
for Hornchurch said a few moments ago, play a central role in this
process. We need to be careful to keep them fully involved and to
ensure that the courts are not unwilling to give out community
sentences. They need to be assured of the success and effectiveness of
those community sentences. I should be interested in the
Minister&#146;s comments on
that.</div>
					<a name="0701177000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
probation service is and always has been linked to the magistrates
courts. The service provides reports and information to magistrates and
supervises people put on orders. The magistrates have always been a
part of the local community and their membership has been drawn as
widely and diversely as possible from those communities. Does the
Minister therefore agree that it is essential that magistrates continue
to have a lead role in the management of the probation
service?</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000368"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cheadle
for the manner in which he spoke to his amendment. We are all trying to
achieve the same objective. It is just a question of how we get there.
Of course I agree that we have to involve the widest range of people to
tackle reoffending. That goes to the heart of what I want to achieve. I
often say that in my time as an MP and as a councillor, I never fully
understood the impact of the criminal justice system on people
inour communities. It was always someone else&#146;s
responsibility. I was concerned about employment, education, health and
other major issues. The reality is that offenders are affected by all
those issues. We must start seeing offenders for what they
are&#151;part of our communities. Offenders come from our
communities. It is not someone else&#146;s problem. It has to be
tackled by our society and our communities. The reason for moving
towards the trusts is to tackle that
problem.</div>
					<a name="0701177000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much has been
made of our proposed changes to the membership of the trusts. Quite
reasonably, concern has been expressed about the size of the trusts and
the removal of some of the member requirements. I shall try to
demonstrate that those concerns are misplaced. The provisions in
schedule 1 relating to the employment of trust members are deliberately
designed to allow for flexibility and to afford the trusts greater
independence in determining their own requirements. We want the trusts
to be able to judge for themselves how they should best be constituted
to meet those local needs. We want to be able to appoint the right
people for the job, not to have to fill particular categories. That
does not mean that we do not attach any value to the expertise that
those categories represent. Of coursewe
do.</div>
					<a name="0701177000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to the
hon. Member for Hornchurch on the point about remuneration for members,
that would be done as set out in paragraph 5. Members of existing
boards are paid attendance allowances, and that will continue for
trusts. Board chairs receive annual salaries, and members get pro rata
amounts for attendance. Similar arrangements will apply to trusts. It
is also intended that there will be continuity of chairs and members,
but that the Secretary of State will reserve the right to not appoint
if there are outstanding issues. As I said earlier, I am heartened by
the high calibre of participants and the range of abilities that was
demonstrated when we recruited the new chairs
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div>of boards. The good thing is that there was an overwhelming
choice&#151;people wanted to come
forward.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0701177000369"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Neil Gerrard</b> (Walthamstow) (Lab): It would be helpful if
the Minister were to clarify how many probation trusts he envisages us
ending up with. I do not expect him to give us an exact number, but at
the moment we have 42 probation boards. I am not clear whether the
intention is that, at least initially, each of those boards will
transform itself into a trust or whether there will be a significant
change in the number at an early stage. The number does matter&#151;a
small number means bigger areas, and that in turn has implications for
local representation and local accountability, which becomes more and
more difficult the bigger the area that the trust has to cover. For
instance, it would be enormously difficult to try to have
representation across the whole of
London.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000370"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point. We
have no magic figure in our heads about the number of trusts. I have
also said that if all the boards want to become trusts and they meet
the criteria that we are going to develop on consultation, we will be
happy. That is why we do not want to restrict the make-up of the trusts
by prescribing who can or cannot sit on them. It might help my hon.
Friend if I go through the amendments; then he can see how he feels
about my
explanation.</div>
					<a name="0701177000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3 states:</div>
					<a name="0701177000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
probation trust shall consist of a chairman and not less than four
other members appointed by the Secretary of State; and the chief
executive&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0701177000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">and amendment
No. 7 proposes increasing &#147;four&#148; to &#147;five&#148;.
As I said, there is no science underlying the proposed figure. I fully
accept that in many, perhaps most, cases, trusts will need to have more
members than that. We are merely setting a minimum. Our intention is to
allow the size of the trust to match the work that it will carry out,
and to adapt to any change that might occur over time. In practice, it
is likely that the trusts will have more than the minimum number of
members, but they will not be required to do so if that is not
necessary. Having too many members would increase costs and slow down
decision making. The key point is that the number for an individual
trust will be a policy matter to be agreed between the chair and the
Secretary of State. It is worth noting that 36 of the current 42
probation boards have sought to reduce board membership as a result of
the opportunities that exist under recent changes.</div>
					<a name="0701177000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 27 proposes that
the trust chairman should be a judge of the High Court or the Crown
court. Boards already have a close relationship with the judiciary,
which is valuable and needs to be maintained, but requiring judicial
members to sit on trusts is not the right way to do that.</div>
					<a name="0701177000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In October 2005, we published a
consultation paper seeking views on our proposals to enable other
providers to deliver probation services and to create probation trusts.
In response, even those members of the judiciary who expressed concern
about our proposals acknowledged that in a world of multiple 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div>providers it would not be appropriate for judges to be appointed to
probation trusts. It would be particularly inappropriate for them to
chair trusts; indeed, I doubt that many of them would have the time or
the inclination to take on such a role.</div>

Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that a couple of the positions on a board of this nature
should be taken by housing experts, given the connection between
housing and offending, or by drug experts, given the connection with
drug misuse? Those are the sort of people who should be welcomed on to
such boards.</div>

						</b> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. That goes
to the heart of the point that we were discussing last
Thursday&#151;where do we stop when it comes to saying who has to be
on the board? I certainly see the bodies that he mentioned being
represented as a crucial element of resolving the problems that we
face. That gives me an opportunity, because I forgot this morning to
answer a point that the hon. Member for Hornchurch made about the
involvement of the learning and skills councils in the education
service. He will be pleased to know that more than 10 per cent. of
adults who gain basic skills gain them in prison, which is a useful
statistic about what goes on in our prisons. Employment on release from
prison is up by 10 per cent. from 10 years ago to 37 per cent. A new
service called the Offender Learning and Skills
Service&#151;OLASS&#151;has been established and probation boards
are represented on local commissioning boards that operate in that
area.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000373"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for coming back
on that point. The clarification that I sought was about the joint
commissioning and the seamless service that would need to be provided

rehabilitation and reintroducing offenders back into the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000374"></a>Mr.

						</b> There would clearly be a crucial role for the
commissioners in helping offenders to stop reoffending through the
educational skills that they need. The commissioner would have to
consider that and I am sure that local discussions would take place
with local bodies.</div>
					<a name="0701177000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to nail the issue of local support and approval. Yes, the

pointed out, in the duties that forthcoming local government
legislation places on the probation service for local area agreements,
we wanted to avoid the duplication and further development of the
number of bodies that consider those issues. It is entirely sensible to
concentrate on the existing structures, such as the local strategic
partnerships and the local area agreements. We have already set up the
crime and disorder reduction partnerships and we have the local
criminal justice boards. There is a great deal of local representation
on all those, and that would be the route by which we would try to
achieve the best outcomes in offender management.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div>
					<a name="0701177000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also talked about the links
between NOMS and sentencing, which will remain vital. We are creating
local forums for sentencers, NOMS and probation providers to discuss
all the issues of local concern. Regional commissioners will have links
with sentencers at a regional level via protocols that will inform
decisions about which services are commissioned. Amendment No. 8 states
that in addition to a chairman and a chief executive, the five or more
other members of a trust should also include a magistrate. Amendment
No. 39 would add a local councillor to that requirement. As I said, I
have many friends who are local councillors. Amendment No. 27 goes on
to propose that other members of a trust should include at least one of
a district judge, a member of a police authority, a psychiatrist or a
member of the local authority. Individuals from all those categories
are likely to have something to offer, but so may many others, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South pointed out.</div>
					<a name="0701177000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that we need the
freedom to be able to appoint individuals on the basis of their skills
and expertise and on how they relate to the needs of a trust at any
given time. Even today the needs of boards differ according to their
size or location. That variation may increase in future and we need to
be able to respond accordingly. The recruitment exercises to replace
members of the probation boards are showing diversity in the skills
offered by applicants.</div>
					<a name="0701177000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 27 would also
require that as far as possible members should be representative of the
local population. We remain committed to diversity in the selection of
trust members and have a good record in that area. In 2000, Her
Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of probation carried out a thematic
inspection of race equality in the probation service and the follow-up
report in 2004 noted that 16 per cent. of probation board members came
from a minority ethnic background. We do not believe that we need any
additional legislation to maintain that record, and it is hard to see
in practical terms how what is envisaged in the amendment would help.
That amendment and others add nothing of substance to the Bill or they
add inappropriate restrictions that would hinder, rather than support,
the effectiveness of public sector providers. I therefore hope that the
hon. Member for Hornchurch will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> This has been a helpful and informative
debate, which has re-emphasised the need for good community and local
links to probation trusts to ensure that they properly reflect their
communities, giving them the best opportunity to rehabilitate offenders
and to provide services that take account of local conditions and the
wishes of the local
community.</div>
					<a name="0701177000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
interesting points have been made in the debate. I take on board the
need for representation to be as wide as possible and for the Committee
to consider the issue more generally. The intervention by the hon.
Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South was helpful in reminding us of the
issues that offenders must address if they are to turn their lives
around. Often their dysfunctional lifestyle, a lack of family support,
a lack of housing, mental health problems, drug problems or other
issues in their background lead 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 114</div>
						to criminal behaviour or are a factor in that
behaviour. I want the probation trusts to have a greater involvement
with those sorts of issues, if they are subsequently established within
the framework in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0701177000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
rule out the opportunity to be more specific in respect of certain
requirements that would be expected of probation trusts. The Minister
is clearly not persuaded by the argument for including a more formal
structure in the schedule. I will reflect on what he has said and
consider what further action may be taken to establish an advisory
relationship alongside a probation trust. We will think about whether
it would provide a sufficient connection to make or preserve local
links and ensure that services are delivered in the way in which we
would expect. As we discussed this morning, local authorities have a
key role.</div>
					<a name="0701177000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
talked about local strategic partnerships, CDRPs and local area
agreements between various central and local governmental agencies to
ensure that improvements are made in key indicators and outcomes. That
framework must be considered in terms of the structure of the probation
trusts and their
membership.</div>
					<a name="0701177000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has referred to regional offender managers. Again, he made a
plaintive request that we believe that this is not a top-down approach
and that it is about local delivery. Again, I have heard what he has
said, but he will not be too surprised to learn that I have not been
persuaded by his arguments. However, in the context of what he has said
about a further review of this particular aspect of the Bill, I beg to

							<a name="0701177000378"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> The amendments concern the part of the schedule
that deals with the terms of employment and pay of the people who will
work for the probation trusts. Paragraph 7(2) states that the terms of
employment of any employees are for the trusts to determine, which will
inevitably lead to variations in employment between different trusts.
Paragraph 8 contains a caveat that pay, pension and other allowances
will require the approval of the Secretary of State. A further caveat
allows the Secretary of State to decide not to use that power. The
effect will be the disappearance of national collective bargaining on
pay and conditions, which has been in place in the probation service
for more than 60 years. Instead, we will end up with multiple providers
and multiple negotiations over conditions of service, which is not a
recipe for a service that will operate
well.</div>
					<a name="0701177000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have seen
something similar happen in my previous area of employment, when
further education colleges, which used to be subject to national
collective bargaining under the control of local education 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div>authorities, became independent corporations. The effect has been to
break down national negotiations over a number of years, which has led
to varying terms and conditions in different institutions. That
approach does not work well, and multiple negotiations do not help. It
is not only the 42 probation trusts that will be affected, because
there will be multiple other providers, too. As negotiations on pay and
conditions are broken down into smaller and smaller units, there will
inevitably be employers who are poor at negotiating. I have seen it
happen: the result is unnecessary disputes, because some of the people
conducting the negotiations do not have a clue what they are doing. I
am concerned that we are going down that
route.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000379"></a>Mr.
Flello:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Does my hon. Friend share my concern that,
in an area such as my constituency, where wages are below the average
for the wider west midlands, officers who are doing exactly the same
job as those in other parts of the country will be paid considerably
less, despite the fact that they are equally professional and good at
their
job?</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000380"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> The concern is that we will move in that
direction. If staff are transferred from one provider to another when a
new provider comes in, they will have the protection of TUPE. There are
also the two-tier work force regulations, so there is some protection
to help people who are transferred. It is not only a question of what
happens in the initial stages, but of what happens in the longer term
as new providers come in which are not simply transferring staff from
the existing national service. All the evidence from the experience of
the Prison Service is that the terms and conditions for staff in
private prisons are significantly lower than in the public sector. It
is a question of not only pay, but conditions&#151;the Bill
specifically mentions pensions and
allowances.</div>
					<a name="0701177000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">What will
happen to people&#146;s career development? A national structure, as
now, certainly helps if a probation officer moves from one area to
another. Continuity of service and how that counts towards pay, grades
or pensions, or how that relates to service entitlements such as annual
leave, are not at issue. That is all simple and straightforward with a
national structure and with the national professional career structure
that follows from that. The fragmentation of that national structure,
which will be the consequence of the schedule as it stands, is going to
cause problems.</div>
					<a name="0701177000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the staffing levels of the national probation service are
currently about 21,000, which is a relatively small number of people to
negotiate on a collective bargaining basis. If we split that 42 ways or
more, in some cases we will have a very small number of people
negotiating about pay and conditions, which I do not see working. That
will cause problems. The NOMS briefings issued by the Home Office state
that there are no plans to move away from collective bargaining, but
they specifically do not mention national collective bargaining. There
is an important difference between &#147;collective
bargaining&#148; and &#147;national collective
bargaining&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div>
					<a name="0701177000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not understand the need for
sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of paragraph 8. The provision in
sub-paragraph (1) that the determination of the terms of
employment&#151;remuneration, pensions,
allowances&#151;</div>
					<a name="0701177000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requires
the approval of the Secretary of
State&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">seems to be there
as a safeguard, which should ensure that an individual provider is not
able to shift pay and conditions a long way from the norm, particularly
not downwards, which would be the obvious fear. However, the rest of
paragraph 8 then gives the Secretary of State the power to ignore that.
He can just say that, for the time being, he will decide that that will
not apply. He might decide that that is not going to apply to an
individual trust or even across the board. In what circumstances does
the Minister think that he might wish to do away with any safeguards
that he is putting in place on pay and conditions, which is the total
effect of paragraph
8?</div>
					<a name="0701177000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the almost
inevitable consequence of the fragmentation that we are likely to see,
if the Bill goes through in its present form. If we end up with large
numbers of relatively small providers in the business, particularly in
the private sector, then ensuring that national collective bargaining,
national pay rates and national terms and conditions apply will be very
difficult. We do not want to see a situation where two people doing
identical jobs, maybe just a few miles apart, are on completely
different terms and conditions of work, pay and pensions. That is where
the schedule will lead us, if it stays as it is. I hope that my hon.
Friend the Minister will reconsider it and explain why he believes it
necessary to take away the safeguard of requiring the Secretary of
State&#146;s approval of pay, pensions and allowances, which will be
an important issue for people who might wish to work in the
service.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> I rise to speak briefly on the amendments. I
heard clearly what the hon. Member for Walthamstow said, and the
Minister might be interested to know that I do not particularly want to
dwell on the private grief on the Government side of the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0701177000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">My normal
criticism of the Government&#146;s top-down approach might not be so
appropriate in this case, given that the schedule provides some
discretion at local level. If the Minister is going down the dynamic,
competitive route of promoting innovation in services and their
delivery, the probation trusts, even if they are intended to compete
against each other, will need flexibility in relation to the manner in
which they operate if that model is to be
effective.</div>
					<a name="0701177000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">On career
development, a relevant question is how standards will be maintained in
the system through training. The Minister addressed the importance of
that this morning and said that the contractual framework would ensure
certain standards of training and provisions on meeting the cost of
training. When we discuss the designation of officers of providers of
probation services under clause 6, we will ask how that will be
measured and what standing the individuals in question will need to
have. My concerns about the standards to be applied may well be dealt
with then.</div>
					<a name="0701177000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
listen with interest to the Minister&#146;s response and see whether
he is able to square the circle of the points raised by his hon.

							<a name="0701177000382"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow for raising serious points. I know that he will accept that
the present Government have done more for the protection of employment
rights than any previous Government. Prior to my role in the Home
Office, I was happy to be the Minister responsible for employment
relations and rights and employees&#146; terms and conditions. In
fact, I have had some interesting ministerial roles: I was also the
Competition Minister, so I fully understand competition. We part
company from the official Opposition because they believe in the free
market whereas we believe in fair markets and in establishing rules and
regulations that create fair market
conditions.</div>
					<a name="0701177000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend paints a picture of doom and gloom. Are we engaged in a race to
the bottom? Are the proposals about devaluing the role of probation
officers and providers, getting things on the cheap and thereby
affecting the quality of the service? I say to him that they are not. I
said earlier that I fully understand the role of the trade unions and
their desire to protect their members&#146; terms and
conditions.</div>
					<a name="0701177000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
7 and 8 of the schedule deal with the arrangements for trusts to employ
staff. Paragraph 7 states that the terms of
employment</div>
					<a name="0701177000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are for the
trust to
determine.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 8
allows but, importantly, does not require the Secretary of State to
approve the terms of employment determined by trusts.
AmendmentsNos. 35 and 36 would restrict that flexibility by
requiring the Secretary of State to determine terms of employment. The
current provisions in schedule 1 are designed to allow flexibility for
the long term and to leave sufficient room for manoeuvre to respond to
circumstances that we cannot yet foresee. I believe we should never say
never, so we should not rule out for all time the possibility of trusts
determining their own pay and conditions at some point in the future.
If, at that point, it becomes appropriate for trusts to set their own
pay levels, surely it would be wrong if primary legislation prevented
that from happening.</div>
					<a name="0701177000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I assure my hon. Friend
that that is not what we have in mind. We do not think it is
appropriate for individual trusts to set their own terms and we have no
plans to change the current arrangements whereby pay, terms and
conditions are negotiated nationally. I hope my hon. Friend will agree
that the provision is sensible. I acknowledge the seriousness of the
issues he raises, but it would be wrong to prevent us from ever taking
that opportunity. There are currently no plans to do so. I know from
the strength of representations from the trade unions involved that
they would resist the Government if our intention was to go down that
route&#151;but it is not.</div>
					<a name="0701177000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, my hope is that
the public sector will rise to the challenge and that the probation
trusts will be public sector-led, but in the spirit of trying to be
dynamic and to open up the opportunities in the Bill, I hope that my
hon. Friend will accept my assurances and withdraw the
amendment.</div>

pay 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>
						and pensions and so on, but not necessarily to other
terms of employment. Paragraph 7(2) states specifically that</div>

... are for the trust to determine&#148;.
</div>
					<a name="0701177000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the Minister has gone
some way in dealing with pay and pensions, he may not have dealt with
some of the other aspects.</div>
					<a name="0701177000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not predicting a race to
the bottom. Some of the people involved in probation boards now, who
may well be involved in probation trusts in future, are not
unreasonable people who would behave irresponsibly, but the more
fragmented the system becomes, the more likely it is that somebody,
somewhere&#151;a trust or employer&#151;will see the provision as a
way of driving conditions down.</div>
					<a name="0701177000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word
&#147;flexibility&#148; always worries me; almost every time it is
used, it seems to indicate that something nasty that I would prefer not
to happen will happen. The Minister said the measure may be used
&#147;at some point in the future&#148;. I hope we do not get to
that point, because it will not be a particularly efficient way of
dealing with pay, pensions or that sort of issue. To have multiple
negotiations with multiple providers does not seem the right way to go.
When that has happened in other places, it seems to have led to
completely unnecessary disputes that could have been sorted out if the
matter had been dealt with at regional or national level.</div>

						Amendment No. 9 would
delete that sub-paragraph.It is a probing amendment to give us
a better understanding of how paragraph 14 will operate as it seems to
state that different directions may be given to different probation
trusts for different purposes. How will compliance with general
requirements fit in? If there is a general requirement for a probation
trust to act in a particular way, it seems strange that under
sub-paragraph (3) certain probation trusts might not be required to
comply with that more general requirement. In what circumstances might
some sort of waiver or exclusion be
appropriate?</div>
					<a name="0701177000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
general point in relation to paragraph 14 and the power relating to
general or specific compliance by a probation trust. There may be
circumstances in which there are separate contracting arrangements that
may sit below the probation trust. For example is it envisaged that the
Secretary of State could order that a particular subcontractor&#146;s
contract be terminated? What would happen in those circumstances in
relation to any potential liabilities or damages that may accrue? That
sort of exclusion may be what was intended in sub-paragraph (3). Some
sort of confirmation of the intent of paragraph 14 and the exclusions
that might apply is
needed.</div>

consideration to the amendment. I look forward to hearing what he has
to say about it.</div>

							<a name="0701177000390"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I do not know whether it is the time of day,
but hon. Members are becoming more suspicious of the powers of the
Secretary of State. I hope to reassure them that those are entirely
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0701177000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for Hornchurch said, paragraph 14(1) of schedule 1 requires
a probation trust to</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div>
					<a name="0701177000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;comply with any general or specific
directions given to it by the Secretary of State in connection with the
carrying on of any of its
activities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
14(3) states that different directions may be given for different
purposes and in relation to different trusts.</div>
					<a name="0701177000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the wording is slightly
different, the effect of that paragraph is the same as that of existing
legislation, as applied to local boards in paragraph 14 of schedule 1
of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, so there is
nothing new at all in what we propose. Paragraph 14 does not restrict
the types of direction that might be issued, but sub-paragraph (2)
gives an example of what we have in mind, namely directions requiring a
trust to provide information relating to its performance. The effect of
the amendment will be to cast doubt on the ability of the Secretary of
State to issue different directions to different trusts for different
purposes.</div>
					<a name="0701177000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
indicated, that will be more restrictive than the existing law, and it
will be particularly inappropriate for a future world in which there is
likely to be greater diversity between trusts and a greater need for
different directions to be issued. At the outset, we expect to treat
all the trusts the same, but that might not always be the case. For
example, in future, not all trusts will necessarily deliver the same
range of services, so if a particular direction is relevant to only one
area of service provision, it will be pointless to issue it on a
blanket basis to all trusts. We might, in due course, decide to allow
some trusts that are performing particularly well greater autonomy than
others. We have no specific plans in that regard at the moment, but it
would be foolish to rule out such flexibility for the future.</div>
					<a name="0701177000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to strike a balance
between retaining appropriate controls over what will continue to be
public sector bodies and avoiding excessive bureaucracy and unnecessary
interference from the centre. The appropriate balance may evolve over
time and in different ways for different trusts. I hope that hon.
Members will accept the need for flexibility, that they will believe
that there is no need to be so suspicious and that they will not press
their amendments.</div>

							<a name="0701177000391"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I hear the Minister&#146;s counsel not to
be suspicious, but if we are to do our jobs, it is appropriate for
those on this side of the Committee to be suspicious of powers that are
vested in the Secretary of State. We have already debated this
afternoon the greater control and the focus on what we see as the
top-down approach, with more power being ceded to and vested in the
Secretary of State. That always makes me suspicious, whatever the
context in which it arises.</div>
					<a name="0701177000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the Minister&#146;s
comments on the amendment. It is important that reporting is done, and
that information on compliance with contractual provisions and
performance criteria that might be applied to a particular probation
trust are provided in a timely and appropriate fashion, given that we
all agree that the protection of the public has to be a paramount
requirement, and that it is appropriate in certain circumstances for
the Secretary of State to require that information be provided to
ensure that a fundamental underpinning obligation is being
appropriately and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div>adequately met. In the context of what the Minister has said, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> I beg to move amendmentNo. 10, in
schedule 1, page 25, line 2, at
end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) A probation
trust must comply with the duties set out in sections 10 and 11 of the
Children Act 2004 (c.
81)&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0701177000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is intended to re-emphasise the importance of compliance in
the Children Act 2004. Probation boards are included under section 10,
which places a duty on agencies that provide services for children to
co-operate with local children&#146;s trust arrangements to improve
the well-being of the children and young people in the relevant local
authority&#146;s area. Section 11 places duties on specific agencies,
including probation boards, to ensure that they discharge their
services</div>
					<a name="0701177000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having regard
to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0701177000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point has
been highlighted by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. In its
view, it is vital that those duties are effectively transferred to the
new probation
trusts.</div>
					<a name="0701177000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is intended to elicit greater information and clarification on the
specific obligations and requirements in the 2004 Act that the
probation boards currently meet and comply with. Perhaps that needs to
be examined in the context of the Act itself; an amendment to it might
be required to reflect the changed situation and the arrangements
contemplated in this Bill.</div>
					<a name="0701177000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event, the protection of
children is an extremely important aspect of what is before us. As we
have heard, education is key, but public protection of children at
risk, who may be in vulnerable situations, is also extremely important.
The Committee should restate that this afternoon. It is imperative that
the Minister state the situation to ensure that nothing will be lost
and that the obligations and requirements of the 2004 Act will be
maintained, adhered to and followed through, whatever arrangements we
end up with as a result of our consideration of the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000393"></a>Mark
Hunter:
						</b> I want to say a few words about the amendment,
although most of the ground has been covered by the hon. Gentleman. I
want to talk from my own perspective about the amendment&#146;s
importance and what it is designed to achieve. We have heard several
times about the importance of protecting children, which is crucial to
what we are trying to do. However, the amendment would place a duty on
probation trusts to co-operate with local children&#146;s trust
arrangements as set out under section 10 of the 2004 Act and to ensure
that they discharge their services with regard to the need to
&#147;safeguard and promote&#148; the welfare of children under
section 11.</div>
					<a name="0701177000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we know,
that includes co-operation with the local authority, its relevant
partners and other agencies that conduct any work relating to
children&#151;a district council, police authority, youth offending
team, strategic health authority, primary care trust, learning and
skills council and other bodies that provide services under section 114
of the Learning and Skills Act 2000.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 122</div>
					<a name="0701177000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are five important
considerations: the physical and mental health of the individuals and
their emotional well-being; protection from harm and neglect;
education, training and recreation; the contribution made by them to
society; and finally, social and economic well-being. I am sure that
the Minister will want to address such concerns in his
response.</div>
					<a name="0701177000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is the
amendment needed? Probation boards were included in sections 10 and 11
of the 2004 Act as agencies that provide services to children. They
therefore need to co-operate with the local children&#146;s trust
arrangements. That duty needs to be transferred to the probation trusts
so that they can effectively co-operate with the agencies to ensure
that the care and management of young offenders is co-ordinated and is
consistent with their services in other areas. That will help to create
good end-to-end management, which I know that hon. Members from all
parties agree is important, especially when children come into contact
with many different agencies through schools, care homes and the like.
It is important that those groups have the necessary information to
ensure that the well-being of the child is looked after
consistently.</div>
					<a name="0701177000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Co-operation also includes
transferring information between the different agencies and
organisations. Both that and the joined-up projects between Government
agencies could help to stop young people, especially those in care,
from getting into trouble to start with. It would certainly help with
rehabilitating young offenders back into the community. I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s comments on those
concerns.</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000394"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> May I preface my remarks by thanking the hon.
Members for Hornchurch and for Cheadle for their points? They are
extremely important and there is no division in the Committee when we
talk about the importance of the Bill leading to greater public
protection. When we start to talk about the protection of children in
particular, it becomes even more real to us all. I thought that the way
in which the hon. Gentlemen made their points added to the
consideration of the Bill by the Committee. From the perspective of the
Government, there is no difference between any of us on the point. We
expect to see sections 10 and 11 of the Children Act 2004 applied as
rigorously and as fully as they are at present to the whole range of
operation of any new system.</div>
					<a name="0701177000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make some remarks with
specific reference to the amendment. The references to local probation
boards in the 2004 Act are just two examples of many references to
local probation boards throughout the statute book. Many of those
references place duties on local probation boards to carry out certain
functions, and often they concern joint working with criminal justice
and other statutory agencies. Let me make it clear, as I said at the
beginning, that we remain committed to maintaining the position of
probation in all those areas. We recognise that all the statutory
references will need to be updated to take account of the fact that
probation boards will ultimately cease to exist. However, the way to do
that is not simply to place on probation trusts the requirements that
apply to probation boards, which is the effect of the
amendment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>
					<a name="0701177000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need, too&#151;I hope that
the hon. Gentlemen will accept this&#151;to take account of the fact
that in future probation trusts will work alongside other providers to
whom those statutory provisions might also need to apply. Although a
consequential amendment is therefore necessary to sections 10 and 11 of
the Children Act, I do not think that that needs to be set out in the
Bill in this way. In due course we will table a consequential amendment
to ensure that the relevant duties continue to apply when probation
boards cease to exist. In light of my comments, I hope that the hon.
Member for Hornchurch will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0701177000395"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I thank the Minister for the manner in which
he has responded to the amendment and for his reassurance that the
issues will remain a high priority in how services are undertaken,
whoever they might subsequently be carried out by. The Minister made
the point that the arrangements could lead to other providers becoming
involved in service provision. We need to contemplate that point. His
point about the amendment is fair and justified, and we will review the
amendment that the Minister has promised to table on the matter. On the
basis of that commitment and because our amendment does not properly
address the wider aspects discussed in this debate, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0701177000396"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> Before we leave the schedule, I would
appreciate clarification on a few technical points. Paragraph 1(1)
states:</div>
					<a name="0701177000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
probation trust is a body
corporate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume that
it is intended to establish the probation trusts as companies limited
by guarantee rather than as any other corporate structure, but I would
appreciate the Minister&#146;s confirmation of that
point.</div>
					<a name="0701177000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 1(2)
states:</div>
					<a name="0701177000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
name of the trust is that specified in the order establishing
it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0701177000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
consider tabling an amendment to include any subsequent order amending
it? Clause 4(1)(b) states that the Secretary of
State</div>
					<a name="0701177000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may by
order...establish a probation trust for purposes specified in the
order&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0701177000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">so in those
circumstances, the name would be as stated in the subsequent order
rather than in the establishing
order.</div>
					<a name="0701177000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2
states:</div>
					<a name="0701177000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
probation trust is not to be regarded as the servant or agent of the
Crown&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0701177000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister might
recall, although maybe notwith fondness, our discussions on
the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill. I would be
grateful if he were to confirm the status of probation trusts under
that Bill and in connection with any associated liability.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div>
					<a name="0701177000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 4 deals with the
removal of an appointed member. It would be helpful for the Committee
if the Minister were to clarify the circumstances envisagedfor
the removal of a member, so that it would not be done peremptorily or
unreasonably, given that those members&#146; functions might
sometimes include raising issues about the maintenance of probation
services, which might make Ministers or the Government uncomfortable.
We need to ensure openness and dialogue without fear of
removal.</div>
					<a name="0701177000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to
paragraphs 6(2) and 8. We have debated general employees, but in
connection with the chief executive, probation trusts might have issues
attracting suitable members and executives to drive them forward.
Particularly if we enter a competitive and dynamic situation in which
other providers try to muscle in on the market, it is important not to
leave probation trusts at a competitive disadvantage by allowing the
Secretary of State to refuse certain arrangements. Some clarification
on the specific issue of chief executives in addition to our wider
debate on general employees would be
helpful.</div>
					<a name="0701177000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
12(2) states that a probation trust &#147;may not hold land&#148;.
Will the Minister confirm that that includes land in its broadest
sense, and that the provision is in no way intended to fetter the
probation trust&#146;s ability to hold leases, to have other
holdings, to provide its services from such properties or, indeed, to
have offices at such properties? The paragraph mentions managing
&#147;land held by another&#148;, but I would appreciate
clarification to ensure that that will not be an unnecessary
fetter.</div>
					<a name="0701177000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the
statement of accounts required by paragraph 13(1)(b) the
same&#151;assuming that the probation trust is a company limited by
guarantee and established under the Companies Acts&#151;as the
requirement to file accounts? Will the accounts be one and the same, or
will two separate sets be prepared on a different basis? If there is to
be duplication, why is it necessary? And will there be a requirement
for a separate financial statement to be audited, as later paragraphs
of the schedule
suggest?</div>
					
					<a name="0701177000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0701177000397"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking
those questions about this schedule, which goes to the core of the
Bill. He is quite right to do so, and I shall do my best to answer his
questions. If I miss any, I shall ensure that he gets the answers in
writing.</div>
					<a name="0701177000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point on probation trusts as corporate bodies,
it is clear that trusts will not be companies limited by guarantee.
They will be normal bodies corporate, with no change from the legal
status of the current boards. Most of the schedule is based on existing
legislation, and many of his questions are covered by those provisions.
The key difference is that we are seeking greater flexibility to give
the trusts greater independence from the centre. He keeps saying that
it will be a top-down system, but we are trying to give trusts the
flexibility and freedom to do a good
job.</div>
					<a name="0701177000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased that
the hon. Gentleman has recognised that we are the first Government to
move on Crown immunity, and the probation trusts will be covered by the
provisions on the Crown acting as employer, which he will remember from
the discussions on the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div>Bill. They will be in the same position as any other Government service.
The holding of land will be the same as it is now&#151;as one would
expect, trusts will not be prevented from holding
leases.</div>
					<a name="0701177000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to spend
some time discussing the role of the chief executive, because the hon.
Gentleman made a fair point in saying that there will be a change in
line management and the relationship with the chief officer. Both the
chiefs and chairs of the probation boards will be appointed by the
Secretary of State, which will create a lack of clarity about the lines
of accountability and the relationship between the chief and the chair.
As the hon. Gentleman has said, paragraph 6 provides for the chief
executive to be appointed by the trust itself, which will clarify
accountability and give the trust greater independence to run its own
affairs.</div>
					<a name="0701177000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 6(3)
makes a transitional provision by allowing, though not requiring, the
appointment of the first chief executive of a trust to be made by the
Secretary of State. That will facilitate a smooth transition between
board and trust status, so that an existing chief executive can be
transferred from one to the other without a fresh appointment round.
Once appointed, whether by the Secretary of State or the trust, the
chief executive will become a full member of the trust and provide an
executive presence on the governing body. His employment status will
remain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 126</div>different from that of members appointed by the Secretary of State, who
will retain the power to determine the chief executive&#146;s terms
and conditions and to dismiss him, if
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0701177000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
removal of members will be by a procedure similar to the current one.
It will be about removing not people who disagree but those who act
inappropriately. As one would expect, there are clear procedures in
place for people to be removed and to have the opportunity to appeal.
The chief&#146;s employment status in that regard will be the same as
that of other staff. The schedule gives us an opportunity to create
flexibility, but it does not stray too far from the principles agreed
in the 2000
Act.</div>
