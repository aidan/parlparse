                  </span> I welcome you, Miss Clark, to
our proceedings. You will find that generally we are a well-behaved
bunch, despite the best efforts of one or two of us to break from that
norm.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Just before
we broke for lunch, I was on my feet for just a minute, probably not
without hesitation and certainly not without deviation, as I
acknowledged that it was the birthday of the national health service. I
will now focus rather more smartly, I hope, on the amendment moved by
my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West, which I rise to support. By
way of context, I shall reflect on the policy implications of
increasing life expectancy. I will also argue that generalisations
about demography and longevity might create new injustices unless
pensions policy becomes more sophisticated and is supported by wider
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s proposals have an obvious context, but perhaps it
is not so obvious. It is demographic—several colleagues have
spelled out the demographic trends, and I will note one or two
statistics myself. We also need to view the issues, albeit briefly, as
we are in Committee, in a wider context of trends that have affected
life cycles in the 20th century and are now affecting them in the
21st century. Today and in future, typical life cycles are
and will be characterised by later entry into the labour market, as
well as lives that are lived longer. Therefore, many years are spent in
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Today,
many of our children and grandchildren will not enter the labour market
properly—there will be holiday jobs, I know—until the age
of 21, or, with postgraduate qualifications and training, perhaps
closer to the age of 25. In other words, in a modern society and
economy, people may take 25 years to get started, at enormous expense
to different people, such as families and the state. I will not talk
about education, but although arguments about tuition fees may seem
distant from a discussion on pensions, in terms of how we understand
life cycles, those two subjects seem closer intellectually than might
be
thought.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have seen statistics on longevity. I thank the Minister and the
Department for their useful background statistical documents. One page
tells us that in 1926, women who survived to 65—many did not, of
course, and I will talk about that in the modern era—lived a
further 13 years. Recent evidence suggests that that average has
increased to 24 years in the recent past. The Department, presenting
new data from the Office for National Statistics, issued projections
that revised that still further upwards to 28.7 years; that is for
women. I hope that I have got the figures roughly right; the Minister
will correct them if I am wrong, although they are his
figures.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the interesting figures in the documents shows that longevity now
means that women could spend 42% of their adult life at state pension
age, many of them, but perhaps not all, retired. That is an
extraordinary thought and in many respects, one could argue, a slightly
scary one. It would certainly require us to be a little more robust
about what we mean by the strange and old-fashioned word,
“retirement”, but that goes a bit further.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Previous
Conservative and Labour Governments accepted the demographic logic, the
implications of longevity and life expectancy, and have legislated
accordingly. In other words, the judgment was made that people will
have to take their state pension at a later 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 47<a class="bkMark" name="Column47">&#160;</a>
                  </div>age and the nettle was grasped rightly to bring about equality between
men and women because of the strangeness—although we can
understand it historically—that women could have their state
pension at the age of 60, while men had to wait until the age of 65
despite the fact that women live longer because they are stronger than
men.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Both
previous Governments planned for the long term, as many thoughtful
individuals do. However, the nub of our critique is that the Bill is
more about an interpretation and a response to deficit. I am not
encouraging the hon. Member for Reading West to get to his feet; he
made a good intervention, and I enjoyed it the first time.
<em>[Interruption.]</em> Members of the Committee were not meant to
laugh. In my judgment, the Bill is more a response to deficit and the
crisis that we are undoubtedly in than sound, social policy planning
and, as a consequence, it heaps a spectacular burden on the shoulders
of the relatively few women—albeit up to half a
million—who will be adversely
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">After
changes to other social policy measures such as child tax credits and
child benefits, many people are entitled to ask whether the coalition
has a problem with women because many of the severest cuts will fall on
the necks and shoulders of women. I noted earlier that past reforms
have met with little resistance or controversy. That is true, and if we
compare the gradual planning of both Conservative and Labour
Governments with the huge disturbances in Paris, for example, when
pension changes were mooted, it is a tribute to those previous
Governments that the long-term planning seemed fair to the public.
There might have been the odd grumble here or there, but it did not
create huge controversy. It was not about conflict. Indeed, it was more
about
consensus.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill is undoubtedly different. It has brought conflict into the pension
policy process because of new forms of injustice. There is a now a
serious danger that that risks shaking and undermining public
acceptance of the demographic challenge, and I would regret it if that
turned out to be the case. I would also regret it if the Bill further
undermined our support for the contributory principle in national
insurance. It did not always work out well in practice because people
paid in when they could because it was their duty, but they drew out as
of right when they needed to, because that was their right, but if we
start to undermine the principle in different ways, we will be in
trouble.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to ask two questions, although I shall be careful not to say too
much about such matters because both more than touch on the amendment
that I shall discuss either today or Thursday, when I shall probably be
talking more about men. However, I shall focus on women now and the
danger of overgeneralising about longevity and life
expectancy.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have known
for some years about the logic of longevity and life expectancy. There
is no quarrel, but we get into difficulty when we assume that everyone,
regardless of background, will live 20 or 30 years in retirement so
they must all understand the nature of the challenge. I wanted to
e-mail all members of the Committee a paper, but I do not know whether
I did. With support from the Library, which had support from the Office
for National Statistics, I looked at the likelihood of women dying
before they reached the current state pension age of 60.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000028">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 48<a class="bkMark" name="Column48">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
interesting to examine such results by social class. I must say that
the social class of the husband was used methodologically in the
process. The Library advised me that that was the best measure to go
by, although distinguished social scientists might disagree. When we
look at the figures, we see that 4% of women from the higher managerial
and professional class—so-called “social class
I”—die before the age of 60; for the next group, the
lower managerial and professional class, the figure is 5%; and for
intermediates, it is 5%. Women doing routine occupations—women
in the poorest social class, if you like—tend to be manual
workers. Many of them do the grottiest jobs in care homes, or are
cleaners, and so on. When we look at those women from the routine
social class, we see that fully 10% of them die before the age of 60.
We can argue about the implications of that; I am bound to say that
they are not obvious, although I will have a proposition on Thursday to
put about them. Nevertheless, I hope that that figure will make us stop
and think that this demographic trend is not so clear-cut and general
as might be thought.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of course,
the other interesting thing is that when we look at people who reach
state pension age—most people from all social classes do reach
it—we again see, because of differentials in mortality through
social class, that women and men from the poorest social class enjoy or
experience fewer pension years than those in the professional class. I
am focusing today on women, but the difference for both men and women
is about four years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My thesis
would be, “Look, let’s be a bit careful about
this”. Quite a few of those women in the poorest social
class—we are talking about women today—die before they
get their pension at 60, putting aside any consideration of wanting to
push the pension age up still further. Of course, when women in the
poorest social class get their pension, they generally get it for four
fewer years than people in very different circumstances, who did not
leave school at 14 or 15 and who did not do cleaning or manual work.
Despite the stresses and strains of a Committee on a Tuesday afternoon,
many people in the professions, such as ourselves, do not suffer the
physical hardships that many manual jobs
involve.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000031">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes, I do. The Minister very helpfully—to
truth, let alone his own case—presented some evidence on that.
Of course, I recognise that that statement is true. Indeed, someone
else could make a further point that surely health inequalities fall
outside the range of pensions and we need to tackle those inequalities,
and the Marmot review has just been published, which reminded me of the
Black report of many years ago. I understand all that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Nevertheless,
I am trying to say to the Minister—although he has heard this
argument from me once or twice in recent
months—“Let’s just pause for thought about whether
we have absolutely got this right as we move the state pension age up
rather quickly for this group of women.” I do not know whether
the Minister, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 49<a class="bkMark" name="Column49">&#160;</a>
                  </div>perhaps with ONS’s help, has been able to establish whether the
increase in state pension age that we now propose for women runs ahead,
as it were, of increasing life expectancy, if he understands what I
mean. At the moment, x% die before the age of 60; I have said that it
is about 10% of the poorest. Could that percentage nudge up a bit,
because of the things that we have been discussing? I do not know
whether he has any figures on that. I genuinely do not know what the
answer would be. It may be that things remain much the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000034">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">This
morning, the hon. Member for Arfon raised issues about location, which
we discussed. It is worth putting some of this on the record further. I
will read from my own paper, if that is allowed; one can plagiarise
oneself, I think. This general social class difference is reflected in
geographical differences. Considering drastic local variations in
longevity, if we compare Kensington and Chelsea with Glasgow—the
hon. Gentleman used this example himself—there is a difference
of almost 10 years. That is for men, but there is of course
a difference for women too. Across Sheffield, there is a difference of
more than 14 years if we look at longevity. Even in Kensington and
Chelsea—I alluded to this without the reference in front of
me—which is, as he said, the borough with the highest life
expectancy, there is a difference of eight years between the most and
least deprived wards. As we represent different constituencies, and
different social groups within our constituencies, my plea is to move
away from generalisations and think whether a future policy which
simply says that everyone has to reach a certain age before they get
their state pension, might be insensitive to the way in which life
cycles are being acted out.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
point I wanted to raise, which has been touched upon by colleagues, is
about employment. Various people have referred to the very good
documentation we have had from the Department. Again, my plea would be:
let us not generalise. Let us not assume that as we raise the state
pension age—in this case for women—everyone will somehow
be able to maintain their place in the labour market, keep their job,
or, if they are not in a job already, readily be able to acquire a new
job at the age of 60 or 61, 64 or 65. Common sense suggests that that
is quite a proposition for the coalition Government to put forward. The
figures I have—I may be repeating one given this
morning—is that, looking at economic inactivity rates by age, by
the age of 59 almost 40% of women are so-called economically inactive,
for different reasons. In fact, it increases quite rapidly in the late
50s. You only have to go back to the age of 57 where the economic
activity rate is only—and I say “only”, in
inverted commas—26.7%. It suddenly shoots up in those last few
years before the current state pension age.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As we proceed
to raise the state pension age, quite rapidly for women, which is our
main point, how confident is the Committee that, in our different
constituencies, faced with these different occupational groups, jobs
will be available for those women who want to work? Others have caring
responsibilities, and I understand that, although many people, of
course, combine work and care. Are we confident about the employment
implications of this? 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 50<a class="bkMark" name="Column50">&#160;</a>
                  </div>I sometimes think that when people talk about this—not
in this place, because I think we are more realistic, but some of the
great commentators on this—it is assumed that out there is a
world where everyone hitting 65 or 66 will develop some sort of
portfolio of interests. There will be company directorships, and
lectures, and books to write, and all these other things. Well, what is
the equivalent for the lady who cleans our lavatories? What does her
portfolio look like? Many of these people, because of their manual
work, and because often they have been in the employment market since
the age of 15 or 16, are actually worn out. Many of those who have
written to me have talked about aching limbs and strained backs. In a
very old-fashioned way, for these social groups, retirement is very
important as a chance to have a rest and to relax after a lifetime of
labour. I think we should be cautious before we readily assume that we
can just keep on increasing the state pension age—in terms of
this amendment, quite rapidly—for this group of

the right hon. Gentleman makes; they are very valid and serious points.
My question is that we are talking about, relatively speaking, a
minimal difference. Exactly the same issues that the right hon.
Gentleman is discussing would have applied to his Government when they
were in power, where women who, as the right hon. Gentleman said,
started work at 15 or 16, would be worn out, to coin a phrase. I am
unsure what alternatives the previous Government brought forward,
because they were following the same

spectre of social class variations by mortality has not suddenly
appeared under this coalition Government. I am being fair-minded. All
sorts of other evils have appeared, which we can discuss on another
occasion. Of course, it has always been an issue, but it goes back to
the point that I raised earlier—my hon. Friend the Member for
Leeds West put it better than I did—that past Governments have
approached the problem rather cautiously and over a long term, so that
individuals could plan and think through their future. The rush to
judgment on increasing the state pension age for women is different
from what preceded it, which is one difference. If and when I introduce
my amendment later in the week—I am not 100% confident about it,

solutions to put to the

                  </strong> Good afternoon, Miss Clark. This morning, you
missed a ripsnorter—as it is known in the trade—of a
discussion on the important issue of the state pension age. That has
been the focus of much attention, and it is proper that it is the first
clause of the Bill. I want to respond to the points made by every

               <p>I am sure that he does
not mean the Secretary of State or me—I might take some pride in
it—but it is not an entirely accurate description of the
Government’s approach. However, from the speech that the right
hon. Member for Croydon North has just given and most others, one could
be forgiven for thinking that amendment 16 and the others in the group
would not raise the state pension age to 66; of course, they would. In
response to an intervention, the hon. Member for Leeds West went
further and said that the current legislative timetable for moving to
67 and 68 is too pedestrian. <em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> I
think she did. She also said that that move should probably be faster
to pay for the effect of the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
the points made by the right hon. Member for Croydon North and other
Members about people feeling worn out in their late 50s and struggling
to find jobs in their 60s will be true whenever we move to a pension
age of 66, 67 and 68. Nothing in the group of amendments would address
the points that have been raised; they would still be true, but true
just a few years later. I will come on to the question of notice, but I
thought it was important to make the point that the general trend to
longer life expectancy and later state pension ages will raise
precisely the issues referred to by Opposition Members, which are not
remotely dealt with in the amendments. It is important to put on the
record that the amendments would raise precisely the same
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
was struck during the debate by the fact that Opposition Members are
asking the single figure of the state pension age to do a huge number
of different jobs. It is meant to tackle local labour market
difficulties in Wales and the fact that some working-class
men—and women, for that matter—leave school at 16 and
have amassed 49 years of contributions by the pension age.
It is being asked to address differences in healthy life expectancy and
differences between regions. One number cannot do all that work. The
issues raised are perfectly proper, but the idea that we should respond
to them through the state pension age is where the logic goes
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000044">&#160;</a>

confused by what the Minister is saying. I did not hear what he heard.
My colleagues argued that, although we may be living
longer—that, too, is not a single fact, because there are
mitigating circumstances for different types of people—it is not
only that the pension age is moving, but that people are different and
need different ways of planning for future changes. They have already
planned for one set of changes, and they need more time to plan for the
next. What I heard was that we cannot just say that people are living
longer, which is a fact or statement that is being made to fit all
circumstances. I think the Minister perhaps misunderstood what

                  </div>individuals and at the real human beings behind the statistics. We heard
some individual case studies, and I was struck by some of them, but
exactly the same arguments would be used under amendment 16, only in a
few years’ time. We would have exactly the same conversation
about the long and hard-working life. I might even have met the lady
whose testimony the hon. Member for Leeds West read out, because we had
a Fabian Women’s event in Parliament and I think the lady told
her story. Under the proposed amendments, folk who have difficulty
working in their late 50s and so on will face precisely the same set of
issues in a few years’ time, so I am not sure how the amendments
will make the problem any
easier.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000048">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments deal with two issues that the Bill does not. First, those
women have already had their state pension age moved once, under the
changes in 1995; the goalposts are now being moved for a second time.
Also, both Barbara and Linda, as well as other women, say that it is
impossible. Linda made it particularly clear in her testimony: she
earns only £270 a week, and it would be impossible for her to
save anything like what is necessary for her to be able to make the
adjustments that she wanted to given the impact that her job is having
on her health. In two important ways, therefore, the amendments deal
with the concerns of the
women.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000050">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am slightly confused. The hon. Lady seems to be
critical of us for moving the state pension age “for a second
time”, but any woman who reaches state pension age after 2022
has already had her state pension age raised to 65 and would now find
it raised to 66 by the hon. Lady’s amendments. The amendments
would raise the state pension age
twice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is clearly an issue to do with people having time to save. The hon.
Lady is fond of quoting the fact that many women in their late 50s,
after 13 years of a Labour Government, have not got much in savings.
How will that change dramatically because of her proposed delay of a
couple of years? If they got to their late 50s with minimal savings,
putting the date back by a couple of years might help a little, but
will not make a radical difference to their ability to put right a
system that has worked against them over their whole lives, as we have
heard from many hon. Members. That is why we are proud to press ahead
next year with auto-enrolment into workplace pensions, which we will
come on to later in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second reason for dealing with the problem, which no Opposition Member
has mentioned at all, is not only the pension age but what people get
at the pension age. I hope to be present in future, perhaps with the
same cast, to address the question of what sort of pension that
specific group of women who perhaps retire in a decade or so should
expect. My firm conviction is that the state pension system presided
over by the previous Government is not adequate for those women; we
have time to change it, although we need to move quickly, to a system
that is far fairer precisely for those women who spent time out of the
labour market bringing up children. We have heard a lot about their
needs, and we have a Green Paper that proposes solutions very 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 53<a class="bkMark" name="Column53">&#160;</a>
                  </div>much benefiting exactly that group of women. I will go no further down
that avenue, but it provides an important context for our
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the key contexts for the amendments is the fiscal climate. The
position of the Opposition party seems to be that its amendments would
leave us £10 billion down on the Bill. When asked by
my hon. Friend the Member for Reading West where that £10
billion would come from, the answer as far as I understood it was from
the taxpayers and firms of 2035—that is when the money would
come in from moving to 67 earlier. I think that even 68 was mentioned,
so it would be the taxpayers of 2045 as well. As one of my hon. Friends
said, that is the children and grandchildren of the very women we are
talking about. The silent voices in the room are the next generation of
taxpayers. The hon. Member for Arfon said that he had only had a small
number of letters, and perhaps some women affected did not write in,
but the other people who did not write in were those who do not know
about the £10 billion that they are about to be asked to pay in
decades to come, because the Labour party leaflet possibly did not
mention that bit. That is the flip side: if we are going to spend
£10 billion on this group of amendments, someone has
to pay for
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
has been pointed out that the change is not in the current
comprehensive spending review. Pensions reform has a knack of not being
in the current CSR, but it is still essential to think about the fiscal
context. My hon. Friend for Grantham and Stamford put it very well when
he said, if we are taking about such vast sums of money, we have to
look at what bang for our buck we are getting, and not just at an
aggregate level. We know how many people are affected, but how many
people are so adversely affected that we need to spend
£10 billion putting it right? I thought that was
absolutely pertinent to our
discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000055">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Does the hon. Gentleman really believe that it is
fair that 500,000 women are so disproportionately affected by the
changes? Even if the Government want to save the full £30
billion, does the Minister think it right that one group of women
should have to pay the highest price for
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000056">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The question of why more women than men are affected
is important, and the answer is that we are treating men and women
equally sooner. An inevitable consequence of treating men and women the
same more quickly is that it will be women who lose in the process when
we level-up state pension ages. As we may go on to discuss, moving men
first would breach our duties under equality legislation, because it
increases the gap between men and women. If the hon. Lady had another
hat on, she would be urging us to close the gap between men and women.
That is what we are doing, and that is why more women than men are
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have to say
to the Committee that I have been uncharacteristically generous to
Labour Members on their amendment; I suggested that it would cost the
Exchequer only £10 billion, but I am guilty of understating the
case. As is the way of Departments, we have a slight tendency to think
only about our bit. The Department for Work and Pensions would indeed
have to find 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 54<a class="bkMark" name="Column54">&#160;</a>
                  </div>another £10 billion of public expenditure, but there is another
£2.5 billion of income tax and national insurance that the
Exchequer would not get if the change was not made. Those figures are
in the impact assessment before the Committee. We are, in fact,
therefore talking about £12.5 billion that would have to be
found.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000058">&#160;</a>

proportion of those women who will be working. The right hon. Member
for Croydon North, my predecessor but six, would agree with me that the
well-established macro-economic evidence is that if we can get people
working longer—raising the state pension age is part of that,
although it is not quite the same thing—we benefit the
macro-economy as a whole, and get enhanced income tax and national
insurance revenues. That is what we risk losing if we delay. It is a
case of “Make me chaste, but not yet”; we all agree that
we are living longer, but we do not want to do anything about it for
another decade. If we stick to the timetable in amendment 16,
men’s state pension age in 2020 will be roughly what it was a
century earlier. That does not feel to me like undue
haste.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000060">&#160;</a>

terribly well, in terms of increases in their income and
wealth—is he satisfied, as a man concerned with fairness, that
this is the place to put billions of pounds-worth of burden? He must
have a conscience about

                  </strong> My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford
said, “Let’s take this group and examine who they are and
what their characteristics are.” The first thing we established
is that roughly seven out of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 55<a class="bkMark" name="Column55">&#160;</a>
                  </div>10 women in their late 50s—the group most
affected—are in paid employment at the moment. It was suggested
that many are carers, and I take the point made by the right hon.
Member for Croydon North that people combine caring with paid work.
Just 3% of that group are on carer’s allowance. If they cannot
get by on carer’s allowance and whatever else is coming into the
household, that is a problem when they are 57, not only when they are
64. If they cannot get by on what they have coming in now and it is not
sustainable, that should worry us today, and we should do something
about that today. Even if amendment 16 is accepted, they will still
have to live on that standard of living for seven years. If that is
totally unsustainable, then we should do something about that. Delaying
putting up state pension ages because of that does not seem to follow
logically.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000066">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> There are two key points here. One of the points
that Age UK makes in its analysis is that a lot of women start to draw
on their savings, whether that is because they are taking on caring
responsibilities, going part-time for another reason, or find the
physical stress of work too difficult for them to carry on. They make
those decisions based on their savings, so they are able to maintain a
decent standard of living. However, carrying on for another two years,
which is what the Bill asks 33,000 women to do, would be beyond their
financial means. Many women who will be affected have said to me that
they have never claimed benefits in their life and will continue to
work as long as they have to, even if the physical demand takes an
enormous toll. They might not claim sickness benefits, but carry on
under extreme physical strain, and the Government are asking them to do
that for another two
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Regarding
national insurance, pages 35 and 37 of the impact assessment state that
the figure is £12.7 million under option one and £8.8
million under option two. I am surprised that the Minister says that
that was not
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000068">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Lady is referring to the White Paper. With
the Bill, we have published a revised impact assessment, which she will
find on page 11 of the Bill’s impact assessment. The Treasury
revised its estimates of the income tax and national insurance impact,
which is why the numbers are
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady is right that a set of people, particularly women, might have
no choice and might, perhaps because of family circumstances, find
themselves with a caring responsibility in their late 50s. If that is a
difficult situation for them, which I am sure it is, that will still
happen regardless of amendment 16 and related amendments. There will
still be, in a few years’ time, women in their late 50s who find
that they have caring responsibilities and that they run down their
modest savings in the run-up to a pension age of 66, which she
supports. Indeed, she has tabled amendments to introduce the age of
66.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is an inconsistency here. I accept that there is an issue about notice,
but she is not talking about notice. People in their late 50s who have
been forced into caring responsibilities unexpectedly do not make
carefully calculated choices and nuanced decisions about it; it just
happens to them. That will go on happening generation after generation,
and that problem has to be dealt with by giving proper support to
carers, not by 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 56<a class="bkMark" name="Column56">&#160;</a>
                  </div>changing the state pension age later. The hon. Lady’s amendments
would introduce the age of 66, and therefore bring forward the number
of women who face the exact difficulty that she has just described. She
cannot suggest that there is a substantive difference—apart from
in the issue of notice, which I will return to—between her
amendments and what the Bill says; the situation would apply in both
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the fiscal context, we have heard the comment that the issue is a
long way off, and that it does not matter from the point of view of the
deficit. I think we even heard that the days of tackling the deficit
will be over, and that the deficit will be some sort of history. What
will not be history is the interest burden of the nearly £1.4
trillion of national debt that we will face at the end of this
Parliament, despite the difficult decisions that we have had to make.
The children and grandchildren of those women will be paying that
interest for generations to come. A person who glibly says, “We
need another £10 billion, but we will find it in the
2030s” or something like that does not seem to be living in the
real world. There is always a case for looking at the impact on
particular groups, which we will do, but simply to say,
“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow” was the hallmark
of the previous Administration, who got us into the situation in the
first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh East asked about the role of employment and
support allowance in supporting people in their late 50s and beyond who
are no longer able to work because of sickness. She referred to the
12-month limit under the Welfare Reform Bill. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Grantham and Stamford said, it is worth breaking that group
down. Nearly a quarter of ESA recipients over 55 are in the support
group, so they are not affected by the issue raised by the hon. Member
for Edinburgh East. Nearly half of those who start claiming ESA over
the age of 55 come off it within a year, so that is pretty typical for
people. The majority of ESA claimants over 55 are men, in any case.
When we start to narrow it down, the number of women who would
otherwise have been on contributory ESA, who would not be in the
support group or receiving income-related benefits, and would be on ESA
for more than a year would be small. I am not saying that no one would
be affected, but we should consider the matter relative to a £10
billion amendment; it is important to keep a certain sense of
perspective.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Arfon asked about the impact on Wales. I assure him
that we took close cognisance of that. When we published our call for
evidence, we highlighted in the document the improvement of life
expectancy in Wales from 84.8 years under the 2004 projections to 86
years in the 2008 projections. One of the questions that we asked was
what evidence concerning changes in life expectancy should be taken
into account. In the impact assessment that we published with the Bill,
which I am sure he will have seen, we gave on page 16 separate figures
for life expectancy at state pension age in England, Wales and
Scotland, under the different
scenarios.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have been very much aware that the policies will have a different
impact on different nations of the United Kingdom, and as the hon.
Gentleman rightly says, from community to community. I was interested
in the example that he gave of the Welsh Assembly Government looking at
ward-by-ward measures, and it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 57<a class="bkMark" name="Column57">&#160;</a>
                  </div>was good to hear some constructive ideas. I do not consider that issues
about state pension age are best addressed on a ward-by-ward basis, but
I am grateful to him for his constructive suggestion, and for his
candour in saying that it is easier to point out the differences than
to work out, under a national social security policy, what to do about
them; he was fair in his
remarks.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun referred to the availability of
jobs. One of the interesting things about the recent recession is that
the market for older workers has held up the best. In fact, the market
for workers over the age of 60 has had a positive growth, relative to
negative growth for younger workers. That is not glibly dismissing the
issues facing older workers, but the evidence shows that it is the
growth area in the jobs market. Jobs are often part-time, and a
part-time job could well pay the equivalent of the basic state pension,
for example, so those jobs are relevant to that group. She raised an
important
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Nottingham South talked about her constituents who
faced 15-month increases, and was worried about the impact on women who
do the right thing. She cited women who leave school, work a full
working life and then face a pension age of 66. In four years’
time, when her policy would come in of bringing the age of 66 forward
by four years to 2022, there will also be women who do the right thing.
Why would the issue of women who do the right thing not be equally
applicable under the amendment that she is asking the Committee to
support? I think that it would.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
raised a particular issue about local government workers, many of whom
will, as she says, have a decent occupational pension, which will
assist with later state pension ages. However, again, if there is an
issue about how the local government pension scheme and re-grading in
local government affects people’s pension choices, that is
something to fix within the context of the local government pension
scheme and local government, rather than by delaying state pension age
changes. That would be using a sledgehammer to crack a
nut.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
now come to a couple of other issues; I want to make sure that I have
responded in full to the debate. I was asked about transition, which is
obviously a key issue. I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State said on Second Reading that he stood by the
principles of the Bill, such as faster equalisation and a faster move
to 66, but that he heard the specific worry expressed by several
Opposition Members, as well as some Government Members, who have been
commendably restrained, but have properly raised their
constituents’ worries with me in writing, for which I am
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
was a specific concern about a relatively small number of women; my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State confirmed that we are willing
to get the transition right. I have been asked, “Well,
where’s the amendment?” This is a classic case of
“Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” The Bill
had its Second Reading a fortnight ago, at which time we voiced our
willingness to consider transition. If we then scuttled away and
presented our transitional amendments to the Committee, the Committee
would have said, “Where was the consultation? Where 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 58<a class="bkMark" name="Column58">&#160;</a>
                  </div>was the discussion? Where was the listening?” Instead, we have
come to the Committee and, given the process we have, Opposition
Members had the chance to come forward with fresh new thinking on
transition. What do we have in front of us? The amendment that they
tabled in the House of Lords, which has already been
rejected.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000080">&#160;</a>

not even have the courtesy to reply to that letter. We wanted to build
on the Turner consensus, which built consensus across business, unions
and all parts of the House. The Government can decide to unravel that

and she will receive a reply. She wrote a couple of weeks ago, saying

and fresh thinking that I assumed she would bring to the Committee.
That is what the Committee is for. This part of the process is for the
Opposition to say what they think should be done, to table amendments
and to bring forward fresh thinking. We have had some fresh thinking
from her right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North, which we will
debate later. We have had some helpful probing amendments from her hon.
Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead, who suggested some other
alternatives that have not been done to death. I hoped that the Labour
Front Bench would come to the Committee with some fresh thinking of
that sort. We have had the same old arguments, the same debate and the
same amendments. I am happy to talk to anyone who will give us fresh
thinking on transition. We have plenty of ideas and we want to get this

recent years—it has been a party, and not least the hon.
Gentleman, which has been committed to freedom of information, a more
open politics, with the Executive of which he is now a distinguished
member treating the legislature with greater respect than, perhaps,
under previous Governments. Given all of that, would it not have been
sensible if the work going on in the Department, which I suspect
preceded Second Reading debate on transitional arrangements, could be
published as a kind of Green Paper so we could have a more

on 22 June and amendments had to be tabled for today. As Mr Brady
reminded us at the start, they were tabled last Thursday, so within
about 10 days of Second Reading, we suddenly have to produce finely
honed legislation. Doing those things in a rush is not right, but

meet organisations to which tribute has quite properly been
paid—Age UK, Ros Altmann at Saga, and many
others—regularly. It will not surprise the Committee to know
that those issues have come up from time to time and we have benefited
from their insight. The invitation remains open for the Opposition to
make specific, costed proposals for transition that they believe would
address the issues. I would be very happy to look at them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me try to
draw the threads together because I am aware that a whole range of
other debates is closely linked to this one. The fundamental point is
that, since the 2007 Act was published, based on 2004 projections, life
expectancy has improved not just a bit, but like an express train. In
four years, between 2004 and 2008, roughly a year and a half was added
to life expectancy at pension age. The bill attached to that is tens of
billions of pounds. The question is, who pays it? Does it all fall on
the next generation of national insurance payers, taxpayers, and
interest on debt payers or does some of it fall upon those who will
benefit from the increased
longevity?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000110">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leeds, West said that we are moving up pension ages
faster than the improvement in life expectancy. I remind her that in
1990 when the pension age was 60, the average woman reaching pension
age—I forget the exact figure—could expect to get a
pension for a certain number of years and by 2020, that figure was
exactly the same even with a six-year increase in state pension age. In
other words, precisely over that period, the number of years for which
a woman could expect to receive a state pension in 30 years, despite a
six-year increase in the state pension age, has not changed. Again,
this does not suggest breakneck speed, disproportionate
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clearly there
are trade-offs and we have aired them quite extensively in Committee. I
simply say that we are mindful of the very specific group and the very
specific issues that my hon. Friends and Opposition Members have
raised. We will work to get that transition right, but I resolutely
stand by the principle of grasping those difficult issues today rather
than putting them off till tomorrow for someone else to tackle.
Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000112">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The point that I am trying to make is that on
Second Reading Members asked time and time again if the Government
would consider the impact on this group of women. The Secretary of
State said that they would and I think that many Members, including the
hon. Member for Cardiff North (Jonathan Evans) who made the case very
forcefully on Second Reading, expected that these transition
arrangements that the Government said they were looking at and were
willing to discuss would be introduced in Committee. The disappointment
felt by the Opposition and, I believe, across the House, reflects the
fact that despite giving a commitment on Second Reading that transition
arrangements would be considered, we are not being given the chance to
scrutinise them. Those transition arrangements relate to the part of
the Bill that was probably debated most on Second Reading. The hon.
Member for Eastbourne says that he thinks they are forthcoming and the
Minister says that the Government are looking at them. Yet in the very
forum in which they should be debated—this Committee—we
do not have any such amendments to consider, even though we are being
asked to scrutinise a Bill that may or may not impact this group of
500,000 women in the way that it currently does. If transition
arrangements are made for those 500,000 women, or those 33,000 women,
perhaps we will be in a different place. Frankly, we do not know that,
because the Government are not sharing the information about what those
transition arrangements will look like.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As well as
Age UK and Saga, external organisations such as the National
Association of Pension Funds have also called for the Government to
rethink. The NAPF has said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“This
is unfair as women have too little time to plan for these changes. MPs
from all side of the house have expressed their concerns on this issue.
The NAPF urges the Government to re-consider the situation for this
group of women during the Committee Stages of the Bill and come forward
with detailed proposals on transitional arrangements to the State
Pension
Age.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000391">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
NAPF goes on to make a series of recommendations: no changes until
2020; the increase to 66 should occur for both men and women from 2020
to 2022; and the Government need to do more to help people to work for
longer.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000137">&#160;</a>

today because the NAPF says that it would expect the transition plans

               </p>
               <p>and
that it would expect the Government to introduce those proposals. That
is what many Members in the House expected when they urged the
Secretary of State to think about the impact on the 33,000 women whom
we have mentioned and the 500,000 women who will have to wait for more
than a year longer than they had thought for their pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">An awful lot
of pressure from inside the House—indeed, from all parts of the
House—and from outside the House has been brought to bear. So I
was pleased that the Secretary of State acknowledged this issue and
repeatedly informed the House that he would be happy to discuss the
transitional
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
with the Turner report, I still believe that the best way to go about
these things is by achieving consensus. As I said to the Minister
during his contribution, I wrote to him, asking him to share with me
the proposal that he was working on, in order that we could scrutinise
the arrangements. That is what the previous Government did when they
put forward proposals for increasing the state pension age. We managed
to build cross-party consensus for those changes, both inside and
outside the House. It is a shame that the Government have deviated from
that approach to pensions policy and it is one that will negatively
affect those people, both in retirement and approaching
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
disappointing that no proposals were forthcoming and a further blow
that we have heard nothing of their plans today. Will the Minister
explain the confusion? Why did he and the Secretary of State say that
transitional arrangements would be looked at, yet nothing is on the
table before us today? As the postbags and e-mail accounts of the
Members of this Committee and Members from across the House will no
doubt attest, this is an issue that has real impact in all of our
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In my
constituency, almost 1,000 women will be affected by these changes by
more than a year. How will Government Members, such as the hon. Member
for West Worcestershire, who has 1,300 women affected in her
constituency, explain that she has not put forward transitional
arrangements or supported the ones that are on the table. The hon.
Member for High Peak has 1,200 women aged 56 and 57 in his
constituency. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has 1,300 women
aged 56 and 57. In Nuneaton, there are 1,100 women; Eastbourne 1,200;
South Basildon and East Thurrock 1,300; Hastings and Rye 1,400; South
West Bedfordshire 1,200; Reading West 1,000; Norwich North 1,000;
Thornbury and Yate 1,100; and Arfon 600—the Member with the
fewest women in his constituency aged 56 and 57 seems to care more
about them than those with perhaps twice as many women of those ages in
their
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
of those women would have been reassured and comforted by what the
Secretary of State and the Pensions Minister said during Second
Reading, which acknowledged the unfairness of their situation and spoke
of the possibility of transitional arrangements that would seek to
address that. I know from letters and e-mails to me, that people have
said that it looked like the Government were  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 67<a class="bkMark" name="Column67">&#160;</a>
                  </div>willing to make concessions, perhaps do a U-turn as they have in other
areas of policies. Yet no such transitional proposals have been
presented by the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000144">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
Committee could have had a fruitful discussion of the transitional
arrangements, yet the Government have failed to come forward with
options, as women in all our constituencies and the National
Association of Pension Funds, Saga and Age UK would have liked them to
have done. Instead we have had no actions and empty words. It is only
the Opposition and Opposition Back Benchers who have tabled amendments
with regard to the state pension age. We have set out—as I did
on Second Reading—that any proposals must give women and men
time to plan. They should impact on men and women equally and no one
should have to wait more than a year before they get their state
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We recognise
that the state pension age needs to increase and I believe that the
amendments grouped together here would ease the transition, but still
get to 66 earlier than under the previous timetable, to reflect
increasing longevity. Ministers say they wanted to investigate: we
could have an investigation and discussion in this Committee. Instead,
we have only Opposition amendments, but I hope today that the hon.
Member for Eastbourne and all hon. Members will support this group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000146">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> During the debate on Second Reading, Members in
all parts of the House expressed concern about how their constituents
will be affected by the accelerated timetable and the equalisation of
the state pension age between men and women. The Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions, in his closing remarks, said that he would consider
introducing transitional arrangements. Since no amendments have been
tabled by the Government, I have introduced my amendment in an attempt
to make the Bill fairer. We have heard from Government Members that
they have submitted ideas to the Minister, so if they wish to intervene
and share those ideas, I will be grateful to hear
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is interesting that my aim is to mitigate the detrimental effect; on 9
March, the Minister gave evidence to the Select Committee on Work and
Pensions, of which three other members are present. This matter formed
the early part of the evidence and there was quite a debate about it,
as you will remember. At one point, it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 69<a class="bkMark" name="Column69">&#160;</a>
                  </div>was mentioned that the 33,000 women are 1% of the women affected. As it
was such a small number, I asked the Minister if anything could be done
to mitigate the effects on these women. The Minister said the challenge
to that was if you fixed for that group of women, a larger part of the
group will say, “What about us?” and the line would just
move to another place. That is a fair comment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, the
Government now seem to be considering mitigation and I would be
interested to know how that could be achieved without moving the line
to another place. Were some of the suggestions that have been made to
the Minister, which we are not party to, about means-testing certain
groups of people? I would be really interested to hear what those
solutions are, because there is much in this Bill that we all agree
upon, but this is a particular sticking point that most people in this
room want to find a solution to. Surely the more voices and ideas we
hear, the more likely we are to find a way to help this group of women.
It is my aim to try to mitigate the detrimental effect that the
accelerated timetable will have on this small group of women who are
hardest hit. I am part of the larger group of women and I would like to
hear the ideas that Government Members
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the compromise that I have put forward is accepted, it would mean that
no woman born between 6 October 1953 and 5 April 1955 will have longer
than one year to reach state pension age from the present position. On
Second Reading, I made it clear that I am not opposed to the principle
of equalisation, nor am I opposed to the idea of increasing the state
pension age to reflect growing life expectancy. We live in an ageing
society and the pension age needs to rise to ensure that
people’s retirements remain financially secure and enjoyable. I
do not want to see a time when people are too old to enjoy their
retirement; it is something people have
earned.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
I cannot support the changes that the Government propose. Speeding up
the timetable for equalising the state pension age in this manner is
unfair to a large group of women. There is a feeling of injustice.
People have said to me they feel conned. They thought they were
contributing to one thing, but now they are getting something else. A
common theme runs through the letters that I have received from
constituents. They do not disagree about the state pension age rising
and they did not complain when it rose earlier. They recognise that
increasing life expectancy makes that logical. The issue is that moving
the goalposts at short notice is creating serious financial harm and
causing worries. As a result, some are considering working beyond their
state pension age but that should be a choice; it should not be forced
upon them. Retirement, and especially the age at which people decide to
retire, should be about choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some of these
women have made a choice. There is a woman in my constituency who over
a year ago decided that she would take a voluntary pay-off from local
government. People were being encouraged to do that. At that time, she
looked on the DWP website and at her pension forecast and she made the
decision based on that. This is a point that I have raised with the
Minister before. At that time he said the website could only reflect
the law as it was at the time. Without any other information or flag on
the website that things might 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 70<a class="bkMark" name="Column70">&#160;</a>
                  </div>change soon, she made a decision to take a pay-off that would see her
through to her expected retirement age. Now that retirement age is
going to be moved by two years and that money will not last. What am I
to say to her? Am I to say that she was foolish to make those plans, or
that it is unfortunate but she has just got to pay the price because
future generations can not pay for her pension? What do I say to that
woman?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000200">&#160;</a>

retirement age. If I take voluntary redundancy, I will be able to last
until my pension age”. She looked around and saw younger people
who perhaps needed that job more. She made the decision that she would
be able to manage. She was nearing the end of her working life, and
decided that she could take the pay-off because she would be able to
manage until her state retirement kicked in. It was a calculated
decision based on her
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000202">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said earlier, it is important to note that those women have already
accepted changes to their state pension age. Originally—as I
was—they were expecting to retire at the age of 60. Depending on
the electorate, I might still do that. They were disappointed when it
was announced that retirement age would increase from 60 to
65 years, but they accepted it and planned accordingly. Now those women
find that they are nearing the end of their time in the labour market.
The goalposts have been moved yet again, and it is not surprising that
they are angry and losing faith in the pensions system. That is
important, because there are aspects of the Bill that we will discuss
later on auto-enrolment, which are welcome. It is about getting people
to engage in the pensions market—a market in which people have
lost faith over recent
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
now be saying to a group of people who have perhaps worked for 40 years
that, although a promise was made to them and they have kept their side
of the promise, the goalposts will now be moved, further weakens
people’s faith in pensions. That is not what anyone in this room
wants to do. The women are facing a large gap, which must be filled.
Their main complaint is the insufficient notice that they have
received. My amendment hopes to minimise that to a certain extent. The
women are about seven years away from their pension date, which is well
below the 15 years that the Turner commission recommends. I should be
interested to know why the Minister disregarded that, and opted for
fewer years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000206">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I have heard
the hon. Gentleman refer to the rapidity of the increase in the living
age. I heard him say that on Second Reading, as I did when he spoke to
the Select Committee. However, the particular group of women who were
targeted before, and are now targeted again, feel so angry and unhappy
about such matters. I understand what the Minister said about our
arguments about caring responsibilities and volunteering, but that will
just happen later on. I am not referring to a group of complaining
women. They form the same group whose pension age was moved before.
They did not complain about that, but said, “Okay, fair enough.
We will be able to deal with that, although it is a
disappointment.” But, as I said before, it is the rapidity and
the lack of time in which to plan for such a change that is the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
wish to cite some examples of how my constituents will be affected by
the Bill. Susan Harris from Belvedere was a teacher for 30 years. In
2005, she took early retirement and a reduced pension. She had made
calculations based on when she thought she would receive her state
pension. She thought she was making an informed decision. Sadly, now
she is one of the unfortunate women facing a two-year wait and a loss
in pension income. I know plenty examples of women in the same
position, but I do not intend to go into each one because we would be
here for a long time. Women with manual jobs have also contacted me,
one of whom is a forklift truck driver. She said that she will not be
able to do such work when she is in her later 60s, and asks what she
will
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000208">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady makes some good points, but she is straying into territory
that is about the raising of the state pension age, not necessarily the
transition. I can understand why people are worried that they cannot
work into later life, but that is a very separate issue from the
transitional arrangements. We should focus on those and talk about them
rather than the emotive subject of whether people will be able to work
later into
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000209">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s point,
but what will happen to such people matters. If they are meant to work
to a later age, will they be able to work? That is relevant. Another
woman who came to me, who has also done the calculations, had an
illness in the family, which could not have been expected. She had some
savings and a couple of private pensions. She was lucky, because a lot
of women of that age do not have private pensions, because they worked
at a time when they were not eligible to join the schemes or they were
part-time workers who were not eligible. She decided that she could
manage with her deferred pension being paid at 60 and her state pension
not being paid until she was 63, so she left work to look after her
elderly relatives. Now she has to wait for an extra two years, that
money will not last.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000210">&#160;</a>

What will happen to them? A large number of people have to wait, but
only a small number are badly affected. Does not that woman deserve any
transitional arrangements? I think she does.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000211">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">What are the
options for the women in these situations? The accelerated timetable
means that women who have taken up caring for relatives or providing
child care on their retirement, so that the next generation can join
the work force, will not be able to do so. As we heard earlier, many
women will not have enough savings to fall back on if they cannot hang
on in the labour market. Women who have been employed in low-paid work
or who have taken time out to have children or act as carers will have
few savings to cover them between the time when they expected to retire
and the proposed state pension date. They may be able to cover a
smaller period of time, but two years is too
much.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
must remember that it is not only women that will be affected; their
families and their partners will be too. Extended family members may
have to contribute financially to help women cover the costs of the
period between when they expected to get a pension and when they
receive it. The change will also affect many men of pensionable age,
because they cannot claim pension credit until their wife or partner
reaches pension age. The change will therefore affect the whole
household. The 12-month limit outlined in the timetable in my amendment
is the maximum that women should have to wait or make alternative plans
for. Any longer is unfair and
disproportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott) wrote
to the Minister asking about his plans for the state pension age, he
replied:<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000214">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>I
disagree with him. No man will have to wait longer than a year, but
thousands of women will. If that is not disproportionate, what is? When
it comes to the state pension, women are already at a disadvantage. The
median pension savings of a 56-year-old women are almost six times
lower than a man of the same age. Women will have decided to have
children, work part-time and raise families. That is a valid decision
and one for which they should not be penalised. It is the very type of
responsible behaviour that we should
encourage.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000215">&#160;</a>

is an opportunity for those who have contributed all they can to
society to rest with peace of mind, knowing that their contributions
will be recognised and that they will be adequately provided for. I
worry, however, about the long-term cost for these women. I suspect
that there will be significant hardship, anxiety and stress about
financial matters. I also worry that ill health will result from
working to an older
age.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000216">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">During
my Adjournment debate on this topic, my hon. Friend the Member for
Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) quoted a constituent who felt that she was
discriminated against when she started work 30 years ago, because she
was barred from joining a personal pension scheme. She feels
discriminated against once again because of her date of birth and
because her pension will be delayed. Does the Minister think that is
fair?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have also raised with the Minister the issue of how the women affected
who are not in work are meant to balance their finances. I raised that
issue in the Chamber and in the Select Committee. The Minister said
that it was an important question to ask. What will these women live on
in this two-year period? Take the women we are talking about. They are
roughly 57 years old currently. What will they be doing when they are
63, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 73<a class="bkMark" name="Column73">&#160;</a>
                  </div>which is before any of them would have had their state pension age
anyway? A good proportion of them will still be working. We do not know
how many, because we do not know the working patterns of 63-year-olds
in a world where the state pension age is higher than 63. We cannot say
with certainty. We know that 70% of these women are working now. If
they are working at 63, the consequences of this change for that
particular group will be to look at working
longer.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister then went on to talk about what such women would live on if
they were not working. If they were not working because they were out
of a job but trying to find one, jobseeker’s allowance is there.
I know people say that they do not want to go on the dole, and I
understand that, but working-age benefits will take the place of
pension benefits. In that two-year period, those women will be able to
claim jobseeker’s allowance if they are unemployed. However, the
issue I raised in the Chamber with the Minister was that, if they were
out of work and had a small savings pot, perhaps from a redundancy, or
had a small pension, it is my understanding that they could only claim
jobseeker’s allowance for six months. What would they do for the
remaining 18 months?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not know
whether the Minister has any ideas about mitigating factors or that
cohort of women, but if he does they would be very welcome. It does not
seem fair that because they have a small widow’s pension or a
small amount put away which they have saved towards their retirement,
they would not be supported in any way even though they were out of
work through no fault of their own. In my constituency, for instance,
more than 3,000 people are registered as unemployed and there are 107
vacancies. For women of that age, competing in such a labour market
would be
hard.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s aim is to eliminate the deficit by 2015. The
provision we are discussing will not help them achieve that goal,
because it does not come into effect until well after. Therefore, the
argument that the proposal will help eliminate the deficit, as has been
agreed, is not valid. However, the Minister says that there will still
be debt after that. My understanding is that the pensions paid to
pensioners today are paid by the people who work today—that has
always been the case—and the pensions paid in future will be
paid by the people who work at that time. It appears that Government
policy, with the Work programme and all the changes to welfare
benefits, is to get everyone back into work, so surely that would be
achievable.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000221">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
point that I wanted to make about the wider Bill is that there is much
in it that we agree on. Let us look at this particular issue and at
what the Government are trying to achieve. People are living longer, we
agree—perhaps people in every region are not living as long as
in other regions, but we agree—and male and female pensions
should be brought into line, we agree. The Minister was a pensions
expert, and spent 10 years working for women’s pensions and
talking about pensions—never stopping talking about
pensions—so he knows that pension planning needs three things:
due notice, time to prepare and proportionality of impact. But that is
where this part of the Bill fails—on those three issues, the
Bill
fails.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">During
this morning’s debate, the focus of Government Members was very
much on the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds
West. They said that her amendment would reduce projected savings 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 74<a class="bkMark" name="Column74">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from the accelerated timetable by £10 billion, then we heard it
might actually be more than that. From those comments, such a
proposition seemed unacceptable. I therefore moved amendment 24 as a
compromise. Based on comments by Lord Freud, it will reduce savings
from the accelerated timetable by less than my hon. Friend’s
amendment would have—by about £7 billion. If that is not
acceptable, will the Minister tell us what is
acceptable?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
accepting the amendments, the Government would demonstrate that they
want to help the women most affected by the change to the state pension
age. Mitigation is what we are looking for; it is what I asked about in
March and it has been asked about in the Chamber. On Second Reading, it
was clear that people were looking for a solution. As I said earlier, I
am happy to take interventions from anyone on the Government Benches
who has written to the Minister with different suggestions of
mitigation for those women. Sadly, no one has
intervened.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000224">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I want to speak briefly to address some of the
issues that I know will be raised by the Minister, and which were
raised in response to the earlier group of amendments. I want to look
again at whether it is unfair and unaffordable to make some of the
suggested changes. It is very easy to say that one is concerned about
the future. This is, as we know, not about deficit reduction. It now
appears to be an issue about not burdening our daughters, our
grand-daughters, our great-grand-daughters, and so forth.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, in
Government, over such a long period, there will be many changes that
take place, which have to be put into the scales when one is looking at
what is fair and proportionate. The amendment would not mean such a
great deal of savings forgone as the previous group of amendments, but
I suspect, though I might be pleasantly surprised, that we will have a
similar response to them. At all times, there will be changes and money
spent in different ways. I understand that just today the Chancellor
has been able to find some £50 million as a concession to the
oil and gas industry. Not in 10, 20 or 35 years’ time, but in
this financial year. Now, £50 million is not
£2 billion, but it is getting on towards £2 billion. I
would suggest that in the future there will be other things that we
will choose, if we want to, to spend money on. We have to ask
ourselves, what is important here? What is important in terms of
fairness? And are we really in such a difficult position that this
relatively small concession could not be made?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I listened
with some interest to what the Minister said about transitional
proposals, which may or may not come forward in the near future or the
not quite so near future. This is not a new issue. It did not suddenly
come to light on Second Reading in this House. Indeed, the matter was
debated at some considerable length in the other place. The issue has
been at the forefront of a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 75<a class="bkMark" name="Column75">&#160;</a>
                  </div>great deal of campaigning since well before the beginning of this year,
so there has been some considerable time to come forward with proposals
and suggestions that could have been discussed. I remain disappointed
that that opportunity has not been taken. If this proposal is not the
one that the Minister considers will tackle these issues, I look
forward to hearing at least some indication—in general terms, if
not in detail—of what he considers will address these problems,
which have been a matter of considerable debate for several months, and
were not suddenly brought to the Government’s attention on
Second Reading a couple of weeks back.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000229">&#160;</a>

position, so that nobody, man or woman, has to endure a delay of more
than 12 months to their state pension. I welcome the principle that
underpins this amendment. The amendment also demonstrates that there
are many options open to the Government, of which this is one. We have
debated our preferred amendment, and many of the issues are the same.

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment addresses the underlying unfairness at the heart of
today’s debate and throughout the passage of the Bill. It
accepts the rise in the state pension age as a necessity, as do I, but
it recognises that it is unfair to hit certain women
disproportionately—a point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Erith and Thamesmead made forcefully in her speech. The amendment would
ensure that the accelerated timetable proposed by the Government is
smoothed out, so that no man or woman will need to wait for their
pension for more than an extra 12 months.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000233">&#160;</a>

would mean that women born between 6 June 1953 and 6 March 1955 will
have to wait for a shorter period before they receive their state
pension. There will still be a delay before they receive that pension,
but it will be of up to 12 months, rather than 24 months. For women
born between 6 April 1954 and 5 December—those most impacted by
the current Bill—the amendment would mean a delay of up to 11
months before reaching state pension age, not 23 months as in the Bill.
Women born between 6 March 1954 and 5 April 1954—the
33,000 so adversely affected by the Bill because they have to wait an
extra two years—would receive their state pension on 6 March
2019. That would mean a delay of 12 months rather than the 24 months
set out in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000236">&#160;</a>

the points discussed in the House of Lords. As hon. Members will know,
the amendment bears some resemblance to those tabled in the other place
by Lord Boswell and Baroness Greengross. The advantage of my hon.
Friend’s amendment, however, is that it at no point widens the
gap in the state pension age for men and women, which was the objection
of the Minister in the other place, but I will come on to that matter
in a moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have dealt
at length with the effects of the changes in the Bill, and the fact
that women who face a two-year delay in reaching state pension age
stand to lose up to £10,000, or £15,000 if they receive
pension credit. There has also been some discussion about passported
benefits such as bus passes, dental and medical prescriptions, sight
tests, Warm Front grants, the winter fuel allowance and cold weather
payments. For someone receiving pension credit, there is also help with
housing benefit, council tax benefit and crisis loans. Delaying the
state pension age by up to 12 months rather than 24 months will make a
huge financial difference to those women who are bearing the brunt of
the changes. A compromise such as the one we are debating will minimise
the burden for the group of 500,000 women who will have to wait for
more than a year, and in particular, alleviate the impact on the 33,000
women by changing the delay from 24 months to 12 months so that no
woman has to wait longer than any of the men affected by these
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000240">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Many of the
women who are helped by these changes, as my hon. Friend for Erith and

discussed by members on both sides of the Committee today, 
<div class="columnNumber">

taking time to care for families. According to Age UK, 68% of women
aged 55 to 59 were economically active in the first quarter of 2010,
but the figure for 60 to 64-year-old women was only 35%. Once women

point is that, for all the reasons discussed earlier, which I do not

for a variety of reasons, particularly caring responsibilities. We know
from the interventions and the speech earlier by the hon. Member for
Arfon that many of these women take up caring responsibilities. The
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead mentioned
earlier was that a lot of these women are making informed decisions.
They are not just taking early retirement or taking on caring
responsibilities hoping that somehow they will make ends meet. They
have done the financial calculations, based on the information that was
available to them. Many of these women feel that, very late in the day,
the goalposts are being moved without them having the time to
prepare.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000249">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is making the case that retirement
age drives behaviour; that when you are approaching retirement, you are
more likely to take the early retirement package. If she looks at the
table in the Library research paper, based on the ONS labour force
survey statistics, she will see that men and women  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 78<a class="bkMark" name="Column78">&#160;</a>
                  </div>behave in broadly similar ways in the years running up to their state
pension age. Therefore, the hon. Lady’s argument is a bit
circuitous.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000251">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not think it is, because these women thought
that their state pension age was at 63 or 64 and have made decisions
based on that state pension age. It may well be the case that if you
adjust the state pension age, people’s behaviours will change.
We know from the constituents who have written to us and the evidence
from Age UK that if you give people just five years’ notice of
these changes—because of course they kick in 2016—or just
seven years notice for the 33,000 most affected women, many of these
people have already based their decisions on that information. It is
not necessarily that women and men make different choices because of
their state pension age, but that people have made decisions based on
the information available. They have done what, I guess, we hope
everybody does, which is take on board all the information available
about our occupational pensions, about the state pensions and when we
will receive those. We do our calculations based on those and what we
can afford. Many of the women, including the women whom my hon. Friend
met, did exactly that. They checked the Department for Work and
Pensions website and made their decisions based on that and then they
had the goalposts moved.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000252">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes. We have already seen that, because of the
changes that the Government made in 1995 to the state pension age, many
women are working longer. Earlier, I gave the example of Barbara Bates,
who said that since 1995 she had known what her state pension age was
going to be and she had accepted that that was fair and that her
pension age would increase to 64. What she finds very
difficult—given her circumstances, the nature of job she does
and her level of savings—is to carry on for another two years
with such little notice. This is the heart of the issue. I have had so
many letters from constituents and people across the country who say,
“I recognise that my state pension age needs to increase. I
accept that and I accept that people need to work longer, but I had
done my calculations.” As the lady mentioned by my hon. Friend
said, they have done their calculations based on the information
available. That is why the Pensions Policy Institute says that people
need 10 years’ notice. It actually says that women need more
notice because women adjust their plans, for example, going part-time
at an earlier age compared with their state pension age than men.
Turner said people needed 15 years’ notice and Age UK says
people need 10 years’ notice. These changes obviously give only
five years’
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000254">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady raises the question of part-time
working. Women working part-time in the 25 to 54 age group, according
to the ONS statistics, are broadly similar to women working part-time
in the year group 55 to 59. Yes, more women work part-time than men,
but there does not seem to be a meaningful statistical difference in
terms of their age.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000255">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> One thing the hon. Lady will not see from those
numbers is what hours they do part-time. A woman might have been
working four days a week and have gone down to two days a week to take
on a caring role, so those numbers need to be combined with average
hours of work. What the Pensions Policy Institute, which is much
respected in its area of expertise, say is that women change their
plans further away from their retirement than men, and that largely
reflects their caring responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000256">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Arfon mentioned earlier the higher proportion of women who
take up caring responsibilities. I am not totally disputing what the
hon. Lady says, but I am saying that there is still a pertinent point
here, for two reasons. First, women were making plans based on a
retirement age that they thought they were going to have. Secondly, the
Pensions Policy Institute and others say that women adjust their plans
earlier than men.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000257">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">To elaborate
on the issue of carers, which my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead also mentioned, Age UK’s statistics reveal that
nearly three out of 10 of the women affected have caring
responsibilities. This builds on the point that the hon. Member for
Grantham and Stamford mentioned earlier. The Age UK report said about
the women who were part of their focus group:<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Some
women had already left work or had reduced their hours due to caring
responsibilities. One of the reasons given for being concerned about
further rises in their state pension age was that some wanted or needed
to do more caring in a situation where the cared-for person’s
health was deteriorating or where they would have liked to have offered
to care for their grandchildren”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000445">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               <p class="hs_brev">“I am
desperate to get the government to listen. I work part time with a net
salary of just over £7,000 per annum to enable me to look after
my grandchildren. My daughter needs to work to pay her mortgage and
child care is too expensive. My parents are in their 80s and in need of
more care as age and infirmity catch up with them. Looking after my
family is my greatest privilege and pleasure but it is demanding and
knowing that I will now have to work for almost two more years has left
me completely
dismayed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000446">&#160;</a>

is that the state pension age will still rise to 66. Will there not be
absolutely identical stories to the ones that the hon. Lady cites of
women who, for all sorts of reasons, are being forced to become carers
and who have a long wait to reach pension age—to 66—that
will result from amendments that she supports? Why is that any
different?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000261">&#160;</a>

difference is twofold. The first is about giving people adequate
notice. The other is the time difference. A 12-month delay in the state
pension will cost those on the basic rate £5,000; a delay of two
years will cost £10,000. Those on pension credit who have to
wait one year will lose £7,500, and for two years it will be
£15,000. Those women will have done the financial calculations
based on the state pension age that they were told would apply to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000262">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister shakes his head, but that is the
reality. These women have been making decisions based on their
occupational pensions, the state pension and the age at which they will
receive those pensions. Women such as the one who was mentioned
earlier, women who spoke to Age UK and women who have written to me
have all made decisions about caring. For example, the woman that I
mentioned made the decision to care for her grandchildren. However, if
she had known that she would have to wait an extra two years before
receiving her state pension, she might not have made that decision.
That is exactly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Erith
and Thamesmead, who spoke about a woman who had accepted redundancy
payment on the basis that she would receive her state pension at a
particular age, but who now finds that her redundancy money has to last
an extra two years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000264">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is slightly invidious to discuss constituents not
knowing the full details, but a woman in that situation—I
presume that she is 57 or thereabouts—has taken voluntary
redundancy. Is it Labour policy that able-bodied 57-year-old women
should not be expected to do any more paid work and that we should
shape our pension policy around that
assumption?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000265">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As I said earlier, the circumstances of these
500,000 women are all different, but they all made decisions based on
what they thought was a contract with the Government—that they
had paid into the system for a certain number of years and would get
their state pension at a certain age.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As others
have said, particularly my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon
North, there were no riots or huge objections when the state pension
age was increased from 60 to 65, because that group of women recognised
that it was fair, and they were given 15 years’ notice, as
Turner had recommended. For these changes, however, they are not being
given adequate notice. In 1995, few of those women had envisaged their
retirement plans but now, with only six or seven years to go, many of
them are well on their way to planning for retirement. They have done
the right thing. They have carefully planned their finances and taken
on caring responsibilities that they could afford, but they now find
that those caring responsibilities are unaffordable because they will
lose up to £15,000 of pension income. That is the key
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second

               <p class="hs_brev">“My
proposed State Pension age will now be 66. I had accepted that the age
had been pushed back from 60 but will now have to work extra years. I
have 2 children, 1 still at university, and 2 grandchildren
under school age who I look after 2 days a week to help my daughter
with childcare costs. I had worked all my life with just breaks for
maternity, until 2009 when I took early retirement to become full-time
carer for a parent with Alzheimer’s. Since their death I have
returned to work 3 afternoons a week to supplement the household
income. I feel that I and hundreds of other women with similar stories
are being penalised for trying to do the best for our families without
asking for State
help.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000447">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
may be only one example, but it is similar to many others up and down
the country. Again, that woman did the right thing. She has cared for
her family. She has worked all her life. She has made what she thought
were robust financial plans, based on information that she was given,
but her plans have been blown out of the water by the rapid changes
that the Government are pushing through.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000269">&#160;</a>

amendment, the state pension age would still go up, but the impact on
those 500,000 women would be greatly reduced. Instead of having to wait
for more than a year, they would have to wait for less than a year. The
33,000 who would have had to wait exactly two years would have to wait
just one year. The 300,000 who would have had to wait 18 months would
wait for 11 months or less. There is a difference. It is a balance
between the finances and supporting the women on whom the changes would
have the greatest impact, which is why I support the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000270">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead was debated in the other
place. The Minister for Welfare Reform said in the other place that any
alterations to the Pensions Bill must be measured against the 1995
timetable—that is correct—and that they must not
contravene the requirements of the equal treatment directive. In
response to an amendment tabled by Baroness Greengross, the Minister

is a slight problem with that element of the coalition agreement. It
was done in that way at the time, and that is fair enough, but we have

would breach our legal commitment to equalisation and then not to
separating the ages again. There are reasons for needing to revisit

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment represents a middle road between the Government’s
proposals and the amendments debated earlier today. The
Government’s timetable, which will disproportionately affect
women and leave people approaching retirement with little time to plan
for the change, is expected to save £30 billion by 2026. The
amendment that we discussed earlier would save £20
billion over a similar timetable. However, it is clear that this is a
middle way. As my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead said,
the estimates for what this might save are roughly somewhere in
between. The estimate for the amendment tabled by Lord Boswell was
£7 billion. It will be interesting to know whether
the Minister and his Department have costed the impact of this
amendment and whether it fails for legal reasons or for other
reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000277">&#160;</a>

               <p>Although
we cannot be sure in the absence of an impact assessment, we think that
this proposal, given its similarity to the proposal debated in the

               <p class="tabbed">As
well as transitional arrangements, the amendment shows that the
Government have a number of options on the table, and this is just one
of them. Would not this measure amount to a suitable alternative that
deals with the fundamental unfairness at the heart of the
Government’s timetable—an unfairness that was
acknowledged on Second Reading? As my hon. Friend asked, what are the
parameters of an acceptable set of transitional arrangements? If this
measure does not meet them, what would the parameters look
like?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000280">&#160;</a>

not this set of amendments deal with the concerns that we have heard
from thousands of women, groups such as Saga and Age UK, unions and

arrangements? Will the Minister pay close attention to this amendment,
to the benefits that it could bring to women in the affected group and
to its status under the equal treatment
directive?<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000281">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I congratulate the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead on doing what this Committee is here to do, which is to
probe the legislation to come up with creative alternatives and to
present them in a thoughtful and well-informed way. I appreciate the
fact that she did all those things. It has given us a good 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 83<a class="bkMark" name="Column83">&#160;</a>
                  </div>opportunity to revisit one or two of the arguments that we
had earlier on today and to take the debate forward. She did the
Committee a valuable service in that regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the last
24 hours, I saw a performance of the musical “Fame”, the
theme song of which is “I’m gonna live
forever”—a song that is dreaded by all Pensions
Ministers. Unfortunately, the consequence of this set of amendments for
a number of women would be, “I’m gonna work
forever.” The amendments are flawed and would provide for large
numbers of women in a particular age group no pension age at all.
Amendment 24 is defective in that it provides no pension age for women
who were born between 7 May 1953 and 5 December 1953 except
for those born on the 6th of the month.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
that we overdo our impact assessments a bit with ethnicity and gender
and all the rest of it, but we have yet to conduct an impact assessment
on the people who were born on the 6th of the month. This amendment
would have a particular effect on them, which was clearly not the hon.
Lady’s intention. If she were to pursue her amendment to a
Division, I would encourage my hon. Friends to reject it on that basis,
if no
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000284">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment has another slightly odd consequence, which is that it would
reduce men’s state pension age. The proposed timetable would
reduce the state pension age for men born between December 1953 and
February 1954 from 65 to between 64 and six months and 64 and 10
months. I feel duty-bound to point that out, but I say it in no
criticism of the hon. Lady because I know how difficult it is to get
such things right. This perhaps provides further evidence for the point
that I made in a previous debate, which is that doing these things in a
hurry is not a terribly good idea. We as a Government should take our
time to get these things
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000285">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will not dwell on the technical flaws in the amendment because that
would be unfair and unhelpful to the Committee. None the less, the hon.
Lady raises some important issues, which I want to try to address
without duplicating the comments that I made earlier. She said that she
does not want to see a time when people are too old to enjoy their
retirement, and I absolutely agree with
her.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000286">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
little while ago we had people standing outside the Department wearing
T-shirts that said, “I don’t want to work till I
drop.” I asked my private office where the departmental T-shirt
saying the same thing was, because I do not want to work till I drop
either. Raising the state pension age to 66 will leave most people with
more than two decades in retirement, and is a recognition that,
compared with the previous generation and the one before that, our life
expectancy, including healthy life expectancy, is improving
dramatically. There is nothing in the Bill that means that people will
be too old to enjoy their
retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000287">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Yes. I was trying to keep my powder dry for the
right hon. Gentleman’s next group of amendments. I wish to put
him on notice that we will get to them today, if possible. He raises an
important point, but my point to the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead is not so much about whether people will make it to pension
age—the vast majority of people who reach 57 will—but
about whether they will be too old to enjoy their retirement. I take
the right hon. Gentleman’s point about averages, but we have to
deal with the most common outcomes as well as the extreme ones, and
what he suggests is not a feature of our
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead quite properly mentioned the
information that we put on our websites. I saw a figure the other day
of something like 500,000, or perhaps 1 million, hits on one of our
state pension age calculator websites—I think most of them were
by me. I can assure the Committee that on the pension age websites we
are clear about the current legal position, which is the only thing we
can definitively state because the Committee is, I think, urging us to
change what is in the Bill. I ask the hon. Lady to imagine a situation
in which we put the current legal position and a calculator based on
what is in the Bill on the website and people print that off and go
away without looking at it again, but we then amend the Bill and come
up with another timetable. I hope she appreciates that information on
websites has to be based on the current state of the law. The website
clearly flags up, on both the entry page and the forecast page that
estimates when someone can get a pension, the sorts of things that are
being considered. I accept that the site has been improved to make
things clearer, and I agree that we need clear information for people
to act
upon.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Notice
periods have been mentioned—the issue often comes up. The hon.
Member for Leeds West told us what Age UK, Saga and the NAPF have said,
but not what the women themselves say. She quoted a lot of research by
Age UK but missed out a table. Women aged 50 to 57 were asked how much
notice they thought they needed of changes in the state pension age,
and their replies were rather surprising. Some 31% of the sample
thought that they needed a notice period of five years or less and 25%
thought they needed six to 10 years, so more women said that getting on
for five years rather than six to 10 was about right. In addition, 9%
said they needed 20 years, 3% said 25 years, and 4% said they would
like to have known when they left school. It is important to say that
it is tempting for us to speak for others, but in this case when people
were spoken to directly they said something rather
surprising.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000291">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady is right. The table I have here shows
the mode as 10 years, but various bands have been aggregated so I am
not absolutely sure about the calculation. The point remains, however,
that more women said five years or less than said six to
10.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000293">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The mean? My mental arithmetic on a banded table
fails me, I am afraid, but this gives us the chance to pause to
reflect. When we presume that we

                  </div>know what people think it is sometimes worth asking them and considering
what they have to say. Notice periods are an important issue, but
opinions on them clearly
vary.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady was absolutely right to make the point that today’s
pensions are paid for by today’s workers and tomorrow’s
will be paid for by tomorrow’s workers. She seemed to suggest
that if we nudge up the pension age a bit, and have the Work programme
and so on, that would fix it. To give a perspective over the long run,
in 2008 there were four people of working age—16 to 64—to
every one over 65. In 2058 it will be 2¼. That is the kind of
dramatic shift that we are beginning to try to grasp. The marginal
changes we are talking about here do not begin to reverse those massive
trends, which is why we need to act.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With regard
to the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead’s amendment as a
whole, we estimate it would cost around £5 billion. In a sense,
the hon. Member for Leeds West is right to say that it is a halfway
house between her amendments with the figure of £10—or
£12.5—billion, and zero, the effect of not changing the
Bill. It again represents a constructive contribution to the debate and
would cap increases at 12 months. With regard to the overall experience
of these women, the hon. Member for Leeds West said that
many—her favourite phrase of the day—have left the labour
market, when 70% are still in work, and that many take up caring
responsibilities, when 3% are on carer’s
allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000297">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister said earlier that only 3% were in
receipt of carer’s allowance. Does he not accept that many of
the women undertaking caring responsibilities do not qualify for
carer’s allowance? He should acknowledge
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000298">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Indeed. The threshold for carer’s allowance
is in the order of 35 hours a week. These will be people with full-time
essentially caring responsibilities. The hon. Lady is right that there
will be many women in that group who are combining paid work with
caring responsibilities. That is the way that they are making ends meet
now. A change in pension age does not change that; that is part of
their lives. It is an important role that they fulfil; I am not
belittling that at all. My point is that they are combining those
demanding caring roles with paid work now, and that will not change
because the state pension age
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000299">&#160;</a>

women are drawing on their savings during the time they have gone on to
reduced hours to make ends meet? They have done that on the basis of
when their state pension age will kick in. When the Minister says that
I use words such as “many”, he will remember that I said
earlier that of women aged between 55 and 59, 31.5% are inactive; 43.5%
are sick, injured or disabled; and 24.2% are looking after family and
home. I do not accept that I am using huge generalisations; I am

                  </strong> I apologise for not responding to that point. The
way that it works is that contributory jobseeker’s allowance, as
the hon. Lady knows, is time-limited to six months. After that period,
the person might still be eligible for income-based JSA, subject to the
two points that she made. If they have significant occupational pension
income to live off instead of JSA, they will live off that. If they
have savings, their savings will decrease, but as soon as they go below
the savings threshold, they will immediately be entitled again. They
will not have to spend all their savings, merely to go below the
threshold. Then they will become entitled
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000308">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The point that I was making is that what is
time-limited for six months is contributory JSA, which has a threshold
for an occupational pension. After the six months, when contributory
JSA stops—I think that is what the hon. Lady is mainly worried
about—there is income-based JSA, in which case the occupational
pension is simply one item of income counted against the threshold for
entitlement. Having an occupational pension per se does not prevent a
person from getting income-based JSA.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000310">&#160;</a>

a cost. I asked what cost would be acceptable. Is any cost acceptable,

about money and not fairness? That is my concern. As has been said, the
retirement age for the women that we are discussing has already been
adjusted, with hardly a murmur at the time due to the length of time
that they had to plan. Because the age is now quite soon—they
can see it and touch it—that cohort of women feel that it is an
injustice against them in particular. In view of what has been said, I

3, which looks at pension credit for the poorest women and whether they
can keep pension credit at the old timetable for women. It is an
instructive amendment, which helps with the transition process. It does
not change the timetable for the state pension age, but it does look at
how we can help the poorest women. Going back to the point made earlier
by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, it is perhaps a more
official way of helping the people who most need the support. When we

I said on Second Reading, it seems that pension policy at its
best—I am talking over 100 years now—is policy that has
some understanding of the way in which lives, society and economies are
changing, which seeks to adjust pension arrangements to them. In saying
that I am not suggesting some great golden age, because there have been
many problems with our state pension system, not least in relation to
women and carers until recently. But we introduced old-age pensions
back in 1909 at the time of Lloyd George because working men, in
particular, were beginning to outlive their working lives. The state
had to do something—hence the birth of state pensions. Liberals
were as generous as they are being today. The pension was 5 shillings
and people had to be at least 70 years old and there were all sorts of
other catches. At least it started the thing
off.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000330">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
between the wars there was the birth of national insurance and the
Beveridge report by another great Liberal, William Beveridge, and then
there was the National Insurance Act under the Clem Attlee Government.
They recognised how society was changing and the need for national
insurance and in particular for pensions. Later on, there was certainly
the beginning of an understanding that all this looked more like a
man’s world than a woman’s world, and what about mothers
who had to leave the employment market to care for children and later
the carers and so on? We began to adjust it, although not always
adequately. We do not need to make party points on this, but we began
to adjust all of that. Yes, in our discussion today we recognise that
there was a gender inequality in favour of women and we needed to
standardise the pension age. Yes, indeed, as we are discussing now, we
need to increase the state pension age for both men and
women.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000331">&#160;</a>

several examples, including the raising of the state pension age and
the move towards gender equality. My final example is the legislation
with which I was involved, when we tried to give pensioners more choice
and flexibility in how they took their pension. At state pension age,
people could either take their state pension—as most choose to
do—or defer it so that they received a higher pension when they
claimed it or, under the measures we introduced, people could take that
deferred element as a cash sum. I always thought that that was an
important advance for those people who, unlike others in white-collar
work who have a big cash sum when they retire, would never see

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
letter reminds us of the fact that many of our constituents, both men
and women, work tough lives and—this is my argument—have
probably been working tough lives since they left school at 15 or 16. I
cited earlier some data on mortality rates, and I focused on women. Let
me now focus on men, and consider the group of workers in what are
called—according to the ONS—the routine occupations. For
men, we are talking mainly about labourers, van drivers and packers,
while for women it will probably be some of those occupations plus
cleaning—people rather like my constituent whom I call Jill
Brown.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
us consider the proportion of those people who never see a pension
because they die. I have sent my paper round, so the Minister will have
seen the sources for my information. As ever, thanks to the Library. Of
men in the higher managerial and professional class I, 7% die before
the age of 65 while it is 10% for lower managerial and professional
class people. However, when we examine the so-called routine
occupations, it is estimated that 19% of those men die before the age
of 65. Almost one fifth never see their state pension. Colleagues will
reflect on that and accept that it is a significant proportion. For any
Government—Labour, Conservative or Liberal—talking about
raising state pension age, which I repeat we must do, provokes
interesting issues, which is why I appeal to the Minister to reflect on
the matter, as I am sure he has done. Even if he can find fault with my
proposed piece of social engineering, which I can myself, I hope that
he will respond to me.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000339">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition,
there is a double whammy, because although most folk in poorer
occupations live to claim their pension—of course they
do—there is a differential. From the information that the
Minister has presented, life expectancy may have increased. However,
for argument’s sake, from the table, professional men at age 65
have a life expectancy of 18.3 years, but people in the social class V
unskilled category have an expectancy of only 14 years. There is a
class differential, from top to bottom, in how many pension years both
men and women receive. Some people will die never having got their
pension, which is based largely on social class; most people get it,
but those in heavy occupations, from the tougher end of society, have
fewer pension years than those from professional
classes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000340">&#160;</a>

He makes an extremely valid point about what has been a feature of the

                  </strong> No, I did not. I am not going to rehearse my
record, good or bad. There are things of which I am proud, such as the
Pension Protection Fund, which we will touch on later. One of the
beauties of being on the Back Benches and having more time to reflect
is that one can do a bit of research and think again. If that is a
criticism of my stance as Pensions Minister it is a perfectly
justifiable one. My concern now is for none of us to level the same
criticism at the current Pensions Minister and I am trying to be
helpful to
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000342">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
are the policy implications of the measure? When I reflected on that I
quickly concluded that they were not immediate or clear. It would be
easy to say, “Well, this is mainly an issue about health and
social class, and we should tackle it through nutrition and so
on.” Of course we must do that, but I want to press the point
that, nevertheless, there might be some implications for
pensions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000343">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I started off
by saying that from time to time we reflect on how our pension
arrangements relate and react to how people live their lives. One could
say that it has probably always been the case, but it is glaring that
many people now, including us in Committee, did not get our first
proper jobs until we were 21, 22 or 23. I said on Second Reading that
although my own three children had holiday jobs, on average they were
probably 23 when they first got into the proper labour market with
proper careers. That is very different from the world in which most of
our grandparents or great-grandparents lived. They would have left
school at 12, 13 or 14 and worked all their life. We now have a great
differential, with increasing numbers of people not getting their first
proper jobs until almost a quarter of a century has gone by. Yet many
people are still leaving 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 92<a class="bkMark" name="Column92">&#160;</a>
                  </div>school at 16 and, depending on the cohort, some of them will have left
at 15—they will be working for most of their life.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000344">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I say at once
that I can see some of the difficulties in the complexity of my policy
proposals. The Minister will be primed to say that some people with
holiday jobs will start paying their national insurance—let us
tick that one off—when they are 16 or 17, or 18 if they are
doing their holiday job, so we could simply link their pensionable age
to when they start paying national insurance. I understand
that—civil servants are brilliant; they will have picked that
up, but the Minister will have picked it up sooner.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000345">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Are we
relaxed? Are we content with pension arrangements? On the one hand, the
privileged people, of whom there are growing numbers, start work at 21
or 22 and get their pensions at 65, 66 or whatever the age will be; but
those from the least privileged backgrounds, who are working harder in
terms of physical labour than most of us do, get their pension after
having worked five or six years more than those from the most
privileged backgrounds. Essentially, that is my thesis. Such people
have a higher chance of death before reaching state pension age, and
they receive their state pension for four fewer years than the most
privileged, yet they have worked hard all their life.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I propose to
the Committee, and particularly to the Minister, that it is surely
possible to explore drawing on national insurance records. I think the
Minister indicated once that those records are not complete, but we all
get pension forecasts, so can we believe them? I had better not say
that the Minister is shaking his head, because that would be unfair, so
for <em>Hansard</em>, the Minister is not shaking his head, but he looks
terribly interested at this point.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000347">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Surely, from
a combination of income tax, employment and national insurance records,
it would be possible to determine the group that I am talking about.
Such people might have started work at 15 or 16, and have reached
pensionable age after 49 years—or whatever the arithmetic is.
They might have been in work, become mums or carers, or experienced
periods of unemployment. Essentially, however, they will have been out
of education since the age of 15 or 16. Should we not be able to devise
some sort of trigger so that they can draw their state pension—I
am still looking to the future—at, say, 65? They have worked
damned hard; they are physically worn out; their joints are creaking;
their backs are aching and they have served this country well. To
simply treat them as we treat the postgraduate class seems an act of
great folly and injustice. If previous Pensions Ministers failed to
spot this one and act on it, that is a shame, but I look to future
Pensions Ministers to find some way of remedying an
injustice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070616000348">&#160;</a>
