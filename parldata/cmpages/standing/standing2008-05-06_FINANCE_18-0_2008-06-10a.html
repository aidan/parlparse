welcome hon. members back to the Committee. It is still a little warm,
and I am happy that some members have taken off their jackets to ensure
that they remain fresh and competent for the debates ahead. We were on
amendment No. 173 when we adjourned at 1 o&#146;clock. The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire was on his feet and I ask him to
resume the excellent speech that he was
making.</div><a name="080610125000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610125000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I am very
grateful, Sir Nicholas. No doubt you said it was excellent, because at
that point I had barely risen. That was probably the strongest part of
the speech.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div><a name="080610125000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000399"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech was so excellent that it has moved me to
say that I am minded to accept amendment No. 255, which aligns the
treatment of the tax affairs of the deceased person with other
arrangements, reducing the six years to four years, and there is no
good reason not to do so. In the context of the debate on powers, it is
better&#151;if my hon. Friends will allow me to demonstrate my New
Labour credentials and just how inclusive I am&#151;to take a
conservative with a small &#147;c&#148; approach to the application
of powers. If he is inclined to press the amendment further, we would
certainly support it.</div>
<a name="080610125000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000400"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am very grateful to the Financial Secretary. I do
not know whether we could break for another meal, as perhaps some of my
other amendments would be accepted. The Financial Secretary said
informally that she would look at the proposal over the lunch break,
and I am very grateful for her acceptance of the amendment. I certainly
will seek to move the amendment formally at the appropriate
time.</div>
<a name="080610125000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
atmosphere of convivial and good natured deliberations, I will not
press the for a Division, but nevertheless I wish to highlight the
issue of privilege. The Financial Secretary said she was
uncomfortable&#151;perhaps that is putting it too strongly: she
recognised the strength of argument that the arrangements replicated in
the schedule with regard to privilege create one or two distortions.
She highlighted the circumstances of accountancy firms with a legal
arm, which enables them to provide advice, whereas smaller accountancy
firms are not able to do so. There is also the wider issue of
accountancy firms in general compared with law firms. We have set out
the accountancy profession&#146;s concerns, which the Financial
Secretary has acknowledged and, to some extent, she has accepted that
the current situation is unsatisfactory.</div>
<a name="080610125000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary said before lunch that the Ministry of Justice was
keen to include the provisions on legal professional privilege. There
was a time when all the other Departments jumped to the call of the
Treasury, so perhaps this is joined-up government&#151;we shall see.
However, the problem remains. We are not going to press for a Division,
but I hope that the Government will look again at the issue of legal
professional privilege. I see no particularly strong reason why the
provision should not be extended to tax advisers more generally. On
that note, may I say how grateful we are to the Financial Secretary for
agreeing to accept amendment No.
255?</div><a name="080610125000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610125000401"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000405"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> In tabling amendments Nos. 174 to 177, my hon.
Friends and I have sought to strengthen various rights of appeal. The
right of appeal is paramount to much of this legislation, and taxpayers
and third parties will have the opportunity to challenge HMRC
decisions, which is an important aspect of the Bill.</div>
<a name="080610125000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 174 relates to part 5 of schedule 36, which deals with appeals
against information notices. Paragraph 27 concerns the right of appeal,
and amendment No. 174 would delete the unnecessary sub-paragraphs (2)
and (3), which contain exceptions to the right of appeal against a
notice. Sub-paragraph (2) prevents an appeal against a requirement to
produce documents that form part of &#147;the taxpayer&#146;s
statutory records&#148;. We seek clarification on which documents are
included in that provision. Such measures are often left deliberately
rather loose, which makes it difficult for anyone to ensure that they
retain and maintain the right records so that they can be produced at a
future date. Are bank statements, mortgage statements and utility bills
included in the so-called statutory documents in sub-paragraph (2),
which appears to negate virtually any leave to appeal provided in
sub-paragraph (1). Given that &#147;statutory records&#148; could
include just about anything, there are virtually no grounds for appeal,
which makes paragraphs 27 and 28 worryingly
otiose.</div><a name="080610125000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clarification
of the measures would benefit and help taxpayers, as they will be asked
to produce documents and to assist the authorities, and they need to
know what they might be asked to provide. There should not be
sub-paragraphs in the Bill that undermine basic right-of-appeal
legislation. Sub-paragraph (3) would prevent an appeal if the
first-tier tribunal approved the notice, but we do not see why the
taxpayer should not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div>be provided with a right to appeal in those circumstances. Will the
Minister explain the thinking behind the measure? We are not alone in
expressing concern . Other hon. Members may know that the Institute of
Chartered Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Taxation and
PricewaterhouseCoopers are concerned about the lack of leave to appeal
generally for the taxpayer in schedule 36. Although part 5 allows some
appeals, that is only against a notice, and it would not allow the
taxpayer to prevent the inspection of premises and documents in
advance. There is no provision in the Bill to suspend an inspection
until the appeal has been decided. Under paragraph 30, application for
an appeal should be made within 30 days, but given that inspection will
not even require notice, there should be a right of appeal against all
HMRC decisions and actions.</div>
<a name="080610125000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="080610125000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 175 would strengthen the third-party right of appeal, and delete
the caveat that, under that right, an appeal can be made only against a
third-party notice if
it</div><a name="080610125000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
be unduly onerous to
comply&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 176 would insert into paragraph 28 a new sub-paragraph (1A) on the
right to appeal against the third-party notice, which would allow an
appeal
by</div><a name="080610125000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
taxpayer to whom a third party notice relates...against the notice
or any requirement of the
notice&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had lengthy debates about the way in which notices are issued, and
the amendment would strengthen the third-party right of
appeal.</div><a name="080610125000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 177 does exactly the same thing as amendment No. 174, but in
respect of the appeal against a third-party notice. There are concerns
that the first-tier tribunal may be persuaded to approve a notice
requiring a third party to provide documents, and that the taxpayer to
whom those documents relate would have no idea that that was happening.
It can be argued that these are civil powers and therefore demand an
openness that is not apparent in the schedule. The amendments in this
group provide some important safeguards in respect of appeals, and
strengthen the rights of appeal, which are an important aspect of any
taxation legislation. I hope that the Minister can persuade us that
these probing but important amendments are unnecessary, although we may
have to think otherwise if she cannot do
so.</div><a name="080610125000049"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000406"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> When discussing schedule 36, we are trying to
balance, as always in such circumstances, the rights of individual
taxpayers and the efficacy of the system to enable HMRC to pursue
taxpayers who owe money. A key element in getting the balance right is
ensuring that we have the right appeals process in place and that an
appeals mechanism applies where it is needed. The group of amendments
that we are discussing relates to that
objective.</div><a name="080610125000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall set out the main issues, and there
is no need for me to repeat everything that he said. He made an
important point relating to paragraph 27(2), which proposes that the
right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal should</div>
<a name="080610125000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not apply to a
requirement in a taxpayer notice to provide any information, or produce
any document, that forms part of the taxpayer&#146;s statutory
records.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div><a name="080610125000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about
statutory records is important. I should be grateful if the Minister
gave the Committee some detail on, if not a definition of,
&#147;statutory records&#148;, because that can be interpreted
broadly.</div><a name="080610125000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have spoken to experts in this field who argue that, in particular
circumstances, a person&#146;s diary could constitute a statutory
record, depending on the information that it contained. We are not
necessarily talking about a narrow definition, but we will listen
carefully to what the Minister says on that point. We are interested in
the reason why notices seeking such information should not be subject
to appeal. If that is a simple matter and such a provision could be
included&#151;that is, a provision to the effect that no one has a
legitimate right or claim to say that such information should not be
presented to HMRC&#151;presumably the first-tier tribunal should be
able to draw the necessary conclusions. We share the views of the
Liberal Democrats on that point. The Minister needs to explain why the
right of appeal should not be available, even if documentation
constitutes part of the statutory records. That argument relates to
amendments Nos. 259, 174 and
177.</div><a name="080610125000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 176, tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, makes a fair point, as
paragraph 28 gives a right of appeal against the third-party notice
only</div>
<a name="080610125000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on the ground
that it would be unduly onerous to comply with the notice or
requirement.&#148;</div><a name="080610125000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
might be other circumstances in which it would be right for the
first-tier tribunal to grant an appeal, but the wording is very
narrowly defined, and provides for a small exemption. I would be
grateful to know the Minister&#146;s thoughts as to why it is
necessary to restrict that right of appeal to that narrow
ground.</div><a name="080610125000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 261 provides that the notice of appeal should go to the first-tier
tribunal, rather than to Revenue and Customs. It is largely an
administrative point, on which we would welcome the Minister&#146;s
comments. Amendment No. 262 relates to paragraph 30(4), which
states:</div><a name="080610125000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the First-tier Tribunal confirms or varies the information notice or a
requirement, the person to whom the information notice was given must
comply with the notice...within such period as is specified by the
Tribunal&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
suggest a clarification of that measure. Our proposal is similar to
that which we made in a couple of debates this morning, because we
suggest there should be a minimum period of</div>
<a name="080610125000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at least 30
days starting with the day after the notification of the decision to
the person to whom the information notice was
given&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would provide a degree of certainty, and ensure that there is a
reasonable amount of time for someone to comply with the tribunal
decision.</div><a name="080610125000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 292 deals with a slightly different point. Paragraph 32 deals with
the supply of goods or services as special cases, and makes particular
rules for such circumstances. Essentially, it deals with
MTIC&#151;missing trader intra-community fraud&#151;which is a
major issue that we have not debated a great deal in this Finance Bill
Committee, although it has been debated in previous years. It
represents a considerable threat to the Exchequer, and there is a case
for special rules to be made in relevant circumstances. However, to
provide a little more clarification and to ensure that paragraph 32 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div>applies only in those circumstances, we suggest a specific reference to
statutory records for &#147;VAT purposes&#148;, to relate the
provision directly to MTIC fraud, and prevent the provision applying
more generally, which I do not think is the Government&#146;s
intention. We await the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="080610125000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000407"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> As has been described, these paragraphs in
schedule 36 set out the appeal rights for taxpayers against information
notices, and strike a balance between the need to give taxpayers the
right safeguards and the need for HMRC to be able to check and identify
where non-compliant taxpayers have underpaid tax. Amendments Nos. 174
to 177 and 259 would exclude the two circumstances in which there would
not be a right of appeal, and I shall seek to answer questions about
the reasons for those exemptions. However, before doing that, I shall
try to answer the questions raised by both hon. Gentlemen about what
constitutes statutory records.</div>
<a name="080610125000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall suggested that bank or mortgage
statements might constitute statutory records. A bank statement could
be a statutory record if the bank account is used for the business or
for taxable transactions, but a mortgage statement would be unlikely to
be a statutory record. It could be requested as supplementary
information, but that would have to be via an information
notice.</div><a name="080610125000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Statutory
records will also be defined in the record-keeping regulations, which
we have taken powers to lay in schedule 37, and in guidance. A diary,
as suggested by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, would be
a statutory record only if it were a business appointment diary, such
as a hairdresser might keep&#151;a business close to both our hearts,
Sir Nicholas. That is a reasonable reason for a diary to be
requested.</div><a name="080610125000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax, the law says that
records must be kept in order to enable a complete and correct tax
return or a claim to be made. Those include records of receipts and
expenditure and sales or purchases of goods, where relevant; VAT
business and accounting records must also be kept, plus additional
records specified for certain purposes. It is reasonable to expect that
HMRC should be able to inspect such records, given that keeping them is
a statutory
requirement.</div><a name="080610125000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
right of appeal against a statutory right is inappropriate and would be
unworkable in practice. For example, what could the right of appeal be?
It would be exploited by the non-compliant to delay HMRC&#146;s
compliance work. There are many examples of other statutory checks by
public sector bodies, professional and trade associations without a
direct right of appeal. Sometimes it is not appropriate to give a right
of appeal where other safeguards are in place, in order to prevent
unnecessary delays in the checking process, or where the appeal right
would be meaningless. Some taxpayers already exploit existing appeal
rights to delay legitimate checking, withdrawing their appeal at the
last
moment.</div><a name="080610125000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
propose that there will be no appeal where HMRC asks for statutory
records. If a taxpayer is required to keep the records, it is
reasonable that they should be asked to provide them and to show them
to HMRC. The concept of statutory records was introduced into the
legislation as a safeguard. It gives HMRC a right to see the basic
records that need to be kept in order to pay the right tax. Where it is
considered that more detailed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div>information is needed, an information notice will be required. We have
debated the safeguards that are being built in around
that.</div><a name="080610125000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
there is doubt about whether something constitutes a statutory record,
the taxpayer can make representations to HMRC; and where there is
genuine doubt about the categorisation of the records, a penalty would
not be incurred at that point. If necessary an information notice can
be issued for those records, again with the safeguards around
information notices that I have alluded to. There will also be no
appeal where the appeal tribunal has already considered whether an
information notice is appropriate. That is something that we have done
in response to representations made by the British Bankers Association
during the consultation. Its concern has been to protect
taxpayers&#146; right to privacy.</div>
<a name="080610125000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
pre-authorisation route may be used only where the tribunal considers
HMRC is justified in doing so. Previously, there was absolutely no
right of appeal against information requests when HMRC was checking
VAT, pay-as-you-earn or periods outside the self-assessment inquiry
regimes. Now, there will be appeal rights if HMRC asks for something
that a taxpayer is not required to keep by law. Although this schedule
retains the ability for HMRC to seek pre-authorisation by the tribunal,
it allows for an appeal right to be given against third-party
information notices where the taxpayer has consented to HMRC seeking
supplementary
information.</div><a name="080610125000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 261 seeks to provide that notice of an appeal should be given to
the tribunal rather than to HMRC. There is a very sound reason why that
should not happen. The provision that the notice of an appeal should be
given to HMRC replicates the existing legislation, but that is not the
reason why I believe it should remain. HMRC needs to be given notice of
an appeal by a taxpayer to make sure that further action is not taken
in seeking information and in order to prepare the necessary material
for HMRC to present its case at appeal. It may be that, on
consideration of the appeal, HMRC agrees that the information is not
required&#151;that can happen&#151;but imagine the frustration of
an individual who has lodged their appeal at the tribunal if HMRC
unknowingly continues to pursue them for the information it has
requested. This matter is also being considered as part of tribunal
reform. The Ministry of Justice is content with the formulation as it
stands. I hope that that description of what I anticipate happening has
allayed some of the anxieties
expressed.</div><a name="080610125000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 262 seeks to limit the tribunal&#146;s power to vary the time
period within which a taxpayer must comply with an information notice
to 30 days or more. It is similar to amendment No. 249, which seeks to
do the same where HMRC sets a time period. The arguments for not
including the provision are the same, but even stronger. If a time
period of less than 30 days is set, it is because the independent
appeal tribunal considers that to be reasonable in the case being
considered. Amendment No. 292 would not achieve anything. If records
are statutory records for VAT purposes, they are still statutory
records. It is difficult to think of any document about the supply of
goods or services that would be a statutory record for some other tax
purpose without also being a statutory record for VAT purposes.
Although the main purpose of paragraph 32 is to enable goods to be
checked along a supply chain for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div>VAT purposes, the legislation is written without reference to specific
taxes as far as possible, as part of the alignment process.</div>
<a name="080610125000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I
have managed to address some of the concerns that have been expressed.
I know they were tabled as probing amendments, and I hope the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000408"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000409"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. On amendment No. 292, I
note the Financial Secretary&#146;s comment that she does not want to
specify within the Bill that the provision applies to a specific
tax&#151;VAT&#151;but I would be grateful for clarification as to
whether the provisions contained in the paragraph could or will be used
more broadly. We understand that the provision is there to tackle MTIC
fraud, so I question the reason for her reluctance to specify VAT
purposes and ask her to provide some clarification to the Committee on
that point.</div>
<a name="080610125000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
right hon. Lady&#146;s comments on various other amendments. I do not
intend to press them to a Division, as they were tabled to prove the
Government&#146;s position. We are not entirely satisfied with the
position on appeal&#151;that is a point we touched upon this morning.
I do not know whether the Financial Secretary wishes to intervene at
all with regard to paragraph
32.</div><a name="080610125000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000410"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It may help in the consideration that the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall is undertaking. The hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire is right and it is a good question, in that it
has clarified the matter. MTIC fraud, which is commonly known as
carousel fraud and which in recent years presented a major risk to
revenue is the focus that we have in mind with this measure, but that
may change, so it is possible that it could be used for some other
purpose.</div><a name="080610125000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000411"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The only other
comment that I wish to make is on statutory records and diaries. The
Financial Secretary said that the provision will be used only for an
appointments diary and gave the example of a hairdresser. She will be
aware that some people may be sensitive about an appointments diary
being in the hands of HMRC, because it may well contain appointments of
a more personal nature that they would not necessarily wish to be in
its hands. The concern cannot automatically be dismissed that there
could be something of a private nature that HMRC could retain in such
circumstances. That is why we have raised the lack of a right of appeal
with regard to statutory records. I do not wish to press any of the
amendments that I tabled to
Division.</div><a name="080610125000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000412"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Some questions that we raised have been answered
satisfactorily, but I am not entirely sure that the fundamental issues
raised by Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 174 and 177 have been
addressed. Our concerns are about statutory records and documents. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>As it stands, if someone is required to maintain such records, it is not
unreasonable to expect them to have some idea of what they constitute.
Otherwise, the list could go on and on and almost anything could be
said to be a statutory document. The argument in favour of a right of
appeal therefore seems to be strengthened. If there were a clear list,
or at least some indication of what those documents were, the right of
appeal could be diluted. That is what the amendments are designed to
address. I can understand the Financial Secretary&#146;s difficulty
in this area, but the right of appeal is an important principle for the
taxpayer in such
matters.</div><a name="080610125000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000413"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I am trying to be helpful. I said that
regulations laid at a later date would bring greater clarity. I
appreciate that that answer is often a frustration for hon. Members in
Public Bill Committee debates, but there is a clear intention to set
out greater detail at a later
date.</div><a name="080610125000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000414"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I am grateful for that further clarification. I
accept that if the Financial Secretary says that in Committee, we can
rely on it. She might just about have saved the day. I want her to
realise that we believe that this is a very important principle. The
right of appeal is paramount when people are trying to defend
themselves against the things that are held against them on tax issues.
Those things could include all sorts of documentation that they do not
believe should be made available for scrutiny by HMRC and there are
issues of privacy in such cases. I hope that the Government recognise
that and will make proposals accordingly. On the basis of the Financial
Secretary&#146;s promises, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080610125000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000417"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The amendment relates to the daily default
penalties set out in paragraph 38 of schedule 36. The issue was raised
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Paragraph 38 provides for
daily penalties to be imposed after a continued failure to comply, so
once a fixed penalty has been imposed there is nothing to prevent daily
penalties from being levied. However, in the view of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants that would be unfair, especially if the original
fixed penalty were subject to an appeal under paragraph 45. That is a
fair point. The amendment therefore suggests that paragraph 38 be
explicitly subject to a moratorium, so that it may not be invoked until
30 days after the standard penalty is imposed, or 30 days after any
appeal against the standard penalty is determined, if that is later.
There is a potential injustice where the fixed penalty could be subject
to appeal, yet the daily penalties would start to
run.</div><a name="080610125000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will allow the Liberal Democrat Members to speak to their own
amendments, but our amendment No. 265 and their amendment No. 180
relate to the same issue, which is where the notice of appeal should
go. I suspect that the Financial Secretary will refer to her earlier
comments on where notice of appeal should be sent. We again make the
point that it should perhaps be to the first-tier tribunal; however, I
note her comments on the previous group of
amendments.</div><a name="080610125000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 266 relating to paragraph 48 of schedule 36, provides some detail
on the appeal proceedings. In particular, it provides for the right of
appeal to the upper tribunal. For these tax-related penalties, a proper
right of appeal to the upper tribunal would be appropriate, and there
should be the chance for representations to be made. That is a
recurring theme in relation to schedule
36.</div><a name="080610125000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a point worth drawing out with amendments Nos. 293 and 307.
They essentially do the same thing, which is to look at the question of
reasonable excuse. The amendments have been provided by the low incomes
tax reform group, which does a lot of good work representing low income
taxpayers. It makes the point that for some people, a lot of their
problems are due to their not having access to professional advice. The
group suggests that it would be helpful to have on the statute book a
recognition that, when considering whether someone has a reasonable
excuse, the fact that they cannot afford professional advice should be
taken into account in certain
circumstances.</div><a name="080610125000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
tabled the amendments in a slightly probing manner, because I see some
administrative difficulties with the provisions. Whether someone can
afford professional advice becomes a difficult question of judgment.
However, the point is an important one, and when looking at reasonable
excuse, whether it is on the statute book or not, there should be an
acknowledgement that for some people getting professional advice is
difficult or not realistic because of the costs involved, with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>result that those people are in a worse position. HMRC should
acknowledge that in the way those people are treated. There should be a
greater degree of latitude for those who are not able to seek the same
advice as wealthy individuals or larger businesses. Amendments Nos. 293
and 307 are intended to flesh out the definition of &#147;reasonable
excuse&#148; so that it refers explicitly to that
matter.</div><a name="080610125000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Good afternoon, Sir

behind them, if it is not already
apparent.</div><a name="080610125000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 178 is intended to remove uncertainty from the Bill. Part 7 deals
with penalties for failing to comply with an information notice, and
paragraph 37 states that a penalty of &#163;300 is payable in those
circumstances. The amendment would delete paragraph 41, which
legislates against the concealing, destroying and disposal of
documents</div><a name="080610125000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
an officer of Revenue and Customs has informed the person that the

part&#151;</div><a name="080610125000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
be the subject of an information
notice&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of groups, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants,
argue that it is unreasonable to expect someone to keep something on
the off-chance that it may be wanted by an officer of HMRC at some
point in the future. People have to make a value judgment as to whether
it is likely that information will be relevant, applicable or of
interest to HMRC at some point. That is an in-built judgment that
people are required to make, and they may feel that they cannot
second-guess HMRC&#146;s future intentions
accurately.</div><a name="080610125000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 179 would allow the tribunal to extend the time available.
Paragraph 42 of the schedule excludes someone from liability to a
penalty if an HMRC officer allows them further time to fulfil the
relevant requirements. We are instinctively sympathetic to such
flexibility, but the amendment would also allow the first-tier tribunal
to allow an alternative time frame for compliance. A theme of our
deliberations, both today and previously, is that we are uncomfortable
with relying on HMRC officers to decide matters relating to inspection
powers and appeals, and that it would be more appropriate for the
tribunal to oversee matters of appeal, including by it having the
ability to amend demands from HMRC as it sees
fit.</div><a name="080610125000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 180 suggests that an appeal should be made to the tribunal, not to
HMRC. Paragraph 46 of the schedule deals with appeals against a
penalty, and the amendment would delete sub-paragraph (1)(c), which
requires a taxpayer to provide written notice of an appeal to HMRC.
That might seem to be a slightly arcane point, but in our view there is
no need for HMRC to be statutor&#151;I can never pronounce
that
word.</div><a name="080610125000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610125000419"></a><b class="B">John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000420"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman&#151;a Somerset MP
came to the rescue, and his help is much appreciated. There is no need
for HMRC to have a legal right to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column624" />Column number: 624</div>informed by the taxpayer. Not only is that confusing, but the appeals
procedure will of course require the tribunal to interact with HMRC to
ascertain the circumstances of the case. Our view is that a taxpayer
should not lose the right to appeal because they did not copy that
appeal to HMRC when informing the
tribunal.</div><a name="080610125000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 181 is the simplest of our amendments to grasp. It suggests that
the 30-day notice period that applies when an enforcement notice for a
penalty is issued should start on the date on which it is received by
the taxpayer, not on the date on which it is issued. There is, of
course, a period between those dates, and it may be longer than would
be ideal if there are difficulties with the postal service, for
example. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response to
those
points.</div><a name="080610125000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610125000421"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): My
hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire and the hon. Member
for Taunton suggested that the word &#147;likely&#148; is open to
great uncertainty in this context. Perhaps the Minister will go into
detail about HMRC&#146;s track record, because it would be useful to
have something on the record so that we can see what records need to be
kept.</div><a name="080610125000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the Minister will suggest, with authority and to her
credit, that taxpayers&#146; compliance and record-keeping
responsibilities are changing rapidly, because much more data is
maintained electronically. That can, as her Department is aware, create
problems, but it is now easier to retain and store data that is kept
electronically rather than on paper. Will she give a brief overview of
this area of responsibility and the way in which the balance of
responsibility between HMRC and taxpayers has developed? It is
unreasonable to expect any corporate or individual taxpayer to keep
reams of paper records in filing cabinets for a prolonged period, but
in so far as much of the data can be stored electronically on discs and
the like, it is understandable that HMRC should expect rather more data
to be kept. When the Minister comments on the concerns that have been
expressed&#151;we have spoken to a range of amendments suggested by a
number of interested outside bodies&#151;she will indicate the
Treasury&#146;s broad thinking on how the balance of obligation
between taxpayers and HMRC will develop in the years ahead, given the
importance of technological
changes?</div><a name="080610125000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000422"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster will allow me, I have more detailed notes on future clauses
to which amendments relating to computer records in have been tabled.
Rather than being drawn into a wider discussion of responsibilities
between taxpayers and HMRC, I shall bear in mind what has been said and
ensure that I refer to it in future
debates.</div><a name="080610125000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the penalties to which the amendments relate is to deter
those who would otherwise not co-operate with HMRC&#146;s checking.
If they are to be an effective deterrent, penalties must be clear and
transparent, but they should also carry safeguards. For that reason,
all the penalties are set out in primary legislation, and they all
carry a right of appeal. Amendment No. 264 would provide that before
daily penalties are levied, 30 days must have passed since the standard
penalty was levied or an appeal was determined. The effect would be
that after an initial penalty was charged for failure to comply with an
information notice, there would be no incentive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 625</div>to respond for another 30 days. That does not fit with the aim of
allowing faster checking and not allowing the non-compliant to delay
legitimate checking at little cost to
them.</div><a name="080610125000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision in the schedule applying daily penalties replicates the way
in which existing legislation works. That avoids making unnecessary
changes that would require taxpayers and their agents to read new
rules, and there have been no representations about HMRC&#146;s use
of the daily penalty regime. I assure the Committee that the schedule
provides for a full right of appeal for taxpayers against both the
applying and the level of daily
penalties.</div><a name="080610125000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 178 would remove the requirement on a person not to destroy,
conceal or dispose of documents when they have been told informally
that those documents are subject to a formal information notice. In
many circumstance, compliance checks are carried out without the need
for the formal use of HMRC&#146;s powers, and with the agreement of
the taxpayer. That can be an easier way of working for both the
taxpayer and HMRC. Adopting this amendment would mean that the risk to
HMRC of following an informal approach would increase, particularly
when dealing with people who, it later turns out, deliberately seek not
to pay tax. Those people could simply destroy the information that HMRC
has said that it needs to check a tax position, which is a good reason
for maintaining the proposals as laid out in the Bill.</div>
<a name="080610125000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 179 seeks to give the first-tier tribunal the power to give
taxpayers further time but, again, that power is not necessary, as the
tribunal will have the power to set aside any penalty if the time frame
allowed is not reasonable. In paragraph 45, a taxpayer may appeal
against a
notice</div><a name="080610125000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
insufficient time has been given&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610125000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The tribunal can set
aside the penalty if it agrees that insufficient time has been given,
so there are provisions elsewhere in the legislation.</div>
<a name="080610125000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 180 removes the provision requiring notice of an appeal against a
penalty to be given to HMRC. The amendment replicates the existing
legislation. We have had this debate before, and I am going to make the
same point in response. Given that existing procedures are working
well, I do not believe it is necessary to accept the amendment, so I
hope the hon. Member for Taunton will not press
it.</div><a name="080610125000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 181 seeks to require a penalty to be paid within 30 days of the
penalty notice. Again, the 30-day period already takes into account
time taken to deliver a notice. If a taxpayer did not receive a notice
until too late, they would have a reasonable excuse for paying the
penalty late, and would therefore not be subject to further penalties
for late payment. If the 30 days did not start until HMRC could
demonstrate that a penalty notice had been received, that would allow
taxpayers who are so minded&#151;again, there are some&#151;to
evade penalties by ensuring they never receive the penalty notice, for
example by not collecting their post. It is therefore better to have
certainty with clear time frames based on the date written on the
penalty notice. That still allows taxpayers with a genuine reasonable
excuse for receiving a penalty notice late to escape penalty for late
payment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 626</div><a name="080610125000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 266 seeks to
apply further procedures to the hearing in cases in which the upper
tribunal may impose a tax-related penalty. That penalty will be used
only rarely, in extreme cases. To get to that stage, the taxpayer must
already have failed to appeal against both the standard penalty and the
daily default penalty. The taxpayer would be able to attend either
appeal hearing or make representations. The penalty is therefore
intended to apply to taxpayers who do not respond to HMRC&#146;s
request for information, and who just accept the penalties that are
charged. It is for the upper tribunal to decide how best to take into
account the taxpayer&#146;s point of view when deciding whether a
penalty should be charged and how much. The upper tribunal, as the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire will know, is equivalent to a high
court. As in any decision by the upper-tier tribunal, there is a right
of appeal for either party, on a point of law, to the Court of Appeal
under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
2007.</div><a name="080610125000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 293 is one of the most interesting in this group, although that
does not mean that they are not all interesting. It seeks to provide
that a taxpayer will always have a reasonable excuse for their failure
to comply with an information notice if at the time they did not have,
and could not afford, professional advice. Amendment No. 307 has an
identical effect in relation to schedule 41, and I acknowledge the work
of the low Incomes tax reform group.</div>
<a name="080610125000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC&#146;s
intention over time is to create a single, aligned reasonable excuse
provision across all tax legislation to make that vital safeguard
clearer and more consistent in its application. That approach was
strongly supported in the consultation, as was the wording we used in
the Bill after the issue was exposed in consultation. The same wording
is used in paragraph 43 of schedule 36 and paragraph 20 of schedule 41.
The law does not attempt to define what a reasonable excuse is, as that
will vary according to the particular circumstances of the
taxpayer.</div>
<a name="080610125000352"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="080610125000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if a taxpayer receives a straightforward information notice asking for
a particular document or piece of information, generally there should
be no difficulty in complying with it. Professional advice is not
needed. Of course, there is nothing to prevent HMRC or the tribunal
taking the lack of access to a professional adviser into account in
particular cases, but it would be inappropriate to allow a blanket
exemption from a penalty on those
grounds.</div><a name="080610125000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the obligation for someone to tell HMRC when they start up in business
is usually not complicated and it does not require professional advice.
Where there is genuine doubt about whether an activity should be
registered, and as a result the taxpayer fails to do so, that might be
a reasonable excuse. Again, HMRC or a tribunal may wish to consider the
issue of access to a professional adviser, but a blanket exemption is
inappropriate.</div>
<a name="080610125000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
cases&#151;I know that this has already happened&#151;taxpayers
approach HMRC through the inquiry centres that it has throughout the
country, to clarify questions of that nature when they are considering
what they need to tell HMRC to establish their tax liability.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 627</div><a name="080610125000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,
in making that response to hon. Members&#146; speeches, I have dealt
with most of their concerns. I will certainly remember the note to
speak perhaps more generally when we consider computer records at a
later time. However, I hope that hon. Members will not press their
amendments to a vote this
afternoon.</div><a name="080610125000119"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000423"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am going to be as gracious as I ever can be and
say that I found the Minister&#146;s response rather persuasive on
many points, and I am happy to acknowledge that. The only point about
which I continue to have a reservation, although I very much understand
the case that the Minister makes, is the specific issue of the taxpayer
having to anticipate which documents HMRC considers are likely to be
required at some point in the future. I appreciate that, if that caveat
is not allowed, there is the opportunity for people to pile loads of
documentation through the shredder, knowing perfectly well that it is
likely to be useful, but they will be able to put their hand up at a
later date and say, totally innocently, &#147;Sorry, I did not
realise that I was doing that&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610125000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the danger of trying to prevent that activity in the way that the
Minister is attempting to prevent it through this legislation is that
other people who are not acting with malign intentions may feel that
they are somewhat caught out too. That situation is what I was trying
to safeguard against, but I appreciate that, in trying to safeguard
against it, we would potentially open up a big avenue of abuse, which
the Minister is concerned about. As I say, although my concerns on
behalf of the innocent taxpayer who is seeking to be compliant remain,
because of the Minister&#146;s perfectly legitimate concerns I do not
anticipate that the Committee is likely to approve amendment No. 178.
It is not my place to do anything on amendment No. 264, because I am
not the author of that amendment, so I will sit down and allow the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire to complete the
formalities.</div>
<a name="080610125000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000424"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are grateful to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="080610125000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000425"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Member for Taunton says that I will
complete the formalities. How does he know that he is not going to get
some inspiring oratory? <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> Alright, I
will complete the formalities.</div>
<a name="080610125000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the Minister for her comments. I am grateful that she paid
due regard to the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which does a lot of
very good work. However, her arguments on amendments Nos. 293 and 307
are persuasive. Although there are circumstances in which recognition
of a lack of access to professional advice should be taken into
account, I can see the difficulties of having a one-size-fits-all
definition of &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; for these purposes and
a degree of flexibility is helpful.</div>
<a name="080610125000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also note
the Minister&#146;s comments with regard to amendment No. 265; she
made comparable comments earlier, and I will accept her comments. I am
not necessarily entirely convinced on amendment No. 266, but I
certainly will not press for a Division on that.</div>
<a name="080610125000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 265, the Minister said that the current system seems to be working
well. I would be grateful if she could keep that under review, and I am
sure that she will, so that if there are problems with notices of
appeal that can be looked at again. On 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>amendment No. 264, I can see the administrative difficulties that may be
created and the potential delays. It is always a question of getting
that balance right and it is not necessarily an easy judgment to make.
Having made those comments, however, and having probed the Government
on these issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080610125000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="080610125000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000426"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 182, in
schedule 36, page 369, line 33, leave
out from &#145;Schedule&#146; to end of line 34 and
insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;may not be made unless a draft of the
regulations has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, the
House of
Commons.&#146;.</div><a name="080610125000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
felt that we had not spent nearly long enough on schedule 36 and that
another amendment would keep us going until perhaps a Division in the
Chamber.</div>
<a name="080610125000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will be
brief. There is a slightly ritualistic quality to the amendment because
it is the type of amendment that is tabled by Opposition parties as a
matter of routine. I sound rather world weary for someone who has only
been in Parliament for three years. I have observed the tabling of such
amendments many times and the Government in my experience resist them.
I anticipate that they will do the same again. There is no harm,
however, in tabling such an amendment even if one anticipates that one
will be unsuccessful.</div>
<a name="080610125000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment seeks to require an affirmative resolution when changes are
made. Paragraph 55(2) states that all statutory instruments provided
for under the schedule will be subject to negative resolution.
Amendment No. 182 changes that to an affirmative resolution. The basis
for that is that we continue to have serious concerns with regard not
just to this schedule and legislation but to other Government
legislation generally about the lack of safeguards afforded to the
taxpayer and the Government being empowered to make changes without
going through the degree of parliamentary scrutiny which we would wish
to see. Amendment No. 182, therefore, seeks to ensure that Parliament
is able to debate further regulations and scrutinise HMRC&#146;s
practices more thoroughly than would otherwise be the
case.</div><a name="080610125000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000427"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, there is a certain
ritualistic nature to the amendment. None the less, I think it is
valuable because Government should always have to justify the use of
the negative resolution as opposed to the affirmative procedure. When I
have debated the matter with the Financial Secretary in the past, she
has tended to make the point that it is the sort of thing that
Oppositions call for and Governments reject.</div>
<a name="080610125000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 36
is an important schedule. It contains an important number of
provisions. The detail on the safeguards by no means matches the detail
on the powers and deterrents; the whole process is about powers,
deterrents and safeguards, a point that I made last week. From what we
have heard, most of the safeguards will be in the form of guidance
rather than in the regulations. There are regulations, but if we were
to look at where the real issue is, it is probably more within the
guidance. That is partly why we have taken some time over schedule 36.
We wanted to get the Minister to consider those particular
points.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 629</div><a name="080610125000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that,
and notwithstanding the characterisation which tends to be the case in
these matters, we are perhaps not as strongly moved by the argument for
the affirmative resolution to apply in these particular circumstances.
I do not know whether that indicates wider expectations. I would be
grateful, however, to hear the Government&#146;s explanation of why
the particular procedures are in place, as opposed to something that
gives Parliament greater scrutiny, given that this is an important
schedule with important
powers.</div><a name="080610125000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000428"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I do not intend to rehearse the usual arguments.
Although the Opposition parties&#146; complaints are habitual, they
are none the less heartfelt. In particular, there is good reason to
explain why there are three regulation-making powers in schedule 36.
The first, in paragraph 21 allows commissioners to make regulations
about the procedures for the first-tier tribunal to resolve disputes
over whether information or a document is privileged. The regulations
represent an additional safeguard for taxpayers and provide a clear
framework to resolve such disputes, which does not currently exist for
taxation. The regulations will simply relate to procedural
matters.</div>
<a name="080610125000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 58
contains another regulation-making power that will allow commissioners
to make regulations to specify particular activities as a
&#147;business&#148;. Primary legislation already sets out some
activities to be considered businesses, and the consequences in
relation to inspection powers. The regulation-making power will enable
more detail to be provided&#151;as I indicated when we discussed
these matters in greater detail earlier&#151;particularly for new or
unusual activities. The negative resolution procedure is appropriate
for each of those regulation-making powers because of their narrow
scope and because they will provide greater clarity and safeguards for
taxpayers.</div><a name="080610125000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third regulation-making power, in paragraph 39, allows the Treasury to
revalorise the level of penalties for failing to comply with an
information notice in line with the value of money. That is standard
wording for revalorisation provisions, which are customarily dealt with
through the negative resolution procedure. I do not believe that there
is any good reason to act differently in this case. Using the
affirmative resolution procedure for any of those provisions would run
contrary to the normal practice for tax matters. I have not been
persuaded by the hon. Member for Taunton, and I hope that he will
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="080610125000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000429"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
said, we are trying to strike a balance between, on the one hand, an
HMRC empowered to do its job on behalf of taxpayers in order to
maximise the revenue accruing to the Government through entirely
legitimate and legal procedures, and on the other safeguarding the
rights of the individual. The lengthy and detailed scrutiny of this
part of the Bill has been extremely useful, precisely because it is so
important to strike the right balance. I am keen to see
Parliament&#146;s powers extended, so that it can continue to
scrutinise in great detail any future changes. However, I accept that I
am unlikely to persuade the Government of the merits of that case. On
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080610125000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

nature, but I thought that it would be helpful if she could briefly
describe the significance of changing the references to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000457"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Thank you, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="080610125000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are several parts to clause 109, which is about computer records.
Subsection (1)</div>
<a name="080610125000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requires a
person to produce a document or cause a document to be
produced&#148;,</div><a name="080610125000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is perfectly reasonable. It also</div>
<a name="080610125000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requires a
person to permit the Commissioners or an officer of Revenue and
Customs...to
inspect&#148;</div><a name="080610125000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">or,
more
importantly,</div><a name="080610125000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
make or take copies of or extracts from or remove a
document&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
necessitates access to the computer, which is described later in the
clause.</div><a name="080610125000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) refers to a provision applying
if</div><a name="080610125000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
reference in the provision to a copy of a document were a reference to
anything onto which information recorded in the document has been
copied, by whatever means and whether directly or
indirectly.&#148;</div><a name="080610125000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall return to that in a
moment.</div><a name="080610125000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3)
states:</div><a name="080610125000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
authorised person may, at any reasonable time...check the
operation of, any computer and any associated apparatus or
material...in connection with a relevant
document.&#148;</div><a name="080610125000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
problem is that, if the document is an e-mail, or an attachment to an
e-mail, sent by a web mail service on a web server hosted overseas, or
if the document is a web page or a page on a web-enabled application,
again on an overseas-hosted web server, I am not sure how any of that
can be done, particularly in respect of subsection (3), which allows
the person to
check</div><a name="080610125000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
computer and any associated
apparatus&#148;</div><a name="080610125000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
order, for example, to remove the
document.</div><a name="080610125000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me directly to amendment No. 229, which is extraordinarily wide,
in that
it</div><a name="080610125000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;makes
any other provision in connection with a
requirement&#148;</div><a name="080610125000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">related
to the person who produced the document or caused it to be produced, or
the commissioners or an officer making or taking copies of or extracts
from or removing the document. I am not sure how enforceable that will
be, particularly in the case of the examples that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 632</div>I gave, which would seem to introduce a degree of extra-territoriality
in the clause itself and, further, in any other provision being made in
connection with something that is extra-territorial and may be
completely
unenforceable.</div><a name="080610125000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to the effect of amendment No. 229 on subsection (5), which
states:</div><a name="080610125000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
authorised person may require...the person by whom or on whose
behalf the computer is or has been so
used&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may be reasonable if the computer is accessible, but subsection (5)(b)
refers
to</div><a name="080610125000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
person having charge of, or otherwise concerned with the operation of,
the computer, apparatus or
material.&#148;</div><a name="080610125000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
amendment No. 229, which is about making any other provision to have
access to remove a document from a person in subsection (5)</div>
<a name="080610125000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;having charge
of, or otherwise
concerned&#148;,</div><a name="080610125000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">brings
into play innocent third parties, because presumably the clause is
about licences and software as well as kit. Assuming that it is
accessible and that it is not extra-territorial, it brings into play
operations people, communications people, third-party maintenance
people and so
on.</div><a name="080610125000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a final issue with the clause. The document could have been created
on a handheld device like a BlackBerry, which is deemed to be a
computer, or it could be an attachment to an e-mail created on a
handheld device, and that handheld device is no longer used by the
taxpayer but someone has charge of it&#151;perhaps a sales rep for
the same company based overseas on secondment for three or four months.
Amendment No. 229 would allow &#147;any other provision&#148; to be
made in connection with removing a document from a
&#147;computer&#148; when it is completely inaccessible and may be
overseas. Clause 109 in general is right, but amendment No. 229 allows
almost anything to happen and I am concerned that it is too wide. There
is also an issue of extra-territoriality, given that servers can be
hosted almost anywhere and are not necessarily in the same jurisdiction
as the person or the jurisdiction where the document was
created.</div><a name="080610125000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 229 risks widening the scope of investigating people involved to
include innocent third parties. It is also unenforceable.
Notwithstanding the depth and breadth of clause 109, I am interested in
whether the Minister thinks that amendment No. 299,
which</div><a name="080610125000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;makes
any other provision in connection
with&#148;</div><a name="080610125000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">taking
or making copies and extracting or removing documents
from</div><a name="080610125000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
computer and any associated
apparatus&#148;,</div><a name="080610125000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
enforceable. Having read amendment No. 229, I do not think that it can
be done, other than through the normal judicial channels of seeking
warrants in third-party countries if a web server happens to be hosted
elsewhere. I am not sure that the amendment, which would allow
other provisions to be made, is not so wide that it undermines and
removes the assurances that the Minister gave in debates this morning,
particularly in relation to domestic premises that were not business
premises that might normally have been searched for
documents.</div><a name="080610125000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that makes sense. I have been as clear as I can be. I look
forward to hearing the
Minister.</div><a name="080610125000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610125000458"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div><a name="080610125000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000459"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the hon. Member for Braintree, can
I say that I shall certainly allow a reasonable debate on Government
amendment No. 229? However, I should like to debate that in full, put
the question on it and then, with the Committee&#146;s leave and
permission, put the question on Government amendments Nos. 230 to 233
together. I hope that I have the Committee&#146;s permission to do
that.</div><a name="080610125000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
the way, since I like to be helpful, there may be two Divisions in the
Chamber at 6.30 pm and, with a quarter of an hour for each Division,
that could take us up to 7 pm. It is not for me to limit or restrict
the debate in this Public Bill Committee, but perhaps in the next few
minutes the usual channels might intimate to the Chair what their plans
are for the sitting this
afternoon.</div><a name="080610125000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000460"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, for probably indulging
me in what I am about to say. I am thinking in a similar vein to the
hon. Member for Dundee, East, because I feel that there are a number of
issues that Government amendments Nos. 229 and 230 to 234 do not
address. Like the hon. Gentleman, I, too, have a problem with clause
109(3), which I will get
to.</div><a name="080610125000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob
Marris) is not in the room, because his knowledge of background notes
is always appreciated in situations such as this. The background note
to clause 109 suggests that it is concerned with the standardisation
of, rather than with substantive changes to, existing provisions. The
note mentions explicitly the review of powers, deterrents and
safeguards that were set up during the amalgamation of the Inland
Revenue with HM Customs and Excise. However, there is no mention of the
many reviews pending into data security, which form the real background
to the clause and are a real cause for concern among members of the
public and their professional
advisers.</div><a name="080610125000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="080610125000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
midsummer approaches we are still waiting for Keiran Pointer&#146;s
final report on HMRC data loss, promised in the spring, but kicked into
touch amid the Prime Minister&#146;s superabundance of bad news.
Likewise, we are still waiting for the final review of the Cabinet
Office report, &#147;Data Handling Procedures in Government&#148;
promised in spring, but also missing in action. The interim report
notes:</div><a name="080610125000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is clear that more can be done to improve trust and confidence about
the arrangements in place to protect information in Government...
As a first step, Government should commit to enhanced transparency with
Parliament and the public about action to safeguard information and the
results of that
action.&#148;</div><a name="080610125000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
Parliament and the public are still waiting. Also in the pipeline is
the report by Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, and Mark
Walport of the Wellcome Trust. Meanwhile, Sir Edmund Burton&#146;s
review and recommendations into the MOD&#146;s loss of laptops is as
absent as its
subject.</div><a name="080610125000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mention all that to question whether this is an appropriate time for a
standardisation of HMRC&#146;s access to computer data, considering
that its procedures have already been visibly shown to be inadequate.
The Government are pursuing the Government&#146;s favourite tactic of
conducting a review into everything in order to stave off having to do
anything. But there is no sense that any of the Government&#146;s
industrious reviewing is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column634" />Column number: 634</div>feeding back into legislation such as this. At the weekend, the Home
Affairs Committee published its report into the emergence of a
surveillance society in Britain, which warned of the erosion of trust
between the citizen and the state. It noted the potential that the
relationship between the two was on the verge of being changed for
good.</div><a name="080610125000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the palpable sense that trust has been eroded, I have a couple of
questions for the Financial Secretary. The first concerns departmental
spot checks by the Information Commissioner. The Prime Minister
announced in November spot checks on departmental application of data
protection principles and data handling procedures. How far has that
process proceeded and how has the Information Commissioner specifically
looked into HMRC&#146;s capacity to handle that kind of computer
access situation authorised under the
clause?</div><a name="080610125000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question concerns the Cabinet Office interim report on
&#147;Data Handling Procedures in Government&#148;. Paragraph 31,
which covers HMRC,
states:</div><a name="080610125000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Specific
actions already taken include the appointment of a senior official,
Director of Data Security, and the appointment of Data Guardians to all
areas within
HMRC.&#148;</div><a name="080610125000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet
I see no provisions in the clause relating to oversight by the director
of data security or the detailed role of data guardians in the
operations of these powers. Nor is there an explicit role for the
Information Commissioner, despite the Cabinet Office&#146;s report
also suggesting that legislative steps should be taken to enhance the
ability of the Information Commissioner to provide external scrutiny of
arrangements.</div><a name="080610125000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Dundee, East, whom I should like to address as an hon.
Friend but cannot for technical reasons, talked about subsection (3).
It simply takes us back to the territory of any &#147;authorised
person&#148; having a right of access to</div>
<a name="080610125000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any computer
and any associated
apparatus&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know from my own experience in the private sector that we took our data
security very seriously indeed because, if we had not, we would very
likely have been sued. I can well imagine that IT managers are not at
all pleased with the idea of undisclosed and unidentified, but
nevertheless &#147;authorised persons&#148;, being able to root
through their systems at will. That would be the position of a member
of staff who provided &#147;reasonable assistance&#148; to an
authorised person.</div>
<a name="080610125000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000461"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> There is another issue here. Because the clause
talks about apparatus, if one considers best practice in backing up
systems and saving data, I can imagine a company or an IT manager being
seriously unhappy if a Revenue officer arrived and said, &#147;I am
taking away all the back-ups to your system because we believe that
somewhere on this in the last six months is a document that we need to
see but we are not sure precisely what day you saved it on.&#148;
What would happen if there was a catastrophic system failure, the data
were in the depths of the HMRC, the system could not be reloaded and
the company ceased being able to trade and began to lose
money?</div><a name="080610125000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000462"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> As always, the hon. Gentleman raises an important
point. People such as him and me, who work in the private sector,
understand the practicalities that the Government have failed to
address in their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div>amendments Nos. 229 and 230 to 234. There are, perhaps, weaknesses in
how they are dealing with issues that have been raised in relation to
clause 109. Even if the clause were urgently needed to standardise and
consolidate HMRC&#146;s procedures, could not the opportunity have
been taken to embed specific provisions on oversight by the Information
Commissioner?</div><a name="080610125000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point is about the emergence of a two-tier system of data
security within HMRC. Members of the Committee know that our tax
affairs, as Members of Parliament, are looked after by two very helpful
ladies who work for HMRC&#146;s public department 1 near Cardiff. The
interesting thing about public department 1 is that one lot of its
computer records is apparently inaccessible by other authorised persons
within HMRC. I believe that colleagues who were on a Select Committee
visit to another part of HMRC once tried to look up their details but
found that the request was blocked. It seems that even in the tax
inspectors&#146; world, some are more equal than others.</div>
<a name="080610125000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two-tier
arrangement was also brought to light by my hon. Friend the Member for
Blaby (Mr. Robathan) in Treasury questions some months ago,
when he discovered that Members of Parliament cannot submit their tax
returns online like mere mortals because the system is not deemed
appropriate for us. The Financial Secretary
said:</div><a name="080610125000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are categories of individual for whom security is a higher
priority.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 24 January 2008; Vol.
470, c. 1626.]</div>
<a name="080610125000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pursue this line of
argument because if there are categories of person for whom security is
a higher priority, surely there are also categories of business or
transaction that require tighter security. I do not want to try your
patience, Sir Nicholas&#151;I am just finishing. Will the Financial
Secretary clarify whether there will be similar gradations of risk in
the way in which the powers in clause 109 are exercised? Will
particularly sensitive businesses or records held by those businesses
warrant scrutiny by a more thoroughly vetted authorised person, or will
the system be one size fits all? Thank you for your indulgence, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="080610125000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000463"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the Financial Secretary to speak,

said then, but I think that it might have been to the
advantage of the  Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000466"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. Amendment No.
190 stands in glorious isolation to be considered separately, but would
it be helpful to pile it in with what we are discussing, as well as the
clause stand part debate, so that everything can be debated in one big
go?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div><a name="080610125000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000467"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am most grateful to the hon. Member for
Taunton for that suggestion, but we have had a pretty major debate
already and I would therefore be reluctant to include the amendment at
this late
stage.</div><a name="080610125000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000468"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. In my opening
remarks I raised a technical point and sought clarification from the
Minister. There are significant issues to do with clause 109, including
representations that have been made by professional bodies such as the
Law Society, that have not yet been addressed. I do not think that a
lengthy debate is necessary, but I think it would benefit the Committee
to debate those issues if we could have that opportunity. Of course,
your wisdom is not to be
doubted.</div><a name="080610125000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000469"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Of course, if there is a demand for a stand-part
debate, I am obliged to find time for it. If there is one, I hope it
will be extremely brief and if there is any way that the hon.
Gentleman, during the remarks the Minister is about to make, can seek
clarification by way of intervention on one or more points, I am sure
the Minister would be very happy to deal with it. Let us see how the
debate
proceeds.</div><a name="080610125000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000470"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I was conscious of the
fact that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire had indicated he
hoped for such a debate and I was trying to structure what I was going
to say accordingly, but I will try to answer all the points that have
been raised in the debate so far, which I thought was particularly well
developed by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. He raised a number of
very valid questions and I will seek to deal with those as far as I am
able.</div><a name="080610125000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the more general points raised by the hon. Member for Braintree, I do
not intend to be drawn into a discussion around when we anticipate a
report from Kieran Pointer. It is very tempting to respond to some of
the details and the sweeping generalisations that he presented, but I
will resist the temptation. It may be worth noting that the Exchequer
Secretary to the Treasury tells me that information she has received
electronically indicates that right at this moment there is a story
running that 38,000 customers of the firm Cotton Traders have had their
credit card details stolen by somebody who has hacked into its website.
The kind of security breach that we saw at HMRC is not, sadly, as rare
as it should be, but the responsibility on organisations that hold
data, particularly data as important as an individual&#146;s
financial information, is very clear and we have made it clear that the
recent, well-publicised lapse of security at HMRC means that, for HMRC,
data security is at the forefront of everything that it does. One might
say that it should always have been so, but it certainly is
now.</div><a name="080610125000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000471"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The Minister is making a statement and has been
very open about the failings at HMRC, but there is a fundamental
distinction between the public and the private sector. Most private
sector data are kept voluntarily and the individuals who are involved
work with some sort of provider or some sort of other business. That is
in sharp contrast to data kept by the public sector which are kept on a
compulsory basis. It is for that reason that there is, and should be, a
higher barrier for data kept by the state rather than by private
companies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div><a name="080610125000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000472"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I absolutely agree with everything that the hon.
Gentleman just said and I am sure that the report we will receive
shortly will be of immense interest to the House as well as to the
public. However, the existing provisions on which this clause is based
have not given rise to security problems, there are already powers to
deal with computers in the way that this clause is describing and HMRC
staff are trained not to operate a taxpayer&#146;s computer in what
we might call a &#147;live&#148; environment, in other words, an
environment within which the data itself might be affected by the
change. The opposite of a live environment would be a safe environment
within which the data can be read, but not affected by the individual
reading it. That is in order to ensure that there is no risk of data
loss.</div><a name="080610125000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
109 explains HMRC&#146;s powers where such documents are stored on
computer memory or otherwise recorded and it already applies to all
taxes, duties and other matters for which HMRC is responsible.
Amendment No. 229 responds to a point made by the Law Society to put
beyond doubt that clause 109 applies not only to enactments about
production or inspection of documents, but also to related provisions.
The effect is that, for example, the protections applying to documents
that we have already discussed in part 4 of schedule 36 also apply to
electronically held equivalents of those documents. The intention is
that the protections that apply to those documents also apply to their
electronic equivalents. Amendment No. 229 makes that
clear.</div><a name="080610125000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="080610125000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Dundee, East questioned whether the provisions of
clause 109 go too wide. They do not go too wide as it sits under
legislation. For example, protections in schedule 36 apply to requests
under clause 109. He also rightly asked what would happen if an
individual&#146;s documents were created or held on websites
maintained overseas. If the webpage can be accessed from a UK computer,
it can be accessed under the power, as long as it is classified as a
relevant document in a taxpayer&#146;s power and possession. We have
discussed how &#147;relevant&#148; would be
defined.</div><a name="080610125000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000473"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> That comes to the nub of the matter. The document
is no longer accessible on a computer in the UK, but remains in cache
memory somewhere on a web server hosted halfway round the world. Clause
109(3) appears to give authorised people entitlement to check that
computer, and the amendment would certainly allow any other provision
to do that to be made. That is extra-territorial, unenforceable and
possibly illegal. I wonder why we have an amendment that would allow
nominally something to happen that could not be
done.</div><a name="080610125000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000474"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I have no reason to believe, from the advice that
I have received, that that is not doable, as the hon. Gentleman
suggests. I will respond to one or two of his points. Again, there is
the tendency to dismiss the role of an authorised person. An authorised
person will usually be a HMRC employer who has received appropriate
training in information technology. HMRC also has a specialist team
available to give advice. Electronic records are no different to paper
records when it comes to boundaries and borders. For example, if a
taxpayer keeps records in New Zealand, but those records relate to
their UK tax affairs, HMRC can ask to see them. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>the electronic record is stored offshore but forms part of a UK
taxpayer&#146;s records, HMRC can see it. HMRC already has those
powers. Officers will not access taxpayers&#146; computers
willy-nilly. They will only do so to view documents needed to check a
tax position. Computers will only be removed for forensic examination
in a case being considered for criminal prosecution. I hope that that
gives some reassurance to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="080610125000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 230 to 234 correct a drafting error in that subsections (2) and
(3) refer to provisions to which the clause applies. The amendments are
necessary to ensure that the provision works as
intended.</div><a name="080610125000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make one final point regarding the hon. Gentleman&#146; very real
concerns. HMRC officers can travel abroad only with the agreement of
another country&#146;s tax authority. Otherwise, HMRC has to ask
another country to use its power to access the information. I hope that
he will accept that the process is highly regulated and subject to
scrutiny.</div><a name="080610125000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that there will be a further debate, if members seek to
catch your eye, Sir Nicholas, so I will curtail my comments. I hope
that I have sufficiently answered the questions on our amendments to
the
clause.</div><a name="080610125000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000475"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 190, in clause
109, page 69, line 24, leave out
from first &#145;is&#146; to end of line 26 and insert</div>
<a name="080610125000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;an officer of
Revenue and
Customs,&#146;.</div><a name="080610125000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the wider points that I wished to make about the drafting of the
clause have already been touched upon, so I shall make a concise
contribution. The amendment would change the definition of an
&#147;authorised person&#148; in subsection (9), so that instead of
the commissioners being able to authorise a class of person, which
would mean that they could allow anyone, even outside contractors or
untrained individuals, to undertake the work in question, only an
officer of Revenue and Customs could access and inspect
information.</div>
<a name="080610125000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment, as I am sure is obvious to the Committee, is to
define more tightly the category of people who will be able to access
potentially sensitive information. My view, and that of my colleagues,
is that that would go a long way towards addressing many of the
concerns that people have rightly expressed about the sensitivity and
privacy of a lot of the documentation that HMRC will be examining. We
believe that it would be more appropriate for a more limited and
defined category of inspectors to have access to that
information.</div><a name="080610125000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000476"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> In light of the amendment, may I ask the Financial
Secretary why we have in the clause a definition of &#147;authorised
person&#148;, rather than of &#147;authorised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>officer&#148;, which is used in schedule 36? No doubt she will pick up
that point in responding to the hon. Member for
Taunton.</div><a name="080610125000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two practical questions. First, will any guidance be produced to
explain how the definition of &#147;authorised person&#148; will be
applied and exactly whom we are talking about? Secondly, if a taxpayer
is having their computer checked by someone performing the powers in
the clause, how will they be able to ascertain whether the
representative of HMRC or other person is an authorised person? What
comfort will the taxpayer have in those circumstances that he or she is
dealing with an authorised
person?</div><a name="080610125000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000477"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Those were thoughtful questions. The amendment
deals with a matter that I started to explain in my response to the
debate on earlier amendments. As I said, an authorised person will
usually be an HMRC employee or officer who has received appropriate
training in information technology. HMRC also has a specialist team
available for advice. However, there may be exceptional circumstances
in which it is necessary to engage a specialist agent from outside
HMRC. The clause is drafted to enable that to be done. That answers the
question why we are using the word &#147;person&#148; rather than
&#147;officer&#148;. It would apply if a taxpayer&#146;s record
keeping systems were of a kind that HMRC did not have the necessary
internal expertise to check. I can envisage a number of circumstances
in which that would happen, but it would be
rare.</div><a name="080610125000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appropriate
steps would necessarily be taken to ensure that the taxpayer was
certain of the legitimacy of the person concerned and that
confidentiality was maintained. I shall want to give some thought to
the exact question I was asked, which was how they will know that. I
will respond to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire later,
perhaps in writing if he will allow me to do so. It was a sensible
question and was rightly put. HMRC will want to be very clear about how
that legitimacy will be determined. I hope that the amendment will not
be pressed to a
vote.</div><a name="080610125000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000478"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I have some concerns about the Financial
Secretary&#146;s assurances, not just on this amendment, but
throughout the Bill. She gives them entirely in good faith, but they
rely on guidelines and the good will and decency of HMRC and its
employees, rather than on being defined in legislation. Having made
that point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="080610125000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000482"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Bearing your strictures in mind, Sir Nicholas, I
will keep my comments as short as possible. Clause 109 contains powers
for HMRC to gain access to computer records. It works on the basis that
documents stored on computers or copied to another form of electronic
media should be treated as though they are documents or copies
themselves. That seems a perfectly reasonable way to deal with the
matter.</div><a name="080610125000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) gives an authorised person powers
to</div><a name="080610125000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;obtain

associated
apparatus&#148;.</div><a name="080610125000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
does not appear to be any limitation on that power. Computer records
are equated with documents and there are protections with regard to the
production of documents, which we have been debating. However, those
protections do not appear to apply to the powers to inspect and check
the operation of computers. First, why are those protections not in
place? Secondly, is it the intention that guidance will restrict the
operation of subsection (3)? Thirdly, as she has done during the
debates on part 7, will the Financial Secretary provide some comfort to
the Committee by setting out how HMRC will operate these powers in
practice to ensure that individuals whose records are held on computer
as opposed to hard copy are not disadvantaged? I would be grateful for
the Minister&#146;s response, either now or after a few moments, when
she may have had an extended opportunity to think about these questions
and then inform the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000484"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Clause 109 forms part of a package of measures
stemming from the review of powers, and, in essence, brings together
existing provisions in two separate Acts, one applying to the former
Inland Revenue, and the other to Customs and Excise. It ensures that
documents include electronic versions of documents, and allows HMRC
access to computers holding information required for a tax check. The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked whether guidance will
follow the legislation. Indeed it will. We are bringing together two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div>existing provisions, and where existing guidance is not adequate, new or
amended guidance will be published, on which we will, of course,
consult.</div><a name="080610125000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause extends beyond schedule 36 matters and applies to other taxes,
to excise and to criminal prosecutions, hence the understandable
concerns expressed in Committee. The hon. Member for Cities of London
and Westminster sought a broader statement of the intent behind the
clause. All the safeguards in schedule 36 prevent the clause from being
used to bypass protections applying to written documents. When HMRC
wishes to gain access to computers, as opposed to written documents, I
would expect it to telephone the taxpayer and make the request, in the
way discussed earlier, and to agree a time at which to inspect or
remove the documents. In so far as it is possible, that will be done
with the co-operation of the taxpayer. Where it is not agreed, the
safeguards that we debated in earlier clauses will apply equally to the
treatment of
computers.</div><a name="080610125000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only change is to the penalty provisions. The existing law has worked
well, having first been introduced in 1985, which means that it
predates this Government. However, it is important that I say a word or
two about the penalty requirements. The Government amendments that
bring together the equivalent provisions elsewhere in legislation will
realign the separate penalties for obstructing an HMRC officer. The
maximum penalty has been set at &#163;300&#151;lower than the
previous maximums. Under the former Inland Revenue provisions, the
penalty was &#163;500, and under the Customs and Excise provisions,
obstruction or failure is a criminal offence with a penalty, on
conviction, of &#163;2,500, which is a significant sum of
money&#151;a level 4 penalty on the standards scale. A fixed penalty
is more easily understood and fits better with other HMRC fixed-penalty
provisions. In the case of a serious obstruction, it would still be
open to HMRC to prosecute under section 31 of the Commissioners for
Revenue and Customs Act 2005. It would make sense to have a single,
aligned provision dealing with access to computer records and would
represent a simplification in that the two existing provisions will be
repealed.</div><a name="080610125000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000488"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, for your guidance. I shall
try to present my comments on the four amendments in as brisk and
workmanlike a manner as
possible.</div><a name="080610125000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
37 is about record-keeping requirements. Amendment No. 294 relates to
the provisions contained in paragraph 2(4), which allow commissioners
for HMRC to make regulations specifying additional records and
supporting documents that are to be kept and preserved. The concern
that we have&#151;this will run through my comments on the other
amendments&#151;is whether Parliament is surrendering too much power
in the
circumstances.</div><a name="080610125000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern in respect of paragraph 2(4) is that if powers are given to
make regulations to impose enhanced record-keeping requirements, those
powers should be limited. I believe that the intention behind the
powers is to have enhanced record-keeping requirements relating to
missing trader intra-Community fraud, which is an important issue. We
do not for a moment want to impede the Government&#146;s desire to
tackle MTIC fraud. However, if that is the concern, the provisions
should be limited to that area. Hence, amendment No. 294, which was
proposed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, would make the
additional requirements that may be produced through regulation more
specific. In essence, it would limit them to VAT
matters.</div><a name="080610125000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 191 was tabled by the Liberal Democrats, and I have no doubt that
the hon. Member for Taunton will speak on it. We are sympathetic to it
because it would address the power that schedule 37 gives HMRC
to</div><a name="080610125000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
provision by reference to things specified in a notice published
by...Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in accordance with
the regulations&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column643" />Column number: 643</div><a name="080610125000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are discussing regulations that will not be made by Parliament, whether
through affirmative or negative resolution, but, as far as one can see,
simply through guidance produced by HMRC. There will be no opportunity
for Parliament to scrutinise them in those
circumstances.</div><a name="080610125000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a practical concern for taxpayers who are seeking to comply
with their record-keeping requirements. Where those requirements are
changed simply in relation to HMRC guidance, it will be increasingly
difficult for taxpayers and professional advisers to monitor what those
changes might be, so this is not purely about parliamentary
accountability. The Minister may be able to address those
concerns.</div><a name="080610125000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
practical point must be borne in mind. Amendments Nos. 275 and 276
relate to further powers under schedule 37 and both would require a
resolution to be made under the affirmative procedure. During this
debate, we have not taken a dogmatic approach on whether affirmative or
negative resolution should be in place, but we would like to test the
Government&#146;s position on those matters. We look forward to
hearing what the Minister
says.</div><a name="080610125000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000489"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Amendment No. 191 is in my name and that of my
hon. Friends. We are concerned that the provisions in schedule 37
provide too much power for HMRC. For example, paragraph 2 allows HMRC
to make regulations, but for reasons of certainty and scrutiny that
should be done by Parliament. Without the amendment, the provision
would amount to tertiary legislation. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, among other bodies, has indicated
that that would allow HMRC guidance booklets to be considered as
legislation, creating great uncertainty for the taxpayer, who will not
reasonably be able to keep up with the rules that they need to abide
by. We are concerned about that. I should be grateful for any
reassurances that the Minister can
provide.</div><a name="080610125000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000490"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It might be worth talking briefly about schedule
37 generally, so that my response to the amendments is in context. The
schedule aligns existing record-keeping rules for the main taxes:
income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and VAT. Those rules
have been the subject of extensive consultation, including draft
guidance.</div><a name="080610125000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Records
are essential both for taxpayers to make accurate returns and claims
and for HMRC to be able to check those. Where there is poor record
keeping, errors often follow. Therefore it is right that HMRC works to
promote good record keeping. However, the overall aim of the schedule
is not to add to what currently happens. We need to align and clarify
the rules across the main taxes as HMRC moves, increasingly, to new
ways of working across taxes. Representative bodies told us that
taxpayers need clarity, but that they do not want HMRC to tell them
exactly what records to keep. Instead, taxpayers should usually decide
what to keep in the light of their own circumstances. It does not
matter if the records are kept in a shoebox, so long as they are
complete.</div><a name="080610125000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
people worry that HMRC&#146;s expectations on record keeping are
unrealistic, particularly for small businesses. The hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire is right: guidance will address that matter
and consultation with the main representative bodies will be invaluable
in ensuring that the guidance is both user-friendly and
realistic.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div><a name="080610125000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been listening to the representations made by both hon. Gentleman,
They both mentioned the Institute of Chartered Accountants and I have
noted what they said about its views. The guidance published with the
consultation was produced early and welcomed by many. It is not always
possible to consult in advance, but on this occasion HMRC worked hard
to do so. The fact that it did so, and the way that it responded to
representations, has been
welcomed.</div><a name="080610125000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments concern the power to make regulations on keeping records.
HMRC will be able to specify what does and does not need to be kept.
That can be a useful way of providing clarity and can act as a taxpayer
safeguard. There is no immediate need to make regulations to give that
added clarity. We took the view that it was sensible to take the power
now, against any future need, particularly as we expect such needs to
be identified in the course of consultation on the guidance and that,
if draft regulations are needed, they will be published in advance to
allow representative bodies to make clear their
views.</div><a name="080610125000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="080610125000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 294 is an attempt to narrow the regulation-making power in the way
described. I say to the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire that
it seemed to us that that was a difficult way of doing
it&#151;linking the power to an existing power in an Act about a
different tax. We thought that if we were amending it in that way, a
more conventional route would have been to amend section 12B. The
amendment would negate the whole point of the attempt to align the
record-keeping requirements across taxes. It would also mean that HMRC
would be unable to provide clarity on what records did not need to be
kept, which is why guidance would be appropriate. It would add
unwelcome complexity, and there is concern about whether it would
provide effective future proofing, which is partly what the hon.
Gentleman is seeking to
provide.</div><a name="080610125000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 191 would remove one instance of the power to make tertiary
legislation. That power allows HMRC to use public notices to supplement
regulations and to specify records. It means that HMRC can make
decisions on routine administrative matters rather than taking up
parliamentary time. That may alarm some people, but that flexibility
allows HMRC to respond quickly to changes and it is already a familiar
feature in VAT. Regulations must be laid before HMRC can specify by
notice. The amendment would perpetuate differences between taxes. It
would hamper the alignment that is integral to the merged HMRC. It
makes sense to align here, particularly as the same records are
relevant for several different taxes.</div>
<a name="080610125000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
turn to amendments Nos. 275 and 276. The normal protocol for tax is to
use the negative resolution procedure for regulations that deal with
routine administrative matters. Affirmative resolution is usually
reserved for more contentious matters or those that directly affect the
amount of tax due&#151;for example, changing a VAT rating. The
existing VAT regulations that specify records are made under the
negative resolution procedure. Using the affirmative procedure for any
of those provisions would be contrary to the normal practice for tax
matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 645</div><a name="080610125000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
concern expressed, and I am in regular conversation with the Institute
of Chartered Accountants. I believe that the amendments are
unnecessary, although I want to keep the matter under review,
particularly if the guidance proves later to be
controversial.</div>
<a name="080610125000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000491"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I acknowledge the Minister&#146;s comments on
amendments Nos. 275 and 276, so I shall not press them. I was
interested to hear what the hon. Member for Taunton had to say about
amendment No. 191. I am still not entirely convinced by the
Government&#146;s position on the matter, based on parliamentary
scrutiny and practicality, but there we are.</div>
<a name="080610125000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note the
Minister&#146;s concern that amendment No. 294 would hamper the
direction that the Government want to take on greater harmonisation and
alignment. That shows up one of the tensions that exist within any
alignment or harmonisation project. There are certain aspects for which
the Government may seek special rules&#151;for example, relating to
VAT, as it is subject to fraud, and regulations would need to be in
place requiring particular documents to be kept as a
consequence.</div>
<a name="080610125000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure whether the Minister is saying that including the provisions of
the amendment in the Bill would hamper that or whether there would be
flexibility within the system to make specific record-keeping
requirements that would essentially apply to a particular tax because
they were seeking to tackle a particular tax fraud. I acknowledge that,
although I am not entirely convinced by that position. However, I shall
not press it to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000494"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Amendments Nos. 192 and 193 come as a joint
package. Both have the intention of ensuring that the individual
taxpayer is notified by HMRC and that a general release by HMRC is not
sufficient. If I may slightly expand, the belief that underlies both
amendments is that exemptions and conditions provided for should be
addressed to the individual taxpayer to whom they apply. That would
prevent HMRC from being allowed to use any written form available, for
example even a press release, to create limitations on the discharge of
duty.</div>
<a name="080610125000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would also require the conditions and exemptions to be
received by the taxpayer. As the legislation currently stands, HMRC is
only obliged literally to write them down. If a taxpayer is required to
follow the rules, the view of our party is that HMRC should ensure that
the taxpayer first be provided with the rules and regulations that they
are required to comply with.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 646</div><a name="080610125000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000495"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Ideally succinct. I thank the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="080610125000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000496"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Essentially, amendment No. 295 does what amendments
Nos. 192 and 193 jointly do. The arguments have been expressed by the
hon. Member for Taunton. The Institute of Chartered Accountants noted,
with regard to paragraph 3 of schedule 37, that it seems to give HMRC
wide-ranging powers to create a statutory condition by means of, for
example, a press release. Again, that raises an issue not only of
accountability but of practicality: not every taxpayer&#151;&#151;I
dare say not even every professional adviser&#151;&#151;will be
watching every HMRC press release as closely as possible. In the
circumstances, it would be preferable if this power was used
specifically for specific taxpayers rather than applying generally.
Therefore, we are most sympathetic to the Liberal Democrats&#146;
amendments and we seek the Government&#146;s views on our amendment
No.
295.</div><a name="080610125000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000497"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> This draft of the legislation aligns the rules in
this area. It does away with the need for prior approval for VAT, but
that is balanced by the power to set conditions about what is
acceptable. I have heard what has been said about press releases and
will deal with that directly. However, the only conditions that HMRC
expects to specify by this route are the current high-level ones, which
allow preservation of records by any method as long as it captures all
the information needed for a tax return. The information needs to be
available in a legible
form.</div><a name="080610125000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that I take the opportunity to put on record that these
conditions will not be in a press release. A press release is a
temporary format. It is very important that the conditions be
highlighted in a public notice, and these conditions are fundamental.
It is quite right that they need to be publicised to all taxpayers. If
these amendments were made, HMRC could not put the conditions in a
notice. Instead, it would have to write to each individual taxpayer to
set them out. Hon. Members will agree that that would be hugely
resource-intensive and help no one. Therefore, although I acknowledge
that there is a genuine worry behind the amendments, I hope that I have
been able to address that concern in my response and that the
amendments will not be pressed to a Division at this late
stage.</div><a name="080610125000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610125000498"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The Minister has gone some way to addressing those
points and I hope that she will continue to be vigilant in the way that
she instructs both her Department and HMRC on the need to ensure that
those who are required to comply with the law know what the law is that
they are being required to comply with.</div>
<a name="080610125000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that

Gauke:</b> I shall be brief, as I have some comments to make
on the amendment in my name in relation to schedule 38. Clause 111
relates to the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes, and the point has
been made that subsection (2) contains provisions on when the measures
will come into force. We have received representations that there
should at least be a reasonable time between the making of the final
