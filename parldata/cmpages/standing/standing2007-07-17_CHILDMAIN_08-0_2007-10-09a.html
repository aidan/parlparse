Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): The Bill states that the amount of

12 per cent. if the non-resident parent has one qualifying child, 16
per cent. if they have two qualifying children and 19 per cent. if they
have three or more qualifying children. If they earn more than
&#163;800 a week, however, the amounts that they would be expected to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000248"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Yes, and 15 per cent. for three; I thank the
Minister for that. We tabled the amendment because we would like him to
explain why that reduction is necessary above the &#163;800
threshold. We do not see why the wealth of a high-earning, non-resident
parent cannot be shared with his children. In proportional terms, the
relevant amounts are small to the non-resident parent, but could make a
considerable difference to the welfare of the child.</div>
<a name="07100949000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is largely about
creating a more equitable framework, but the reduced rate for higher
earners is likely to be a bone of contention between the parent with
care and the non-resident parent, particularly if the parent with care
has a considerably lower income than the non-resident parent. I know
from personal experience that it is a bone of contention when a mother
is struggling and sees that the non-resident parent is quite wealthy
but is not sharing that wealth with their children. Will the Minister
explain how the figures for the &#163;800 threshold and the reduced
percentages were chosen? The rationale behind them certainly is not
clear to us.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000250"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The amendment proposes that there should not be a
taper, so the percentage figures that are quoted for the first
&#163;800&#151;12 per cent. for the first child, 16 per cent. for
two and 19 per cent. for three&#151;would be a flat rate. We do not
see why wealthier parents should not share that wealth with their
children, and we want to know why the &#163;800 threshold and reduced
percentages have been chosen. As far as we are aware, there is no
rationale behind
them.</div><a name="07100949000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100949000251"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I am indebted to
the hon. Member for Rochdale for tabling the amendment. There has been
a change of Government philosophy on this matter. It used always to be
the case that, however rich non-resident parents were, their children
would share in their increased income going forward. I remember that
some Labour Members strongly defended that principle when I served with
them on the Select Committee on Work and Pensions in the previous
Parliament.</div> <a name="07100949000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
hon. Gentleman was speaking, I looked at page 74 of the explanatory
notes to see whether was some explanation for the Government&#146;s
change of heart in relation to different treatment of the two groups in
terms of the percentages that apply according to their income. I did
not find much comfort. The point is an important one philosophically
and I shall listen to the Minister with interest to see whether there
is a valid justification for what he has done. The question has been
well
put.</div><a name="07100949000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000252"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I hope that I can satisfy the hon. Member for
Rochdale. Let me begin by restating our commitment to ensure that all
non-resident parents meet their financial responsibilities to their
children. The Bill changes the basic rate that applies to all gross
weekly income up to &#163;800 a week, so that, as I think he now
knows, the rate will be 12 per cent. for one qualifying child, 16 per
cent. for two and 19 per cent. for three or more. As he said, it
introduces new rates for those whose income is from &#163;800 to
&#163;3,000 a week, at which point there is a cap. He now knows that
those rates are 9, 12 and 15 per cent. respectively. The rates were
chosen with the aim of preventing a substantial change in the cash
liability for non-resident parents who move on to the new calculation
rules. That is the straightforward answer to his
question.</div><a name="07100949000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#163;800 threshold corresponds to the amount of weekly income at
which the 40 per cent. marginal income tax rate starts to apply. There
is therefore a greater difference between gross and net income at and
beyond those levels&#151;a difference that we must take into account
to ensure fairness in the proposed scheme. Without the second tier of
rates, a non-resident parent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>with gross weekly earnings of &#163;2,000 would end up paying
&#163;320 a week for two children instead of &#163;282 under the
current scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West asked what
would be the cash impact of the proposal in the amendment. One way of
putting it would be to say that, if the amendment were carried, the
increase from current maintenance assessments for non-resident parents
whose income takes them into the 40 per cent. band would be &#163;64
a week for one child and &#163;88 a week for two or more
children.</div><a name="07100949000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the two percentage tiers and the &#163;800 threshold, therefore,
is to match the new calculations as closely as possible in cash terms
with the current assessments, thereby smoothing the transition. No new
dispensation and no favours are being introduced for people on higher
incomes. Instead, a level playing is being retained in relation to the
current maintenance. That has to be done, because of the move from net
to gross figures for calculation purposes.</div>
<a name="07100949000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100949000253"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I have two quick questions
that follow on from the Minister&#146;s very clear explanation of
what is going on. The first is whether he could give the Committee any
measure of the distribution of winners and losers under his formula.
What are the limits at which somebody to whom the current formula is
applied and who transfers to the new formula will or will not be
significantly affected, as far as the number or percentage change in
the assessment are concerned?</div>
<a name="07100949000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second question is bound to
be in our minds after the Chancellor&#146;s announcement of his
pre-Budget report today. Tax rates can, of course, change. Has the
Minister made any provision&#151;I do not detect one&#151;for scope
to alter the percentages if material circumstances alter? He might say
that that is a done deal now&#151;that we are on a gross rate and
that so it will be for the future. However, is not such a power at
least worth
consideration?</div><a name="07100949000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000254"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those two points.
He asked first about a table of winners and losers. As far as I can
recall, we published indicative figures on that. I do not have them in
front of me, but the cash alteration on the illustrations that we have
given is marginal in all cases. There are some slight
&#147;ups&#148; and some slight &#147;downs&#148;, which is
inevitable if a percentage basis is used.</div>
<a name="07100949000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
second question was why the percentage figures are expressly in the
Bill and what happens if tax rates change. It is not so much a change
in marginal tax rates that would have an impact; it is the threshold
between the two. There is provision whereby if that were to
change&#151;for example, if a Chancellor were substantially to alter
the point at which 40 per cent. marginal rates became
applicable&#151; regulations could be made to change the threshold
point in line with any alteration that had been made in the Budget in
respect of the 40 per cent. band. That would keep it consistent and the
facility would be there to make the necessary
change.</div><a name="07100949000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same
time as introducing these new rates of calculation, we also propose to
increase the maximum weekly outcome to be taken into account from
&#163;2,000 to &#163;3,000, ensuring that higher earning
non-resident 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>parents do not unfairly benefit from the shift to calculations based on
gross income from net. We want to ensure that parents do not end up
paying far more than under the current scheme, that parents with care
do not receive far less, and that the movement of existing cases to the
new calculation rules is as supportive and seamless as possible. If
there were to be dramatic cash differences, it would inevitably cause
friction in those transfers, which is not what we want to see. We want
to ensure that there is relative equality in the cash amounts that
parents with care and non-resident parents are paying as the system
transfers from one formula to the other.</div>
<a name="07100949000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100949000255"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): Briefly, will the
Minister confirm that the current rules that enable a variation in
special expenses if a child has special needs will also be available
under the new proposals to ensure that disabled children are properly
looked after?</div>
<a name="07100949000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000256"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b><b class="B"> </b>I think that I am right in saying that
those rules carry through to the new scheme. If that is incorrect, I
will come back to it.</div>
<a name="07100949000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said to the hon. Member
for Daventry, we will continue to review the rates of calculation
during the course of each Parliament and reclaim the power to amend
them by regulation. That enables any changes that are deemed necessary
to be made more easily as and when they are required.</div>
<a name="07100949000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I discover that I will not have
to write to the hon. Member for Forest of Dean because I have a note
saying that I was right.</div>
<a name="07100949000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the hon. Member for
Rochdale to withdraw his

leave out that section to probe the Government&#146;s thinking as to
why they are seeking to increase the minimum amount from &#163;5 to
&#163;7. Also, it aims to uncover the justification for the figures.
In percentage terms, to go from &#163;5 to &#163;7 is a significant
leap. Is that leap because the &#163;5 figure has not risen for some
time? If that is the case and Ministers feel that it is important to
have a minimum payment going forward that keeps pace with inflationary
changes, do they intend to ensure that that figure continues to be
increased in future years as circumstances continue to change? What
assessment has been made about the impact of such a change? Obviously,
the minimum 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>figure applies particularly to people on very low incomes and
non-resident parents on very low incomes, such as those taxed on
benefit, for example.</div>
<a name="07100949000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has the Minister made any
assessment of the impact that the change will have on poverty, child
poverty and poverty of working-age people who may be paying a higher
level of reduced rate? If he has not conducted such an assessment, does
he intend to ask his officials to do so? This is an open opportunity
for him to explain his thinking, to reassure us that there is a
consistent and logical basis behind the proposed increase, and to
reassure us that the impact that it might have on poverty has been
properly thought
through.</div><a name="07100949000043"></a>

Selous:</b> I have one brief question relating to the
amendment and paragraph 4 of schedule 4, dealing with the minimum
payment, which the Bill seems to be increasing from &#163;5 to
&#163;7. Among the people excluded from having to pay that &#163;7
are able-bodied students, many of whom have jobs to support themselves,
which is not unreasonable. We expect many students going through
universities and colleges to work to some degree. However, all of us
are fully committed to the battle to change the culture, so that change
can really happen. I wonder whether the provision sends the wrong
signal to the student population at large. Someone who is the father of
a child while at college or university and is able-bodied and able to
help out in the union bar in the evenings or to stack shelves in
addition to completing his studies might, as a minimum, be required to
pay the &#163;7 referred to in schedule 4, which is the subject of
amendment No.

Bedfordshire because of my former involvement as Minister responsible
for students, to express an interest in his
point.</div><a name="07100949000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, on a
general point, part of this provision is to give at least a continuing
relationship to ensure that people are not disappearing from the map
and that there is an obligation to pay some maintenance. That is an
important point with analogies to the student loan scheme, where people
may be required in certain cases to pay a minimum even if they do not
have to pay more than a
minimum.</div><a name="07100949000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, my
hon. Friend&#146;s point about students was well made, because it is
now common&#151;although I will not say universal&#151;for students
to work for 15 hours a week. Bodies like Universities UK normally
advise students that working up to that level is acceptable, but if a
full-time student works above 20 hours it is not acceptable. I suspect
that this provision&#146;s exemption for students may reflect the
fact that, historically, we have always said that student support was
discrete and separate from the benefits system. This is, in a sense, a
piece of private law adjusting the relationship between two persons
with the Department acting, perhaps, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>the intermediary. It is at least worth the Minister&#146;s
reconsidering this provision, without pressing him to a final
conclusion on the
matter.</div><a name="07100949000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000263"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I thank the hon. Members for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey and for Rochdale for tabling the amendment. I
welcome back the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey; it is nice to see him
here.</div><a name="07100949000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me first
restate our firm belief that it is important that parents support their
children even when they have a comparatively low income. I shall come
back to that point. A flat rate that is applicable to non-resident
parents in receipt of benefits or with a very low income is the best
way to ensure that these important responsibilities are met, while
keeping payments at a level that low-income, non-resident parents can
afford.</div> <a name="07100949000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked me specifically to comment on why the figure of
&#163;7 is in the schedule. It is important to remember that the
&#163;5 figure was introduced by Parliament in 2000 and has not been
increased since then, so it has remained at a flat rate of &#163;5
for seven years. In looking into this matter, we have taken into
account increases in benefit rates since 2000 and have been bearing in
mind that the full application of the schedule does not come into
effect until 2010-11, at which time it will be introduced in a phased
transition that will not be complete until
2013.</div><a name="07100949000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking into
account increases in benefit rates that have already taken place and
those that it is reasonable to assume will take place before the
measure has full effect, using the inflation forecasts and nothing
else, we come to the figure of &#163;7. This is about retaining the
real value of the &#163;5 that was introduced by Parliament in 2000
and maintaining a level amount as regards the proportion of income for
someone who is on benefit. Exactly the same percentage proportion moves
to that cash amount by the time that the measure is fully
applicable.</div><a name="07100949000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000264"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation, which seems very
rational.</div><a name="07100949000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000265"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I
am.</div><a name="07100949000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000266"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Occasionally. Given that the rating has been
allowed to fall behind inflation over the years, will the Minister
comment on the Government&#146;s intentions from 2011 onwards, as
regards further updating the figure.</div>
<a name="07100949000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000267"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I was just coming to that. When the hon.
Gentleman was speaking to the amendment he suggested that there might
be an annual uprating. A 2 per cent. inflation adjustment is a small
cash adjustment, and it is not worth taking the detail of regulations
and all the recalculations of amounts through on an annual basis when
the cash change is so small. The Government envisage assessing the
rating in each Parliament and keeping it in line that way, which is a
sensible compromise between ensuring that it keeps pace with the real
value while at the same time not overly complicating the system and
introducing new annual calculations for timed changes in
payments.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div><a name="07100949000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000268"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I endorse what the Minister says and I encourage
him wherever possible on this sort of occasion to go for a flat rate
because it is much more intelligible. I can report to him that quite
apart from recent political events that might have made things even
more radical, I look forward to the receipt of the retirement pension
in about eight weeks&#146; time. We are about to have a deeply
ontological argument about the entitlement to 49 pence a week, and it
is one of those things where one is anxious that it should be got
right, but it is a waste of time not to have something that is
straightforward and intelligible to people wherever
possible.</div>
<a name="07100949000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000269"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I think that those were words of support and I
will take them as such, with appreciation as
always.</div><a name="07100949000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Students who
are currently exempted or zero-rated for maintenance were mentioned.
There is an issue here, and I am interested in the view put by the hon.
Member for South-West Bedfordshire, because we are trying to address a
matter of responsibility. I am prepared to look again at that
matter&#151;probably not within the context of the Bill, however, but
it does need to be examined. There is a whole variety of students in
very different circumstances. All I will say at this point is that the
issue merits further consideration. I do not want to go further than
that, but in view of the principle of responsibility that we are trying
to establish, it is something that I was already minded to examine.
With that in mind, I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey will withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="07100949000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000270"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his answers
and explanation. He did not address the point about assessments in
relation to poverty, but that may be something that we can pick up at a
later stage. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="07100949000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000273"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> We move onto another important part of the Bill.
It is a thorny topic and one that it is important to get right for the
success of the Bill and for the general welfare of the children of
separated couples throughout the country&#151;it is the issue of
shared care.</div>
<a name="07100949000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 116 is a probing
amendment. It would delete the three paragraphs in schedule 4 that deal
with shared care. It is worth briefly re-capping the current
provisions, in that the Child Support Act 1991 allows the non-resident
parent&#146;s child maintenance liability to be
reduced:</div><a name="07100949000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the care of a qualifying child is
shared&#148;.</div><a name="07100949000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
allow a reduction where the care is, or is to be, shared.</div>
<a name="07100949000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the new scheme introduced
by schedule 4, child maintenance will be fixed for a 12-month period,
and at the point when the liability is fixed, shared care arrangements,
which in this context are interpreted as the child staying overnight
with the other parent, may not have started. Unless the rules are
changed, that could lead to a situation in which the non-resident
parent&#146;s liability takes no account of actual shared care
arrangements for the first 12 months, so I understand the need for the
particular paragraphs under discussion. The Bill therefore allows a
reduction in child maintenance liability in anticipation of future
shared care arrangements during the period of assessment, but that in
and of itself obviously raises a number of questions worthy of debate
and on which I would seek the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="07100949000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the thrust of the Bill is to encourage as many parents as possible to
take the voluntary arrangement route, it means that the parents going
to CMEC will be those who have more contentious problems and who find
it more difficult to agree. It is therefore reasonable to assume that
those parents are more likely to be in touch on a range of issues,
including the all-important one of contact.</div>
<a name="07100949000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">How will the commission
determine whether the care of the child is to be shared? How will the
extent to which the couple agree about shared care arrangements and the
robustness of that agreement be determined? What help, if any, will
parents get in reaching an agreement on shared care? What additional
support for separating parents do the Government, through the
Minister&#146;s Department or the Department for Children, Schools
and Families, propose to help them to reach agreement on contact
arrangements and maintenance?</div>
<a name="07100949000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to take the Minister
back to Australia again. He will probably not thank me for that but it
is important to make him aware that the family relationship centres in
Australia have been &#147;swamped&#148;&#151;it is their
word&#151;by the demand from separating parents seeking help, support
and guidance. I urge him to ask his officials to make contact with the
Australian CSA on that point. The main objective of the family
relationship centres is to do more preventive work to help to prevent
couples in relationships and marriages from breaking apart in the first
place, and I heartily support that work.</div>
<a name="07100949000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also part of the remit of
family relationship centres to provide help for separating couples to
ensure that the arrangements for contact with children are as civilised
as possible and to help to provide support, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>education, advice and assistance, perhaps even bringing in the
grandparents and so on. It is that part of the service that has
experienced massive demand. We need to learn from that and to ensure
that the arrangements in place in the UK are put into place in the
light of the Australian
experience.</div><a name="07100949000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to know what avenues will be open to either parent when the
contact agreement that formed the basis of the child maintenance
calculation has either broken down or been altered by agreement. Will
there be any grounds for a supersession when the parent with care and
the child are losing out financially because the non-resident parent is
not providing shared care on the basis represented to the commission?
The Minister is very keen to have 12-month financial agreements for
shared care. I understand the haunted look in his eyes about what has
gone on before; I also understand exactly where he is coming from, but
these are practical issues to which we need answers. If he does not
have all the answers now, I hope that he will agree to reflect on the
issues before Report. The Committee would take comfort from
that.</div> <a name="07100949000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some specific
questions arise from amendment No. 116. In what situations will the
commission proceed to adduce child maintenance liability based on a
prescribed assumption of shared care, and for how long will that
prescribed assumption continue? That raises another point: whether
there will be a presumption of shared care which could be rebutted by
the other parent if they chose to do
so.</div>
<a name="07100949000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="07100949000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
117 is different in nature and I shall explain to the Committee what it
means if it is not immediately obvious. At the moment there is a
presumption that children can spend two nights a week apart from the
parent with care, with no reduction in maintenance liability. That is
102 days within any year, which is 52 weekends times two.</div>
<a name="07100949000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The present rule allows that
for each night a child stays with a non-resident parent&#151;worked
out as an average over a 12-month period&#151;child maintenance
liability is reduced by one seventh. In practice, that means that there
is a strong financial link between the amount of contact and the amount
of child maintenance paid. That leads to disputes over contact
arrangements, particularly when there is already conflict and mistrust
between the parents. Under amendment No. 117 there would be no
reduction in maintenance paid if the qualifying children were spending,
on average, up to three nights a week with the non-resident
parent.</div> <a name="07100949000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously
these discussions cut both ways. There is the issue of the cost to the
non-resident parent: non-resident parents might be up in arms because
they would get less money. That is a valid argument and I accept it,
but it is outweighed by the strength of the reverse argument which says
that this would remove the financial friction between the non-resident
parent and the parent with care over getting extra nights of residence
for the child. We are effectively talking about another 52 days a year
which children could then spend with their non-resident parent. The
parent with care would not have to say, &#147;No, I do not want that
as it will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>reduce my liability,&#148; and would be more likely to agree to a week
at Christmas, a week at Easter and two weeks in the summer. I shall be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="07100949000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000274"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> How do the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments
impact upon the idea of a voluntary
arrangement?</div><a name="07100949000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000275"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Where there is a voluntary agreement it does not
come within the ambit of CMEC and parents are free to make their own
arrangements. I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making
because I made the point at the beginning of my remarks that we are
dealing with that subset of separating parents who have been unable to
reach a voluntary agreement and where there is likely to be more
conflict. I shall quote in a minute from a solicitor who specialises in
family law because she goes through some of these issues. The proposal
in amendment No. 117 would lead to a reduction in friction. It would
enable children to stay with the non-resident parent more frequently
because the parent with care, typically the mother, would not want to
have to trade handing over her children for a reduction in her
maintenance
payments.</div><a name="07100949000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000276"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point,
may I ask him how his amendment would affect those people whom we
discussed under the previous amendment who are paying the minimum
amount of maintenance? As I understand it, currently if the
non-resident parent has care for one day a week, the minimum
maintenance figure is waived because that parent is taking a degree of
responsibility. Would that be the case under his amendment,
too?</div><a name="07100949000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000277"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Gentleman has picked me up on something
that I should have mentioned. It was towards the bottom of my notes,
but I can answer his question directly. The amendment does not alter
the rules that apply when the non-resident parent is on benefit. Here
there is a fixed contribution which will go up to &#163;7 a week. The
amount is waived completely if a child stays overnight with a
non-resident parent for at least one night. Given the low income of
NRPs on benefit, it would be inappropriate to raise the shared care
threshold of three nights for that group. Therefore, that would not
affect that group. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that
point, which needs to be on the record.</div>
<a name="07100949000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new clause 10, I want to
make a number of points that were passed on to me relatively recently
by a solicitor specialising in family law and an academic who works in
the area. The solicitor, writing about cases that she had dealt with
relatively recently, stated that</div>
<a name="07100949000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the fact that child support would
be reduced once&#148;</div> <a name="07100949000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
parent with care</div> <a name="07100949000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agrees
to the children staying with their father at least one night per week
can cause a reluctance to encourage contact.&#148;</div>
<a name="07100949000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have just made that point to the
Minister.</div> <a name="07100949000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
solicitor then made an important point about the benefits system, child
benefit and tax credits&#151;it is important to link tax credits with
this discussion 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>because they have significant effects on the finances of both the parent
with care and the non-resident parent and can have a significant
bearing on the issue of shared care. She
wrote:</div><a name="07100949000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
problem with the tax credit system for these separated couples is that
tax credits are only paid to one parent and there is therefore no
recognition in the system for shared care arrangements...I
understand that tax credits are paid to the parent who claims child
benefit.&#148;</div> <a name="07100949000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
Department, that is the determining factor for deciding which parent is
the parent with care and which is the non-resident parent. We
understand that that is the key decision. The solicitor
continued:</div><a name="07100949000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
come across many fathers who may see their children up to 3 days a week
but get no financial support for them. In fact, if they are working
they could be doubly penalised by paying child support. I recall one
father in particular who was claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance and
showed a real determination and commitment to his children to maintain
a meaningful relationship with them even though their mother did what
she could to prevent it. The case, perhaps inevitably, went through
court and he was awarded shared residence of 3 nights per week. The
mother retained her child benefit and tax credits and the father
struggled to survive on his income based job seeker&#146;s allowance,
receiving no additional monies for caring for his children nearly half
the week.&#148;</div><a name="07100949000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Chope, for putting that
on the record, but I think that it is important to come down to some
individual cases.</div>
<a name="07100949000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000278"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman has highlighted an
interesting case, but clearly had the non-resident parent been in work
he would potentially have been entitled to at least some tax credits
through the working tax credits, so the system is not quite as black
and white as the hon. Gentleman is trying to make
out.</div><a name="07100949000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000279"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the father
I have just mentioned being in work is, of course, right. Nevertheless,
the facts that I have put on the record about the father being in
receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance shows how that situation is
quite unfairly skewed, given that that father had been given residence
of three nights per week by the court.</div>
<a name="07100949000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100949000280"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I am following what the hon.
Gentleman is saying with interest as I have had a similar case. One
thing that worries me slightly, however, is how income is to be
determined for tax credits when two people in separate households claim
them. It seems to me that there is a serious danger of overcomplicating
the system in that respect; there will have to be separate tax credit
applications for both parents in that
circumstance.</div><a name="07100949000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000281"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. We are certainly into
the area of complication, but we are trailing a refining of the system
for some particularly rough justice. The hon. Gentleman will have
constituents, as I will&#151;as we all will&#151;who will find
themselves quite aggrieved.</div>
<a name="07100949000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Committee will bear with
me for a few moments longer, I shall conclude shortly, but I want to
mention one other case that, again, was drawn to my attention by an
academic working in this area who is pretty exercised about the point.
He drew to my 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>attention a case where two separated parents were sharing equally the
cost of bringing up their children. The children were spending an equal
amount of time in each parent&#146;s home and the family court had
recognised their equality of rights and responsibilities by granting a
shared residence order. However, one parent was receiving almost 20 per
cent. more disposable income than the other as a result of the child
maintenance transfer even though both had identical costs and expenses
in relation to their children. The parent with care was obviously
receiving child tax credit and child benefit.</div>
<a name="07100949000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The parent with care was the
father in that case. That gentleman wrote directly to the Minister to
raise the issue and got a reply from the ministerial correspondence
unit:</div><a name="07100949000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should be borne in mind the formula is designed to reflect the ability
of both parents to contribute to the maintenance of their
children&#148;.</div><a name="07100949000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">He is quite
exercised about that and describes it as a significant
&#147;injustice&#148; about which he is concerned the Bill will do
nothing. I recognise that the issues are complicated, and that there
are fixed costs and variable costs, but the Bill is quite light in that
area. Given that we are setting up a system that we all hope will be in
place and robust for many years to come, I am not asking for detailed
answers from the Minister now. However, I ask him to go away and
reflect a little more on some of those shared-care issues, particularly
when child benefit and tax credits come in and where there is equality.
They can cut both ways for all our constituents, and we have not
considered them in sufficient detail. I would be interested to hear
what he says in response to this section of the
debate.</div>
<a name="07100949000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000282"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I failed in my earlier intervention to welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Chope. I apologise; I am delighted to
serve under your chairmanship once again. These are difficult and
complicated issues, particularly those to do with shared care. The
point that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire made towards the
end of his remarks was right: there are a great many complications from
family to family in respect of what shared care and the degrees of care
that are shared mean in terms of the financial commitment that parents
make. A variety of other costs enter into the equation, both fixed and
variable. That is why the amendments highlight an important issue. I
will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to some of
the points. I am grateful to One Parent Families, among others, for the
briefing provided for this short debate. I hope that the Minister can
provide reassurance on some of the points that the hon. Gentleman has
rightly made about the
amendments.</div><a name="07100949000216"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="07100949000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman did not particularly help the case with his comments on tax
credits and child benefit, not least because his party has been
particularly keen to highlight what has been described as the couple
penalty in the tax credit system. To have some sort of system whereby
tax credit payments are divided up on some basis seems to go against
the argument about the family that his party has
been  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>making on that point. I am not saying that it is right or wrong, but
that there is a degree of inconsistency in the points that are being
made.</div> <a name="07100949000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
approach is taken by new clause 18, which seeks to recognise the
complexities by trying to give a degree of flexibility in such issues
to the commission. It is unclear in the Bill&#151;the Minister may be
able to clarify&#151;whether instances of equal shared care, that is
50:50 or thereabouts, will require a maintenance arrangement or not.
David Henshaw&#146;s report and that of the Work and Pensions
Committee recommended that cases of 50:50 shared care should be exempt
from third-party involvement, with no provision within the child
support formula for transferring funds between parents. As a member of
that Select Committee, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare might well
choose to contribute to this debate&#151;it is a relevant
point.</div><a name="07100949000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, the
Department for Work and Pensions report entitled, &#147;Child Support
Policy: an international perspective&#148; showed that payment
obligations in many other countries, such as Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, Norway, Netherlands and France, on parents in cases of equal
shared care would be reduced to nil and that, in the majority of
countries, payments between all shared care couples would be annulled
completely regardless of disparities in parents&#146;
incomes.</div><a name="07100949000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Weston-super-Mare might wish to intervene, because I am not
sure whether that is correct, which is why we have proposed new clause
18, which would allow the commission a degree of flexibility. There is
a danger in assuming that where there is 50:50 shared care neither
parent needs any financial maintenance whatever. That does not follow.
One of the founding aims of the child support arrangements in this
country, inadequate though they have been, was that parents should have
a duty to share resources with their children when separated as when
they are married or in a
partnership.</div><a name="07100949000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100949000283"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): Given that I have been
invited twice, in tones of increasing desperation, let me outline
quickly what the Select Committee recommended on that point. The report
stated:</div><a name="07100949000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Committee recommends that the statutory child support system moves away
from the current system of overnight liabilities which causes day
counting and diary keeping by parents and constant
readjustments&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="07100949000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">this is the point about the friction
between parents with care and non-resident parents, which my hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire was making earlier. The
report
continued:</div><a name="07100949000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the Committee's view the ideal solution is that there should be an
initial agreement between the parents and C-MEC on the approximate
amount of time the children spend between the two households. This
should govern the assessment for the remainder of the year and not be
adjusted unless there are major contact changes. For arrangements with
close to 50:50 shared care the Government should consider the case put
by Sir David Henshaw for having no child support liability at all
between
parents&#148;.</div><a name="07100949000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee did not recommend necessarily that the Government should take
up that recommendation outright, because of the concerns about fixed
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>variable costs. Clearly, however, the recommendation contains a degree
of sense, which we hoped that the Government would take up. I point out
also that it was adopted unanimously in Committee, including by the
hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire, who is sitting behind the
Minister
today.</div><a name="07100949000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000284"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am glad that all of those points, including
the final one, have been put on the record.</div>
<a name="07100949000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am worried about going down
the route of saying that there should be a nil assessment in such cases
because of the point that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare made
about friction. It could equally well be the case that where not only
50:50 shared care is the most appropriate arrangement, but where there
is significant financial disparity between parents, the most sensible
arrangement cannot be reached because one parent objects on the grounds
that if they went for the shared care arrangement, the sharing of
income that should take place would not.</div>
<a name="07100949000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 18 seeks to ensure
that the commission would maintain the flexibility necessary to assess
such cases. I think that that is the right way to go, and I would be
interested to know whether the Minister agrees and, if so, whether he
feels that it should be done through the new clause, or that the Bill
contains the necessary provisions. Certainly, however, that needs to be
teased out a bit further so that he has the chance to put on the record
the Government&#146;s intentions in relation to those cases. No doubt
the commission will look to his words during our discussions on the
provision of guidance to it when it seeks to make arrangements in such
cases.</div> <a name="07100949000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that where shared care arrangements are in place&#151;be it
50:50 or a variation of that, such as 30:70 or some other
proportion&#151;there remains some ability to take into account the
financial disparity that might exist between parents, in order to
ensure financial fairness as well as fairness in relation to care. Both
those things are important in ensuring that the children, who should be
the focus of our attention, get the arrangements that are most suitable
to there
needs.</div><a name="07100949000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000285"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> Once again, I am grateful to the hon. Members
for South-West Bedfordshire and for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey for tabling the amendment. I am also grateful for the
helpful intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West
and for that of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare&#151;it was
helpful to me, but I am not sure whether it was helpful to those on his
Front Bench.</div> <a name="07100949000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
everybody acknowledges, this is a very difficult and sensitive area and
one in which we must tread with great care. I begin with some of the
thoughts that we had from the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
in moving the amendment. Listening carefully to what he said, he
demonstrated the extreme difficulty and the risks that we would take
were we to go down the road that he suggested. Let me explain why I
think that.</div> <a name="07100949000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach, there was a tendency to be rather
mechanistic about the matter. We almost arrived at a sort of daily rate
for looking after a child, and that departs from the reality in which
most separated couples live.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="07100949000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is, of course, a certain
amount of continuous cost involved in having children. However, for
most parents who have separated and who are dealing with the costs of
children, the real contentions are found on the sizable one-off costs
that arrive at intermittent intervals&#151;the school uniform, the
new shoes, and these days there are iPods and that sort of stuff. That
is where the difficulty arises, rather than the daily charge and how
much it costs to have the child at home for one day or one night. It is
not territory that I think most separated parents get into, and for
that reason I would not want to see the commission try to get into it
either, just as the CSA would not have been advised to do so. That is
one reason why we must treat the issue with considerable
care.</div><a name="07100949000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other potential danger, which it is crucial to avoid, is the risk of
turning access into a bargaining counter between separated parents. We
must do everything that we possibly can to avoid that happening, as
that would never be in the interests of the children and their
long-term upbringing or emotional stability. Those are important
warnings against some of the arguments that I think the hon. Gentleman
was using in support of his amendment. We must proceed more cautiously
in this area.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000286"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I agree with the Minister&#146;s point about not
linking access and maintenance&#151;these can be vexed issues for
non-resident parents if they are dealing with both subjects at the same
time. He is right in that, but would he acknowledge that the current
system leads to some conflict, particularly when the parent with care
does not want to see her maintenance reduced? That is quite
understandable, and I would defend her right not to see her maintenance
reduced. As the Minister helpfully outlined by way of an example, the
costs of a school uniform, new shoes, iPods and so on are probably in
most cases being borne by her, rather than by the non-resident parent,
although he may be contributing.</div>
<a name="07100949000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister acknowledge
that the present system leads to conflict? That is the experience of
family lawyers to whom I have spoken, and we should look at ways to
reduce that potential conflict&#151;something that amendment No. 117
would do.</div> <a name="07100949000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point, and I will be brief, is that I wonder whether there is scope to
look at the difference between fixed and variable costs. I quite
understand that the cost of rent, council tax and some major items are
fixed, but I wonder whether there is scope for designating some costs
as variable, which would be applicable to the non-resident
parent.</div>
<a name="07100949000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000287"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> All I can see in front of my eyes as the hon.
Member speaks is huge complexity. It really is not a route that we want
to go down. We must do everything that we possibly can to keep this as
easy to administer as possible, and I can see us going towards an
incredibly unwieldy system if we follow the route that he suggests.
That is why, in the end, we proposed no substantive change to the
shared care rules&#151;the consultation on the child maintenance
White Paper revealed no consensus among major stakeholders on any
fundamental change to the arrangement. In our view, that reflects the
fact that it is a difficult issue. Most of the issues that we have
teased out during this brief debate are finely
balanced.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="07100949000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000288"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Does the Minister accept that although there
might not have been a huge consensus on what must be done to change it,
it is not necessarily true that the current system avoids the problems
that he has described? The system of day counting and continual record
keeping both is unwieldy in itself and creates the sort of
unintentional and unwanted frictional links between access and
maintenance that he rightly says we want to avoid if we can. The
current system is not perfect by any
means.</div><a name="07100949000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000289"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I am certainly not claiming perfection for it. I
would not dream of it, because of the complexity of the matter and the
circumstances with which we are dealing. With respect, the amendments
that we have been asked to consider would not ease that situation. They
will not achieve perfection either; I think that they would make the
situation more different. We found during the consultation that people
could point to frictions arising as a result of the arrangements, but
no one could tell us what changes would overcome or resolve them. That
is the difficulty. After distilling the consultation, we came to the
conclusion after careful consideration that it is best not to make any
substantive changes. In speaking in more detail about the specific
proposals, I share try to reinforce that
point.</div><a name="07100949000217"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="07100949000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would remove all changes to schedules designed to ease the process of
making decisions about shared care. The agency has often found the
issue difficult, because information about the shared care arrangements
is of poor quality or disputed by the parents involved. The
Bill&#146;s proposed changes will assist the commission by allowing
parents to reach an agreement regarding the principles of shared care
without having to agree on the details during what can be a stressful
and uncertain time for both parents.</div>
<a name="07100949000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to reduce the
maintenance liability of non-resident parents by a set amount for up to
six months in cases where the details of shared care have not been
agreed. We believe that that period will help parents reach amicable
shared care arrangements. The reduction in maintenance liabilities will
also allow parents to get used to the level of maintenance that they
will pay or receive when a more permanent shared care agreement has
been established. The rules will allow more flexibility in the early
days of separation, so that parents are not immediately tied into a
maintenance liability under a system of fixed-term awards. By
reconsidering shared care after six months if necessary, the commission
will be able to take account more quickly of any changes to shared care
arrangements.</div><a name="07100949000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
parents can agree a pattern of shared care during or at the end of the
six-month period, the new powers will allow the commission to take
account of that agreement. If they cannot agree on the level of future
shared care, the six-month period will give the commission appropriate
time to judge existing levels of shared care and make any appropriate
reductions in maintenance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="07100949000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are continuing to investigate
the specifics of the interim shared care decision, which is not an easy
matter. When final decisions have been made, we will set them out in
regulation. The amendment would remove the advantages of the more
flexible approach and tie parents into a year-long shared care
decision, when arrangements are likely to be at their most unsettled.
That would benefit neither parents nor children and would further limit
the ability of shared care rules to work in everyone&#146;s
interests.</div><a name="07100949000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment No. 117, maintenance would not be reduced, unless the
non-resident parent cared for the child for at least 156 nights a year,
or three nights a week on average. In the 2003 scheme, about one fifth
of non-resident parents received a reduction for shared care. Where
shared care occurs, it lasts in most cases for fewer than two nights a
week. Only one in 10, or 2 per cent. of the entire caseload, cared for
their children for 156 nights a year or more. The Government&#146;s
view is that we ought to encourage shared care because children almost
always gain from the continued involvement of both their parents in
their lives, whether or not their parents live together.</div>
<a name="07100949000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reduction in maintenance
recognises that shared care invariably involves non-resident parents
incurring extra expense, which can be substantial. The rule offers a
simple and transparent incentive for non-resident parents to share
care. A higher shared-care threshold might deter many non-resident
parents from active involvement with their children, which would
clearly be to the detriment of everyone involved. A sizeable proportion
of non-resident parents have relatively modest incomes and could be
forced to choose between paying child maintenance and having their
child with them, whereas they may currently do both. Others may
question why they ought to pay full maintenance, when they already
incur significant costs in looking after their child.</div>
<a name="07100949000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government therefore
consider that the current threshold of 52 nights is correct. It
requires a level of care that many non-resident parents ought
reasonably be able to consider and prevents reductions in maintenance
for lesser amounts of care. It also means that the reduction would
apply in what is believed to be a fairly common pattern of care, namely
when a non-resident parent has their child every other
weekend.</div> <a name="07100949000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
18 would give the Secretary of State the discretion to make regulations
for the calculation of statutory child maintenance in instances of
equal shared care and enable the commission to determine what such
instances might be. However, the new clause is unnecessary, because the
scope to make regulations for such cases is given by provisions of the
Child Support Act 1991 that are not affected by the
Bill.</div><a name="07100949000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that a case of equal shared care will not feature a situation in which
a parent clearly attempts to avoid their responsibility to maintain
their child. Some have queried whether there should be a liability at
all in a case of equal shared care, a point of view reflected in Sir
David Henshaw&#146;s recommendation last year that such cases should
not be within the scope of the commission. However, there is an
opposite way in which to look at such instances. The income of the
parent with care tends to be lower than that of the non-resident parent
and, in some cases, the differences 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>could be substantial. In those situations, there might still be a case
for the non-resident parent to provide additional financial support
above what they give when the child stays with them.
The matter is not straightforward, and in such situations the
Government need first to give careful consideration to what is best for
the child and, secondly, to the most effective means by which any
outstanding needs can be met.</div>
<a name="07100949000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current incidence of equal
shared care in the agency&#146;s case load is small, and we expect it
to reduce further when all parents are free to come their own
arrangements. Many parents who have agreed how their children are to be
cared for ought to be able to agree whether there is a need for
maintenance to be paid. Accordingly, we wish to involve the commission
in arriving at the right way forward in cases of equal shared care.
Although we have made no decisions on the matter, any new provisions
will be presented in secondary legislation, which will be subject to
the affirmative procedure to give Parliament the opportunity for
scrutiny and debate. In summary, we want the shared care rules largely
to remain as they are, but we will continue to examine the details of
rules regarding cases of equal shared care.</div>
<a name="07100949000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 10 would require the
Government to publish a report, before the commission comes into being,
on whether a lower maintenance liability, either because of shared care
or another reason, results in fewer cases of actual shared care. We
have a range of evidence from research that shows that non-resident
parents strongly support the principle that time spent with children
ought to be recognised when setting maintenance rates, but there is
less support from parents with care. In addition, we are conducting a
large-scale survey that will provide much better information on current
levels of shared care, on which we expect to report in spring next
year. Our view is that it would not be possible to commission research
that provides a robust assessment of the impact of the shared care
rules on behaviour. We would be reliant on parents accurately reporting
that they had denied contact solely because of shared care rules and
would be extremely wary about the quality of information collected in
such a way. However, we will continue to review all the evidence and
work with our stakeholders to assess whether the detail of the shared
care rules can be further improved. With those reassurances, I hope
that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="07100949000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000290"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The amendment was always a probing amendment, as I
made clear at the beginning of my remarks, so I am happy to withdraw
it. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments and recognise that
the matter is complex. The hon. Member for Wirral, West, put his finger
on it when he talked about the importance of voluntary agreements, and
if I draw one conclusion from the debate it is that parents who feel
strongly and have contentious issues arising would be well advised to
go down the voluntary route so as not to be subject to the complicated
rules. I am grateful to the Minister for his response, and I shall
study his remarks carefully and reflect on how we can go forward. I beg

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000293"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall be relatively brief in moving the
amendment, although it raises a significant issue that is worth
spending a little time on. It addresses the involvement of income
from</div><a name="07100949000210"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any interest,
dividend or other income derived from
capital&#148;</div><a name="07100949000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">in maintenance
assessments. As the Committee will know, income is currently treated
differently, depending on whether it falls under the old or new scheme.
Under the 1991 Act, dividend income was taken into account by way of
the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases)
Regulations 1992, with which I know the Committee will be familiar. In
the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, however, the
definition of &#147;income&#148; was severely restricted. Under it,
the scheme defines net income specifically as earnings from employment,
income from self-employment, tax credits and other income that has been
restricted to pensions or other benefits under occupational pension
schemes and so on.</div><a name="07100949000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, both definitions will continue under the new regime.
There is no reference in the 2000 Act to interest, dividends or other
income derived from capital, as was provided for in the 1991 scheme. I
understand that such income can be considered only if applied for by
way of a variation by the parent with care. That arrangement will
continue under the Bill, which will potentially create significant
anomalies.</div> <a name="07100949000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subject of people who derive substantial income from capital but manage
to shelter it for tax purposes has been debated a great deal in
relation to private equity fund managers, for example, who, it has been
widely reported, pay considerably less tax on their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>income than their cleaners. That will probably still be true today, even
after the announcement in the comprehensive spending review. If such
income is not taken into account at the first stage, someone with a
substantial income from capital could have a relatively low initial
maintenance assessment, because of how the rules about what should be
considered income and what should not are drawn
up.</div><a name="07100949000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may
well argue that the ability of parents with care to apply for
variations should allow such egregious differences in income to be
taken into account, but the practicalities of that are complicated and
difficult. It has proved quite difficult for parents with care to be
successful in applications for variations under the Child Support
(Variations) Regulations 2000.</div>
<a name="07100949000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, if one goes down the
route of variations, that still leaves the onus on the parent with care
to make an application. They may be unaware of any income, substantial
or otherwise, derived from capital, dividends and so forth. Even if
they do know that information, they might assume that it has been taken
into
account.</div><a name="07100949000138"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000294"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman talking about the
commission looking to make a notional calculation of weekly income on
capital or a calculation of actual
income?</div><a name="07100949000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000295"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. As
drafted, the amendment refers to actual income, although he may argue
that the income should be notional. I would be happy to hear that, and
it might be worth debating, if the amendment were accepted. However, as
drafted, the amendment does not make that distinction and thus would
refer only to actual
income.</div><a name="07100949000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was talking
about variations. I foresee problems with leaving the variation system
to bear the burden of dealing with cases when such gaps occur. The
Minister might argue that the amendment could lead to a significantly
increased administrative burden on CMEC, because additional income
information would have to be taken into account. At the very least,
that is debatable, because processing variations also imposes an
administrative
burden.</div><a name="07100949000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us bear in
mind that HMRC has much of the information, so it could be part of the
data-sharing arrangements between it and CMEC. If CMEC were to get into
the habit of arranging matters on a regular basis and that was part of
the information that had to be provided at the beginning, the
arrangement that we are proposing to ensure that such income sources
would be included from the beginning could be at least as
administratively efficient. Such arrangements would certainly not
impose any undue extra burden. The cases to which I am drawing
attention are those when substantial income might not have been
disclosed or taken into account in the basic
calculations.</div><a name="07100949000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
also the other problem that sometimes taking income in such forms from
capital can be a way of avoiding a full income being taken into account
in respect of a maintenance assessment. The amendment makes an
important point, and I hope that the Minister will give it fair
consideration. It would improve the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>chances significantly of ensuring that the full income of a non-resident
parent is taken into account when a maintenance assessment is
made.</div><a name="07100949000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000296"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I listened with interest to hon. Gentleman. I must
admit that I am in broad agreement with the points that he has made. It
is a curious anomaly that some sources of income are not taken into
account in the calculation. I imagine that that sentiment is shared
fairly broadly on the Government Benches. It is interesting that the
Department&#146;s research report No. 285 of 2005 by Atkinson and
McKay, &#147;Investigating the compliance of Child Support Agency
clients&#148;, found a widespread belief among working non-resident
parents, and particularly those in the civil service, some of whom are
in the Room, and the armed forces, that they were easy targets for the
Child Support
Agency.</div><a name="07100949000199"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">It was
reported that there was resentment that those with the ability to
control their income find it easier to evade paying child maintenance
at a level that reflects their true income. It has also been reported
that that resentment fuels non-compliance, because people are unhappy
at having to pay when others can get away with it. Those on PAYE who
have a regular job are easy targets, while those who control their own
business or those who have complicated family financial arrangements
and can set up dividends or have money diverted to their partner get
off. That leads to a sense of unfairness and to people not wanting to
comply. It is all part of the culture, which we are right to mention so
often. It is important to make sure that we have a culture in which the
system is perceived as fair and equitable. I shall listen with interest
to the Minister&#146;s response to amendment No. 83&#151;I am
certainly in favour of
it.</div><a name="07100949000218"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="07100949000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 15
should go hand in hand with amendment No. 83. One without the other
would not provide the full toolkit that the Minister will need to make
a success of CMEC. The new clause would give the commission powers to
look at what exactly a non-resident parent is doing to try to deprive
himself or herself of income. Paragraph (b) states
that</div><a name="07100949000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Commission
shall regard the person&#146;s obligation to support his children of
paramount
importance.&#148;</div><a name="07100949000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
key phrase, which is necessary to direct Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs and the commission on how to act in such
cases.</div><a name="07100949000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister responds, I imagine that he will say that the measures are not
necessary, because there are existing powers under the 1991 Act.
Technically, he would be correct, but I think that he would also agree
that the Secretary of State has in the past failed to use those powers
and that, in practice, the grounds on which a departure or variation
can succeed are complex, tightly drawn and, frankly, difficult for
parents with care to
access.</div><a name="07100949000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 15
would require the Secretary of State to make regulations dealing with
this issue, rather than it being left to their discretion. The
amendment would establish that in determining whether it is reasonable
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>apply this provision, the commission should pay due regard to the
importance attached in public policy terms to the non-resident parent
properly maintaining his children, having regard to his actual ability
to pay. We all know from our case loads that it is the issue of
non-resident parents who are able to be clever&#151;as they would see
it&#151;that causes us and our constituents the greatest concern and
which has led to some of the most severe and, perhaps, justified
criticism of the Child Support Agency. It feeds a culture of resentment
towards the agency that some people are perceived as getting away with
it.</div><a name="07100949000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment and
the new clause are intended to give the Minister the tools to do the
job properly, to reduce that sense of resentment and unfairness and to
make the system work properly, as far as all parents with care are
concerned.</div><a name="07100949000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000297"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and for South-West Bedfordshire for
their speeches in support of the amendment. I am also grateful for the
important intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West.
Let me try to reassure them about our
intentions.</div><a name="07100949000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree
that we should consider whether the commission should have a means of
dealing with non-resident parents who intentionally deprive themselves
of income in order to reduce their maintenance liability and those who
have significant sources of income that are not currently taken into
account in the main scheme. However, we must consider the appropriate
place to take account of such complex financial circumstances. Taking
account of deprivation of income, as new clause 15 would enforce,
entails the commission deciding whether any observed reduction in
income is intentional or reasonable, which would potentially cause
significant delays in the processing of such
cases.</div><a name="07100949000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
pointed out, the Secretary of State has the power to make those
regulations and has done so for the 1993 scheme. However, these powers
were not used for the 2000 scheme precisely to avoid such complex
circumstances. We believe that that is the right approach. To introduce
regulations to tackle the small number of non-resident parents who
successfully deprive themselves of income into the new arrangements
would add unnecessary complication and, therefore, cause additional
delays in finalising maintenance calculations and ensuring the flow of
money to children. If these powers were applied, we would risk creating
considerable additional work for the commission by casting doubt on the
income information supplied by all non-resident parents. Similarly, on
amendment No. 83, it is vital that the definition of income in the new
statutory maintenance scheme reflects operational realities. I know
that hon. Members are well aware of the pitfalls in making maintenance
calculations too complicated. Indeed, they may recall that the
definition of income used for the first scheme was far too broad and
caused the agency, children and parents significant problems, as
evidence often proved difficult, if not impossible, to obtain, made
little difference to the maintenance due and opened the system to abuse
and delay by non-resident parents.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div><a name="07100949000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000298"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for making that
point. However, is it not the case that the information on types of
income referred to in amendment No. 83 is routinely collected by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs? Surely some of the proposals in
the Bill reflect the idea that the Minister has advanced about having a
closer relationship with HMRC, which I support and would perhaps go
further on. However, if there is to be a data-sharing arrangement,
surely it would apply to these categories, which would mean that where
the HMRC holds information it can routinely be taken into
account.</div><a name="07100949000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000299"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I am afraid that the issue is more complicated
than the hon. Gentleman imagines, as is often the case with such
issues. HMRC has some of the information to which he is referring in a
form that is easily attributable to individual taxpayers, but not all
of it is attributable, so the matter is more
difficult.</div><a name="07100949000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
clear that the amendments would not allow a workable definition of
income. If legislation were to require all those items in their
entirety to be taken into account on the initial calculation, the
operational effects of the amendment would be extreme and adverse. If
commission staff were expected to investigate every bank account, every
dividend and every piece of capital where there was the potential to
earn income by a non-resident parent, the calculation process would
become unworkable.</div>
<a name="07100949000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000300"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Considering the Minister&#146;s earlier comments
about not all information being owned by HMRC, does he not think it
important that our new clause 6&#151;or something like it&#151;is
included? That would give the commission the power to carry out such
investigations and respond to issues raised by parents with
care.</div><a name="07100949000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000301"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> No, absolutely not. We are not going back to
trying to set up the commission as an investigatory body charged with
the duty of looking into people&#146;s personal finances. We know how
complex that task is, and it is not the purpose of the commission. The
answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point lies in other means, and
the other changes that we are introducing in the Bill come closer to
answering his concern than his suggestion. Basing the assessments on
tax data and having the tie-up between HMRC data and the commission is
important, as are the annual fixed-term assessments, the new sanctions,
which we will come to, and the existing sanctions for not revealing
information. That is where the answer to his point lies, rather than in
trying to invent a new financial investigatory authority, which it is
inappropriate to ask the commission to
do.</div><a name="07100949000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000302"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; he
has been very courteous. I apologise if he has already given this
answer, but I am still not clear why amendment No.83 would cause
problems, if we were to use tax data from the previous year. Why can
the information not be transferred in the same way as income data? Why
would that cause any extra work for CMEC? Frankly, as a matter of tax
evasion, if the information is not there, one would expect HMRC to deal
with the matter anyway. I am still not clear on that point from the
answer that the Minister has given.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div><a name="07100949000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000303"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> That might be because I have not reached the end
of my contribution. As I go on, I hope that that issue will become
clearer. The amendment would even require current accounts with incomes
as low as a few pence a week to be included in the maintenance
calculation. Almost every non-resident parent would have such assets,
and the additional work load for the commission would simply mean that
it would not be able to function
properly.</div><a name="07100949000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the variations scheme is the place to deal with the kinds of
complex financial matters that the amendments seek to address. The
variations scheme already contains grounds for including dividend
income, investment income and income from assets in maintenance
calculations. In addition, we already have the power to introduce
grounds for a variation to cover intentional deprivation of income, and
paragraph 9 of schedule 4 to the Bill will carry forward the powers to
estimate income, where the information relating to a non-resident
parent&#146;s income is believed to be inadequate or unreliable. We
believe that those powers specifically, and the variation scheme more
generally, are the best means of taking account of the difficult
circumstances that the amendments address, without unnecessarily
impacting on the majority of cases to which the circumstances do not
apply. It is a question of a proportionate response to the scale of the
problem.</div><a name="07100949000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
add&#151;I hope that this will reassure those who have spoken in
support of the amendments&#151;that we are currently meeting
stakeholders, including One Parent Families, to discuss the best way to
deal with those complex issues and to decide the best way to deal with
the circumstances in practice. We are also investigating ways to
strengthen the variations regime to help ensure that non-resident
parents&#146; liabilities accurately reflect their ability to pay. In
addition, we will be taking advice from the new commission before
introducing the necessary secondary legislation to address the issue.
Depending on the outcome of those discussions, we will implement
strategies to help ensure that non-resident parents are unable
artificially to reduce their maintenance liabilities by depriving
themselves of income or disguising their true ability to pay assessed
maintenances. I hope that those reassurances will enable hon. Members
not to press their
amendments.</div><a name="07100949000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000304"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response.
He has understandably and rightly said that there will be further
consultation, discussion and debate with stakeholders and
representative organisations. However, I am still not convinced that he
has answered my point about the problem of putting all the burden on
the variations regime, in that it still requires the parent with care
to come forward and apply for variation, which makes assumptions about
the parent with care&#146;s knowledge and their willingness to come
forward for a variation, having gone through what may already have been
a very lengthy, bureaucratic and delayed process to get the assessment
in the first
place.</div><a name="07100949000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, it
is not my intention to push the amendment to a vote at this point, but
it is an issue that we need to come back to at a later stage. Although
the Minister&#146;s criticisms of the range of issues contained 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>within the amendment may have raised an important point, to rely solely
on the variations regime to deal with such cases runs the risk that
non-resident parents with significant income from non-income sources
would be able to avoid paying proper maintenance to their children.
That is a circumstance that I think everyone in Committee wants to
avoid.</div><a name="07100949000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000305"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> At the appropriate moment, I would like to press
new clause 15 to a vote. I have listened carefully to the Minister, but
I still do not feel that I have an answer to the extreme frustration
expressed to me by my constituents who know that their ex-husbands or
ex-partners are rearranging their financial affairs in such a way as to
pay a minuscule amount of maintenance. I think that the new clause
would go some way towards addressing that
problem.</div><a name="07100949000219"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="07100949000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000306"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> I am slightly mystified by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s approach, because I thought that he said that the
new clause would not really work unless in tandem with amendment No.
83, which has just been
withdrawn.</div><a name="07100949000165"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000312"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I shall be brief, as it is getting late in the
day.</div> <a name="07100949000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
118 would change the provision in the Bill whereby a reassessment takes
place only if the income of a non-resident parent either increases or
decreases by 25 per cent. I can almost hear the Minister&#146;s
response about the agency&#146;s difficulties with readjusting
assessments on small amounts of income, but the 25 per cent. figure is
much too high. It can be as unfair to the parent with care as it can be
to the non-resident parent when income both goes up and goes down. If
there is an increase in income of 24 per cent. and children do not
benefit from it, that is wrong. If someone has a gross weekly income of
&#163;100, it goes down to &#163;76 and the percentage is applied
on the &#163;100 figure, that is wrong, too.</div>
<a name="07100949000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figure is too wide in
scope. The Minister will say, &#147;We will get it all through, it
will be simpler, it will be administratively easier,&#148; but the
scope is just too wide. It is another example of too much rough justice
in the Bill. The figure of 10 per cent. would be more reasonable, and
variations of 9 per cent. either way could be borne more easily than
variations of 24 per cent.</div>
<a name="07100949000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000313"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I speak in support of amendment No. 124, which
is part of this group of amendments. To some extent I share the
concerns that the hon. Gentleman has expressed, but amendment No. 124
would introduce asymmetry to the arrangements. It would make provision
that</div><a name="07100949000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where there is a
change in circumstances of the non-resident parent, the Commission
shall review maintenance arrangements if the gross income of the
non-resident parent has increased by greater than 25 per cent. or
decreased by greater than 10 per cent. from the gross income figure
fixed by the calculation currently in force&#148;.</div>
<a name="07100949000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The asymmetry is proposed for
two reasons. Although it is important to ensure that children benefit
from increases in income, it is also important to provide for
non-resident persons whose income falls by, for example, 24 per cent.,
because if there is no variation, the proportion of their income that
is taken up by maintenance could, in some cases, rise to 42 per cent.
The amendment is designed to concentrate more of the
commission&#146;s limited administrative resources for processing
variations and changes in circumstance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>on those cases in which a fall in income could have  a serious
effect on the non-resident parent&#146;s circumstances.</div>
<a name="07100949000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select Committee&#146;s
report includes a helpful table in paragraph 133 on page 37 that shows,
using different figures, the proportions of employed non-resident
parents who would be eligible for adjustment. A 10 per cent. variation
for income falls would result in an increase of 9 to 16 per cent., but
a 10 per cent. reduction for income rises would result in the
proportion of cases being dealt with rising from 15 to 33 per cent. I
accept what the hon. Gentleman said about the importance of ensuring
that income increases are passed on, but if the interest of justice and
fairness is balanced with the administrative efficiency that CMEC will
have to pursue as one of its objectives, our amendment would enable
those cases to be addressed in which income falls could lead to serious
hardship, although when significant income increases occur they would
have to wait until the start of the following year to be
processed.</div> <a name="07100949000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
be the right balance, and would allow CMEC&#146;s resources to be
devoted to cases in which hardship might occur. I agree with many of
the points made by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, but our
asymmetric system would make the balance more right and I hope that the
Committee will support our
amendment.</div><a name="07100949000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000314"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> This is an important matter, and I appreciate
the points that have been made in support of the two
amendments.</div><a name="07100949000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 118 would provide for regulations to require a fresh assessment to
be made if the gross income of a non-resident parent has increased or
decreased by 10 per cent. or more. Amendment No. 124 would provide for
maintenance to be reviewed if the gross income has increased by more
than 25 per cent. or decreased by more than 10 per cent. from the gross
income figure used in the maintenance calculation. It further makes
provision for regulations to provide for an immediate change in the
maintenance calculations when updated HMRC income is provided to the
commission.</div><a name="07100949000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 17
provides powers to make regulations on supersessions, which may include
the ability to restrict the type of changes in circumstances for which
maintenance liabilities can be adjusted. At present, when a relevant
change of circumstances takes place the maintenance calculation can be
changed to reflect that, and such an adjustment is a supersession. If a
client reports repeated changes in income or shared care, the
maintenance calculation can change every week. That creates uncertainty
for the other parent and also means that agency staff are constantly
calculating maintenance rather than focusing on collection and
enforcement. I shall illustrate that with some real numbers on which
hon. Members should
reflect.</div><a name="07100949000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
introduction of the revised scheme&#151;the 2000 change&#151;5
million changes of circumstances have been notified to the agency, and
the current rate is 145,000 a month. That is the scale of changes of
circumstances that the agency must deal with at the moment. Taking that
into account, I hope that the Committee supports our intention to
reduce that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>volume in the interest of supporting collection and enforcement rather
than constant and repeated
recalculations.</div><a name="07100949000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the statutory maintenance scheme, the intention is that only
significant changes in circumstances&#151;for example, a child
starting work or a substantial change in the non-resident
parent&#146;s income&#151;will lead to an immediate adjustment in
the maintenance calculation. More minor changes will be reflected when
an annual case review is carried out, and the maintenance liability
will be updated using income data for the most recently available tax
year provided by
HMRC.</div><a name="07100949000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">For changes in
income, we propose a tolerance level of 25 per cent. If the
non-resident parent&#146;s income goes up or down by 25 per cent. or
more compared with the historic HMRC figure that was used, the
maintenance calculation will be changed so that it is based on the
non-resident parent&#146;s current income. That tolerance will not
apply when income data are updated at the annual review. If the new
income figures result in a change in the amount of maintenance due,
then regardless of the amount by which income has changed the
calculation will be updated.</div>
<a name="07100949000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The tolerance level must be set
where it strikes a balance between allowing significant changes in
income to be taken into account, and ensuring that the commission is
not inundated with requests for recalculations. We believe that the 25
per cent. level strikes that
balance.</div><a name="07100949000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
analysed income changes between 2004-05 and 2005-06 for non-resident
parents in the 2003 scheme. That analysis shows that around 40 per
cent. of them had a change in their income of 25 per cent. or more. It
also shows that just over 60 per cent. had income changes of 10 per
cent. or more. Clearly, a tolerance level of 10 per cent. suggests that
the commission would be required to make adjustments in a far greater
proportion of cases than under our preferred level of 25 per cent. It
would affect the commission&#146;s ability to manage its case load
effectively and would provide much less certainty for parents. It
would, at a stroke, prevent us from moving to a system in which
maintenance awards are generally fixed for a year and only updated on
an annual review
basis.</div><a name="07100949000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000315"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Will the Minister place the information that he
has just given, and from which he has quoted excerpts, in full in the
Library? His figures differ significantly from those that were given to
the Select Committee by the Secretary of State and published in the
report on page 37, which would suggest that reducing the threshold from
25 per cent. to 10 per cent. for downward adjustments only would lead
to 7 per cent. more cases coming through the system. The totals in the
report do not match the ones that he has given. Could he provide the
information and set the record straight on how the two sets of figures
are consistent with each other? If he could make that clear, I would be
grateful.</div><a name="07100949000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100949000316"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I am happy to do that in order to help members
of the
Committee.</div><a name="07100949000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 124 would provide a tolerance of 10 per cent. for
decreases but keep the level for increases at 25 per cent. It would
also increase the number of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>cases that would need to be reviewed. We consider that the system will
be simpler for staff and parents to understand if the same figure
applies to increases and decreases in income. Under the amendment,
non-resident parents could get their payments lowered and based on
current income much more readily than a parent with care could ever get
them raised. Parents with care would perceive that as
unfair.</div><a name="07100949000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">A much lower
tolerance level for decreases in income could also
tempt some non-resident parents to manipulate their finances in order
to portray a drop in income. We will make provision to prevent the
scope for that, but if the tolerance were as low as 10 per cent.,
non-resident parents might be more tempted to try to do that than with
a higher tolerance of 25 per cent. in the knowledge that, if
successful, their maintenance would be reduced with immediate
effect.</div><a name="07100949000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part of amendment No. 124 would provide that a maintenance calculation
based on historic HMRC income information should be changed immediately
if updated income information is provided to the commission. Under the
new arrangements, all calculations will be based on HMRC income
information unless the non-resident parent&#146;s current income is
significantly higher or lower. The calculation will then be updated at
the time of the annual
review.</div><a name="07100949000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
appears to provide that a non-resident parent could submit income
details for a more recent period at any time and have their maintenance

<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>calculation reviewed. That, too, would clearly inundate the commission
with requests for
changes.</div><a name="07100949000220"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="07100949000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The system of
annual reviews will mean that parents will know how much maintenance
they are to receive or pay for the year, and be able to budget
accordingly around that figure. Under the amendment, which would allow
for maintenance to be reviewed whenever updated information became
available, parents would never be able to predict when it might change.
If the commission were required to update calculations as soon as new
information became available, it could also lead to unmanageable peaks
in its work load following the end of the tax year, when most
non-resident parents&#146; new income information for the previous
year would become available. It is therefore vital that reviews take
place in individual cases when they are due rather than on demand, in
order to spread the commission&#146;s work load evenly throughout the
year.</div> <a name="07100949000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
recognise that although the principle of having the tolerance is
accepted, there is a range of views as to what it should be. We do not
want to fix it in primary legislation, as it would not be possible to
review it in the light of experience. It is therefore much more
sensible to provide in secondary legislation.</div>
<a name="07100949000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those reassurances, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div>
