							<b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): What an unexpected
pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow,
on yet another occasion. It has been a great privilege to do so in the
past. I shall try my best to ensure that I do not go over any ground
that has been referred to before in Committee and I hope that, should I
dare stray into that territory, I shall be reminded by the Chair. I
shall try to avoid it
happening.</div>
					<a name="07070331000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
relates to the application of serious crime prevention orders in the
context of excluded material and banking information. The provision
makes it particularly clear that a serious crime prevention order can
be used to obtain certain documentation relating to banking business.
My questions for the Minister concern the discussions that have taken
place with the banking industry or other regulators about the
application of the provision. Given this country&#146;s obvious
reliance on financial services and balancing the need to ensure that
effective measures are in place to control the activities of serious
organised criminals, we must have some certainty that industry
understands what is going on and what the expectations
are.</div>
					<a name="07070331000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reading of the
Bill suggests that there could be extraterritorial application and that
an international bank could be subject to an order if it were felt that
a protective measure was required to prevent someone from committing a
serious criminal offence in this country. I understand the intent
behind the provision, and the meaning of subsections (3)and (4) under
which</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>
					<a name="07070331000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition A is that the
person to whom the obligation of confidence is owed
consents&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07070331000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
straightforward if someone has consented to the provision of
information required under an order. However, subsection (4) has a wide
ambit and says that, if the order requires certain documentation to be
provided, in essence the bank or financial institution would have to
comply.</div>
					<a name="07070331000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a matter of clearly understanding the position of the banking
industry and commerce. Given the potential sanctions for breach if a
bank, company or financial institution were to fall foul of the clause,
it would be helpful if the Minister could set out in more detail the
application of the clause, and what consultation has taken place with
and what representations have been received from financial service
institutions as well as from regulators here or internationally that
may have been involved in the preparation and consideration of the
clause.</div>

							<a name="07070331000429"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):
						</b> Mr. Bercow, in
the light of your comments, I wish also to welcome a few members to the
Committee and make one or two other comments. I should be grateful if
you would allow me to indulge you and the Committee. I congratulate
those members of the Committee who have now moved
on&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Laughter.]</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>I hasten to add that they
have moved on in a positive sense. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the
Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) now has the post
of the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; and I am
delighted for my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden
(Siobhain McDonagh) and the new Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for
Hartlepool (Mr. Wright). The Committee&#146;s debates have
been of a good-hearted nature, but they have been challenging and have
given the Bill proper scrutiny. In that spirit, I ask the hon. Member
for Hornchurch to pass on my congratulations and best wishes to the
hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert), who has been
promoted.</div>
					<a name="07070331000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome my
hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston. I also wish to mention
the hon. Member for Reigate and the Lord Commissioner of Her
Majesty&#146;s Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth, who
are staying put. If it is not too self-indulgent, may I congratulate
myself on staying put?&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.] </i>It is very
self-indulgent. I also welcome my hon. Friends the Members for
Stourbridge and for Vale of Clwyd and, lastly, the hon. Member for
Hornchurch to the Committee. I wish him well in navigating his way
through the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070331000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
also pleased to see that you are still chairing the Committee,
Mr. Bercow, with Mr.
Benton.</div>
					<a name="07070331000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start by
saying that the measures in clause 14 have been discussed with the
British Bankers Association. It has commented on the clause, and the
Government have taken account of what it has said; it is perfectly
happy with the clause. I hope that that offers the hon. Member for
Hornchurch reassurance on that
question.</div>
					<a name="07070331000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides that a person cannot be required to produce excluded material
under a serious crime prevention order; and that a person cannot be
required to provide information in relation to which</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>
					<a name="07070331000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;he owes an obligation of
confidence by virtue of carrying on a banking business
unless&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">one of two
conditions is met. The first condition is</div>
					<a name="07070331000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the person to whom the
obligation of confidence is owed consents to the
disclosure&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07070331000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">as the hon.
Gentleman pointed out. The second condition is that the order requires
the disclosure of specific information, or disclosure of a particular
kind of information and that the confidential information is of that
type.</div>
					<a name="07070331000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important safeguard. A serious crime prevention order should not be
capable of requiring the disclosure of excluded material. In addition,
an order should not be able to require the disclosure of
information</div>
					<a name="07070331000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in respect
of which...an obligation of
confidence&#148;</div>

owed</div>
					<a name="07070331000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by virtue of
carrying on a banking
business&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">unless a court
has given permission for or has specifically considered its disclosure
and concluded that disclosure is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070331000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have said throughout the passage of the Bill that it is
important to recognise that the court must always act fairly and
proportionately, and it will have to do so on the disclosure of
information under the clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000430"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I welcome the assurance on the preparation of
the clause and the consultation with the BBA&#151;it is helpful to
have that on the record. Was any consideration given to the
international aspects of the provision? The BBA was consulted, but did
the Government look at the matter from an international angle? Will the
measure have applications to banks outside the
UK?</div>
					<a name="07070331000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000431"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> We are not sure that that would be necessary under
the clause. We are dealing with the prevention of crime in this
country, which is why we negotiated with the
BBA.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000432"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> Just to clarify, it is not inconceivable that
someone intent on committing a crime in this country might seek to use
banking services overseas. Will the Minister tell us whether that has
been contemplated, so that we can understand the breadth and ambit of
the measure? Will the measure apply only to UK banks and financial
institutions or could it have wider application to overseas entities,
particularly as we know that, in this age of internet banking and other
types of trading of finance, it is not impossible for a financial
institution outside the UK to be used for improper
purposes?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000433"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a reasonable point.
My understanding is that our particular concern was with respect to
British banks and financial institutions, but I will consider that
point and, if necessary, come back to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>

things. I will certainly pass on the Minister&#146;s kind wishes to
my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who is now the

amendments in the way that his predecessor did not always
do.</div>
					<a name="07070331000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 109 is fairly uncontroversial. It is made to avoid the problems of
unintended consequences. It relates to serious crime prevention orders
not requiring people to disclose protected documents. At the moment,
that protection is limited to disclosure where disclosure is prohibited
under any other enactment. It occurred to me that there might be a
range of documents where non-disclosure is authorised by any other
enactment. I think that there is a slight difference. In order to guard
against the law of unintended consequences, we should build in that
protection. If the Minister assures me that there is no difference from
the present wording in the Bill, I will be reasonably satisfied.
However, I personally think that there is a
difference.</div>

is a question of carefully analysing the context and consequences of
these provisions. If the Minister can give some assurance or comfort in

this Committee and the understanding of the
Bill.</div>

No. 109 will reassure Opposition Members.</div>
					<a name="07070331000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 15
provides an important safeguard. We do not intend such orders to cut
across any prohibitions on disclosing information that might be
contained in other legislation. However, the amendment goes further. It
means that in cases in which there is a discretion or restriction on
disclosure in another piece of legislation, such disclosure could not
be provided for by an order. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>Discretions or restrictions are specifically drafted as such because
disclosure might be appropriate in some instances. I do not think it
necessary to extend the provision into such areas; the High Court will
be able to decide whether the circumstances of a case make disclosure
appropriate.</div>

					<a name="07070331000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
clause 37 includes a protection for anyone making such a disclosure.
That ensures that actions for breach of a restriction on disclosure
cannot be brought against the subject of an order. I hope that, with
that reassurance, the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> I remain uneasy. I shall not press the amendment to
a Division but it would be helpful to have examples of the instances of
discretionary power to withhold that the Minister says exist in
legislation. That would put the Committee in a better position to
determine whether it wants to insist on the provision, either on Report
or in another place. If the Minister can give us an example now, so
much the better, but I shall understand if he cannot; the matter is
complicated and I would not blame him for not being able to do so. I
would, however, expect to have some examples later. If he would be good
enough to write to me, we could reflect on the way forward. On that

						</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 176, in clause 17, page 10, line 22, leave out &#145;5

							<a name="07070331000441"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I know that the amendments have the support of my
hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch. I return to the fact that the
orders are pretty draconian. We have already argued that point in this
Committee and it is generally agreed that they are potentially
extremely serious. That being so, one has to ask for how long they
should run. We would not necessarily be dealing with people who had
committed criminal offences. Some would not have done&#151;I refer to
the facilitator. The restrictions that might be contained in the order
are specified in clause 6, and they are pretty widespread; they touch
on almost every aspect of people&#146;s ordinary lives. The Minister
says that they are not punitive but preventive. That is true as to
their purpose, but they can plainly be used in a punitive way. Equally
plainly, they can have penal consequences. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>For the reasons that I have already argued in this Committee on many an
occasion, I do not think that the safeguards are appropriate or
sufficient.</div>
					<a name="07070331000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that, how long should an order run? The Bill provides for a five-year
term&#151;that is the maximum; it would not necessarily be that
long&#151;and I believe that that is too long. It should be a lesser
period, having regard to all the considerations that I have advanced,
hence the proposal that it should be but one
year.</div>
					<a name="07070331000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000442"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I support the comments made by my right hon.
and learned Friend on the duration of the orders. As he rightly points
out, clause 17(2) provides for an order to run for five years. We
should consider whether such a period is proportionate or appropriate
in the context of any other criminal law action that might be
considered in relation to the circumstances to which the order is
subject, and of any uncertainties that might arise.</div>
					<a name="07070331000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that clause 18 deals
with the variation of orders, and in some ways there is an
interrelationship between the two provisions. However, it is relevant
to consider whether the five-year term currently envisaged is
appropriate, given that the potential impact of what may be required
would clearly be significant. I think, for instance, of the sorts of
provisions contained in control orders; I know that in previous
discussions and debates the question was raised as to whether control
orders were relevant and appropriate, given the context of orders made
under the Bill. A parallel can be drawn between those and control
orders and orders for antisocial behaviour, but we want to know in what
context it applies to the orders in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070331000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly all of the 18 control
orders that have been issued so far required that the people concerned
should reside at a specific residence, and permit entry to police
officers and persons authorised by the Secretary of State. Sixteen of
those subjected to control orders had to surrender their travel
documents and more than half of them had to wear an electronic
monitoring tag and had to report each day to the monitoring company;
they were subject to restrictions on communications, could not maintain
or use more than one bank account and had to provide the Home Office
with details of their employment.</div>
					<a name="07070331000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context of the need to
protect the public, I understand the desire to be able to impose such
conditions, albeit we have serious concerns about the effectiveness of
control orders, given the number that have been breached. However, that
is the subject of a separate debate.</div>
					<a name="07070331000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000443"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> May I place it on the record that, as the hon.
Gentleman concedes, we have debated at length the difference between
serious crime prevention orders and control orders? However, of the
other civil orders accepted by the House, football banning orders run
from two to 10 years, and antisocial behaviour orders and sexual
offender orders last for a minimum of two years with no maximum. Again,
the conditions that can be placed on people the subject of those other
civil orders put considerable restraints on them in order to prevent
them from offending again.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>
					<a name="07070331000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000444"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that intervention,
but football banning orders and the like have narrow terms of
reference. However, I think he accepts that the intention is to provide
a degree of scope and flexibility in order to reflect the various
circumstances and factors involved in making orders to prevent serious
offending.</div>
					<a name="07070331000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand why the Minister argues as he does, but a balance has to be
struck between flexibility and being able to ensure that an element of
control can be brought to bear. That is why we suggest a one-year
limit. I was drawing a parallel with the control order regime, and
although I accept what the Minister said about distinguishing between
the two, it is still appropriate to debate the matter. For instance,
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 a non-derogating control
order effectively lasts for 12 months, although it can then be renewed.
We believe that a parallel can be drawn to ensure that if significant
restrictions and restraints are put on a person, there should be at
least a 12-month review to see whether those sorts of restrictions were
still appropriate given their import and impact.</div>
					<a name="07070331000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is interesting to note that
on Second Reading the Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and
Police, the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), said
that the intent would be that a criminal prosecution would be brought
if that was possible. I say to the Minister here that if we had this
type of provision, with a 12-month restriction on the extent of this
order, at the very least that would provide a mechanism for considering
whether a prosecution could be brought at the expiration of that
12-month period or whether it was necessary to continue with a new
12-month order.</div>
					<a name="07070331000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we
are not seeking to undermine or challenge the intent behind these
provisions. We are trying to ensure that we have, first, an effective
mechanism to deal with reviews and, secondly, proportionality in the
orders that are granted.</div>
					<a name="07070331000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty also highlights the
issue of uncertainty about the aspects of the orders that may have been
granted and the terms of those orders. It said in its briefing
paper:</div>
					<a name="07070331000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
experience of ASBOs and Control Orders reveals several risks about how
SCPOs might operate in practice. In particular it suggests that the
restrictions imposed on an Order may well be drafted in an uncertain
manner; include standard restrictions rather than restrictions which
are tailored to each case; and that there will be no regular review of
the Order with the result that restrictions will stay in place which
are no longer necessary or
proportionate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I understand that it is open to someone to go back to court to seek a
variation in the terms of the order, obviously that provision is
drafted in a fairly restrictive way, in that the court must be
satisfied that certain tests have been passed and that certain
requirements apply. If an order was granted for 12 months, that would
formally allow a 12-month review of the appropriateness of the terms of
the order. Rather than an application by an individual being granted, a
12-month review would provide a mechanism to ensure the
appropriateness, and in some ways the certainty, of the terms of the
order that is being granted. That may be appropriate not only for the
person who is subject to an order but for law 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>enforcement, so that law enforcement officers can ask at the end of 12
months whether the conditions of the order are still applicable or
whether they should be looking for something different. A 12-month
provision would allow such an analysis to be undertaken, to establish
whether the order was operating
appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07070331000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000445"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Can the hon. Gentleman confirm, for my benefit and
that of the Committee, that under clause 18 it is not only the person
who is the subject of the order who can apply for variation but the
applicant authority? Therefore, if the applicant authority wanted to
vary the order, it could do so in six months,  12 months or
indeed 18 months.</div>
					<a name="07070331000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000446"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The Minister correctly states the provisions
of the Bill; the applicant authority has that right under clause 18 to
go back to the court to vary the order. However, I am saying that this
review would be a natural trigger, after a period of 12 months, that
would force the authorities to look again, to ensure that what is being
sought remains appropriate, and to consider whether any further
provisions might be necessary to reflect changing
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07070331000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that these orders would be reviewed by the authorities to maintain
their assurance to the public. However, this review would not only
ensure that there is a 12-month restriction to see that there is some
proportionality in the way that the restrictions are imposed, but would
automatically provide a natural review for the authorities to analyse
whether the provisions that are being applied are effective or should
be modified in any way by means of the renewal of an order, which would
perhaps lead to slightly different conditions being
applied.</div>
					<a name="07070331000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I talked
about the issue of prosecution. The Justice briefing note said that,
unlike the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, the Bill contains no
provision for the consideration of whether a criminal prosecution is
possible before a serious crime prevention order is applied for, and
that if the Bill is passed it will be possible for prosecutors to apply
for serious crime prevention orders where they are not confident that
they have enough evidence of a type admissible before a jury to obtain
a conviction; the protections of the criminal process will therefore be
circumvented.</div>
					<a name="07070331000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
Justice&#146;s view of how serious crime prevention orders will
operate. Clearly, it is open to prosecutors to take the view that they
want to go down the serious crime prevention orders route for those
purposes. It is important to ensure that we are confident that the
orders will not be used
inappropriately.</div>
				
					<a name="07070331000397"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div>
					<a name="07070331000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take on board
what the Minister for Security, Counter Terrorism and Police said on
Second Reading: that a prosecution would be pursued if it were
possible. Our defining goal has to be that this process is a last
resort rather than a first resort, as some commentators have suggested.
A mechanism for having another 12-month period would perhaps allow for
a further review after 12 months to see whether a criminal prosecution
might be appropriate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000447"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> This goes to the heart of the Bill and what we
have been talking about. Of course we want people to be prosecuted, and
if they are prosecuted&#151;which is the first option&#151;and
convicted they will be subject to criminal penalty. However, the Bill
is not about punishment, but about the prevention of future crime. The
hon. Gentleman is in danger of rerunning the argument and saying,
&#147;These are punitive measures,&#148; whereas our fundamental
point is that they are preventive measures and are not a substitute for
prosecution, but are about preventing future
crime.</div>
					<a name="07070331000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000448"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I hear what the Minister said and I note the
previous discussions and debates in Committee on this point. I do not
intend to rerun previous debates. However, although I accept his
intentions in relation to this being a preventive measure, the way in
which the Bill is drafted could allow an alternative approach to be
adopted. Hence the reasons for the concerns that have been expressed
previously and my concerns about the need to impose a 12-month period
to restrict the ambit of the control
orders.</div>
					<a name="07070331000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
there is a clear justification for seeking a shorter period than five
years for the operation of the control orders. A 12-month period would
be appropriate and consistent with other pieces of legislation. It
would allow a proper review of the terms of the orders, to ensure their
proportionality and to address any uncertainty about their application,
whether in the interests of law enforcement or the liberty of the
subject. It would also ensure that the control orders remain
appropriate in all the circumstances. That is a reasonable, fair
suggestion. I hope that the Minister will consider it
appropriately.</div>

						</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman has ranged widely in
his treatment of the amendments. I am not criticising him for that in
any way, but it might be convenient for the Committee if I advise that,
in the light of that, I am not minded to allow a clause stand part
debate on this
clause.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I shall be brief and to the
point. This is the first time that I have chosen to speak this morning.
I cannot remember whether the Minister said that certain hon. Members
had moved on or passed away, but whatever their fate I am sure that
they will not enjoy themselves nearly as much as they would have done
if they had been here with us this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07070331000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
amendments. It is worth looking back to clause 6, which lists
examples&#151;it is not an exhaustive list&#151;of the sanctions
that can be put in place, including severe restrictions on
people&#146;s liberties, which, as I mentioned in previous sittings,
mean everything short of imprisonment. I stand by that assertion. An
individual&#146;s financial property, business dealings or working
arrangements&#151;that is a very broad category of
restriction&#151;the use of any premises or item by an individual and
their travel within the United Kingdom can be restricted. Those are
severe
penalties.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000451"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> So that the Committee is in no doubt, they are not
penalties or punishments; they are preventive
measures.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000452"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> The Minister repeatedly makes that point. The
essence of the Government&#146;s argument is, &#147;We prefer to
prosecute people if we can, but if we know they are guilty and
can&#146;t find enough evidence to stand that assertion up, we have
this list of measures instead.&#148; The measures would not always be
preventive; they may be imposed on people who have committed offences
in the past, or are believed to have done, and who, it is believed,
might be willing to do so in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07070331000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment,
which would replace &#147;5 years&#148; with &#147;1
year&#148;, would be more proportionate for someone who may never
have been convicted of a criminal offence in their life, but who, it
may be asserted, wishes to commit an offence in the future, but who may
not choose to do so
either.</div>
					<a name="07070331000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000453"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman would probably agree that when
one thinks about the rollover provisions, which are the subject of the
next debate, orders could run for 10 or 15
years.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000454"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention and I will
come to that territory shortly. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is
right; he said 10 to 15 years, but the period could be indefinite; he
was being generous. One could pick a figure&#151;a multiple of five,
for example&#151;as it is all contained in the clause. One year is
more proportionate, given that the person concerned has not been
convicted of a criminal offence, and it provides scope for renewal and
reflection on a more regular basis than if the period specified is five
years, as in the clause as
drafted.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000455"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> May I briefly return to the issue of prevention,
which is at the heart of what hon. Members have been saying? I refer
the Committee to the tests that must be met in order for a serious
crime prevention order to be given, and especially to clause 1(1)(b),
which states that the High Court may make an order if</div>
					<a name="07070331000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it has reasonable grounds to
believe that the order would protect the public by preventing,
restricting or disrupting involvement by the person in serious crime in
England and Wales&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070331000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
always the case that the measures that the serious crime prevention
order would put in place would be preventive, preventing crime in the
future. An SCPO cannot be given unless that second test is met. In the
end, the High Court will be the judge of whether that is the
case.</div>
					<a name="07070331000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): What is the reoffending
rate for people who have committed serious crimes coming out of prison?
There is a case for saying that the test would be met by anyone who had
been in prison&#151;that based simply on the statistics of people who
have been in prison, it is reasonable to suspect that they would
reoffend.</div>
					<a name="07070331000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000457"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point,
as it is exactly the point that I was about to make. Figures from the
Serious Organised Crime Agency show recidivism rates of 85 per cent. It
is not for the prisons or anybody else to determine whether it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>is appropriate for any of that 85 per cent. to receive a serious crime
prevention order; it is a matter for the Crown court, when it is acting
in civil way, or for the High Court.</div>
					<a name="07070331000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I shall say in my formal
response to the debate, a recidivism rate of 85 per cent. makes the
case very well for a serious crime prevention order to be available to
prevent a person reoffending after they leave prison. It also makes the
case very well that as there is a recidivism rate of such magnitude,
SCPOs, as well as other measures, could be an effective tool available
to the judiciary and to society to restrict the harm that those people
might cause in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07070331000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
point is that the vast majority of SCPOs would be imposed on an
individual as a result of their criminal
conviction.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000459"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Of course, only the prosecuting agencies could
apply a serious crime prevention order. We would expect them to choose
it in the first place. Before you rule me out of order, Mr.
Bercow, I am coming back to the amendment. I was trying to answer one
or two of the points. If the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will
permit me, I must move
on.</div>
					<a name="07070331000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">These amendments
would make the maximum length of an SCPO one year instead of five. We
chose five years because the vast majority of people engaged in serious
crime will be engaged in a criminal lifestyle and will reoffend
persistently. Initial work done by SOCA, in relation to its target
base, is that the recidivism rate could be as high as 85 per cent. That
is the point that the hon. Member for Reigate was making. As a result,
we believe that the maximum possible length of five years is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070331000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress
that that is the maximum. The hon. Member for Hornchurch does not often
do this, but he slightly glossed over that point. It does not have to
be five years. It is a flexible measure that is available to the
courts. If the court thought that a year was appropriate it would make
it a year. If it thought that two years was appropriate, it would make
it two years. But the provision offers flexibility up to a maximum of
five years so that the court can make a judgment based on the evidence
that it has before it for each individual case. That is a reasonable
proposition. It is a reasonable power for the court to
have.</div>
					<a name="07070331000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry if I
get boring on this, but the High Court cannot act in a way that is
inconsistent with the European convention on human rights. It is a
public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act and as such
it must act in a way that is consistent with it. If it does not, people
can go to the Court of
Appeal.</div>
					<a name="07070331000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
will impose orders that they consider to be reasonable and
proportionate. So there is every possibility that orders will be put in
place for a range of periods. In addition, for the courts to put in
place an order for five years, they will have to have reasonable
grounds to believe that it will prevent involvement in serious crime
for those five years. If they think that the risk is more short term
they would put in place an order for a shorter length of time. For
those reasons I think we should resist the amendment and allow the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>courts to have the discretion available to them so that they can make
the best judgment on the basis of the evidence that is before
them.</div>
					<a name="07070331000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000460"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am not going to withdraw the amendment. I should
like to make a number of points, if I may. The Minister has spent some
time arguing that the provisions are not penal, but preventive. In one
sense that is true. I have acknowledged that. I have made the point, as
has my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, that one looks to the
consequences. The consequences are very severe and are certainly penal
in character.</div>
					<a name="07070331000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one
looks at the White Paper, one sees sometimes that the motive is
effectively penal and not preventive. The fifth substantive paragraph
on page 31, for example, contains a lot of discussion as to
circumstances in which the order could be made as an alternative to
prosecution. The following arguments are put forward: cases can be
quite difficult to put together; overlong trials are not to be
encouraged; somebody may be on the margin of the substantive
conspiracy, and so on.</div>
					<a name="07070331000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">What exactly is being
contemplated is that these orders will be used as an alternative to a
criminal prosecution. Once one understands that, the argument that they
are wholly preventive rather than penal disappears, at least to a high
degree. The motive is to catch those who are guilty of criminal
offences, but in respect of whom it is not desired, often for pragmatic
reasons, to bring a prosecution. That is bad news. It is bad news for
the variety of reasons that I have already articulated: namely, that
none of the safeguards that are required in criminal cases
applies.</div>
					<a name="07070331000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
incidentally raises another interesting consequence. Let us assume that
for the pragmatic reasons identified on page 31, it is decided not to
prosecute a person who is on the margins of a criminal conspiracy. The
consequence upon them of an order being made can be much graver in
terms of the penalty than if that person were to be prosecuted,
convicted and sentenced to a penalty by the original criminal court.
That, again, is bad news because it undermines the presumptions of
civil liberties for which I have argued in front of the courts for some

					<a name="07070331000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has reminded us, as he has done many times, that the High Court is a
public authority and is caught by the provisions of the human rights
legislation. That is true, but is an irrelevant consideration unless
and until a relevant article is brought into play. The Minister will
remember that in our previous discussions, he and I have referred
repeatedly to the case of McCann; that was a decision of the House of
Lords relating to antisocial behaviour orders. However, he will
remember that I was able to point out that article 6.2&#151;one of
the fundamental articles in the convention&#151;did not apply. The
House of Lords ruled in terms that as the ASBO provisions were not
deemed to be criminal, the provisions in article 6.2 had no
application. Consequently, the assertion made by the Minister that the
protection afforded by the convention is absolute is true only to the
extent that the courts will hold that an applicable article comes into
play.</div>

is a crime in respect of which I am going to have a serious crime
prevention order. After this Government, anything is
possible.</div>
					<a name="07070331000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was trying
to deal with the point about the convention, which is an important one.
People suppose&#151;as this Committee appears to suppose&#151;that
the High Court is always bound by the terms of the convention. However,
it is bound by the terms of the convention only when the articles are
brought into play. They will come into play in varying and different
circumstances. In particular the articles that apply to criminal cases
will not apply in the context of serious crime prevention orders,
because, for example, of the McCann judgment.</div>
					<a name="07070331000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, taking those two

for ASBOs are running at 55 per cent. and at  70 per cent. in
certain parts of the country. I would be very cautious about praying in
aid the recidivism rate as a way of justifying the need for serious
crime prevention orders, particularly when breaches of other orders are

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000485"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> The reason why I have tabled amendment No. 9 and
new clauses 3 and 4 and regard them as important is that they get to
the nub of what the Bill is about&#151;the excessive use of arbitrary
force by the state. If I may take hon. Members through the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>proposals that I am putting before the Committee, I hope that everybody
will understand the point that I am
making.</div>
					<a name="07070331000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
9 would remove subsections (5) and (6). Subsection (5) sets out the
power to make an additional order, over and above the five years that
we have just voted to keep in the Bill, but contains a rather spurious
use of the word &#147;new&#148;, in the phrase &#147;making a new
order&#148;. That is a deceptive use of language, because we are
actually talking about indefinitely extending an order that is already
in place, rather than a new order in any meaningful sense.</div>
					<a name="07070331000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">A few moments ago the Minister
said, &#147;Ah, but you&#146;ve got to remember that the five years
is a maximum figure. It could be lower than five years.&#148; That is
true, but the figure could be indefinitely higher than five years. The
right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said that
the period could be 10 or 15 years. Indeed, it could be any multiple of
five, yet no new evidence needs to be produced to apply for an
extension at all. What is more, under subsection (6) an order can be
made</div>
					<a name="07070331000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in anticipation of
an earlier order...ceasing to be in
force.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In new
clauses 3 and 4, we are arguing, first, that there should be a need for
fresh evidence over and above what was originally available when the
first five-year restriction was put in place. Secondly, there should be
the ability to consider again the possibility of a criminal
prosecution. A criminal conviction should be needed to give somebody a
second order. With both the proposed provisions, we are trying to give
the individual citizen who is subject to the orders some reasonable
expectation of when their liberties will cease to be curtailed so
restrictively under clause 6.</div>
					<a name="07070331000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the Bill, somebody who
has not necessarily committed a criminal offence can be restricted in
all the ways outlined in clause 6, which the Committee voted through.
They will have no ability to know how long those restrictions will be
in place. The figure of five years is slightly misleading, because if
the restrictions can be renewed and extended in multiples of five
without any new evidence being produced, five years is just a starting
point. If the Bill goes through unamended, some people will be
restricted for the rest of their lives in all the ways laid out in
clause 6 and in other ways unspecified in the Bill. As a Committee, we
should not allow that to pass into law and to disturb fundamentally the
balance between the state and the individual
citizen.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000486"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I support the amendment. I should also like briefly
to speak to amendments Nos. 111 and 112, which are in my name and which
are designed to have effects similar to those of amendment No.
9.</div>
					<a name="07070331000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My purpose is to
stop the rolling over of orders in the way that the hon. Gentleman has
described. In the Bill, provision is made for the rolling over of
orders without limit of time. There is no limit at all on the number of
orders that can be made seriatim, as lawyers used to call it before the
Latin tags were prohibited. That means consecutively. You knew that,
Mr. Bercow, but not everybody on the Committee
did.</div>
					<a name="07070331000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of the
Committee will have spotted that the application to make the fresh
order can be made before the existing order has come to an end, so they

<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>are genuinely rolling-over provisions. I do not want to rehearse all the
arguments that have already been made&#151;you have told us not to do
so, Mr. Bercow, and I understand why&#151;but it is
important to keep in mind the draconian nature of the orders that can
be made. As has been said repeatedly by hon. Members, the provisions
set out in clause 6 will impact on almost any aspect of a
person&#146;s life: where they live, with whom they communicate and
how they earn their living. They are draconian.</div>
					<a name="07070331000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly and differently, as I
said in the previous debate, page 31 of the Green Paper makes it quite
plain that the Government are contemplating using serious crime
prevention orders as an alternative to prosecution. Although it is
right, in a sense, to say that the orders are preventive, a policy of
using them as an alternative to prosecution, which is the stated
policy, comes very close to penal orders without the protection of the
convention on human rights, which is often invoked by the Minister.
Many of the important provisions of the convention apply only to
criminal procedure. For example, some of the provisions of article 6
have no application, as stated by the Lords in the case of McCann, so
we are dealing with a serious reduction in the liberty of subjects.
Given that background, one has to
ask&#151;</div>

however, article 6.1, on the right to a fair trial, will
apply.</div>

Bill. However, I have said relatively gently that we cannot&#151;and
will not&#151;rehash or reheat debates and arguments. I now appeal to
and exhort the right hon. and learned Gentleman during the remainder of
his remarks not to dwell on matters, however important he thinks that
they are, that the Committee has already addressed. I was hoping
shortly to hear the word &#147;renewal&#148; from him, as the

						</b> Forgive me, Mr. Bercow. The last thing
that I want is to transverse on your patience, but whether an order
should be renewed&#151;&#147;renewal&#148; is now firmly on the
table&#151;is to be determined by the nature of the orders. If the
orders were fairly minor in character, were surrounded by all the
safeguards that I have urged on the Committee and were of short 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>duration and applied to people who had committed criminal offences,
renewal would not be so
oppressive.</div>
					<a name="07070331000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all of
the considerations that I have identified do not exist, renewal will
become oppressive especially when we are dealing without a time limit
or occasion to that renewal. We are laying the foundations for a very
oppressive regime, and key to that is the power of the enforcement
agencies to ask the court for renewal. I have a fundamental objection
to the measure; it is not a slight objection. I hope therefore that the
Committee will reject the concept of the rolling renewal that is
contemplated by the Bill. The lead amendment is tabled in the name of
the hon. Member for Taunton, so it is up to him to determine whether to
withdraw
it.</div>

Brokenshire:
						</b> The issues arising from the amendment have
been highlighted effectively during the debate. There is clearly much
unease and uncertainty about the import of the provisions in relation
to the duration of the orders, how they would apply and what safeguards
and protections are in place to ensure that they are appropriate and
effective in terms of protecting the public, but we must not impose
undue conditions or restraints. Clearly, the duration of an order is
entirely relevant and appropriate when examining the breadth and scope
of the ambit of the protections offered. I shall therefore listen
carefully to what the Minister says in response to the points that have
been made. They have been made effectively and he has much to come back
on to justify the current
position.</div>

Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I oppose the amendment. As
a Government Back Bencher, I realise that it might be dangerous to do
so before the Minister has given his explanation of why we should
resist it. However, I do so on behalf of my constituents and I shall
briefly explain
why.</div>
					<a name="07070331000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the orders is the prevention of crime, and I see a distinction between
the two sides of the House on the aim of the orders. The courts ought
to anticipate the orders. We must bear in mind the seriousness of the
crime that we are dealing with. I am thinking about some of the cases
to which my constituents have been subjected, some of whom have been
victims of serious crimes, particularly those involving children or
violence against women. Some of these crimes do not just occur
overnight, but are planned over a long period of time. It seems right
to me that the court should anticipate whether a lot of planning was
involved in the
crime.</div>
					<a name="07070331000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
wrong if we, as a House of Commons, were not thinking on behalf of the
victim. If a court thinks that a crime is being planned, it should be
able to keep in place the restrictions on the people it believes to be
involved. I ask the Committee to think from the other
perspective&#151;that of people who have been victims of crime and
who we anticipate might be victims of crime in the future. If we know
that serious crimes are being planned and there is evidence that can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>be used in court showing that people who have been involved in such
crimes in the past might be involved, I agree that we should prosecute.
Is it not right simply to say that courts should intervene if we can
restrict people&#146;s behaviour to stop them being involved in crime
in the first
place?</div>

many times, and I have responded to
it.</div>
					<a name="07070331000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am merely
pointing out that by this point, the court will already have been
through a process of considering whether the person presented to it is
a risk to the public. It will have to have gone through that process.
We have discussed the process again and it is reasonable for the court,
with everything that it has had in front of it, to be able to
anticipate at the end of the order whether it needs to be put in place
again. Whether it is after one, two or five years&#151;the court can
impose an order of any length, not just five years&#151;if a court
realises that an order must be re-imposed, it would be wrong-headed
were it simply not able to do it. That would not give the protection to
the public that I want to
see.</div>

							<a name="07070331000499"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that powerful
contribution, which goes to the heart of the debate. My hon. Friend and
all hon. Members would defend civil liberties. We understand that,
but&#151;this is part of the reason for the Bill&#151;in certain
circumstances it is necessary for the victim&#146;s civil liberties
to be given a little more precedence than those of somebody who is
causing harm to a community and may cause it harm in the future. That
is my hon. Friend&#146;s point. It will be very difficult for us to
explain to our constituents if we pass a measure in Parliament that
prevents the court from doing something which could prevent harm to
them in the future. My hon. Friend&#146;s powerful speech reminds the
Committee and all hon. Members that there is a difficult balance to
strike between the rights of the individual subject and public
protection. We are trying to strike that balance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>and we ought to remember the civil liberties and rights of the victim as
much as we sometimes remember those of the perpetrators of crime. It
makes sense to include something in the clause to anticipate an earlier
order or provision ceasing to be in
force.</div>
					<a name="07070331000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
understand, to an extent, why the hon. Member for Taunton tabled the
amendments, but I hope&#151;although, given the debate, I am not that
hopeful&#151;that he will accept that they are unnecessary. He seeks
to provide a protection to subjects of orders so that the orders are
not renewed unreasonably on
expiry.</div>

							<b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): In a previous discussion,
the Minister mentioned a statistical likelihood of reoffending as a
reason for such a provision. In the context of renewal and talking
about victims, we could be led into talking about a victim when we have
not got one at this point. We are talking about potential crimes that
may be committed in future. Does the Minister feel that we have a role
in respect of victims even though we are talking about potential crimes
that may be committed in
future?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000501"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The whole point of serious crime prevention orders
is to prevent there being victims in future. A court will not give a
serious crime prevention order, or put one on an individual, if it did
not believe that it would prevent serious crime in future&#151;in
other words, the orders are to protect the public. That was the point
that my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley made and that is what I
say to the hon. Member for North Cornwall. I am sure that if he spoke
to his constituents in North Cornwall, many would say that they want
the public protected and victims&#146; rights given a little bit more
precedence and priority than is sometimes the
case.</div>
					<a name="07070331000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill already
provides protection to the subjects of the orders so that those are not
renewed unreasonably on expiry. I remind the Committee that for an
order to be renewed on expiry, as provided in the clause, the test in
clause 1 would have to be met in exactly the same way as if it were a
brand new application. The applicant authority would have to provide
then High Court
with</div>
					<a name="07070331000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reasonable grounds
to believe that the order would protect the public by preventing,
restricting or disrupting involvement by the person in serious
crime&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070331000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
already discussed in relation to clause 1, that provides an effective
test for applicant authorities to have to meet when applying for an
order. The test is explicitly laid out in clause 1, the implications of
which we have debated a number of times. Any renewal or new order that
is put in place has to meet that test, whether on the expiry of the
existing order or before a new order is
made.</div>
					<a name="07070331000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000502"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I should like to mention something, just so I am
completely clear about what &#147;renewal&#148; means in the
context of clause 1. People who have been convicted of a serious crime,
under any test that the Minister is presenting under clause 1, can
expect to be subject to orders forever because of the recidivism rate,
which is the evidence that he has given for them to be subject to an
order. People convicted of serious crimes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>will leave prison with all the other paraphernalia, including parole and
everything else, with the Prison Service and their time in prison
having failed to address their recidivism rate. The failure of our
public policy in this area will be addressed by these orders and people
can expect, on the balance of the reasonableness test in clause 1, to
be subject to them for the rest of their
lives.</div>
					<a name="07070331000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000503"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> There are a couple of points there. Without going
back to the standard of proof debate, the hon. Gentleman will know that
the matter is not dealt with on the balance of probability. First,
under clause 1, as we said, the standard of proof would be virtually
identical to the criminal standard, so it is not about the balance of
probability in respect of clause 1(1)(a). Secondly, of course one wants
to see the recidivism rate&#151;the reoffending rate&#151;reduced.
Of course, the hon. Gentleman raises a number of important issues about
what happens in prison, including how we prevent reoffending and the
sort of treatment that is given in prison for drug addiction. Of
course, the hon. Gentleman raises a number of important issues about
what happens in prison, including how we prevent reoffending and the
sort of treatment that is given in prison for drug addiction. All of
those are crucial and they need to be worked on and developed. My hon.
Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston will consider them in her new
role in the Ministry of
Justice.</div>
					<a name="07070331000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the need to develop policies in other areas is not a reason for making
available to the courts measures that might prevent crime in future.
All that we are doing here is adding to the options that the court
might choose to use in order to prevent harm to the community. The hon.
Member for Reigate makes a powerful point about the other issues that
need to be addressed. However, that is no reason for not doing this; it
is a reason for considering what more we need to do on other policies
while continuing to develop this
one.</div>

							<a name="07070331000504"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am very grateful to the Minister for giving way.
Perhaps he would reflect that he has done less than justice to the
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate. While clause
1(1)(a) imports something approaching the criminal standard, clause
1(1)(b) does not, in that it
says</div>
					<a name="07070331000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it has reasonable
grounds to believe&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070331000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of a conviction, the court has to be satisfied merely that
there are reasonable grounds to believe and&#151;as my hon. Friend

made indefinitely.

Coaker:
						</b> As I say, if somebody has been convicted of a
serious crime and, in the judgment of the court, continues to pose a
risk to the public, of course a serious crime prevention order should
be available to the courts. I apologise to the hon. Member for
Reigate&#151;I was not making light of his comments; I was agreeing
with him that more needs to be done in other areas, and that is what we
are trying to do. My point was that that is not an argument against
serious crime prevention orders, which should be available to the
courts should they choose to use them; it is an argument for developing
other policy alongside them.</div>

						</b> On precisely the point raised by the hon. Lady, of
course that choice is available&#151;it is the one that everybody
wants people to make&#151;but under these provisions, somebody can be
made subject to an order having finished a term of parole or as soon as
he is released from prison. The fact that he has been convicted is the
reason for his being made subject to an order. He has not said that he
will be a good boy&#151;at current rates, thanks to the failure of
policy, 85 per cent. of people who leave prison are not good boys; they
reoffend. A conviction is a reasonable ground under clause 1(1)(b) for
the application of one of these orders. My concern is that this measure
is being used as the easy way out because of the failure of our penal
policy to address recidivism in prison&#151;we will just pass orders
for ever on people, once they have been convicted of serious crime. Our
having to go down this route is an admission of a terrible failure in
our criminal justice system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000509"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I do not accept that at all. The hon. Gentleman
pointed out the first part of the test, which is a criminal conviction
for involvement in serious crime. I do not want to read out again
clause 1(1)(b), but the judgment of the Court has to be taken into
account. Involvement in serious crime is one part of the test. The
second part of the test is that the Court believes that such action
would protect the public by preventing crime. Is the hon. Gentleman
really saying that a serious crime prevention order should not be put
in place if the Court believes that somebody will commit crime in
future?</div>
					<a name="07070331000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends and I think that if a court judges that applying a serious

in this country will say, &#147;You impose that order.&#148; As my
hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley said, the individual can choose
to obey the law, as the vast majority of people in this country do, and
not be made subject to a serious crime prevention

Browne:
						</b> The Minister probably misunderstood my
intervention because I worded it badly by referring to him personally.
The point that I was trying to make is, how is someone with honourable
future intentions meant to demonstrate that good intent? At the moment,
the assumption would be made, on the basis of likelihood, that that
person would offend. If that person is not going to do so, it is
impossible for them to prove that they are going to be good in the

my remarks on that issue. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>No, I will move
on.</div>
					<a name="07070331000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">When considering
the renewal of orders, a High Court judgment on whether a person is
potentially a threat to the public because of their involvement in
serious crime is a far more relevant factor than what the order was
based upon or whether a specific period of time has elapsed.</div>
					<a name="07070331000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">To constrain the Court&#146;s
judgment in the ways that have been proposed could lead to the perverse
situation in which a court might feel that it was reasonable and
proportionate to grant an order to protect the public, but is unable to
do
so.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000522"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> The issue of renewal relates to the automaticity
that I fear we will set up in the system if the measure goes through as
drafted in the Bill. Once the reasonable test is passed, people who are
convicted of the offences in the schedule will automatically be subject
to these orders when they come out of prison. Those orders will be
automatically renewed unless a person can get themselves off the hook.
The issue is that if the recidivism remains, it is quite difficult to
see, as the hon. Member for Taunton says, how that would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>be established. It is the automaticity that is coming into the system
with these renewal orders that should concern the

reasonably. I do not believe that there is an automatic renewal in the
Bill. There is the possibility of renewal, providing that the tests set
out in the Bill are met. If the tests are not met, it is open to the
court to renew an order. I would find it hard to explain to one of my
constituents why a reasonable and proportionate order compatible with
convention rights was not put in place, when it could have prevented
harm to them and it could have prevented a serious
crime.</div>
					<a name="07070331000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the hon.

						</b> It is my understanding that a further renewal
of an order would be treated as a new order for the purposes of the

was stated:</div>

							<a name="07070331000541"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I have a specific concern regarding clause 18,
which I hope that the Minister can reassure me about, that relates to
the provisions dealing with applications to vary an order that may be
made by the relevant applicant authority. I assume that the situation
envisaged is that the authority that originally sought an order and had
it granted wishes to go back to the court for a variation on that
order. The conditions under which the authority is able to do that, as
set out in clause 18, are different from the conditions faced by the
person subject to an order who then wishes to go back to court to have
it varied. That causes me a little concern.</div>
					<a name="07070331000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18(4), which deals with
the conditions attached to the person subject to the order,
states:</div>
					<a name="07070331000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
court must not entertain an application by the person who is the
subject of the order unless it considers that there has been a change
of circumstances affecting the
order.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">By comparison,
however, clause 18(8)
states:</div>
					<a name="07070331000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
variation on an application under subsection
(3)(a)&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07070331000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other
words, an application for variation by the relevant applicant
authority&#151;</div>
					<a name="07070331000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
include an extension of the period during which the order, or any
provision of it, is in force (subject to the original limits
imposed)&#148;;</div>
					<a name="07070331000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other
words, the five-year time limit. But in the case of an applicant
authority making an application for variation, there is no requirement
regarding a change of circumstances. I am concerned about that, simply
because I do not think that the Government would wish to create a
position in which the relevant applicant authority can have another
bite of the cherry, in order to obtain a more stringent set of
restrictions on the liberty of the person subject to the order than it
was able to get in the first place.</div>
					<a name="07070331000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts should not be tied
up with repeated applications by the relevant authority, just to get a
few more restrictions than were obtained in the first place. The
Minister said earlier in relation to a different clause that it would
be for the court to decide what sort of restrictions are appropriate
and for how long. That was in connection with the argument that we had
about the proper duration of the orders. It would not be right in that
context for the relevant applicant authority to keep coming back to
court to make that application. Can the Minister explain why the
requirement that there should be a change of circumstances affecting
the order should not apply equally to applications for variation made
by the relevant authority, as well as to those made by the individual
subject to the
order?</div>

							<a name="07070331000542"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I just want to make a brief contribution because
new clause 2 is tabled in my name, and because it is a complicated
clause compared with others.</div>

noon</div>
					<a name="07070331000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present
there is no obligation on the state to keep the circumstances of the
order under review. That obligation to apply for a discharge or a
variation order rests with the defendant. My enthusiasm is to try to
make the state more accountable for its actions by placing that burden
of keeping the order under assessment, and to ensure that if there is a
consideration of discharge or a variation to the order, it is obliged
to undertake that.</div>
					<a name="07070331000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000543"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I should like to make a number of specific points.
First, would the hon. Member for Taunton forgive me if I disagreed with
new clause 2? I do not think that it would always be the case that the
enforcement agency would know about a change in circumstances. In
general terms, the change of circumstances would be known, if not
exclusively, then largely to the person who is the subject of the
order. My feeling is that it would be unfair to place that obligation
on the enforcement agency unless it had particular notice of a change
of circumstances. To that extent, I do not agree with the hon.
Gentleman, although I understand and agree with the overall motives of
what he is describing.</div>
					<a name="07070331000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to make three
specific points. First, I have some difficulty in understanding the
real purpose of clause 18: whether it is designed primarily to make
current orders more onerous, or less onerous. When one looks at clause
18(1), the criteria to which the courts have regard, it is not plain
from those what the over-arching purpose is.</div>
					<a name="07070331000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point builds on the
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. He is
entirely right that there is an imbalance here between the enforcement
agency and the person who is the subject of the order. The agency does
not have to establish any change of circumstance and, as my hon. Friend
says, it can make the order more onerous even if there has been no
change of circumstance. That is the effect of clause 18(8). However,
the person who is the subject of the order has to demonstrate a change
of circumstance. I do not like that imbalance because I see no reason
in principle why there should be an imbalance. The consequence, as my
hon. Friend rightly said, is that the enforcement agencies can simply
go back and seek to improve on the condition of the order from its
perspective, even if the omission was through their own fault in the
first place. I do not like that one little
bit.</div>
					<a name="07070331000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, if the
change of circumstance justifies an application by the person who is
the subject of the order, what are the criteria to which the court
should address itself when determining whether or not to make the
variation order? I am making absolutely no complaint as to the fact
that amendment No. 114 was not selected; decisions have to be made. At
least in that amendment, I tried to set out the criteria, which at the
moment do not exist at all in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070331000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two questions to put to
the Minister. First, what is the primary purpose of clause 18?
Secondly, what are the criteria to which a court should have regard
when it considers an application to vary made by the subject of an
order on the grounds of changing circumstances? The Committee requires
answers to those questions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>
					<a name="07070331000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000544"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. It is probably just as well for the
record to point out that amendment No. 114 was selected and it was,
indeed, debated with amendment No. 104 to clause
10.</div>
					<a name="07070331000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000545"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am sorry.</div>
					<a name="07070331000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000546"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I am glad that you mentioned amendment No. 104,
Mr. Bercow, because I was wondering what happened to
it.</div>
					<a name="07070331000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
clause 18 is to ensure that an order can be varied so that it can be
kept proportionate and reasonable by the applicant authority. I shall
come back to the points made by the hon. Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth and his right hon. and learned Friend, but the clause gives
the option to vary an order to either the subject or the applicant
authority. When either is significantly adversely affected, they may go
back to the High Court and say, subject to conditions being met, that
the order should be varied. The purpose is to bring proportionality and
reasonableness to the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070331000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, the applicant
authority is given the freedom to go back to the Court without having
to specify a change of circumstance to ensure that an order is not left
in place if it becomes disproportionate or inappropriate. The subjects
of orders are restricted from making similar applications to prevent
them from overloading the courts with repeated and baseless
representations about changes of circumstance. We have differentiated
the authority that has applied for and been granted an order to ensure
that such authorities have the power to change orders should it come to
their attention that that is appropriate. The different stipulations
for respondents are made because we do not want them continually to
make erroneous or spurious applications or to overload the
Court.</div>
					<a name="07070331000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000547"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> The Minister said that the variation provisions
were available to ensure that authorities could return to the court if
a particular facet of an order became disproportionate or
inappropriate. If that is the case, an order would become
disproportionate or inappropriate as a result of a change of
circumstances. I am not clear as to why a change of circumstances
should not be a requirement for an authority that goes back to the
Court to ask for a variation of an
order.</div>
					<a name="07070331000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000548"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> As I said, the applicant authority must be given
an unfettered right to apply for the variation of an order to ensure
that the order remains proportionate and appropriate. The distinction
is&#151;I am repeating myself&#151;that a respondent may not go
back to the High Court without specifying a change in circumstances.
Without that requirement, people might continually go back to the Court
with what we might term erroneous, insignificant or unimportant changes
of circumstance.</div>
					<a name="07070331000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000549"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I shall put it to the Minister another way because
what he is saying presents a difficulty. We shall not argue again about
whether the orders are penalties, but there can be no disagreement that
they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>can have severe implications. Given the severity of the orders, is it
not important that the person affected has certainty? They will never
have that certainty if the relevant authority is permitted to go back
to ask for a variation without there having been a change of
circumstance, including a variation that would make the requirements of
an order yet more
onerous.</div>
					<a name="07070331000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000550"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Again, the Government have made the right
distinction in the Bill, but the hon. Gentleman is arguing against it,
albeit reasonably. At the end of the day, whether or not the court had
to take account of a change of circumstances, if the applicant
authority was making it more onerous, it would still have to
demonstrate to the court what it intended to do and make its request to
the court in a way that was reasonable and proportionate and to the
satisfaction of the court. That is the safeguard. It is not necessary
for the applicant authority to have the restriction that we have placed
with respect to the respondent; in the end, the arbiter will still be
the court. It will be the court that makes the
judgment.</div>
					<a name="07070331000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
different situation with respect to the respondent, because there is a
different purpose. We are trying to ensure that we do not get a huge
number of baseless applications, while retaining the right of a
respondent to try to get an order varied if there is a significant
change of circumstance which they believe the court should take into
account.</div>
					<a name="07070331000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18
provides an important power for the court to make variations to an
order when appropriate. As I have said several times, the orders will
not be used for anything other than to prevent involvement in serious
crime, so when there has been a change in circumstances from when the
order was made, which means that the terms of the order are no longer
appropriate, an application can be made to the High Court under clause
18 to vary it.</div>
					<a name="07070331000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must resist
the new clause as it is unnecessary and undesirable and would place an
obligation on the relevant applicant authority that it could not
possibly fulfil. To answer the point made by the right hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham, how is the applicant authority
to know and hence inform the High Court, of every change in
circumstance that occurs, which would potentially give the subject of
the order the right to apply for variation or discharge?</div>
					<a name="07070331000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The orders will most often be
part of law enforcement efforts to manage serious career criminals for
their lifetime. However, it does not mean that they will be under
observation for 24 hours a day. It remains the case that the person
most likely to know of a relevant change of circumstances, which would
occasion the right to apply for a variation or discharge, is the
subject of the order
himself.</div>
					<a name="07070331000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
think about the practicalities, and what the change in circumstances
could possibly be. For example, what about the condition to use only
one mobile phone to prevent the use of clean and dirty phones? The
subject may take legitimate employment, which requires the use of a
work mobile and makes the order unreasonable without variation. How
would the applicant authority know of that? We have provided extensive
rights for the subject of an order and third parties to apply for
variation and discharge of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>order, which reflects the practical realities of how the orders will
work and achieves the aim of the hon. Member for Taunton in tabling the
new clause: that there is a means of ensuring that the terms of an
order are maintained in a reasonable
way.</div>
					<a name="07070331000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to the
right hon. and learned Gentleman, the purpose of the clause is to try
to ensure that when in place the orders are kept proportionate and
reasonable, hence the desire to allow people to apply to vary them
should there be a change of circumstances. Clause 18 provides an
effective protection, which will mean that the terms of the order are
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070331000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, I hope that the hon. Member for Taunton will seek to
withdraw the new clause.</div>
					<a name="07070331000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000551"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I want to respond to a couple of points about the
new clause, and I understand the concerns that were expressed. My
proposal does not exclude the defendant from applying for a variation,
but it also puts a burden on the authority in that regard.</div>
					<a name="07070331000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The orders have very severe
penalties, which may restrict a person going to their own home, their
working arrangements and their travel within the United Kingdom or
abroad, and the authorities should know if the circumstances of a
person who has had such restrictions imposed on their liberty change
substantially. As the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd said, we are not
talking about people who have stolen a Mars bar, but about really
serious criminals.</div>
					<a name="07070331000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister estimates that
about 30 people would be subject to these control orders in any given
year. They are serious criminals, as the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd
pointed out. Very small numbers of very serious criminals will have all
their liberties restricted, short of being sent to prison. In those
circumstances it is not unreasonable for the authorities to have an
idea about whether their circumstances have changed. Furthermore, if it
means that the police are more guarded about using these powers in all
but the most extreme circumstances, that is no bad thing
either.  For those reasons, I am keen to push the new clause to
a
vote.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000553"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I shall make a number of specific points. Once
again, we see an imbalance between the powers of the relevant applicant
authority and the powers of the person who is the subject of the order.
In the case of the relevant authority, there is no need for there to be
any change of circumstance, whereas in the case of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>subject of the order there is. I rather doubt whether the applicant
authority will be making any applications to discharge the orders save
as the result of some bargain made between the person who is the
subject of the order and the applicant authority.</div>
					<a name="07070331000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can contemplate a deal being
done between someone deemed to be a criminal who is already the subject
of an order, and the applicant authority. The deal would be something
like this: &#147;If you give us information, we will go to the court
and apply to discharge the order.&#148; Whether that is a good thing
or a bad thing depends on the transparency of the deal. I rather
suspect that neither the court nor the rest of us would learn about the
nature of the deal. While in some circumstances I might applaud the
deal, I am by no means willing to say that I would do so in all
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07070331000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
repeat what I said before in this Committee. Once public authorities
are given power it is always abused. It is a fundamental law of public
law. All power, once given to officials, is always at some stage or
other abused. This Committee, as representative of the House as a
whole, has to be very conscious of that.</div>
					<a name="07070331000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware, as I reminded
myself of the grouping under clause 10, that we have already debated my
amendment No. 115, which was intended to set out criteria as to the
considerations which the subject of the order would have to establish
in order to prove that the discharge order should be made. The problem
about the clause as it is currently formulated is that there is no
indication of what the applicant has to prove, other than a change in
circumstances. Once a change in circumstances has been established, it
is left at large as to the criteria that the courts should adopt. I
personally find that rather undesirable. I should have thought it
highly desirable that the Bill should say what considerations the court
should adopt.</div>
					<a name="07070331000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a slightly different point. What is the meaning of the
phrase,</div>
					<a name="07070331000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a change of
circumstances affecting the
order&#148;?</div>
					<a name="07070331000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
position where the applicant says, &#147;I have turned over a new
leaf&#148;? That is the point made by the hon. Member for Taunton. Is
a person who says, &#147;I have turned over a new leaf&#148; a
person who can say that there has been a change of circumstances
affecting the order? I do not know the answer to that. But it is rather
important. If the applicant can say that he comes within that rubric,
this is a form of appeal against the order once made. If not, if we are
dealing with a technical matter only&#151;for instance, &#147;I no
longer wish to use this particular mobile telephone, but I would like
to use another one,&#148; or, &#147;I do not want to use this bank
account; may I use another?&#148;&#151;it is a very limited right
to apply for a discharge of the order. I would welcome guidance from
the Minister on the meaning to be given to the phrase</div>
					<a name="07070331000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;change of circumstances affecting
the order&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07070331000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short, is
it an opportunity for people who have turned over a new leaf and who
want to lead a new life to ask for the order to be lifted? As I said, I
would like to see the criteria to be adopted by the court set out in
the Bill.</div>

Coaker:
						</b> I was not going to speak on clause 19 because many
of the arguments have already been rehearsed. However, the point raised
by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
about someone saying that they have turned over a new leaf is
important. Someone saying that they had turned over a new leaf would
not of itself be sufficient for the court, as the right hon. and
learned Gentleman will concede. If the person who was the subject of
the order could demonstrate his new circumstances to the court and show
how he had changed, the court might be able to consider it, but a
person saying simply that he had turned over a new leaf would not be
enough. The court would have to hear the evidence that the respondent
wanted to present in order to determine whether he had turned over a
new
leaf.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000555"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> The Minister makes a rather important statement. He
will know that the courts are entitled to consider ministerial
statements when determining the interpretation of statutes. I
understand plainly what he says&#151;that the applicant has to
produce evidence to show that he has turned over a new leaf. That is
wholly and utterly right. I accept that. However, he also says that if
the applicant can do that and the court is satisfied, as a matter of
fact, that he has turned over a new leaf, the change of circumstances
provision is established and the court can discharge the
order.</div>
					<a name="07070331000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000556"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> Only if it is relevant to the conditions imposed
under the serious crime prevention order. The subject of such an order
can say, &#147;I have turned over a new leaf. I can demonstrate to
the court how I have changed in the following ways&#151;A, B, C,
D.&#148; The court may be satisfied that the conditions that led to
the imposition of the order are no longer relevant because of that
change. That is something that the court can consider&#151;I see that
the right hon. and learned Gentleman is nodding. I realise that he is
not saying this, but a statement saying that someone had turned over a
new leaf would not be sufficient. I therefore hope that the clause will

Hogg:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in
clause 20, page 12, line 44, leave
out from &#145;concerned;&#146; to the end of line 1 on page
13.</div>
					<a name="07070331000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
small, but I suggest that it is surprisingly important. It would delete
the provision contained in subsection (7)(b), namely that an order can
be made by the Crown court in addition to an order &#147;discharging
the person conditionally&#148;. I do not want to go into too much
detail, but my wish to delete that paragraph goes back to an earlier
debate and the question of what offences should be caught or classified
as serious offences.</div>
					<a name="07070331000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
may remember that I had suggested that the penalty was a good way of
identifying those offences that should be treated as serious crimes
under the Bill. One thing is absolutely plain: in the generality 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>of cases, a person who has been conditionally discharged is being
treated extraordinarily leniently. It inevitably follows that an
offence that attracts a conditional discharge can in no sense, in
ordinary language, be considered serious. It is almost the least penal
of punishments that can be imposed. An absolute discharge is probably
the least penal, but a conditional discharge is the second least penal
or oppressive.</div>
					<a name="07070331000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
including that provision, we are enabling the Crown court to impose a
pretty draconian order&#151;we come to the arguments about clause
6&#151;in respect of somebody where the offence, as determined by the
nature of the penalty, is by definition pretty trivial. I do not like
the feel of that one little bit, especially when one considers the
renewal provisions that we have debated already. On any view, I would
say that subsection (7)(b) should be cut out of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07070331000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000558"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I support the amendment. In this context, we
have to look back at what has been said about the reason for seeking
serious crime prevention orders. I referred earlier to the fact that we
have been told that, in essence, it is anticipated that only 30
applications for serious crime prevention orders would be made a year.
We have been told that the intent would be to use them for the
&#147;Mr. Bigs&#148;&#151;in other words, a small,
narrowly defined group of serious offenders. In considering the Bill
and how it is framed, it is appropriate to consider not only the types
of offences that are specified in schedule 1 as denoting seriousness
for the purposes of the Bill, but the range of punishment that might be
available.</div>
					<a name="07070331000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. and learned Friend has focused on the point about conditional
discharges. It would seem strange that one of those 30 orders against a
Mr. Big would apply to someone who had received a
conditional discharge, because that would suggest that the court did
not regard the offence as serious in that context. My right hon. and
learned Friend has made a persuasive case and therefore certainly has
my support from the Front Bench in pursuing the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07070331000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000559"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> Briefly, I, too, would like to support the
amendment that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford
and North Hykeham has moved, for the reasons given by him and, from the
Front Bench, by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch.</div>
					<a name="07070331000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">A substantial imbalance would
be created if subsection (7)(b) were to remain in the Bill, because
somebody receiving a conditional discharge can receive such an order in
consequence of a criminal conviction only if either their involvement
in the offence was minimal or their personal circumstances were so
remarkable that that was thought to be the appropriate decision in the
case. In either situation, for that to be the criminal penalty and for
a civil order placing extraordinarily onerous restrictions then to be
imposed would give the lie to the argument that the provisions are only
preventive and not punitive, and that they are designed purely to
ensure that those with a serious and detailed involvement either in a
previous commission of serious crime or in a likely future one need to
be controlled. Those are not the individuals who are likely to be
subject to such an order. If the Minister were to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>insist on retaining the provision in the Bill, I suspect that his other
arguments would be substantially
undermined.</div>
					<a name="07070331000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000560"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> It is fair to say that 30 was an approximate
figure for the number of orders that we thought might be used by the
courts in any one year. Of that figure, I do not expect that many would
be used on the back of a conditional discharge.</div>
					<a name="07070331000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, one could foresee a
situation in which it might be useful for the courts to have the power
to impose a serious crime prevention order, should they believe that to
be appropriate in the circumstances. For example, suppose someone who
is a serious criminal has been convicted of a serious offence, however
defined&#151;in schedule 1 or at the court&#146;s
discretion&#151;but is too ill or old to go to prison. In those
circumstances, people are sometimes given conditional discharges, even
though they have committed serious
offences.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07070331000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that situation, it might be that a serious crime prevention order could
be given to the individual concerned. The person could communicate, so
one could make them the subject of a serious crime prevention order by
saying that there will be restrictions on their communication. That is
one example of a situation in which such an order might be appropriate.
There might well be others. A conditional discharge is sometimes given
to somebody who is found guilty of a serious offence. In those
circumstances, the court ought to have the ability to use a serious
crime prevention order if it thinks it appropriate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000561"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I suspect that, in the circumstances that the
Minister has described, it is far more likely that the criminal court
would impose a suspended sentence rather than a conditional discharge,
which is a wholly different response to such a
situation.</div>
					<a name="07070331000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000562"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The court might well give a suspended sentence,
but, with respect, I am talking about a situation in which it gives a
conditional discharge. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that
the court might well give a suspended sentence. Given that I have
conceded that point, however, he must concede that it might also give a
conditional discharge, in which case a serious crime prevention order
would be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07070331000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000563"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> Will the Minister contemplate the fact that
under the amendment, it would be open to the court to acknowledge that,
if a conditional discharge order was given, a serious crime prevention
order would not be applicable? Will he weigh that as a factor in
determining what an appropriate sentence would
be?</div>
					<a name="07070331000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000564"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> My understanding of the amendment is that it would
make it impossible for the Crown court to make an order where somebody
has been made the subject of a conditional discharge. That is
absolutely the point of the amendment. With respect to the hon.
Gentleman, that is the point of disagreement. I think that there might
be circumstances in which a serious crime prevention order should be
available to the court where somebody has been conditionally
discharged.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>
					<a name="07070331000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(7) is drafted to show that the orders are not a form of punishment and
that they must be viewed separately from the disposal that the court
makes in relation to a person who has been found guilty of a serious
offence. The court may impose an order only in addition to the
punishment that it hands down for the offence, or in addition to a
conditional discharge. That is an important point of principle: in this
area, as in others, the orders are not designed as an alternative to
the criminal process of prosecution and punishment.</div>
					<a name="07070331000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The practical effect of the
amendment, which is the effect that I believe the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham is trying to achieve,
would be to ensure that an order would not be available to the court
where its disposal was a conditional discharge. I do not agree with
that; the proposed subject of the order might have been conditionally
discharged, but would also have just been found guilty of a serious
offence. Notwithstanding the fact that the court has considered it
expedient to issue a conditional discharge, it should be open to the
court to put in place a reasonable, proportionate order, if it
considers that such an order would protect the public by preventing,
restricting or disrupting the subject&#146;s involvement in serious
crime. For those reasons, I hope that the right hon. and learned
Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div>

						</b> I wonder whether we can see a way forward here. I
like to be collegiate occasionally. The Minister is wrong when he says
that the orders are not intended as an alternative to prosecution. We
know full well that they are; page 31 of the White Paper makes that
wholly
plain.</div>

						</b> We discussed this in the previous sitting. It is
actually the Green Paper. Whatever it says, we are discussing the Bill.
I have made it quite clear, as does the Bill, that we do not see the
orders as an alternative to
prosecution.</div>

							<a name="07070331000567"></a>Mr.

						</b> If it waddles like a duck, looks like a duck and
sounds like a duck, it is a duck. This legislation is an alternative to
prosecution because it sounds like a duck, waddles like a duck and
looks like a duck&#151;and it has been described as a duck in
previous publications. It is a duck.</div>
					<a name="07070331000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am perfectly willing to
accept that the Minister has made a valid, though narrow, point in
relation to conditional discharge. I can see that it is a theoretical
possibility that there are individuals who are so ill or so old that
they are unlikely to go out and commit serious offences, but who might
make suggestions to third parties who do so. I hope that he, in turn,
will accept that this provision is a creeping mechanism that allows
serious orders to be made in respect of fairly trivial
matters&#151;each of us has a point.</div>
					<a name="07070331000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a way forward. I
suggest that the Minister amend the Bill on Report so as to include the
concept that the court has made a conditional discharge by reason of
some personal circumstance associated with the person who is the
subject of the conditional discharge. We can talk about whether there
should be specific reference to old age, sickness, or anything else. I
accept that his point has merit, so if he were to ring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>fence the concept in order to reflect it, he would
find me extraordinarily collegiate. On that basis, I beg to ask leave

Subject to the terms of section 16 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, the

128.</div>
					<a name="07070331000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">This may be quite
an important amendment. It is an amendment to the forfeiture powers
contained in the clause. I draw two specific facts to the attention of
the Committee. Subsection (2) makes it plain that an order can have an
effect in respect to a property in which a third party has an interest.
When one approaches the clause, one assumes that the only person who
has an interest in the property which is capable of being forfeited is
the person who has committed the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>substantive offence under clause 26. Clearly and inevitably, one must
recognise that other people may have an interest. They may be partial
owners or have an equitable interest and so on. They may be a hire
purchase company, for example. Therefore, third parties can have an
interest in property which is the subject of the forfeiture
order.</div>
					<a name="07070331000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5)
states that the forfeited property can be destroyed, and that is a
pretty permanent outcome. Therefore, a property that is subject of a
third party claim can be destroyed under the forfeiture order. That is
the background, which is quite serious. One looks at the forfeiture
powers in the clause to see if one can find any guidance over the
approach that the courts will adopt. I have heard the Minister many
times say, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, Mr. Hogg, it is all
in the convention.&#148; I have in front of me the Human Rights Act
1998 and, in particular, the convention. I suspect that the Minister
will say it is covered by article 1 of the first protocol, which
provides that</div>
					<a name="07070331000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every
natural legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his
possessions.&#148;</div>

shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and
subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general
principles of international
law.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is motherhood
and apple pie. The article continues:</div>
					<a name="07070331000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The preceding provisions shall
not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such
laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance
with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other
contributions or
penalties.&#148;</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07070331000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is pretty
general stuff. If I were a person whose interest in property would be
affected by a forfeiture order, I would not draw much comfort from the
article; I would have some difficulty in spelling out the approach that
the court would adopt. We are saying of and to the courts, &#147;You
are going to be the legislators, because by your interpretation of this
article, you are going to provide the safeguards that Parliament has
not provided.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07070331000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is deeply offensive; it is
the business of Parliament to spell out in legislation the criteria
that the court should adopt in the context of such matters. In any
event, such protection as is afforded in article 1 and elsewhere in the
convention is so much in the hands of the court that it leads me to
think that, unless we put the provisions that I contemplate in the
amendment into the Bill, we are neither providing proper protection nor
doing our duty.</div>

							<a name="07070331000577"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> I point out to the right hon. and learned
Gentleman that subsection (2) gives people with an interest in property
the right to make representations to the court, which will consider
whether forfeiture is reasonable and proportionate. We have included
that proposal to ensure that it is reasonable.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>
					<a name="07070331000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. and learned
Gentleman has done me a great service: he has saved me having to read
out article 1. Without wishing to be sarcastic or flippant, there is a
debate to be had on the interpretation of these articles and their
application. On the protection of property, article 1 says that where
it is in the public interest, consistent with the law of the country,
just, and done appropriately through the courts, forfeiture of property
is not inconsistent with compliance with human rights
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07070331000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. and learned Gentleman may say that it is not appropriate in
these circumstances, or that he does not agree with it, but that does
not make it any the less a fact that it is included in the protocol,
for the very reasons that we are discussing: when the state wishes to
pursue a particular line in order to prevent crime or to prevent people
from benefiting from crime, they can clearly use that part of the
protocol.</div>
					<a name="07070331000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is unnecessary, and I shall try not to reiterate earlier
points in explaining my reasons for rejecting it. The clause is a way
of ensuring that those involved in serious crime do not seek to flout
its provisions. As well as the offender risking imprisonment for breach
of an order, it will be open to the court to order the forfeiture of
anything in the offender&#146;s possession at the time of the
offence, and that it considers to have been involved in that
offence.</div>
					<a name="07070331000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
when someone has been found guilty of an offence relating to the
distribution of child abuse material via the internet, it might be
reasonable to place an order that forbids them from owning a personal
computer. That would force them to use public access computers, from
which they could not disseminate such material, if they needed access
to the internet. If they were then found, in contravention of the
order&#146;s terms, to own a personal computer, it is reasonable that
it should be forfeited. That is the purpose of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07070331000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is unnecessary, because we do not need&#151;as I have said on a
number of occasions&#151;to tell the High Court to act justly and
proportionately in operating this provision, as it will do so whether
we tell it to or not. For that reason, I resist this amendment and hope
that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw
it.</div>
					<a name="07070331000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07070331000578"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The Minister mentioned the seizure of
computers in the context of, say, a child pornography case. I want to
be clear about something. Is he saying that, if an offence is committed
and the court rules that an order is made, there is not a right of
forfeiture in law under other legislation and, therefore, there is a
need to make a serious crime prevention order? Alternatively, would
other provisions in other statutes apply to enable that forfeiture to
operate? It is important that we are clear about whether he is saying
that an SCPO would be required to cover the facts that he has
given.</div>
					<a name="07070331000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000579"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> This is an additional way of ensuring that crime
is prevented. With those explanations, I hope, as I said, that the
right hon. and learned Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000580"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> No, I will not. Although the Minister has been
gracious in his reply, I disagree with him. He is right in saying that
clause 27(2) enables third parties to make representations, but there
is no guidance at all in the Bill about the criteria that the court
should address when listening to those representations. The Minister
will say, &#147;Well, then you go to the convention.&#148; That is
so. I shall not read from the convention again, though, because I have
done so once.</div>
					<a name="07070331000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing in article 1 of the first protocol that says anything about
justice and proportionality. Whether or not the courts will apply a
test of justice and proportionality will apply, first, in accordance
with their determination as to whether any article applies and,
secondly, in accordance with their construction of what is justice and
proportionality in the context of the intended objectives of the
legislation and the protection afforded by the article. The Minister
may or may not be right in saying that the courts, on a forfeiture
application, would construe justice, necessity and proportionality as
necessary criteria. In any event, these are sliding scales that reflect
the gravity of the particular facts of the
case.</div>
					<a name="07070331000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Committee as robustly as I can to consider a further point. Time and
again, the Minister has said, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, the
convention will always apply.&#148; The truth is that it will not
always apply; it will sometimes apply. If the Minister says,
&#147;Right, then Parliament never need incorporate into the Bill the
protecting clauses that historically we have always thought
necessary&#151;not even in criminal cases&#148;, one might as well
remove the words &#147;knowingly and intentionally&#148;, which are
often found in criminal legislation, because the Minister will say,
&#147;Oh, don&#146;t worry, articles 6.1 and 6.2 will
apply.&#148; However, this is not the way
forward.</div>
					<a name="07070331000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
are a necessary safeguard, but they do not relieve us of our
obligation. We should be in the business of spelling out in legislation
what we deem to be the necessary criteria and protections, and we
should not rely on general language in the articles that may or may
not, depending on the circumstances, apply in a particular case. This
is not the way forward. We have a duty and we are not performing it.
For that reason, I will not beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07070331000594"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I rise briefly to seek clarification on
petitioning and the powers of winding up. From my reading of clause
28(1), those are intended to apply when an offence has been committed
under section 26 and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director
of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions or the director of the Serious
Fraud Office determines that it would be in the public interest to seek
a petition to wind up the company; in other words, an offence has been
committed and that is deemed the appropriate way to dispose of the
breach.</div>
					<a name="07070331000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
about the amendments and how they apply relates to the factors that the
directors would take into account in determining what is in the public
interest. Are they intended to be as wide as possible? Can the Minister
give examples of what would be appropriate in the circumstances? We are
talking about corporate entities and there would have been some sort of
breach. In some ways, the issue goes back to my intervention during the
debate about the liability of directors during our discussion of clause
26. I want to gain an understanding of how the Bill is intended to
operate and how discretion is intended to be applied in allowing the
winding up of companies for such
breaches.</div>
					<a name="07070331000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000595"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right; as he says, the
clause deals with companies that have breached a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>serious crime prevention order. In such cases, the applicant authorities
can go back to the court to seek a winding-up order against such
companies. The hon. Gentleman asks what sorts of offences the companies
would have to have committed. The obvious answer is that if the company
had not complied with the conditions imposed by the serious crime
prevention order, it would clearly be in breach of the order, and the
applicant authority would go back to the court to seek the winding-up
order.</div>
					<a name="07070331000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000596"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I understand that point. Obviously, the
Minister has mentioned the first limb of the test for whether an
offence has been committed under clause 26. I was seeking to press him
on the second limb&#151;the application of the consideration of the
public
interest.</div>
					<a name="07070331000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07070331000597"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman should come back to me if I
have misunderstood his question. If he is asking me how we define
&#147;in the public interest&#148; in respect of determining
whether a company should be wound up, that would be a matter for the
court, which would determine what was reasonable and proportionate. The
public interest test is the prevention of crime and the reduction of
harm. The conditions placed on the company are about reducing harm and
preventing crime; if they are broken, the applicant authorities will
apply for a winding-up order. That is the public interest test, which
we want to be
observed.</div>

of the court, and about the determination by the director, rather than
the court, on whether the application should be
made.</div>
