</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 396.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The amendments relate to the establishment and functions of standards committees and are intended to clarify the Bill's provisions. Amendment No. 395 clarifies the ability of the standards committee of a district council to delegate its functions in relation to parishes to a sub-committee, should the authority choose to appoint one. In all other circumstances, we have provided that the standards committee cannot delegate any of its functions. The amendment is necessary to allow a parish sub-committee that is set up by an authority to carry out its intended functions. Amendment No. 396 replicates the provision for Wales.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): You are obviously in a hurry to get home, Mr. O'Brien, so I shall quickly interject.
<P>
The National Association of Local Councils is concerned about the role of parishes in the new arrangements. It wants standards committees for parish or town councils to be established at county rather than district level in order to minimise the risk of a conflict of interest. Irrespective of that, the NALC wants the Secretary of State to issue clear guidance that the sub-committees are to be separate from the principal authority's standards committee so that the separation of functions is clear.
<P>
The Bill provides that a district council's standards committee, which is responsible for monitoring standards in parish and town councils, or a sub-committee must include at least one member of any of the parish councils for which it is responsible. The NALC is calling for the membership of standards committees or sub-committees to include town and parish council representatives and independent members, who collectively will form a majority. However, given the Government's track record on that, I am not terribly hopeful.
<P>
There is also the smaller matter of allowances. The Bill enables the Secretary of State to authorise principal authorities, but not parish or town councils, to pay their members allowances in respect of such expenses or to arrange for the care of children or dependants—which my local authority has done— and other costs incurred in carrying out their duties as members. Understandably, NALC sees no good reason why parish or town councils should be excluded from those measures.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We stay in close contact with NALC. Indeed, I am a former vice-president of the organisation. We discussed the matter in some detail when the House last debated local government legislation. The problem is the sheer number of parish councils. If the parish was represented on the standards committee at the county tier, and if the NALC agreed that at least one member of each parish or town council should be represented on the sub-committee, the resulting committees would be huge because many counties have dozens of parish councils. That is the problem.
<P>
We have discussed the matter with NALC, and it understands what we want to achieve. It wants regulations that safeguard its position on the standards committees of district councils. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we intend to introduce the regulations to provide for that. Indeed, we shall do whatever we can to safeguard the position of parish councils, but we must not make the whole thing unwieldy by including them at county level. It would be unworkable.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with those assurances.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 51, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>STANDARDS COMMITTEES OR SUB-COMMITTEES FOR COMMUNITY COUNCILS</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment made: No. 396 in page 35, line 10, leave out subsection (7) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any function which by virtue of the following provisions of this Part is exercisable by or in relation to the standards committee of a relevant authority which is a community council is to be exercisable by or in relation to—

Clause 52, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 75</center></H4>
<H4><center>DISCLOSURE AND REGISTRATION OF MEMBERS' INTERESTS ETC.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 507, in page 52, line 4, leave out `Every' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The monitoring officer of each'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 508 and 509.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I beg your pardon for being slow to start, Mr. O'Brien—I thought that my colleague, the Welsh Minister, was to speak to these amendments, but he has had to leave.
<P>
Clause 75 deals with the declaration and registration of members' interest. The monitoring officer is required to establish and maintain a register of interests, and the clause provides that the Secretary of State may prescribe in regulations the circumstances in which standards committees may grant dispensation. Amendment No. 507 is simply a drafting amendment to clarify the fact that the monitoring officer is responsible for maintaining the register of members' interests. Amendment No. 508 removes the definitions of ``partner'' and ``household'' in clause 75.
<P>
We have looked at the issue closely, as it forms a difficult part of the existing code of conduct. The requirements for the code are scattered throughout primary and secondary legislation, and we need to clarify precisely whose interests need to be registered and declared. Unfortunately, the clause does not yet achieve that clarity, which is why we are amending it. It is important to get that aspect of the framework right; we therefore want to discuss with local government the best and most suitable formulation to achieve the necessary precision for the code of conduct.
<P>
I firmly believe that the model code of conduct is the most suitable place to include such definitions, as that will enable members to refer to the code for all the information that they need, rather than perpetuating a confusing mixture of primary and secondary legislation in the framework.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 509 is a technical amendment to correct a cross-reference in the clause. It does not affect the substance of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 52, line 27, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Any regulations that are made under subsection (5) shall provide that, in respect of interests arising solely from the occupation of residential property owned by a local authority, any dispensation in favour of a member of that authority occupying on a secure tenancy under the Housing Act 1985 shall be granted in no less favourable terms to any member holding on a lease from that authority.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The matter is small, technical and probably above my head, but I shall try to deal with it anyway. It has been suggested by a property lawyer, so perhaps it will meet with some agreement from Labour Members.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Declare the interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I have no interest to declare.
<P>
The amendment deals with an anomaly regarding the residential status of a tenant or leaseholder. Its purpose is to correct the current anomaly whereby councillors who are tenants enjoy general dispensation granted by the Secretary of State under appendix 1 of circular 16/92, whereas councillors who are leaseholders enjoy no such general dispensation. By that dispensation, members may participate and vote on matters in which they have an interest no different from that affecting the generality of tenants. The same should apply to leaseholders in respect of any interest they may have that is no different from that affecting the generality of leaseholders. Essentially, there does not seem to be any reason why a certain type of councillor should be excluded from an interest simply because of his or her residential status.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The amendment would widen one of the existing categories of general dispensation that enable members to participate in considering and voting on issues in which they have a pecuniary interest. It is similar to an amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats in the other place.
<P>
As I have already said in relation to previous Government amendments, one of our aims is to clarify and simplify the existing rules and regulations in codes of conduct. Indeed, the existing rules on registration, declaration of interests and general dispensations are complex and are contained in a variety of different places. We want to rectify that. Although the amendment raises a useful question about the types of interest that might require a general dispensation—a question that we will need to consider in developing the code of conduct—it is unnecessary because the existing rules are to be replaced. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
As I have already suggested, we propose that rules on registration and declaration of interests should become part of the code of conduct for members. Alongside that, we have already made provision in clause 75 for the standards committee to take on the role of considering dispensation requests. Where it remains appropriate, we envisage that any general categories of dispensation, such as the one contained in circular 16/92, might also be covered in the code.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): The Under-Secretary will be well aware that that answer is almost identical to the answer given to my noble Friend in another place when she moved a similar amendment. Nevertheless, it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would tell the Committee whether the Government accept the principle behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) that the issue should be covered in the code of conduct.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We certainly accept the principle, but we want to ensure that councillors in similar situations, or those who have a similar relationship with the council vis-à-vis their residential status should be treated the same in respect of any general dispensation. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am touched that the Under-Secretary has accepted the principle of the amendment. In view of her undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>STANDARDS BOARD FOR ENGLAND</center></H4>
{**P5**}Mr. Loughton: I beg to move amendment No. 571, in page 35, line 22, leave out `three' and insert `five'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also take amendment No. 572, in page 35, line 23, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Standards Board for England must be comprised of persons possessing such qualifications as may be determined by the Secretary of State.
<P>
(2B) Qualifications under subsection (2A) shall include not less than four years' continuous service as either a member or officer of a relevant authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> With clause 53, we come to an important part of the new structure; the Standards Board for England and the equivalent body for Wales, a potentially powerful body. Amendment No. 571 would simply increase the minimum size of the board because, as it stands, its minimum size is three members, and a chairman and deputy chairman must be appointed. That is a small group, and would seem to be grossly unfair to the poor person who is not appointed as chairman or deputy chairman. Given the Government's determination that even the most vexatious complaints about councillors' conduct will be considered by that national body rather than at local or regional level, it is worrying that the Bill provides for that body to comprise as few as three members, all of whom will be appointed by the Secretary of State. Given the Government's performance in appointing the board members of regional development agencies, it does not exactly inspire confidence that Standards Board members will be chosen entirely on the basis of appropriate knowledge and expertise. That is where the second amendment comes in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to the second amendment, has he taken into account the possible implications of paragraph 10 of schedule 3? That paragraph relates to the requirement for board members to declare interests, which might lead to situations in which the number is fewer than three.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We shall discuss that in more detail in relation to schedule 3, but it is an interesting point and not an entirely hypothetical one. For the board of such a powerful body to be made up of a small clique of three people, all appointed by the same person, with unclear accountability to the House, is far from satisfactory, especially given the power that the Standards Board will wield over the lives of members of local authorities, officers and anyone connected with them. As we shall soon see in relation to clause 56 and the ethical standards officers, about whom we have severe reservations, the board will have the power to make councillors' lives a misery by losing those ethical standards officers on to them to look into their affairs. It is important, therefore, that the system is seen not to be susceptible to political influence. The more members of the Standards Board there are, the more difficult it will be to corrupt or cajole it.
<P>
Returning to the point made by the hon. Member for Bath, there is also a question of work load. The Standards Board will be the first port of call for grievances, no matter how trivial or self-evidently ludicrous they are. The board will require more members simply so that it can give proper consideration to all the cases coming before it. It is also important that councillors feel that they are being judged by people who know what they are talking about and who have experience of the situations in which councillors find themselves from time to time while conducting their duties.
<P>
Amendment No. 572 seeks to ensure that members of the Standards Board for England have experience by providing that they must have sat on or worked for a local authority continuously for four years. They would still be excluded from appointment if they were councillors at the time of appointment. Four years seems reasonable—that is the normal length of a councillor's term of office. The minimum provision would not be demanding. It would ensure that those chosen at least had knowledge of the workings of local authorities, which is essential given that the subject is technical. As an added bonus, the amendment would also diminish the pool from which the Secretary of State could allocate posts, reducing the power of patronage inherent in the appointment of such a body. Essentially, we want to strengthen the credibility of the Standards Board. Many people have expressed fears that it is a powerful body. As such, we should have as many properly accountable people on it as possible.
<P>
The Minister might like to comment on the legal position of board members sued for incompetence or unreasonableness. Will they be afforded immunity from victims of ethical standards officers who feel that they have been unreasonably treated and have been cleared of wrongdoing? Will such people have redress and will there be immunity against that redress? We might return to the terms of appointment of those members when we consider schedule 3. The position is far from clear. Given the vagueness of the arrangements in particular, it is essential that the board is bigger and that its members are as experienced as possible in the field in which they have been appointed to participate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. We wish to use the amendments to probe the Minister's thinking about the shape of the Standards Board, its staff and the administrative details. As my hon. Friend noted, the three appointed members could find themselves dealing with a huge backlog of cases produced by the ethical standards officers. Will officials conduct most investigations, with the three appointed members simply rubber-stamping dozens of decisions as the officials produce them? Will there be opportunities for proper hearings during investigations? Does the Minister know where the board will be based and how many staff it will have? Will she tell us how much it will cost to run? Will the ethical standards officers be based centrally or will they be scattered regionally? Such details are important and we need to know them at this stage.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Perhaps I should have intervened earlier. Amendment No. 571 certainly contains a misapprehension. ``Three'' refers to the quorum. There must never be fewer than three people present at a board meeting. We intend to appoint five or even six people as board members, but the minimum size of the board when it meets will be three. We will appoint more than three people, but like any board or committee, people will not be able to attend a particular meeting for circumstances that are beyond their control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am not convinced. The Bill patently says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Standards Board for England is to consist of not less than three members.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nowhere does it say that three is a quorum or that there will be more than three members. Is the Standards Board the organisation, or is it the gathering of that organisation in the form of the board doing its work? In that case, the quorum would apply, but that is not clear, which is why we have tabled the amendments. They are obviously needed.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman does get worked up. The reality is that the board will never be fewer than three, and that is what the Bill stipulates—a minimum of three. We will usually appoint five or perhaps six people as members of the board. Two members might be substantially indisposed, but we would never allow the board to meet unless there was a minimum of three. I understand the confusion and difficulty, but the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham knows that the terms were drawn up by previous Governments. The language has been used for non-departmental public bodies in other legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Committee is well aware that if the Minister's intentions are clearly on the record, then that is what we will follow. However, as I share the confusion of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, will she clarify the matter further in case a problem arises? Will the same interpretation apply to the regulations that the Secretary of State makes on the size and composition of standards committees? Did our discussion on the number of people who are likely to be on a standards committee relate to the quorum rather than the total number of people who could be appointed to it?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They are very different bodies. One is a committee of the council; the other is an independent standards board. Members are appointed to the board in the usual way. If we appoint six members and two become indisposed—for example, one might die and another might be ill—the membership will be down to four. The appointments procedure cannot take place overnight. To ensure that the board can continue, the minimum number of members will be three at any one time. If three are not present, the board cannot perform its duties.
<P>
Our discussion on the standards committee related to the minimum number of people who could serve on it, although the Bill does not express it in that way. We said that at least one independent person, two members of the council and so on should be on the committee. The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) said that a standards committee of three would be possible. We wanted the guidance to specify more than three, but it is difficult to say that the two bodies are comparable and that two comparable rulings can be applied to them. The cases are not the same and I do not want to mislead the Committee by pretending that they are.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The statutory minimum provided for is not really a quorum but in effect it operates as one. The board could not operate if membership fell below that number. The amendment would therefore be unnecessarily restrictive, and could cause problems, in the event of membership dropping even temporarily below five. I hope that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham understands that appointment to NDPBs is a lengthy and rigorous procedure with several stages, which is overseen by, I think, the office for public standards. We must abide by its rulings in respect of appointments. I raise that in relation to amendment No. 572, which deals with the qualifications of people appointed to the board.
<P>
We do not propose to specify the composition of the board and there will be no reserved places. We intend to appoint members from a range of backgrounds. I wondered whether the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham would at least blush while speaking to the amendment, because this morning we heard him ranting about membership of a council not being a necessary qualification for understanding what went on in councils. However, now he has moved an amendment under which only those who had served for four years could be members of boards. We have made it clear that those people will not be excluded, but we want to ensure that people from a range of backgrounds participate. We shall welcome applications from people with direct local government experience, but may also want to consider appointing people with experience and expertise in other areas relevant to the board's function. We might want, for example, to appoint someone with a legal background. The amendment would restrict the Secretary of State's ability to do that. All appointments should also be made on merit and we therefore propose that they should be made in accordance with the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, which is what I meant to say earlier.
<P>
The amendment would also impose a requirement for board members to have had four years' continuous service as a member or officer of a relevant authority. We are keen to obtain local government experience for the board, but believe that others have a contribution to make. Its full remit would include setting the strategic direction for the board, setting up its staffing structure and making decisions on operational matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I have been conscious at the back of my mind of having read something that contradicted what the Minister of State was saying earlier. I have now lighted upon it. The Minister said quite categorically that the quorum of the Standards Board is to be three. I draw her attention to paragraph 9(1) of schedule 3, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Standards Board may regulate its own procedure (and in particular may specify a quorum for meetings).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill states that it is for the board to determine its quorum.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I slightly misled the Committee, but I later corrected myself. I should have said that it is a quorum in effect only. We believe that there should never be fewer than three people on the board, so it should be larger; otherwise, if two members died, the board would cease to operate until at least three more members had been appointed.
<P>
As I was saying, that in order for the board to carry out its full remit, including setting its strategic direction, setting up its staffing structure and making decisions on operational matters, it will be necessary for it to reflect a range of general skills. We believe that those skills may best be found by opening up the appointments to candidates from a variety of backgrounds, which is why we oppose amendment No. 572.
<P>
It will be for the board to determine the appropriate level of staffing and so on. However, the explanatory notes make it clear that any increase in the costs to local government of the introduction of the new ethical framework should be offset by savings arising from the introduction of the new decision-making arrangements. A budgetary provision of £7 million a year has already been made available by the Department to cover the costs of establishing and running the new Standards Board, which is comparable to the cost of the local government ombudsman.
<P>
I hope, in the light of my explanation, that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> What an effort that was. When is a quorum not a quorum? Apparently it is when it is called a board. Absolutely nowhere in the Bill is it made clear that what the Minister has now defined as the board is not the board as we would recognise it—that is, the Standards Board—but a meeting of the board that must be of no fewer than three people. The Minister has entirely redefined clause 53. Nowhere in the clause or in schedule 3 is it defined otherwise.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have made it clear that the board can never be fewer than three people. That relates not only to its meetings but to its continuation, as I made clear in response to the hon. Member for Bath. I say it again so that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is under no illusion: at no time shall the board be fewer than three people. Circumstances over which we have no control dictate that the board should be bigger than that. Therefore, we shall probably appoint five or six people. However, we would not be satisfied if, for reasons beyond our control or the board's control—the number slipped to two, because the board would have to be reconstituted. I hope that it is now clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It was patently clear in the Minister's first explanation. My complaint is that it is patently not clear in the Bill. The right hon. Lady's explanation, which we have now heard twice, was necessary in order to define what was meant by that highly confusing term. We now know and so have no need to press the amendment—but it should not have been necessary. As the hon. Member for Bath has said, the term is highly ambiguous. A better definition in the schedule of what constitutes the board—a quorum or the institution—might go a long way to avoiding further confusion in future.
<P>
With regard to the other amendments, I thought that the Minister might have welcomed a conversion to councillor experience, as she put it. There is a world of difference between legislators in this place who have skills of whatever origin to determine legislation by which local councils operate and people who will be in the field monitoring the performance and standards of councillors today, next week, next month and next year. That was why we suggested having people who knew intimately councils' workings and who would be far more likely to know scams that could be operated and loopholes that unscrupulous councillors might use to avoid detection. It obviously makes sense to use people who have had such practical experience, even if over only a four-year term. They would add credibility and weight to the committee, which, we hear, will have five or six members, although we seemed to get a different number each time the Minister spoke.
<P>
We are at last clear about the numbers. The Minister has given undertakings about the rigour of the procedure for selecting people, which is reassuring. The suggestion that members should have to have local government experience was intended purely to be helpful—such experience would make them better qualified to do their job. The Minister has acknowledged the point, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 398 in page 35, line 26, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In exercising its functions the Standards Board for England must have regard to the need to promote and maintain high standards of conduct by members and co-opted members of relevant authorities in England.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The scope and arrangements for the Standards Board have changed significantly since the publication of the draft Bill more than a year ago. In the draft Bill, the board was concerned very much with the investigation of alleged cases of misconduct. The Bill now casts the board's role much wider. It will have a range of guidance-making powers and will be responsible for the administration of the adjudication process as well as overseeing investigations into misconduct. It will be helpful, because of the changes, to provide a broad purpose to guide and to inform the way in which the board performs its functions. The issue was raised in the other place and my noble Friends undertook to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister of State is right that the amendment is related to the Government's willingness to reflect on the point. I apologise if I have overlooked amendments on the selection list and some are still to come. Does the Minister believe that it will be necessary to make amendments to clause 54 in relation to complaints about the overall behaviour of an individual authority rather than to complaints about the behaviour of an individual councillor or co-opted member?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, we have not tabled such amendments because we intend the board to deal only with individual members. It is difficult to allege that there is a problem with the conduct of a whole council. If a complainant is concerned about the manner in which a local authority has operated in relation to a particular issue, that is likely to be a case of maladministration, which would be dealt with by the local government ombudsman. We want to be clear that we do not confuse the two roles.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I understand the distinction. Maladministration should be referred to the appropriate ombudsman. However, irrespective of whether a code of conduct complies with the model code or has been approved by the Secretary of State, members of the public might believe that it is being abused by council members or the executive collectively. Will someone investigate that complaint and, if so, who?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises a difficult issue. The Standards Board will have to be able to investigate complaints in a proper manner. For example, if a local citizen believes that the complaints procedure has not taken account of his or her concerns and that the standards committee has not operated within the terms of its code, there will be an executive member with responsibility for almost every aspect of that process. That is the most effect way to proceed. However, collective investigations are possible, and we do not intend to amend the Bill further. The issue is difficult to handle because we do not want to create confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I promise not to intervene again.
<P>
The Minister has put it firmly on the record that collective action is possible, notwithstanding the fact that a minute ago she suggested that she did not think it a good idea. Will she explain for my benefit—I am sure every other Committee member knows this—where that is covered?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is in clause 6(4)—I confess, I took advice on that.
<P>
Amendment No. 398 introduces a general duty for the Standards Board to have regard to the need to promote and maintain high standards of conduct by members and co-opted members of relevant authorities. The duty will guide and inform the board's work and ensure that it pays due regard to the responsibilities conferred on it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 446.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have tabled the amendments following consultation and discussion with existing monitoring officers and other local government representatives. Under the amendments, provision would be made for the Standards Board in England and the Commission for Local Administration in Wales to issue guidance, should it be deemed necessary, to relevant authorities in relation to the qualifications or experience that a monitoring officer should have.
<P>
It is not appropriate for legislation to specify the appropriate experience or qualifications of an authority's monitoring officer. Although some legal qualification for monitoring officers is likely increasingly to be preferred, smaller relevant authorities might be unable to afford a legally-qualified officer. As many hon. Members will know, such authorities frequently contract with companies for most of their legal work. A restriction would also prevent career progression to the role in question for competent but non-legally-trained officers. Requiring authorities to employ a legally-trained monitoring officer is therefore inappropriate, but it could be appropriate to enable the Standards Board to issue guidance on the matter should it consider that necessary in future.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 523, in page 71, line 17, leave out `and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 524, 530 to 533, 535 and 522.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The amendments relate to schedule 3, which covers the status and general powers of the Standards Board. The schedule sets out the grounds for disqualification from appointment to the board. It requires the Secretary of State to appoint the chairman and deputy chairman and it makes provision for the Secretary of State to determine members' remuneration and allowances. It enables the Standards Board to appoint and pay staff to carry out its functions, and also covers the proceedings of the board, declarations of interest, provision of finance, submission of accounts, annual reporting arrangements and other matters.
<P>
Amendment No. 523 is a drafting amendment to remove an unnecessary word. Amendment No. 524 would clarify the ability of the board to provide support, such as premises, to the Adjudication Panel for England and therefore to case tribunals. Amendment No. 530 sets out provision in relation to the appointment of the chief executive, which is absent from the Bill so far. It would enable the Secretary of State to appoint the first chief executive, after consultation with the board. That would enable the Department to run the recruitment exercise and find a short list of candidates before the appointment of the board, saving valuable board set-up time. Provision is also included for the board to make all subsequent appointments, with the consent of the Secretary of State, which is common procedure for NDPBs.
<P>
Amendment No. 531 is a drafting amendment and amendments Nos. 532 and 533 are technical. The Bill prohibits any person from being employed to enable the ethical standards of officers to exercise their functions at the same time as enabling the president, deputy president and any tribunals of the Adjudication Panel for England to exercise their functions. That is necessary to ensure clear separation between staff who are directly involved in the investigation and those who support the adjudication process. However, the provisions as currently drafted could include support staff.
<P>
Information technology, personnel and payroll staff might have to be separated too. The amendment clarifies the fact that only staff directly involved in investigations would be caught by the provision. Amendment No. 535 will place the Standards Board under the jurisdiction of the parliamentary ombudsman. That is consistent with our drive to address the criticisms, made over many years, about the lack of openness and accountability of non-departmental public bodies. As part of that drive, we are committed to placing all executive and advisory non-departmental public bodies that have direct dealings with members of the public under the jurisdiction of the parliamentary ombudsman.
<P>
Amendment No. 522 is consequential upon other amendments and is simply technical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Under-Secretary skimmed over Government amendments Nos. 530 and 533, which seem to pave the way for the Secretary of State to veto the appointment of a chief executive to the Standards Board. Will she elaborate on the conditions in which that will apply? Given that the members of the board have been appointed by the Secretary of State, and that he will determine the budget of the board from which a chief executive's remuneration can be calculated, why does he need that additional power of veto? It raises the fear that the role of the chief executive may be turned into a political football. When does the hon. Lady envisage that power being used?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> As I made clear, especially with reference to amendment No. 530, the provisions are standard procedure for appointing staff at any level to non-departmental public bodies, but particularly chief executives. I shall not be hypothetical this afternoon about the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might object to an appointment, and I doubt whether it would happen. It happens only infrequently, but it is right that the Government should be satisfied that the people appointed to undertake important work on behalf of the public have the right qualifications and the confidence of the sponsoring Department. There is nothing sinister in that. It is entirely good practice. It is consistent with the way in which people at that level have been appointed to NDPBs for some time.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Amendment No. 529 and the other Government amendments grouped with it deal with provisions on the staffing of the Standards Board set out in schedule 3.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 525 and 527 bring the drafting of the disqualification provision into line with the rest of the Bill by providing that a person is disqualified from being a member of the Standards Board if he is also disqualified from being a member of or being elected a member of a relevant rather than a local authority.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 526 and 528 make similar corrections on who can be employed as an ethical standards officer. Paragraph 3(2) of the schedule provides that a person may not be employed as an ethical standards officer if he or she is an officer or member of a local authority or one of its committees, sub-committees or joint committees, or is disqualified from being elected or being a member of a local authority. That is to ensure that those conducting investigations are, and are perceived to be, independent. Amendment No. 529 adds to the provision by making it a term and condition of ethical standards officers' employment that they cannot subsequently become a member of a local authority. Amendment No. 412 is consequential to that amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As usual, I will be brief. The issue is important but clear. We are debating the Standards Board, which will have an important function in relation to the ethical standards of all who work in local government. It has been accepted increasingly in recent years that those who serve in local government should not declare interests when they speak on particular matters but submit themselves to filling in a declaration of interests, as Members of the House are required to do. That declaration should be held by the council or other relevant authority and made public.
<P>
The members of the body that will judge whether individual councillors are meeting those high standards clearly ought to be willing to submit to similar standards. Paragraph 10 contains the means by which that is in part to be done. Members of the Standards Board will be required at the appropriate meeting to declare publicly what, in their view, might be relevant interests. The amendments would require members of the board to establish and to maintain a register of interests. The proposal seems uncontroversial; Government and Opposition Members will presumably accept it.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I certainly have no difficulty in agreeing with the principle of what the hon. Gentleman says. I have great sympathy with the sentiments that he expressed. It is of course important that everyone in the conduct of public life is of, and is seen to be of, the highest standards. It must be right that Standards Board members register their interests in the same way as local authority members do, declare their interest and do not take part in matters on which they have expressed an interest.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my explanation of why it is unnecessary to include such a provision. Under the provisions in the Cabinet Office guidance—``The Governance of Public Bodies''—all non-departmental public bodies must adopt a code of practice. A cornerstone of that code is the establishment and maintenance of a register of interests appropriate to the body's activities. The register should, as a minimum, list direct or indirect pecuniary interests that members of the public might reasonably think could influence judgments. The guidance also covers requirements in relation to non-pecuniary interests and to family and other relationships that could be relevant when considering what interests should be registered. Registration requirements will be drawn up by the board and by the Department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I was aware of those provisions. Will she confirm that there is also a requirement in the code of practice that, when a matter is raised in a meeting in which a relevant person has an interest, that person should publicly declare the interest? I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong. If that requirement is in the code, will the Minister explain why the declaration of an interest is to be included in the Bill but not the maintenance of the register? That is my problem.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The code of practice requires board members of NDPBs to declare an interest. The register is a requirement of the code of practice. Members have to declare their interests as and when they arise in the execution of their duties. We have included the declaration of interest in the Bill because it circumscribes the behaviour of board members. The code of practice goes much wider. It determines what the board as a body should do, which includes establishing and maintaining a register of interests to ensure that such matters are dealt with corporately by the board. To include that in the Bill when it is already in the code of practice for NDPBs would be unnecessary and repetitious because it would duplicate what members are already doing. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that reassurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course, I always accept the Under-Secretary's assurances when they are put so convincingly—which should not be taken as a commitment to accept everything that she says. Her assurance that all members of the Standards Board will be required to fill in and maintain a register will be recorded in our proceedings. I am grateful for her remarks, but the Bill is oddly constructed. She said that it is unnecessary to include the register in the Bill because it is contained in the code of conduct for NDPBs, but that it is important to include something else that is also contained in the code. It seems that we have not got our act together. Nevertheless, the issues that concern have been covered, which is important. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

New clause 18 replicates that provision for the local commissioner in Wales.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to raise a query. We are starting to get into the territory of ethical standards officers, which we will debate more fully in our deliberations on clause 56. Will ethical standards officers have immunity from any suit brought against them, even if they are deemed to be acting vexatiously or unreasonably while carrying out their investigation?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Any statement made by an ethical standards officer in connection with the exercise of his or her functions would be absolutely privileged. That does not mean that they are protected absolutely from the law of defamation, but privilege would apply to statements that are related to their functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> So full statutory immunity does not apply to ethical standards officers, and if their activities during an investigation were deemed to be vexatious or unreasonable, they could be sued on that basis because only their statements are privileged. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It is an usual situation in that if an ethical standards officer was shown to be acting in bad faith, there would be no protection under the law. Short of that, then yes, their statements would be privileged.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> There are a few things to be mopped up in relation to the questions that I raised with the Minister. Schedule 3 includes much terminology about the workings of the Standards Board but not much detail and I would appreciate some further elaboration on that from the Minister. We are told that members of the board will be of a high calibre, so what will be their on-going training requirements, especially given that the Minister has not accepted an amendment that would require members to have some local authority experience? How will the Government ensure that board members will continue to be suitable for the job and for how long will they serve? Schedule 3 refers only to the terms of appointment of members of the Standards Board. Have those terms of appointment been drawn up yet, and how big is the staff likely to be? Will there be a large office of people? Paragraph 9(1) provides that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Standards Board may regulate its own procedure,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives it an enormous amount of power. One of the questions I raised earlier, which is important in terms of our on-going role here, is that if the Standards Board is to produce an annual report on its workings, are the Government prepared to set down the criteria according to which the annual report will be drawn up? What is the report supposed to contain to make it a meaningful document rather than a glossy brochure and to show that the Standards Board is alive and kicking and spending its large budget? Certainly, in considering the legislation that established the Financial Services Authority, we spent a considerable amount of time trying to determine the nature of the annual report and how it would be presented to Parliament, as well as to set up a system that would enable Parliament could keep tabs on the authority in future—although not to the extent that some of us would have liked. Surely the Standards Board should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny by Parliament. Has any thought been given to that?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I can answer some of those questions specifically but not others, for the very good reason that they relate to the Standards Board's legitimate determination on how it will operate. Clearly, I agree that there will be a need for training, not simply in how local government works but on-going opportunities for board members to consider what training they need to undertake their functions and operate as a board. That is for the board to determine because it is an operational matter. The length of service will be between two and five years and that will be a matter for the Lord Chancellor to determine. He has yet to do so, but it will be within that period of time. The matter of staff numbers is, in part, for the Standards Board to determine. We have not settled on a fixed figure, although we have an idea of the numbers of different categories of staff.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the annual report will be an important document. It should be suitably informative, in order to ensure that there is accountability, in relation to the discharge of the board's functions and to public expenditure. Initially, it will be for the board to decide what the contents of the report should be, but the report will be presented to the House, and we will want to ensure that the contents give the House a comprehensive and detailed view of the work of the board throughout the previous year. I hope that he will accept my assurance that we will ensure that, as the board starts to consider its first annual report, the report will enable hon. Members to make a judgment on how the board is working. I share that objective with the Opposition.

Government amendments Nos. 413 to 417, 425 to 430, 432, 433, 436 to 438, 440, 442 to 444, 447, 448, 450 to 453, 455, 456, 458, 459, 461, 463 to 465, 488, 489, 499 and 503.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> This might be a lengthy set of amendments, but they all relate to a matter that was raised in the House of Lords by Lord Dixon-Smith. We wanted to respond to the amendment that he proposed, and these amendments deal with the issue that he raised.
<P>
It is our policy that the Standards Board should be able to investigate former members of an authority for alleged breaches of the code. However, we accept that the provision in clause 56(1) is not sufficiently clear. In the light of the helpful amendment proposed by Lord Dixon-Smith, we have revised the provisions relating to the investigation of former members.
<P>
The amendments will put beyond doubt the ESO's powers to investigate former members and to outline how any ensuing reports or referrals to the monitoring officer should be treated. Amendment No. 46, which was tabled by the Opposition, repeats Lord Dixon-Smith's amendment. It is virtually replicated by Government amendment No. 410, which fits in with our more comprehensive approach.
<P>
I hope that that meets the Opposition's concerns and that they will not see the need to move their amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 404, in page 35, line 41, after `to' insert `one of'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 405.
<P>
Amendment No. 45, in page 35, line 42, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Where the Standards Board for England decides that any allegation made under this section shall not be investigated, it shall give its reasons in writing.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment. No. 582, in page 35, line 42, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) If the Standards Board for England considers that a written allegation under subsection (1) should not be investigated, it must provide a written response giving the reason why, within a maximum time limit set down by the Secretary of State under regulations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 449.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> In speaking to amendment No. 404 and the other Government amendments, as well as addressing the similar issues raised by the amendments tabled by the Opposition, I assure the Committee that we will expect the Standards Board to respond in writing to the person who had made an allegation, if it decided not to proceed with an investigation. We would also expect any such notification to state why the board did not think it appropriate to investigate that case.
<P>
Following the case made by Lord Dixon-Smith in the other place, we considered the issue and tabled Government amendment No. 405 to give effect to it. The amendment makes it clear that if the Standards Board considers that a written allegation should not be investigated, it must take reasonable steps to inform, in writing, the person who made the allegation of that decision and the reason for it. Amendment No. 449 makes similar provision for Wales. The amendments tabled by Opposition Members are similar but defective, because they do not define to whom the written response should be directed.
<P>
Amendment No. 582 would require any written response to be given within a maximum time limit laid down by the Secretary of State in regulations. That would infringe what is clearly an operational matter for the Standards Board, and does not need to be addressed in regulations. We would, of course, expect the Standards Board to set a target for the time taken to respond to correspondence—including allegations of breaches of the code—as part of its service standards. That target will be agreed with the Department.
<P>
Amendment No. 404 is a drafting amendment, which ensures that any allegations are referred specifically by the board to one of its ethical standards officers.
<P>
Our approach strikes the right balance and addresses the key underlying issues of amendments Nos. 45 and 582.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We are on fairly common territory, as the amendments all seek to achieve the same objective—to place on the Standards Board an obligation to justify a decision not to proceed with an investigation after a complaint.
<P>
We do not wish to pursue either amendment. However, it would be worth the Government considering the maximum time limit that amendment No. 582 proposes, because it is important to complainants that their grievances receive prompt consideration; they should not be led to believe that their complaints have been left on a shelf to get dusty because they have not received a response within a certain amount of time. The parliamentary ombudsman works to targets. He has about 12 weeks to make an initial response as to whether he intends to take up an investigation, and, if the investigation takes place, an average of nine months—the figure has recently been falling—to confirm its outcome.
<P>
Although I accept that it might be inappropriate to include such a requirement in the Bill, the regulations should include guidelines on the expected turnaround time in which a complainant should receive an answer on whether their complaint will form the subject of a substantive investigation. The public could then be assured that their complaints are being handled with due promptness. On that basis, we shall not oppose the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I should like to ask the Minister three questions. First, we have just heard reference to a complainant being sent a letter about a decision not to pursue a complaint. Have the Government considered whether there should be an appeal mechanism in the event that the person making the complaint is not satisfied with the response? [Interruption.] I think that I can see the response that I shall get from the Minister. Nevertheless, will she tell me whether the Government have decided against that, and, if so, why?
<P>
Secondly, having read through subsequent clauses, especially clauses 58 and 59, in some detail, it is still not clear to me—I find these matters somewhat difficult at times—whether the person who makes the written allegation to the Standards Board in the first instance would have the right for that information to be confidential. In other words, would that person be able to make such an allegation without his or her name becoming public? That might not be the Government's intention in the light of later clauses' provisions relating to the responsibility of the Standards Board in terms of what it is required to publish.
<P>
Finally, I should like to be absolutely clear about a response that the Minister gave earlier about the Standards Board's ability to investigate a collective act by members. Clause 54(1) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person may make a written allegation to the Standards Board for England that a member or co-opted member of a relevant authority in England has failed to comply with the authority's code of conduct.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will she confirm that for ``member'' we can also read ``members'', and that for ``co-opted member'' we can read ``co-opted members''?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question is no. We considered that option. Throughout this part of the Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes) said this morning, we have sought constantly to strike a balance between setting up a regime that can be seen to be independent and to carry out proper investigations, and one that might encourage vexatious and obsessive allegations. If the standards officer should find that there was no case to answer, that should suffice. The hon. Gentleman and I know people who always appeal, and who will never be satisfied. We believe that we are implementing a rigorous regime.
<P>
In relation to the confidentiality of complainants, we shall discuss later an amendment about publishing all reports. I am not sure whether it was tabled by the hon. Gentleman or by other Opposition Members. There will be problems of confidentiality. It could be difficult always to maintain the confidentiality of the complainant during an adjudication. It could also be difficult to investigate on that basis.
<P>
However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's point that some people will be most unwilling to make a complaint unless their confidentiality can be assured. That is precisely why it is difficult to provide categorical, easy answers, and I shall also make that point in response to the later amendment proposing that everything be published. If a complaint was not upheld, what would be the position if the complainant had be given a report and information had been revealed about the person against whom the complaint had not been upheld?
<P>
Complicated issues are involved, and we want to ensure that we get the provisions right. We want a regime in which the board will be sensitive to this issue. We shall have to consider that in guidance. However, the Standards Board will be responsible to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the way in which it behaves towards the public. I am sure that the regime that will develop will reflect experience in other areas, and the Parliamentary Commissioner will reflect that in the way in which he holds the Standards Board to account.
<P>
In relation to the point raised earlier, I have examined the clause and I am not convinced that its wording is as clear as it should be. It may be hard to introduce a simple collective action or collective complaint under the proposed regime. If a complaint is made about an issue or the way in which a council has handled a matter, it will be traced back to the member or members who have responsibility—they will be the first port of call.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Provisions in clause 55(1)(b), which we shall discuss in a moment, allow for an investigation into one member to be extended to fellow councillors, if that appears to be necessary under the initial investigation. Having taken legal advice, I shall write to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham to ensure that we got it right today.

On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 583, in page 36, line 25, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The provisions of this section shall be subject to a full review after three years has elapsed since they were first brought into force.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the most significant aspects of this part of the Bill involves the powers that will be given to ethical standards officers—they are, as it were, a type of ethics police. They will have powers of access to documents and records, and if they are not afforded such access, instant fines will be applicable. They will have the power summarily to suspend councillors on suspicion, and they will have the power to take an investigation to the Standards Board to decide whether a full-blown case should be heard. Many penalties can be imposed on the person being investigated. ESOs are potentially very powerful people.
<P>
The amendment seeks to establish the checks and balances that will apply to the activities of ESOs. That concern explains my earlier questions to the Minister—I asked whether ESOs had statutory immunity from prosecution if they acted in bad faith, vexatiously or unreasonably. I am slightly assured to know that they will not be able to get away with such behaviour.
<P>
Various professional bodies have raised concerns in this regard. In its memo to the Joint Committee, the Council on Tribunals expressed strong concerns about the powers that will be given to ESOs, especially the power of interim suspension. It believes that that is a draconian power, and that there should be safeguards. The power to suspend when there is good reason to believe that an allegation is true involves an element of prejudgment by the ESO. I flagged up a matter that pervades this part of the Bill—that there is a suspicion of guilt about a councillor who is investigated; the onus will be on him or her to prove that he or she is innocent.
<P>
Concerns have been expressed about the time that the complaints procedure will take and about the interaction between an ESO, the Standards Board and the case panel. If a case is investigated, will there be a complete rehearing of evidence that has already been taken? The Association of Council Secretaries and Solicitors thought that the process could take 18 months to complete if the investigation procedure that the ombudsman adopts is anything to go by. Such a lengthy process is frustrating to the complainant, debilitating to the council concerned and potentially unfair to the member of the council who is alleged to have transgressed. Throughout the period during which the suspension has run it is the constituents—the ward members—of the councillor who will lose out, because they will not have their duly elected representative in post to represent them. He or she may have been suspended on what in the end turns out to be fruitless suspicions and charges.
<P>
I am slightly concerned about the extent to which the constraints on the workings of ESOs have been considered. Where will they be drawn from, what training requirements will be placed on them, who will regulate the extent of their powers and what qualifications will they need? That is why, as with other aspects of the Bill, the provisions should be reviewed fully every three years.
<P>
In time, many parts of the Bill will need to be reviewed and changed, and all Committee members will agree that there will be many teething problems. However, we should be particularly worried about ethical standards officers who fail to do their job properly and go off the rails, or decide to exercise their powers rather more forcefully than they might. Such problems are potentially damaging to councillors whom officers investigate, as well as the councils.
<P>
Regulation lawyers have advised me on certain implications in respect of article 6.1 of the European convention on human rights, which deals with civil rights and obligations, and article 6.3. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that. In the light of Rowe and Davies v. the UK, many such stipulations pertain to civil proceedings—for example, some of the guarantees that article 6.3 demands. A Treasury Minister has confirmed that the disciplinary procedures established in Financial Services Authority legislation are of a civil nature and should be covered by the relevant parts of the European convention on human rights. Such procedures are comparable with those that pertain here.
<P>
I should like the Minister's view on the legal implications. I am particularly concerned about the obligation promptly to inform the person under investigation of the nature and cause of the accusations, and provide adequate time for that person to prepare a defence. I am concerned about that person's right to examine witnesses and have evidence handed over, as well as the clauses that will establish that the findings and details of a case should not be published without the prior permission of the person in question.
<P>
There is also the question of the Saunders provision, through which the person under investigation should not be incriminated on the basis of compelled evidence. The description of ethical standards officers' powers contains aspects of compelled evidence, and it could be used against the person under investigation on a criminal basis, should the matter go that far.
<P>
Finally, where a case has gone to appeal, there is the question of imposing sanctions, be it a fine or a suspension, on the party under investigation before the ultimate finding of the case. In criminal law—although we are not talking about criminal law, the same principle will apply under article 6.3—the right of a person under investigation not to be fined normally remains until a final appeal has been heard.
<P>
I might be barking up the wrong tree—or just barking. [Laughter.] I thought that I should get that in before someone else did. These are legitimate concerns that have been raised by legal experts, and I should be grateful if the Minister would explain what consideration her departmental lawyers have given to them. If they have not considered them, the Bill will not qualify under the European convention on human rights, and all sorts of problems might ensue.
<P>
The amendment would guarantee that the working of ethical standards officers will be statutorily reviewed in no more than three years, as should other parts of the new procedure. We must keep a close tab on the working of the ethical standards officers because, practically, they are the most powerful part of the new procedure.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I reinforce what my hon. Friend said, because it is important to review the procedure. I appreciate what the Minister said about the difficulty of balancing the need for confidentiality without discouraging whistleblowers. After three years, the Minister, or whoever is in power at the time, will want to ensure that that balance is right.
<P>
I am intrigued about what would happen if a local paper ran a story containing an allegation against a councillor, and no one formally wrote in. It would be ludicrous if the front page of the Rotherham or another local paper made serious allegations against a councillor and no formal complaint was made. If a complaint was not made in writing, the Standards Board could not start a review.
<P>
I have a plea for the Minister. Will she consider changing the title of ethical standards officers? It suggests the thought police or something else out of ``Nineteen Eighty-Four'' or ``Animal Farm''. It also murders the English language. The Oxford English dictionary defines ethical as pertaining to morality or the science of ethics and we are discussing officers who will monitor standards, not ethics or morality. A change of name should be considered, if not now, in three years.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying the amendment, but he was speaking on two levels. The amendment refers to a process of review, but his concern, which was valid, was about the way in which individual ethical standards officers might operate and the extent to which there will be adequate scrutiny of the way in which they go about their business and the sort of decisions that they make.
<P>
The checks and balances on ethical standards officers will be a matter for the Standards Board. Under their general duty, the board will have to take a close interest in the way in which ethical standards officers discharge their responsibilities. As employees of the board, the terms and conditions under which ethical standards officers are employed will include arrangements for regular and individual appraisal, as is now routine for all public servants. The way in which the board works and the terms on which people are employed will provide micro-scrutiny of what individual ethical standards officers are doing and whether there is cause for concern.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the power of interim suspension by an ethical standards officer prior to a judgment was draconian. Ethical standards officers will not be able to institute interim suspension. They will be able to recommend interim suspension, but only a case panel, which is at a different level from the ethical standards officer who has undertaken the investigation and assessed his or her view of the evidence, will be able to suspend a member. Members of the adjudication panel will be selected by the president.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made the general contention that the possibility of interim suspension was draconian. I disagree with him, in that interim suspension pending the continuation of an investigation and the arrival at a judgment, while a serious act, is by no means unprecedented. It is part and parcel of the disciplinary code of practice and the code of practice for complaints procedures for many employees, including many in the public sector such as the police. A close analogy can also be drawn with auditors' and ombudsmen's staff, whose powers are very similar. These powers have been related to those of the staff of auditing and ombudsman organisations.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is a serious measure, but it is not unprecedented. The power to take a view that the nature of the allegations is too serious to allow someone to continue to work pending a thorough examination of the evidence and a conclusion is not unique in being applied to councillors. Quite the opposite—it will treat councillors in the way in which many employees are treated.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a number of questions about where ethical standards officers would be drawn from, and what training and qualifications they would have. Those will be important matters, initially for the board to consider. We shall be concerned to ensure that those responsible for the investigations—the ESOs—will come from backgrounds that provide them with the knowledge, skills and ethical standards to be able to conduct investigations in the appropriate way. Adequate on-going training to ensure the quality of their work will be part and parcel of the arrangements.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised many legal issues, especially in relation to the European convention on human rights and related matters. I am not a lawyer, and I shall not be drawn into answering questions that would require me to give a legal opinion. Our view is that the provisions in part III are compatible with the European convention on human rights, and the powers in the Bill will provide for procedures of the case panels to be set out clearly in regulations that will take ECHR requirements fully into account.
<P>
The amendment proposes a review within three years. In addition to the comments that I have made in relation to continual scrutiny and review of the work of individual officer, I assure the hon. Gentleman that there are already processes for a more overarching, full-scale review not only of the ethical standards officers and the way in which they work, but of the whole apparatus surrounding the Standards Board. There are processes that apply to any non-departmental public body, involving a full-scale review that asks fundamental questions, every five years. That is a more appropriate time for that kind of review.
<P>
In addition, other mechanisms are built into the process whereby the work of the board and its employees could be examined. The Select Committee, for example, could, at any time, examine the workings of the board or any part of its operation. The board will be subject to the National Audit Office, and also, in terms of its relations with the public, to the Parliamentary Commissioner, as was stated earlier. I hope that, in the light of that higher level review, the hon. Gentleman will accept that several opportunities are already in place that apply to bodies such as this, which will enable detailed, full-scale review. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment in the light of those assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her assurances about reviews happening, on whatever time scale. It might be necessary to look at that sooner rather than later. We used that amendment as a means of analysing the general powers of the ESOs, and to express our concern about the potential abuse of those powers. Conservative Members would not want to do anything to deter the suspension of councillors who repeat the kinds of actions that have occurred in Doncaster and Rotherham.
<P>
The points that I raised about the European convention on human rights are important and potentially fundamental to the Bill. I appreciate that she could not respond to them immediately, other than to say that she is advised that this part of the Bill is ECHR-proof. In the light of the intensive debates on the ECHR that took place in respect of the Financial Services and Markets Bill, with which I drew legitimate comparisons, I listed seven activities in respect of which the Bill may fall foul of the ECHR. Will the Minister write to me with a fuller explanation of how she believes it to be ECHR-proof with regard to those examples? If there are some loopholes, the whole Bill may be vulnerable.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that some of the detail of the issues that he raised has yet to be worked out. We are advised that the principles and general structure of the apparatus in the Bill are compatible with the ECHR. I assure him that outside the confines of the Committee—where it is difficult to engage in such a detailed discussion—I shall be happy to write to him about the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 56 is further to do with the work of ethical standards officers and deals with the conduct of their investigations. The amendment would tackle the risk that an ESO might be influenced by links with an authority on which he or she has served or by which he or she has been employed. The Government's time limit of five years is somewhat arbitrary. Why is not it less than that, or six or seven years or more? The five-year period is arguably insufficient for the purpose that it is designed to achieve. Many senior officers and councillors serve continuously on the same authority for much more than five years, and personal connections therefore go back much further than that. One of my local authorities includes senior officers who have been there for the best part of 20 years.
<P>
The amendment would tighten the restriction to prevent an ESO from taking on any case involving an authority on which he or she has served as a member or officer at any time. There should be no need for such a situation to arise—there will be many ESOs, and the case could be handled by another officer. Imposing a blanket restriction would mean that suspicion of personal involvement could be avoided. Of course, it would not prevent all such instances, as networks of contacts extend across authorities—especially as some members, and even more officers, move from authority to authority. However, it would provide a better safeguard against personal involvement than the Government's proposals.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would prevent an ESO from taking part in any investigation in relation to members of an authority where that ESO has at any time been an officer or member. Clause 56(4) provides that an ESO cannot conduct an investigation in relation to a member of an authority if, within the past five years, he has been an officer or a member of that authority. Clause 56(5) further provides that an ESO who is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>directly or indirectly interested in any matter which is, or is likely to be, the subject of an investigation . . .<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) must disclose the nature of his interest to the Standards Board<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and must not take part in the investigation. If an ESO has been a member or officer of an authority that was the subject of an investigation more than five years previously, and there was still some issue that could reasonably be expected to influence the conduct of the investigation, he or she must declare it and not take part in that investigation.
<P>
We have sought to strike a reasonable balance. On the one hand, we could have opted for an outright prohibition on the ESO's ability to investigate, which seemed rather onerous. In this morning's debate, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was keen that we should defend the rights of individuals and not be overburdensome or onerous; we have sought the same. On the other hand, we have sought to make it clear that the integrity of the process and of the officer should be maintained, and that is why there is not only a five-year ban, but the requirement for a declaration of interest.
<P>
Together, the provisions provide sufficient protection to maintain the real and perceived independence of an ESO who is undertaking an investigation. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hear the Minister's reassurances. She recognises the possibility that long-standing contacts will colour someone's judgment. I am more concerned with the rights of the individuals who are being investigated, rather than the rights of the ESOs. We shall not press the point. However, there will be a large pool of ESOs, and we should have a clear-cut general rule that, if someone has had a link with a local authority, he or she must not investigate that authority—making a declaration is not enough—but should investigate something else. There will be enough work for all of them.
<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister will not make the matter simpler. That is what the amendment seeks to do. She is determined that there are checks and balances elsewhere, so we shall not press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 411, in page 36, line 41, leave out `or sub-committee' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sub-committee, joint committee or joint sub-committee'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

This is another technical amendment to ensure that the provision in clause 56(4), which prevents an ESO from investigating if he or she has been a member of the authority concerned or one of its committees, is in line with provisions elsewhere in the Bill. The amended clause will cover all types of committee in the relevant authority.

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 573, in page 40, line 9, after `55', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of the outcome of the investigation, and to provide any such member with a copy of any report under this section before it is made available to any other person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 60 deals with the reports that ethical standards officers will produce after an investigation. The amendment would right an injustice whereby the only person who would not see the report would be the subject of it. The clause gives the ethical standards officer power to produce a report and, for instance, to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provide a summary of any such report to any newspapers circulating in the area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first that the subject of the investigation will know of its findings will be the local newspaper ringing to ask for a comment. That is substantially unfair.
<P>
More seriously, the ethical standards officer seems to be under no obligation when an investigation leads to further action to furnish the member with a copy of the report, but only to inform him of the outcome. That could mean simply telling him that the case had been referred to the monitoring officer or the Adjudication Panel, without giving an explanation for the decision. That is unfair.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> This is the Opposition amendment that I referred to earlier, which contains some worthy ambition as well as some real difficulty. A person who was the subject of a case that was to be referred to the Adjudication Panel for England should see a copy. That would be only right and fair. However, in other circumstances, where an investigation would not lead to any possibility of punitive action, revealing the contents of the report might not be the appropriate course. It might contain sensitive information about the alleged perpetrator, provided by a colleague. It might have nothing to do with the code of conduct. Reporting all that, after a decision had been made that nothing relevant to the code of conduct arose, might lead to great difficulty. I was recently involved in the publication of a report on another matter; we had to be careful about it, because unsubstantiated allegations were made that could have been libellous. Difficult issues are involved. A person whose behaviour is the subject of a complaint must clearly have a copy of the evidence and the report. However, I am wary, because we do not want anything in the Bill to interfere with people's human rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): This is a delicate matter. Surely, the Minister must have been advised on whether such a report would attract qualified privilege and therefore be safe from action for defamation.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not think that that covers every aspect. I am conscious of what Opposition Members are trying to elicit, but we must pay due regard to people's human rights and ensure that certain matters are not publicised by sending copies of the report to the wrong people. It is important to have a clear code and regulations that cover such matters. That should therefore be pursued through the work of the Standards Board, which should work out how to deal with such matters. I ask the Opposition not to press the amendment to a Division. We are anxious that those who are accused should know if there is any merit in the accusation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> When a report is issued but no further action is taken, can the investigated councillor have been the subject of a penalty—that is, a fine if he had not released the required documents or a suspension?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> There may well have been such cases. That is why a blanket provision cannot be made to achieve what the Opposition seek. I appreciate that, which is why I am trying to deal with it. Serious issues have been raised. The regulations and the manner in which the Standards Board operates should uphold both aspirations—that we ensure that people who are being pursued have all the evidence and all the relevant reports and news put to them but that we do not make life even more difficult for them by allowing reports to be published that show that no evidence has been found.
<P>
I appreciate what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham seeks. We shall continue to consider the matter, and try to ensure that we get the framework right. We anticipate that the Standards Board will have to decide how to deal with such problems. Expecting the Bill to provide that everything should be made available automatically will not achieve what we all seek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I asked whether the investigated councillor could have suffered penalties because the Minister said of a complainant who had been vexatious, unreasonable or even libellous—spurious complaints having been made with no groundin,—that an investigation would have been undertaken and that the investigated councillor's circumstances might have been materially affected as a result. Knowing that a report will be published and given to the investigated officer first might deter people from making such frivolous complaints. People would not risk being libellous by producing a pack of lies that could be traced back to them. What redress would the investigated councillor have if his or her reputation was besmirched by a suspension or fine that came out in the press or was leaked and which was based on the flimsy evidence of a vexatious complainant?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to cover everything in one amendment. The Opposition are making some valid points, but they are undermining some of their other intentions. Spurious allegations might be made against the hon. Gentleman in the press during his political life. He will have no redress other than to fall back on his reputation. The allegations could be investigated by our equivalent of the standards officer and found to be spurious, but that would be his only option.
<P>
In the vast majority of cases, it will be right for the report to go to the person that it is about. I defend the policy of fining people who fail to co-operate even if subsequently there is no evidence against them. They might decide not to co-operate because they know that the evidence would incriminate them or lead investigating officers to a deeper problem. We need to insist that people co-operate. We are in difficult territory. The House has not always handled such matters well. It would be easier to establish a Standards Board in local government if this House had experience of one. I also think that an independent body outside the House would have helped the reputation of hon. Members. This is a difficult matter. There is no perfect way forward. I assure Opposition Members that we are trying to find the most robust and fair method of investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> To an extent, I appreciate the Minister's problem. Nevertheless, the clause is in a muddle. A vast amount of extra work will have to be done to it to ensure that she can achieve the objective of producing a robust and fair system. The clause is capable of inflicting great unfairness on the investigated councillor, especially with regard to relationships with local newspapers. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 574, in page 51, line 13, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Pending the verdict of the High Court on any appeal under subsection (15) the appellant shall not be disqualified or suspended, other than in exceptional circumstances set out in writing by the Standards Board.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We touched on the question of suspension earlier so I shall not debate it at any length. The amendment would provide for a councillor who was under investigation to stay in office pending an appeal against the findings of a case tribunal and for a member who was appealing against a fine for breach of the code of conduct where the breach was serious enough to warrant suspension or disqualification not to stand convicted of any criminal offence. However, as the Bill stands, there could be a lengthy suspension while the case was considered, and we have no idea of the time scale of that suspension. Bearing in mind that such a person would not have been accused of a criminal act, it seems draconian not to allow him or her to continue to serve as a councillor while the appeal was being considered. The measure would also have the effect of disfranchising those members whom that councillor represents while the appeal case was being considered. We believe that the proposal is over-draconian and we tabled the amendment to explore with the Minister how such cases can be dealt with.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> We agree that the system that we are establishing must treat members fairly, although we also want to introduce a robust system. We believe that the procedures that we are putting in place for the investigation of alleged breaches of the code of conduct and any subsequent adjudication are fair and open and will work effectively, so that the conclusions reached by an adjudication panel will be correct in the majority of cases. Nevertheless, in order further to protect members, we have introduced a right of appeal against the decision of a case tribunal to the High Court. However, we should not let that right defer the implementation of any penalty imposed by the adjudication process because, to do so, would suggest that we do not have confidence in the process of investigation and adjudication, which is not the case.
<P>
Opposition Members will know that the imposition of a penalty pending an appeal is far from unprecedented. The criminal law operates on that basis and a more direct analogy can be found in the Housing Act 1996, for which the hon. Member for Hexham and his colleagues were responsible. I can say more about that if the hon. Gentleman wishes. Having said that, the amendment has prompted us to think about the circumstances that pertain where a case panel has decided that a member should be disqualified from taking office. Any such disqualification would trigger a by-election and if, following a by-election, the High Court were to uphold an appeal by a disqualified member, there would be no way of revoking the consequences of the disqualification. Therefore, there might be a case for reconsidering that specific category of cases, and we are willing to do so. Although we would not be content for a disqualified member to remain in office pending the result of an appeal, it might be more appropriate to suspend that person pending the outcome. However, that would leave that councillor's constituents unrepresented for a prolonged period, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman would accept would be undesirable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we would be willing to consider how to accommodate those circumstances and to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I was remiss in not apologising for my two colleagues who had to leave the Committee early to attend an urgent meeting and left me here to score a little victory. I do not know whether that is the result of being a fresh face, but I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for agreeing to consider the matter further and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 512.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The amendment would provide for a separate code of conduct for the council manager. As hon. Members will know from earlier discussions, that individual is a new category of employee, who will have significant duties relating to the new political management structures in part II. Therefore, we envisage that it might be necessary for a hybrid of the councillors' and employees' code to be drawn up to ensure that the council manager is sufficiently covered by the new conduct framework. Amendment No. 512 is a technical amendment. I hope that hon. Members will accept the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 563, in page 53, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In subsection (1) of section 2, Part 1 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (political restriction of officers and staff), paragraph (f) is deleted.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important probing amendment. I have no intention of pressing it to a Division. It is important to find out the Government's latest thinking on something that affects as many as 30,000 local government staff. The Committee will be aware that since May 1990 the activities of various people working in local government, those on salaries currently above £27,999, those on other salaries who are deemed to be in sensitive posts and even political assistants to local authority party groupings are constrained, particularly from doing anything that may give the appearance that they advocate support for a particular party. They are also banned from standing in elections, including elections to the European Parliament. Although that ruling came into effect in May 1990, the Minister will know that it was challenged in the European Court as being in contravention of articles 10 and 11 of the convention. However, the union that brought the case was unsuccessful.
<P>
The time has come for consideration to be given to whether such arrangements are appropriate. The time has come for a review. For example, it is somewhat odd that a local authority employee who wishes to become involved in what may be seen as a party-political campaign—certainly a political campaign—to save a local hospital from closure should be barred from becoming involved. It seems particularly bizarre—I ask the Minister to comment specifically on this—that those who are employed to serve particular party political local council groups are barred from party political activity. I am sure that many of us are aware of local council groups that have such people working for them. They are, by their very nature, highly political animals and, come the time of a local, general or European election, are brought in because of their expertise. It is bizarre that they are debarred from being involved in such an activity. We should examine the range of officers and activities that are restricted.
<P>
I will support the Minister to the hilt if she says that the advice that officers give to councillors in the exercise of their functions must be non-party political. There can be no bias. I genuinely believe that people who work for us in local government maintain high standards and did so long before the 1990 legislation came into effect. I do not criticise them. They have adopted high standards and I am confident that they will continue to do so. The amendment's purpose is to enable the Government to give a statement of intention—they can give a more detailed statement later—on whether the time has come to review the range of officers affected and the range of activities involved.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Opposition will begin to think that Committees should always be conducted in this way. It seems that we have rushed through a lot of the Bill only to reach the meat of the subject on which Ministers might grant concessions.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the amendment and certainly with the sentiments behind it. The Government argued in a case in the European court that the code to uphold the independent advice of officers should continue to operate because it is a critical part of the way in which the British public servant, who is not elected, behaves. The civil service has a strict code on how it advises Ministers and how the political activities of public servants are restricted in their private lives. Those restrictions also apply to political and special advisers to the Government. I always try to ensure that we look at local government in a different way. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that special advisers who are employed to advise Ministers are politically restricted and not allowed to campaign in elections. Indeed, people have resigned before an election so that they can act politically. Following the European court ruling, I undertook to review the framework. That consultation, which involves a wide range of people, is continuing. Although we believe that the principle should be upheld, we realise that a review is needed to ensure that political restrictions bite at the right level.
<P>
Many people who work for local government do not give advice on policy directly to members. They should not be politically restricted, which is why we are considering whether the boundary needs to be changed. We shall continue with that review, especially on the restriction on political advisers, although it is legal for party groups to employ political advisers within a clear framework.
<P>
I could not accept the amendment, even if I was minded to, because it is technically deficient—I am told that it is not in the right place or something. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are reviewing the matter and I shall take his comments into account. We want to ensure that the system is clear to the public, and that we are not allowing biased information; we also want to make it clear that we are not infringing people's rights.
