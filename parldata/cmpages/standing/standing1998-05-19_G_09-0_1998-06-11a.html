<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 3, line 42, after `exemption', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`he shall first publish in full three months prior to withdrawal of the exemption the reasons why he considers that relevant, material change of circumstance has occurred and then.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 8, in page 4, line 2, and end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Director shall give due notice of any intention to cancel the validation of an existing agreement, and where such a cancellation is made no penalties shall be payable retrospectively.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 4, in page 4, line 16, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(8) Before cancelling any exemption, the Director shall give the affected party sufficient opportunity to state the case for retention of the exemption, and the Director shall be under a duty to give consideration to such a case before removing an exemption.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendments form a trio, which is designed to improve process and fairness when considering exemptions. They are consistent with the points that we made earlier about the need to be understanding when exemptions are appropriate. Above all, there is the need to be sensitive when an exemption is being withdrawn--a clawback power of the Director General of Fair Trading. The Minister will understand that there is some difference in practice, which I touched on earlier, between giving someone an exemption for a particular agreement, which should happen when it is appropriate, such as in relation to individual exemptions under clause 4, and rescinding an exemption that has been made.
<P>
If an exemption is made and then withdrawn, that puts the parties to an agreement in a difficult position. It may be possible to avoid retrospectivity but, in terms of the separate issue of process, it is important that the parties do not suddenly wake up one morning to find, perhaps from the newspaper, that their exemption had been withdrawn and that they are at risk of penalty having been given notice. I do not wish to taunt the Minister, but I do not believe that there is a difference in our general approach to the matter. Though neither of us are lawyers, we are talking about the legal doctrine of legitimate expectations in that parties carry on until they are told not to. In fairness, there must be an opportunity for proper consideration and representation in which they can be involved.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 is key to the withdrawal of the exemption and suggests that the director general should first publish in full three months prior to its withdrawal
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the reasons why he considers that relevant, material change of circumstances has occurred''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is explicit in subsection (1) that the director general has to have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a material change of circumstance''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not a matter of the director general waking up one morning and saying, ``I don't like this any more. I am going to rescind it.'' We must not tick off the assumption that he will consider grounds and give a reason for his decision. As a further protection, he must give notice in writing.
<P>
Under our proposal, the director general should first give three months' notice of the withdrawal of the exemption and give his reasons for the withdrawal. He must explain what had changed in the interim. That should not be impossible for him, given that he will have had to make some decisions and to have had reasonable grounds for doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I can see the good sense of the amendment. Is it my hon. Friend's view that requiring three months' notice of the intended cancellation of the exemption would give the affected party the opportunity to make counter representations, which representations the director general would be obliged to consider?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is exactly the substance of amendment No. 4. However, I shall go through the amendments in sequence; one cannot always do that, but it works with this group of amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 13 seeks to ensure that the reasons for any decision that the director general is minded to take should be published three months in advance. We must also remember the sensitivity of cancelling existing agreements.
<P>
Amendment No. 8 is a variant means of saying that the validation of an existing agreement should not be cancelled without notice. It goes on to say that penalties should not be payable retrospectively. If there is any question of going back on the validation of an agreement, the question of penalty arises, which seems manifestly unfair if one could not have known, until the director general changed his mind, that he, the director general, felt that something was wrong with it.
<P>
Next, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), amendment No. 4 would require that, before an exemption is cancelled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Director shall give the affected party sufficient opportunity to state the case for retention of the exemption, and the Director shall be under a duty to give due consideration to such a case.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is self-evidently in the interests of natural justice. As so often happens--perhaps I anticipate the Minister's reply--one can see possible cases--[Interruption.] No, I shall not try to read the Minister's speech upside down; I cannot see it from here. However, I am always ready to take over his Box.
<P>
I am making a serious point and I know that the Minister wants to respond. There are two possible qualifications. The first, which is not embodied in the amendment, is that, in a case of clear and immediate mischief, the director general might want to act immediately. I would not want to insist on three months' notice in such a case. Perhaps we can think about that. The second qualification is that, if it is open to the affected party to make representations, it is arguable, although I do not commit myself to this, that other interested parties, including disaffected competitors, might be able also to make representations to the director general.
<P>
Those are matters for consideration, but the substantive point remains; if agreements have been exempted, those exemptions, and the freedom from penalty conferred by them, should not be withdrawn without good reason and without notice. We are concerned to get the process right, and to ensure fairness to all parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is generous in giving way. Is it my hon. Friend's view that, once the director general has given due consideration to the representations made to him in support of continuing an exemption, he should be obliged to state the reasons for rejecting those representations? Should he be obliged to do so in writing? Clearly, a decision has ultimately to be made. The talking and the debate has to stop and a decision has to be made--and that decision must be final. Is it my hon. Friend's intention that the director general should be obliged at least to state his reasons for rejecting the representations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed; it is embodied in amendment No. 13 that the director general should publish that information.
<P>
I foresee that a sort of dialogue could take place, particularly if other parties were involved. If representations were made, the director general might then have say why he took no notice of the representations, or say that they were misguided. It is a delicate matter. I am not sure that we need specify in the Bill that there should be a further round of responses to consultations to the director general. I am sure that the Minister will want to consider that. My point is simple: there should be no withdrawal of an exemption without due process, good reason, adequate notice on the opportunity afforded to make representation. Those simple points may commend themselves more widely across the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Good morning, Mr. Atkinson. Like Opposition Members, I think that this is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. I shall therefore respond specifically, answering not only the points that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has made, but also placing on record the process. If hon. Members want me to, I am happy to send a note to them, setting out the process, because it is one thing to put technical words on the record, but quite another to provide logistics of the proposals. I am also happy to be able in my response this morning more than adequately to cover all the hon. Gentleman's points in terms of both the principle and the structure in which he has placed his argument.
<P>
I accept entirely that if the director general proposes to cancel an exemption, a party to the agreement should be entitled to know why the director general proposes to act, and should be given the opportunity to make representations. I am also sensitive to the rights of parties to challenge a decision made by the director general. I believe that I can give the hon. Gentleman a satisfactory response to the legitimate anxieties that he raises. The Bill will enable ample provision to be made for such matters.
<P>
Under the Bill, requirements as to such procedural matters will be made under the director general's rules in clause 51. Schedule 9 elaborates on the kind of provision that the rules may make, signposting the matters that we regard as especially important. Hon. Members will see that paragraph 6 of the schedule makes explicit reference to the rules making provision as to the procedure to be followed by the director general when deciding whether to cancel an exemption, and as to the form and manner in which notice of such a decision will be given.
<P>
The director general must consult on the rules. The rules are subject to the Secretary of State's approval and to annulment by either House. That is how to deal with such matters.
<P>
The director general's rules will need to provide for reasons and an adequate period of notice to be given, and to allow for representations to be made and to be considered. As consultation has yet to take place, hon. Members will understand that I cannot give a firm commitment as to a specific period. However, I am happy to give the Committee an assurance that the rules will provide for reasons and an adequate period of notice to be given, and will make proper provision for representations.
<P>
I shall return to what the hon. Gentleman said, but we should not include such a time period in the Bill at this point. The purpose of consulting with interested parties, including stakeholders in business, who may be affected by the proposal, is to ensure that questions such as the hon. Gentleman raised can be properly addressed. The hon. Gentleman himself said that three months' notice may not be possible in some circumstances. He makes my point genuinely.
<P>
Consultation is vital so that when the proposals are finalised, the time scales are the culmination of debate with the business community so that it has some sense of ownership to the proposals and a sense that the proposals presented in secondary legislation meet the requirements of people involved in the process. That is not an attempt to avoid specifying something in the Bill in terms of parliamentary debate. It is a genuine attempt to ensure that, in the process of implementing it at the coal face, those who will be affected by it have a genuine say in how the director general will proceed in such matters in terms of time scales. The debate today will ensure that the director general and his colleagues receive such an input as part of the response that the director general will look for in his consultation.
<P>
Apart from the rules requiring the Secretary of State's approval, clause 51(10) enables her to direct that rules be made about a particular matter, while clause 51(9) enables her by order to vary or revoke any rules. So if a problem arises at any stage, the matter can be returned to, to ensure that the rules operate effectively.
<P>
Before I come to amendment No. 4, I will set out the process--this is the information that I will circulate to the Committee. The director has two issues to consider: first, whether he has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a material change of circumstances''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
since he granted the exemption; second, whether he has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a reasonable suspicion that the information on which he based his decision''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to grant the exemption was materially incomplete, false or misleading. If he decides that he has either reasonable grounds or reasonable suspicion, the director must first notify the parties and give them an adequate period of notice. As I said, the length of that period of notice will be a matter for consultation.
<P>
In the second part of the process, the parties make representations to the director. If the director changes his mind at that point, no action will proceed. However, if the director is not convinced by the representations, the next stage is that the director, by notice in writing, cancels the exemption. At the next stage, a party can appeal to the appeals tribunal.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
At the outset, the director must state clearly the grounds on which he seeks to revoke the exemption. He must then notify the parties and give an adequate period of notice. He must then receive representations, and if he is satisfied at that point, he can exit the process and no further action will be taken. However, if he believes that he has either reasonable grounds or reasonable suspicion, he moves to the next stage by giving notice in writing cancelling the exemption. A party can then appeal to the appeals tribunal.
<P>
At that stage, the appeals tribunal is constituted and will consider the appeal on the basis of the notice of appeal and of written and oral representations made by the parties. The tribunal may decide to suspend the director's decision to cancel the exemption pending the conclusions of its proceedings. So even at the tribunal stage, there is a range of opportunities for consideration to protect the interests of the parties concerned.
<P>
The appeals tribunal can vary or set aside the director's decision. If the tribunal confirms the director's decision, the party may appeal to the Court of Appeal on points of law or, in different circumstances, on the level of penalty. A clear and specific set of arrangements is built into the process. At each stage, the parties concerned will be engaged and the appeals process will be protected. The director general can exit the process if he is satisfied with the evidence provided by the accused. Therefore we have more than met the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has expressed.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Director shall give the affected party sufficient opportunity to state the case for retention of the exemption''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that I have proved that we have provided for that. I have told the Committee what I expect the director's rules to provide, but the hon. Gentleman may have in mind a right to an oral hearing. Regulation 17/62 gives concerned undertakings a right to a hearing if the Commission proposes to cancel an exemption. Again the hon. Gentleman's well made point is covered in the regulations.
<P>
I would not necessarily expect the rules to give an absolute right to an oral hearing, although the director may well agree to see the parties. That question needs to be considered in the context of the much fuller provision for appeals made in the Bill than exists at Community level. So we are not just taking the Community-level approach; we have significantly extended and expanded the provision. I therefore hope that, having heard that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied and will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want me to give way, or does he want to make a speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> A speech. I would not like to make an intervention and trespass on your good nature, Mr. Atkinson, by making it too long.
<P>
I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say. I understand from the clause that if there is a ``material change of circumstance'', as referred to in subsection (1), the director general may issue a notice that will have effect from the time specified, which is any time from the point of writing the notice. If the cancellation derives from subsection (2), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a reasonable suspicion that the information . . . was incomplete, false or misleading''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or subsection (4), referring to failing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to comply with an obligation'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Government will have the power to cancel the exemption from a date earlier than the date given on the notice, as provided under subsection (6).
<P>
When the director general makes rules, no doubt he will give guidance about the basis on which an exemption will be cancelled under subsections (2) and (4). What is the Minister's understanding of the principles that will be applied? Will the cancellation go back to the date of the obligation, as referred to in subsection (4), or will it go back to the commencement of the agreement under subsection (2)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I intervene briefly to pick up the point being made by my hon. Friend the member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). The criteria for effectively retrospective cancellation should be clearly defined if they pave the way to penalties. The criteria will be about defalcation or failure to comply with conditions, which is sensible in principle.
<P>
As the Minister reflects on what my hon. Friend has said, I ask him to consider another matter. The director general will have a number of concerns, including the fact that his judgment was wrong in the first place and that the matter will have been drawn to his attention by specific breaches of the conditions imposed. When serving the notice, he will need to pay great care to the grounds for doing so. The notice may need to say that, because it is served under X, there is the possibility of a retrospective re-opening of the case. That should be made clear to the parties at the time because representations could be made not only on whether there had been a material change in circumstances but whether there should be an element of retrospectivity.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister and I appreciate the process by which he has given a good deal of sensitive thought to the issue. There is something of a dilemma. On the one hand, there will be extremely complicated cases and it would be foolish for the director general to make a decision in a hurry without considering and reconsidering the matter, or even commissioning an independent study. That might take longer than, say, three months. On the other hand, we do not want to give the director general a green light, allowing the case to continue indefinitely. There are one or two disturbing parallels in Europe, such as the beer exemptions that we discussed earlier.
<P>
I am not sure what period the director general will have in mind. His rules will have to relate to the circumstances of the case. There will be cases over which the director general should take time to make a decision and there will be others when the parties can reasonably ask him to get a move on, especially if penalties are involved and the parties to the agreement have to reshape their business.
<P>
Those are minor points that march alongside the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. The Minister has clearly considered the matter carefully and we appreciate his offer of further information. It is right to have open dialogue that informs the director general's consideration of how he will go about his business. Subject to the Minister's response, I shall not be pressing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall deal first with the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry. I apologise to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire for making him wait longer.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's last point about complex cases that may need a period of more than three months is one that I was making. Although his amendments, about which he spoke very fairly, specify a period of three months, in some cases that period should be less than and in others more than three months. That is why the consultation process on the director's proposals is so important. In that process, the director sets out his intentions and proposals arise out of the discussion. The hon. Gentleman's points about complex cases are matters for consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are trying to get this right. My concern is that however good and thorough the consultation and the representations, they cannot anticipate cases that will come for consideration in the future. If a single period is specified--three months, six months or whatever--some kind of saving clause or understanding is necessary. In practice, the courts can apply specific term limits so that the director general gets on with the job if he can do so; if he needs longer, he may take longer, if that is consistent with the interests of justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am sure that that is the sort of point that will be made in the consultation process; the director general will want to ensure that the rules will be effective. The last thing that the director will want is a system that is unworkable, unwieldy and difficult for all concerned. I look forward to the consultation; I am sure that it will be more than adequate in meeting people's concerns.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised a point in respect of decisions where the director general may have got it wrong. Under clause 47(3)(f), cancelling an exemption is one of the director's decisions which a party to an agreement may appeal to an appeal tribunal of the Competition Commission. That will give the party not just the right to a hearing, but will enable the director general's decision to be overturned, if that is what the appeal tribunal decides. The appeal is on the merits of the case. It is not limited to a review of the reasonableness of the decision. The tribunal will have all the relevant information and will have the same capacity to look at it as the director general. It is therefore a broader appeal process than the hon. Gentleman perhaps first thought.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire raised issues that I believe refer to amendment No. 8, which provides that no penalties should be payable retrospectively if an individual exemption is cancelled. Under the Bill, the date on which cancellation takes effect may be backdated if the reason for cancellation is that the information on which the decision is based was incomplete, false or misleading in a material particular, or where there has been a failure to comply with an obligation, subject to which the exemption is granted. The director general will need to exercise his discretion in the light of the circumstances, but he should have the power to backdate the cancellation in such circumstances--otherwise there would be no deterrent to supplying incomplete, false or misleading information and no real force to the obligation to act responsibly and within the law. We must be able to say to some people, ``Crime does not pay; you cannot mislead or falsify information and get away with it--if you do, you damage other businesses, individually or collectively.'' We have to include a deterrent in the legislation.
<P>
As to the details, the hon. Gentleman fairly asked a range of questions. It is not a weak response, but they are matters that will be dealt with in consultation with the director. The consultation will deal with some of the matter-of-fact issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. I repeat my commitment that I will ensure that the director general knows of the points raised by members of the Committee so that he can consider them as part of his process of consultation about the rules. I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 65, in page 4, line 21, after `may', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or, in the case of agreements to which section 9(c) is likely to apply, shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 67 in clause 9, page 6, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or
<P>
(c) has been approved by him or by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission following an inquiry prior to this Act coming into force.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We now move on to block exemptions. There is no real difference of principle between individual exemptions and block exemptions, which are collective rather than individual agreements. If anything, block exemptions have an even more significant economic impact than individual exemptions because many businesses are operated by one company that has many franchisees or particular structures of commercial trading that have been sanctioned over time and which have seemed commercially sensible.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Minister could explain the nature of the block exemptions that are in place. I admit that I twitted the Under-Secretary last week about trade associations and agreements that were registered under the restrictive trade practices legislation, when he told the Committee that there were 183 such approved agreements. I do not know the number of block exemptions, but it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could give us the ballpark figure.
<P>
I am concerned that block exemptions are likely to be more sensitive and more complex than individual exemptions. They may require a good deal of consideration and there is a danger, in either their creation or their withdrawal, that they may take an inordinate time to resolve. We are talking about trade across the frontiers of member states within the single market, which is not the same as domestic trade; and I have mentioned before the brewing industry in relation to the European Union. That is becoming increasingly important because of the large quantity of beer that is imported, legally or otherwise, through the channel ports as a result of our differing tax system.
<P>
About four years ago, the United Kingdom brewing companies each made application to the Commission, yet they are still only in the state of receiving letters saying that the Commission is minded to approve certain cases; in some cases, even that position has not been reached. I emphasise strongly that commercial considerations are summed up on the phrase ``time is money'' and they must be balanced against the higher theology of competition law because its purpose is to look towards a more efficient operation in the market. I am worried that, if block exemption procedures are not given grandfather rights, they will clog up the system and cause difficulty for the director general and business. They will provide rich pickings for the lawyers and may not serve the interests of competition and the consumer as much as we would hope.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 relates to clause 9 and would provide a specific extra provision for both block exemptions and individual exemptions--the clause also refers to criteria for individual exemptions. Amendment No. 67 would provide for an exemption in cases that have been approved by the Secretary of State or by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``following an inquiry prior to the Act coming into force.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, we propose that there should be grandfather rights for existing block and individual exemptions that have already been the subject of an inquiry. Of course, that would not prevent the re-opening of an inquiry, but it would validate existing agreements until such time as they are challenged.
<P>
That is relevant to the administrative burden on business and business compliance costs. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) has already mentioned the experience of brewers, who have explained how much four years of delay have cost. A major national brewer told me that his estimate of the legal costs of the compliance operation is of the order of six figures. Others have suggested a figure as high as &#163;250,000. Those are substantial administrative and legal costs.
<P>
Further costs will be incurred by the director general, who as the Minister has stated today, will have to consult. I am delighted that he will have to go through a full consultation process but he will be snowed under with submissions.
<P>
There is also concern that if cases that appear perfectly reasonable are opened retrospectively, recriminations and grave difficulties will be triggered for businesses that had thought that they had conducted themselves properly.
<P>
The proposal in the amendments, set out in amendment No. 67 but pursued formally through amendments Nos. 64 and 65, which pave the way, is that under the criteria there should be grandfather rights for both individual and block exemptions that have already been considered through existing competition procedures. That is sensible and consisent with what we have said in previous debates. It would make the director general's job at the outset much easier. It would not remove his power to re-open any investigation whenever appropriate. That would improve the Bill and be a great relief to British industry.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I preface my remarks by saying that in respect of existing agreements, the Bill will provide a sensible transitional period. That will enable parties to agreements to consider what, if anything, needs to be done to ensure that an agreement is not prohibited under chapter I. It may be helpful to the Committee and to those who are following our proceedings if I place on record the time scales for those transitional arrangements.
<P>
As a general rule, agreements entered into before prohibitions come into force will have a transitional period of one year, which will start when the prohibitions come into force. We expect to commence the prohibitions about one year after Royal Assent, so parties to existing agreements will have at least two years from now to prepare for the new regime. That is reasonable.
<P>
For certain agreements--for example, those which have been considered and approved by the restrictive practices court--we intend the transitional period to be five years. That will apply to over-the-counter medicines and resale price maintenance. That five-year period will not start until the court has concluded its proceedings--assuming that resale price maintenance is found to be in the public interest. If it is not, there will be no transitional period. That would be true even without the Bill. If the case for the continuation of the current regime is not sustained, there will not be a transitional period.
<P>
Agreements in the utility sector, which have been excluded from the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, will also have a five-year transitional arrangement, starting from the date when the prohibitions come into force. We shall discuss transitional arrangements later, but that will give hon. Members an opportunity to consider how the Government propose to introduce the legislation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about block exemptions. He asked for ballpark figures, but after yesterday's football result that is a rather sensitive matter. However, I shall try to assist. European block exemptions will apply automatically. Under the Bill, it will be for the director general to recommend domestic block exemptions. Under paragraph 3 to schedule 13, the Secretary of State is empowered to make block exemption orders prior to the commencement date so that they are in place when the regime comes into force. We are examining the case for block exemptions for certain agreements relating to co-operatives and other matters.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked what areas are covered by block exemptions. Currently, they relate to motor vehicle distribution and service agreements, technology transfer, exclusive distribution, exclusive purchasing, and research and development. I have no figures for that, but I hope that I have assisted the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The Bill will enable the director general to establish how an agreement will be treated under it. Parties to an agreement will be able to look to EC jurisprudence, including the requirement that, for an agreement to infringe the prohibition, it must have an appreciable effect on competition. They will also be able to see whether they would benefit from block or parallel exemptions; and they will be able to look to the general advice and information issued by the director general. They will also have the option of notifying agreements to the director general, for guidance or a decision--including an individual exemption--if that is thought necessary.
<P>
We should also keep in the forefront of our minds the fact that if agreements are benign they should not be open to challenge under the Bill.
<P>
The amendments would be unclear in their effect and impractical as a piece of law. It is not clear what particular agreements would fall within the category of being approved by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission since its inception in 1965--or by the director general since 1973, assuming that the person referred to in amendment No. 67 is the director general. That is especially so as the director general and the MMC will often not have investigated agreements per se. The MMC's role is not to approve agreements but to determine whether they are against the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was about to suggest to the Minister that it should be a defence against the recision of an agreement that a party or parties to it could show that the matter had been considered under the previous anti-competitive process. In a sense, it would arise only by exception, when matters were challenged, rather than by having to trigger preliminary consideration and possibly taking the director general's advice on whether it had been considered in the past.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall cover that point in a moment.
<P>
It has always been open to the director general or the MMC to investigate again, or to be asked to investigate again, matters that they previously found not to be against the public interest. I do not wish to provoke hon. Members; nor do I want to cover ground already covered by our debates on clause 19, but The Times is a classic example of that.
<P>
Matters can be reinvestigated in the light of new knowledge, changes in circumstances or the development of a market. The amendments take no account of that, but rather fix approval at a particular point in time. They would defend old circumstances, irrespective of the changes or potential changes that have taken place; or irrespective of others in the marketplace who, because of those potential changes in circumstances, wish consideration to be given to whether a particular agreement had infringed the prohibition. It is critical that that be provided for.
<P>
It is one thing to allow specific agreements, which have been considered and given a section 21(2) direction, to be excluded because their restrictions have been decided not to be significant, as provided under schedule 3. It is quite another thing to allow a wide-ranging, vague, automatic exemption in respect of agreements that the director general or the MMC may be said to have approved. In their representations to us, neither the Confederation of British Industry nor business in general argued for that. Without wanting to mislead the hon. Gentleman, I know of no siginificant or minor proposal along those lines presented by the business community.
<P>
Most importantly, I must underline the point of the Bill, which the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Wokingham seem to refuse to accept. We are introducing a new and tougher competition regime, incorporating different tests, albeit ones that apply at European Community level. It should be possible to examine under the prohibition regime agreements that have been considered in the past in connection with an inquiry made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission or by the director general, rather than such agreements being automatically exempted, as the amendments propose. Even the exclusion for section 21(2) agreements is subject to a power of clawback by the director general.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is, of course, usual when new legislation is being introduced. Naturally, it is often right to provide a transitional period, which I set out in my opening remarks. However, an employer would not be exempted from new health and safety standards just because he or she has met the previous standards. Nor, dare I say it, would an employer be exempted from a national minimum wage on the grounds that he or she has hitherto met all the requirements expected of him or her. That is a nonsense. Things move on; standards move up. As a consequence, we must be able to examine agreements that may now not meet those standards--especially in view of the fact that we are trying to protect other businesses from potential abuse.
<P>
As the director general has put it, the only businesses that should have cause for concern about action by the Office of Fair Trading are those that operate an anti-competitive agreement or abuse a dominant position. As I have said, if the agreements in question are benign, they will not be open to challenge under the Bill.
<P>
Moreover, as I explained, parties to agreements such as those about which Opposition Members are worried will be able to establish how their agreements will be treated under the prohibition. A lengthy transitional process has been set out to enable them to do that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, on hearing that response, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for trying. He has an atmosphere and a style that usually tends towards reasonableness, and does us the compliment of addressing our points. For that, we are grateful.
<P>
However, with the greatest respect, that is not quite good enough. The Minister himself has conceded that he cannot say how many agreements are covered. I am not surprised, because I cannot say how many agreements are covered. He has, rightly, said that a huge range of agreements, for example, agreements for research and development and motor dealer exclusive arrangements, cover the stuff of commerce--a phrase that I have used before--throughout the country. There are thousands of such agreements. They enter into virtually all parts of commercial life.
<P>
Although, as the Minister rightly says, there will be transitional arrangements--which I appreciate; his clarification was welcome--from the time that the Bill is passed all such agreements may be at risk. As he rightly says, if they are benign--if they are not designed to subvert competition and so forth--they will not get into trouble. However, neither he nor I can tell in advance what interpretation the director general will apply or what will happen in practice. Although I cannot prove it until after the event, there will be cases in which people who have been doing things that they thought were perfectly sensible find that those practices are challenged, and, despite all the safeguards that the Minister has included, somehow fall foul of the Bill, and may incur penalties accordingly.
<P>
Endearingly, the Minister went on to say that that is in the interests of improving the situation and having a tougher competition policy, and that it will be better for business when it is implemented. I understand his motives, about which we are not arguing--in this context, at least. However, I am not sure whether it will be easy as that. Certainly, the analogies that he drew were implausible. In relation to the national minimum wage and health and safety legislation, he said that we move on to a different standard. It may be a requirement to put a new guard on to the equipment, or to pay &#163;3.60, or whatever figure comes up--we will find out a little later--instead of &#163;3.20. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham may be engaged at the moment in establishing whether tips are to be included, a matter that we have debated in extenso and which I shall therefore leave.
<P>
Instead of saying that we shall move, within the framework, from point A to point B, we are now changing the framework and have created a new and different concept that no one has yet worked out in practice. As the Minister rightly said, the director general will have to consult up to the eyeballs to work that out and to establish a satisfactory way of doing things. All existing commercial agreements are put at risk by the change, and not to validate them, unless and until they are changed or challenged, seems unwise and precarious. There will be a difference of judgment in that regard, just as--we should not forget this--there is a difference of judgment on compliance costs. If I were in business--I am in a modest way, but not on a scale that is likely to fall outside the de minimis level--I would feel that I had to get it right. As a director, I would at least have to consult my lawyers, who might have to take advice to cover their backs, so someone else would probably be involved. It would therefore become a sort of arms race of compliance which will cost business a great deal.
<P>
While I appreciate that the Minister has done his best, it is not, with respect, good enough and I shall not withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 4, line 34, leave out `an agreement does not' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`there is a failure to'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 29.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am pleased to say that amendment No. 29 deals with a matter on which, for once, we are able to agree with the Opposition. We undertook, in another place, to review in this Committee an amendment along the lines of an amendment tabled by the Opposition at a late stage in another place.W are now fulfilling that undertaking with amendment No. 29.
<P>
Subsection (6)(c) currently confers a general power for a block exemption order to specify circumstances in which the director general may cancel a block exemption in respect of a particular agreement. It will be for the director general to judge whether a particular agreement falls within the terms of clause 9. The power for the block exemption order to enable the director general to cancel the benefit of a block exemption when there has been a breach of an obligation remains.
<P>
Amendment No. 119 corrects the drafting of clause 6(6)(b) which provides for the cancellation of a block exemption when an obligation under the block exemption order is not complied with. Currently, the clause refers to the agreement not complying with the order, rather than the parties to the agreement. The amendment remedies that proposal.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) bring to the attention of those likely to be affected whether any or all of the agreements covered by his proposed recommendation are exempt by virtue of section 10.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another amendment that would make the process clearer. As the Committee knows, we have many worries about the process that is identified in this and other clauses of the Bill. It is not as clear as it should be and we believe that the principles of natural justice need to be more clearly reflected. I hope that the Minister understands the spirit of this amendment and the others moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. It is important to make the process clear so that businesses dealing with the director general and the competition authority should understand it and believe it to be fair. My amendment would add the words on the amendment paper to ensure that it is brought
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the attention of those likely to be affected whether any or all of the agreements covered . . . are exempt by virtue of section 10.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee will remember that clause 10 deals with parallel exemptions when agreements can be exempted by the Brussels Amendment No. 29 makes it clear that that power is to be limited to the ground that the agreement does not fulfil the criteria specified in clause 9. The Bill will thus generally follow the position under EC law, contained in article 7 of EC regulation 19/65 jurisdiction. We need to know the relationship between the Brussels exemption and the British exemption.
<P>
The amendment relates to a general point that we have been making throughout the Bill's passage. There will be two jurisprudences and two separate authorities--a Brussels one and a British one--even after the Bill is enacted. I think that the Minister agrees, but the argument between us is how different they might be. We are extremely worried that they could be quite different in certain respects because we are talking about different people operating under different rules. As we have said several times, the British proposed legislation does not entirely reflect or mirror the treaty. It is different in that it goes further in some areas and exempts rather more in others. It is not possible simply to graft inter-state trading into an intra-state framework. Our modest amendment would clarify the matter and enable a little more light to be shed on the issue of parallel exemptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Unlike previous amendments, I can see no merit in this one. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman does not take that personally. It is not because he, rather than one of his hon. Friends, has moved the amendment. It is just unlucky for him that I have less sympathy with the principle of his amendment than I had for the others that we have been discussing. It will be seen from the Hansard report of our proceedings that I gave a full and frank exposition of what we need to do and why. I expressed a desire for us all to ensure that the rules governing such matters are effective, transparent and follow natural justice in their application.
<P>
Clause 10 provides that agreements that are exempt from the European Community or European Economic Area prohibition of anti-competitive agreements are to be automatically exempt from chapter I prohibition. In addition, agreements that are not subject to the EC or EEA prohibition because they do not affect trade between the relevant states, but which otherwise meet the conditions of an EC or EEA block exemption, are to be automatically exempt from chapter I prohibition. That means that there will be no need for a large number of agreements to be given an exemption either individually under clause 4 or by block exemption under clause 6.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I reiterate my previous commitment that I do not expect block exemption under clause 6 to cover areas that are the subject of Community block exemptions. The director general will have existing block exemptions in mind when considering the need to recommend one. It would be utterly pointless to make a block exemption for a category of agreements, all of which are parallel exempt under clause 10, which is what is contemplated in the amendment.
<P>
While I can conceive that some agreements might fall within a block exemption under clause 6 although they are covered by a parallel exemption, I cannot see that that will cause any problems. It would mean that they would be exempt twice over and that the company could have two celebration parties. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point, but it is not a real argument. I hope that he will accept that the director general should not have to publicise the existence of such agreements. There is no case to be made for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The point at issue is the difference between intra-state and inter-state trading rules. It is possible that a practice that the European authorities thought worthy of an exemption at the inter-state level might not be thought worthy of an exemption at the intra-state level. The two jurisdictions leave open the possibility of different treatments. Our amendment was designed to demonstrate that and to give some comfort to people that the competition authorities would understand that.
<P>
The Minister might like to consider pubs and the brewers, who have been waiting for four years for a formal exemption from Brussels. They might enjoy the comfort of an exemption in this country in the meantime. Would the hon. Gentleman be happy for the competition authorities to grant them an exemption?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's argument is false. I made it clear that agreements exempt from European Community or European Economic Area prohibitions are automatically exempt from the chapter I prohibition. I cannot make it clearer than that. The director general will have the power to recommend other block exemptions. All the building blocks that the right hon. Gentleman wants are already in place. Will be carefully consider the proposals in a non-partisan way?
<P>
I agree that we must ensure that the Bill is effective and provides protection where that is needed. Its proposals must be clear. The block exemptions to which I have referred will automatically continue. I cannot be any fairer than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I was approaching the matter in a non-party-political spirit. I still think that there is merit in the amendment, although I have not satisfied the Minister of that. He is arguing that a block exemption at the Community level will automatically apply at the United Kingdom level. He appears to be ruling out separate competition investigation of an industry in the UK that does not violate the inter-state trading rules of the European Community. In that respect, the proposal will weaken British competition legislation.
<P>
The Minister must accept that otherwise there could be separate inquiries and different decisions under the two systems. Sometimes, that would go against business. I raised the example of pubs and brewers to try to find a way through the delays and difficulties of the European system for an important domestic industry. The Minister says that it will just have to wait its turn in the Brussels queue. Cases might go the other way: under the current rules, British competition authorities might not like practices that were permissible at the inter-state level.
<P>
The Minister has not satisfied me, but I see from the balance of the Committee that I am unlikely to carry the day if I press the amendment to a Division, so on this occasion I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 5, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) Parties to an agreement which may fall within a category for which an application to the Director General for a recommendation for a block exemption under subsection (6) has been made shall not subsequently be held liable for reliance on the terms of that agreement during the period when the application was being considered by the Director.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment basically concerns agreements that may fall within a category for which an application to the director general for a block exemption has been made. Parties to such agreements should not subsequently be held liable for reliance on the terms of such agreements during the period when the application was being considered by the director general.
<P>
The key point is that clause 8 provides for the procedure that the director general is to follow in making block exemption orders. Clause 8(6) provides that a block exemption order may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have effect from a date earlier than that on which the order is made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Difficulties may arise from that. Inevitably, time will elapse between the application to the director general for a block exemption and the confirmation of an exemption by order of the Secretary of State. Let us be realistic; it may be many months before such applications are resolved.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe the Minister; he may provide some comfort and reassurance. There is concern that the lapse of time between the application to the director general for a block exemption and the confirmation by order will result in uncertainty for businesses while they try to comply with the new demands of the Bill. The amendment would introduce certainty and stability by protecting companies while arrangements are being considered by the director general.
<P>
I think that the point behind the amendment is clear, and I do not want to prolong the debate. I will be interested to hear the Minister's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's remarks in the spirit in which they were intended. He said that the amendment was a probing amendment; I hope that my explanation will satisfy him. If it does not, no doubt he will have further opportunities to raise the matter.
<P>
The effect of the amendment would appear to be one of two alternatives. The first is that, where the director general had recommended a block exemption order to the Secretary of State, parties to an agreement that would fall within the recommended terms could rely on the recommendation--presumably until the Secretary of State made a decision. In that period, they could continue as they were. Is that what the hon. Gentleman was saying?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> My fundamental concern is that we do not find ourselves legislating retrospectively. We always try to avoid that, as it passes problems to those who will be covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I think that I have got that right, then.
<P>
The second alternative is that parties to an agreement falling within the recommendation who had applied to the director general for exemption would not be liable for any infringement of the prohibition during that period. In other words, there would be a stay of execution until they were found to have infringed the prohibition in some way. In either case, the amendment is unnecessary and may be undesirable. I shall explain why.
<P>
The Bill already provides that block exemption orders can be backdated. Under clause 8(6), a block exemption order may be backdated if the Secretary of State so determines--subject of course to parliamentary procedure. That is the proper way to provide backdating when it is merited. The point made by the hon. Gentleman is covered, in that once a decision is made and it is clear that the proposal is acceptable, the backdating meets the requirements. It means that it would not affect the action being taken.
<P>
The amendment would simply remove one reason for the Secretary of State having a role. The Bill sets out a hierarchy, under which it is for the director general to recommend block exemptions, but for the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament, to decide whether to make them and whether they should be backdated. The amendment would make the Secretary of State's role in the latter respect a hollow exercise. We must maintain that accountability to Parliament through the Secretary of State.
<P>
I hope that, having heard those explanations, the hon. Gentleman will agree that our proposals are reasonable and fair, and that they meet the concerns that he expressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 6, line 11, leave out `a Regulation' and insert `any Community rule'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 69, in page 7, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ```Community rule'' includes any provision in the European Treaties, a Directive or Regulation adopted by the Commission or by the Council, and any decision, including a decision of the European Court of Justice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr Redwood:</B> We are rather surprised that clause 10 should single out Community regulations--one way in which the Community legislates--and particular types of Commission action, but not the other means by which the Community rules our lives. Amendments No. 68 and 69 would broaden the approach of clause 10, to give people the comfort that they could be exempted from other forms of Community legislation or decision as well as from Commission judgments and regulations.
<P>
It is unusual for the Community to legislate by regulation. Community regulations act directly within each Community country. It more usually legislates through directives which, in most circumstances, require additional legislation to implement them. In the United Kingdom, that is done through statutory instruments or primary legislation.
<P>
Clause 10 should take into account not only European decision making that acts directly through regulation, but European decision making that acts partly directly and partly through local domestic law--in the United Kingdom, by directives. We also think that decisions of important bodies such as the European Court of Justice should be included in clause 10, to make it comprehensive.
<P>
It is true that Commission decisions are often the most important in competition cases, but it would strengthen the clause if the ECJ were to be expressly included. We propose to achieve that by amending clause 10, leaving out the word ``Regulation'' and inserting the phrase ``any Community rule'', and introducing a definition of the term ``Community rule'' at line 16 to include all those points that I have mentioned. Business will want that reassurance.
<H4><center>[Mr. Peter Brooke in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I congratulate you, Mr. Brooke, on your elevation to the Chair.
<P>
The Committee will need to be reassured, as will business, that the Bill takes a comprehensive approach to the law in Europe as a whole and to the law in Britain. Therefore, in clause 10 or at some place of the Minister's choosing, the Bill should cover all types of Community legislation and decision making, not just the particular types singled out in clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Welcome to your new position, Mr. Brooke.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am demonstrating some unfamiliarity with it.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am sure that you will cope admirably, Mr. Brooke. You have achieved a full house, having been a junior Minister, a Cabinet Minister and now a Chairman of a Committee. You can now only go down.
<P>
I hope that I can persuade the right hon. Member for Wokingham that his worries, although legitimate from his point of view, are a bit over the top. One of the principal purposes behind the Bill is minimising, as far as is possible, burdens on United Kingdom business by aligning our domestic laws with those of the EC, which have applied in the UK for more than 25 years. That is in stark contrast to the position of the right hon. Gentleman, which is to retain the existing competition laws and force many businesss to assess their agreements under both the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and the prohibition-based regime of article 85 of the European treaty.
<P>
Clause 10 covers all the bases on which an agreement that is subject to article 85 has been exempted from the prohibition under EC law. The parallel exemption provision is not the only mechanism that we have for seeking alignment in EC and UK competition law treatment. I shall illustrate that by dealing with the Community rules that are set out in the amendment. It refers to European treaties; there is no need for that. The governing principles provision, clause 60, already ensures that relevant treaty provisions are reflected in the application of the domestic system.
<P>
Article 222 of the EC treaty provides that nothing in the treaty is to affect the law and practice governing the system of property ownership. For example, the ownership of intellectual property is not anti-competitive, but the exercise of intellectual property rights, such as discriminatory royalty rates, could be anti-competitive. As articles 85 and 86 must be applied within the limits of article 222, so must the UK prohibitions.
<P>
Regulations are covered in the parallel exemption clause. For example, regulation 1017/68 declares article 85(1) to be inapplicable to certain forms of agreement in the transport sector. Such agreements will be automatically exempt from the United Kingdom prohibition. Directives are also taken account of; they are addressed to member states, which must transpose them into national law. If the resulting national law imposes a legal requirement for certain agreements to be entered into or for firms to alter their behaviour, the relevant businesses will have the protection of the legal requirements exclusion under schedule 3--a matter that we discussed at an earlier sitting. If, by virtue of a treaty provision, something is not subject to article 85 or 86, that will be reflected through the governing principles provision, clause 60.
<P>
I come finally to decisions of the European Court of Justice. The governing principles clause imposes a requirement on those applying the prohibition not to act inconsistently with the principles laid down by the European Court of Justice or a relevant decision that it makes. Once again, there is no need for the amendment as such matters are covered in another part of the Bill. I hope that my explanation will reduce the fears of the right hon. Member for Wokingham. If, however, he still has some and writes to me, I shall give him a fuller response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> For once, I am grateful to the Minister. He has given me a good response to at least two of my worries about the provisions of the treaty and the decisions of the European Court of Justice. Anyone who now reads the Bill, especially when it is enacted, will see that the governing principles provision, clause 60, is more important than clause 10. I still believe that clause 10 is too narrowly drafted. The Minister illustrated that by telling us that we must look at clause 60. On occasions, matters will be governed directly by treaty or by decision of the ECJ, not in the specific ways set out in clause 10--by a directly acting regulation or by a decision or action of the Commission.
<P>
I would still prefer the Bill to be consistently drafted and that to be stated clearly in clause 10. Given that clause 10 pulls out some methods of Community action, it is strange that it does not include the others, which the Minister rightly tells us must also be part of the package. However, once again, looking at the balance of the Committee and because I want us to make progress, I am happy to withdraw the amendment, although I have been strengthened in my belief that the clause and other clauses must include the other methods of Community decision-making. We will now be able to tell business that that is the correct position. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 6, line 18, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (iii) The Commission has issued a comfort letter in relation to the agreement stating that either the agreement does not appear to infringe Article 85(1) or that it appears to satisfy the requirements of Article 85(3) or that it falls within a group exemption.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another case in which we feel that the Bill's drafting excludes matters of importance that should properly be included. Perhaps the Minister will again tell us that it is intended that the provisions of the amendment will be included in the manner in which the Bill is implemented. I look forward to him saying that, although again it would be better to write it into the Bill.
<P>
It is not at present clear from clause 10 that an industry or company that had obtained a comfort letter from the Commission to say that an agreement did not appear to infringe Community jurisdiction would receive a parallel exemption on the basis of that letter. Given the extraordinary delays in receiving complete decisions from the European competition authority, and given that a comfort letter is usually sufficient to ensure that no action is taken by the European authorities against parties to the agreements concerned, it would be helpful for businesses to know that if they have battled their way through and eventually received a comfort letter, they would in normal circumstances benefit from a parallel exemption under clause 10.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can satisfy me that that is the intention, although the Bill would be the better for saying so explicitly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend and endorse his view that either the amendment should be passed or the Minister must assure us that comfort letters issued by the Commission will attract parallel status inside the United Kingdom. The Minister will be only too aware that a great many notifications to the European Commission are now dealt with by way of comfort letters. The Commission has resorted to comfort letters because of the great volume of notifications that it has received. In the guidance that he has issued, the director general is contemplating using comfort letters from the outset as a mechanism to deal with the process.
<P>
Either we ought to pass the amendment to make that clear or the Minister must make it clear that where the Commission has issued a comfort letter, there will be a presumption that it will count to the same degree as guidance issued by the director general under UK legislation--that it will attract a parallel exemption--were that to be tested by the Office of Fair Trading or by the Competition Commission.
<P>
Given that the greater number of procedures initiated by companies seeking a parallel exemption will probably arise under the comfort letter procedure, it is curious that the relevant clause does not make clear that a comfort letter may attract a parallel exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Again, I hope that I am able to clarify the position for the Committee in my explanation. I shall take a little time to do that, but the issues raised by the amendment demand a full explanation, which I shall attempt to provide.
<P>
In EC terms, a comfort letter is one in which the Commission tells the parties to an agreement that it intends to close the file on the case. It may or may not give reasons. The proposed Commission determination may or may not have been given some publicity by the Commission, to enable third parties to comment on the effects of the agreement on competition. It may say that it is not of sufficient Community interest to justify its action. The Commission may expressly reserve its right to reconsider the matter. With such a spectrum of comfort--or even, in some cases, discomfort--it would be wrong to give automatic exemption to any agreement on which the Commission has said that it would close its file. EC comfort letters are not formal exemption decisions.
<P>
However, comfort letters will be highly relevant in the application of the UK prohibitions. The director general and the European Commission will apply a consistent prohibition test, and an EC comfort letter will therefore be of highly persuasive authority for the UK system. As the director general's draft guideline states, he considers that comfort letters preceded by a notice under article 19(3) constitute a statement of the Commission to which he and the courts are obliged under clause 60 to have regard, as I made clear to the right hon. Member for Wokingham in an earlier debate.
<P>
The draft guideline issued by the director general makes it clear that, as a general rule, he will not depart from the Commission's assessment of an agreement. The guideline goes on to identify the exceptional circumstances in which the director general might need to depart from a Commission comfort letter. For example, the Commission may issue a comfort letter saying the agreement is not caught by article 85(1) on the basis that it does not affect trade between member states. Such an agreement would benefit from automatic exemption under the proposed amendment.
<P>
It is simply unacceptable for such an agreement to benefit from an automatic exemption. That would cover agreements that had a harmful effect within the UK but that were not caught by article 85 because the effects were limited wholly or largely to the UK. The fact that such agreements do not have effects outside the UK, and are therefore not caught by article 85, should certainly not prevent the normal application of the prohibition.
<P>
Arrangements between bus companies in a town in the UK that prevented new entrants may raise serious competition concerns for the UK, but would be unlikely to affect trade between member states--unless, of course, the bus drivers lost their way. As such, the Commission would dismiss the matter as not coming within article 85(1). The amendment could therefore result in such an agreement being automatically exempt from the prohibition. Reliance on the powers of the director general to claw back such an agreement is simply not good enough. Once the comfort letter was obtained, the parties would not run any risk of sanction until action was taken by the director general.
<P>
The amendment would rob the deterrent effect of the prohibition against such agreements. Companies would have no incentive to consider the risks of breaching the prohibition until the director general took action, by which time the damage to competitors may already have been done. Anti-competitive agreements should be prohibited from the outset and not, as under the present regime, only when the authorities have come to a decision.
<P>
The position of comfort letters cannot, therefore, be compared with formal exemptions, whether on a block or on an individual basis. If an agreement benefits from an exemption, the Commission will have come to the view that any restrictive effects on competition are offset by countervailing benefits. That is an important aspect that we discussed in a previous debate, and which will arise on some later clauses.
<P>
The right for national competition authorities to take action against agreements that benefit from a Commission comfort letter is expressly recognised by the Commission and by the European Court of Justice. Paragraph 22 of the Commission notice on co-operation between national authorities and the Commission, which draws on quotes from a court case, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The fact that a practice has been held by the Commission not to fall within the ambit of the prohibition contained in Article 85(1) or (2) or Article 86, the scope of which is limited to agreements or dominant positions capable of affecting trade between Member States, in no way prevents that practice from being considered by the national authorities from the point of view of the restrictive effects which it may produce nationally.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that that full explanation will assist the Committee to see that the Government's proposals are consistent, will be easily understood by those who will be affected by them, and will maintain our right to deal with anti-competitive behaviour in a way that will prevent some of the problems that have arisen in the past, whereby companies have been run off the road and put out of business, so that they, the investors and the public have lost out on a better range of services.
<P>
Following that full explanation, I hope that Opposition Members will consider the proposals worthy and accept them as they stand in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was a fascinating and helpful answer, which clarifies the intentions behind a rather muddled piece of legislation, but it will disappoint many people in business. Business men who heard the words of the President of the Board of Trade believed that our law would be brought entirely into line with European law and that single jeopardy, rather than double jeopardy, would be created for anyone pursuing a competition case. I have argued throughout that there would always be double jeopardy and that there must be a difference between a domestic law code and an international law code, given that the international law code in its origins is based on inter-state rather than intra-state trading problems. The Minister has now accepted that.
<P>
The Minister gave us the good example of the bus industry and thinks that it will be possible for the European Commission, or the European authorities generally, to give the British bus industry a clean bill of health on the ground that there is not much cross-border trade from Kent into northern France--we have few amphibious buses.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman be on some of them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Not on the amphibious ones. I do not think that I would trust them, but perhaps I might try them after the Minister has tried them.
<P>
Considerable competition problems could arise within the United Kingdom if, as the Minister says, there needs to be double jeopardy--or two different types of jurisprudence and two authorities examining different things as well as, from time to time, examining the same things, perhaps from a different perspective. The Minister criticised our approach by saying that leaving the existing law in place would perpetuate double jeopardy, but I counter that by saying that a new type of double jeopardy, which is more expensive and disruptive, will be created. Under the existing law, all the things that are currently going on are deemed to be legal or reasonable unless and until the competition authorities investigate them one by one and find that they are unreasonable. That is the way to proceed. The Minister knows that I should like further investigation or rule changes in some areas of the economy because I believe that they are not competitive enough.
<P>
Under my proposed system, people would have the reassurance or comfort of knowing that what they are doing now is legal unless and until it is found otherwise, whereas there will still be two jurisdictions and double jeopardy under the Government's system. The bus industry case and many like it will arise, and businesses will have to ask themselves whether to break the European rules. If they find that they do not break the European rules, they will have to ask a separate and different question about whether they break the new prohibition rule introduced in the United Kingdom.
<P>
On the specific point prised out of the Minister about the comfort letter, business will find that disappointing because having been through the process of gaining a comfort letter from Brussels, it should count for something. I have some sympathy with the Minister in that there could be a case when a comfort letter is derived from Brussels but which relates to inter-state matters, so a separate competition inquiry or decision could be required in the United Kingdom. That is well outside the spirit of the remarks of the President of the Board of Trade and when she introduced the legislation and some of the early remarks that we heard about getting rid of double jeopardy.
<P>
We have flushed out what we wanted by virtue of the amendment and we must now tell business that a comfort letter does not count. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 7, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(12) The Secretary of State shall indemnify any United Kingdom company against any action taken by the European Community as a consequence of any exemption the company is granted under this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 12, in Clause 11, page 7, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) The Secretary of State shall indemnify companies or enterprises or undertakings or persons who by virtue of compliance with this Act are found to have breached relevant Community rules, provisions or procedures.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The amendment goes some way towards reassuring the British business community about the dangers of double jeopardy. I suspect, in the light of the Minister's most recent answer, that he will be a little nervous of indemnifying anyone under the legislation against European Community action. I can understand that. In fairness to business, if we are to reduce the scope or damage of double jeopardy, the competition authorities should be prepared to offer some reassurance in the event of an exemption that the Community dislikes.
<P>
The amendments, which would be inserted in clauses 10 and 11, are similar in style. They would offer some indemnity to companies because they are behaving reasonably, but then it is discovered that one jurisdiction does not reflect the views of the other jurisdiction.
<P>
I can already hear in my mind's ear the Minister's objections. He will say that it is not possible in each case for the British authorities to be sure what the European authorities might do. There will also be the worry that it might entail substantial expenditure if and when the British authorities get it wrong. I counter that by saying that, were the amendments accepted, the aim should be nil cost. We would not want to pay out indemnities, so it would mean that the British and European authorities would be forced to work closely together. The British competition authorities would have to be extremely careful because we would not want to increase their permitted budget to pay out indemnities.
<P>
Business is telling us that the total burden of regulation as between the European and British Governments is already at the point of being unacceptable. I freely accept that previous Conservative Governments did not remove as much regulation from the statute book as some of us would have liked. We will do rather better next time. We have seen an avalanche of regulation since this Government came to office and I fear that the Bill which, according to the President of the Board of Trade is designed to simplify matters, will add another layer of complexity and difficulty to the existing competition regulation in this country.
<P>
We have shown how many businesses will face uncertainty. We have had no answers from Ministers about the implications for newspaper pricing and distribution, the brewing industry or the relationship between brewers, tenants and publicans. We have had no reassurances about the relationship between car manufacturers and distributors, nor about franchise agreements. A series of industries with complicated agreements and arrangements will have to go back to the drawing board, consult their lawyers at enormous cost and then seek comfort from the competition authorities. It would be unfair if, after all that work having been completed over the next three or four years, an industry which had triumphantly gained what it thought was a watertight exemption from the British authorities and believed it to mean that the European authorities were also happy, subsequently fell prey to an investigation in Brussels because the two jurisdictions were not synchronised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Surely the principle involved is that just as businesses will be bound by the obligations of the Bill, they will be able, in most circumstances, safely to depend on the freedoms and exclusions that that might confer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I agree. It is a pretty raw deal if business men with other things to do, such as selling goods to customers, for example, have to wrestle with all the procedure. They might have gone through a lengthy investigation involving lawyers, lobbyists and so on, and triumphantly got their exemption under the British jurisdiction, thought that it meant that they were free of intervention from either jurisdiction, but subsequently found that that was not so.
<P>
The Minister might try to reassure us by saying that that is an unlikely circumstance. In that case, the guarantee is a free lunch; the Minister could offer it as a gesture of good will, to show that he is absolutely sure that those circumstances will not arise. However, if he argues that it could prove too expensive, it will have demonstrated that we have flushed out the huge danger of business having to spend a lot more money, and having to redouble its efforts by applying to both jurisdictions, to be absolutely sure that what it is doing is reasonable.
<P>
We hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the amendment. I am sure that business would be extremely grateful if he accepted such a proposal. I hasten to add that the amendment is not the idea of any particular business or lobby group. It is proposed by the official Opposition to try to test the proposition of double jeopardy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): Almost 50 years ago, I was a member of a congregation addressed by the then Bishop of Salisbury, who was preaching on the subject of faith. He was speaking of the time when Salisbury's cathedral spire was last repaired.
<P>
From the pulpit, he told us that the steeplejack at Salisbury cathedral had persuaded him to ascend the spire. When they reached the spire, the bishop saw that narrow planks had been laid around it. Those planks were held in place by stanchions, and the stanchions were linked by a rope. When the two men arrived at the top, the steeplejack said to the bishop, ``Now that I've got you up here, there are one or two things that I want to say to you. If I were you, I would lean back against the spire.''
<P>
``Then'', said the bishop, ``the steeplejack leaned back against the rope.'' The bishop gave that as an example of faith. That image has remained in my mind ever since.
<P>
I shall dwell only briefly on the faith of Government Back Benchers, to which I alluded during the sittings motion. The fact that they chose not to test the Minister on the Government's proposals is itself an exercise of faith. In ascending order, the reasons may be, ``It will be all right on the night'', ``Disretion is the better part of valour'', ``Ian knows where he is, even if I don't'', ``New Labour is never wrong'', and finally, ``I shan't still be a Member of Parliament when the excrement hits the fan.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a somewhat more sober note, I am sure that my right hon. Friend will wish to remind the Committee that faith was once memorably described as the suspension of disbelief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am always grateful to my hon. Friend for his interventions. He is certainly right.
<P>
The parable that I cited about the Bishop of Salisbury applies also to the condition referred to by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. A rope may be enough for a steeplejack, and faith may be enough for a bishop, but the rest of us would prefer belt and braces. I quite understand why my right hon. Friend moved the amendment. As was said when the war between the states was about to start in America, Abraham Lincoln wanted to have God on his side, but he had to have Kentucky.
<P>
In 1972, I was in Brussels, dining with the Anglo-Belgian chamber of commerce--it was the night of the Second Reading of the European Communities Bill. Mr. Kuipers, a Dutchman who spoke English with astonishing fluency, was then the chairman of the Economic and Social Council of the Community. He told the assembly that he had much sympathy for my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath)--Mr. Heath, as he then was--in his attempt to persuade the British people to enter the Community. He said that he had been invited by the British Government to spend the previous month touring the United Kingdom to explain what being in Europe would be like.
<P>
Mr. Kuipers said, ``Only last week, I was in a small village in north Wales where, after I had been asked an incomprehensible question by a Welsh trade unionist''--he then told us the incomprehensible question--``a little old lady at the back got up and said, `Oh, Mr. Kuipers, I'll tell you what is worrying us in the village. It is that if we go into this Community of yours, the Mafia will be allowed to set up its world headquarters in this village.''' Mr. Kuipers, demonstrating a profound knowledge of British political geography, said, ``Madam, I give you the absolutely categorical assurance that if that were to happen, you would be entitled to put them on the next train to Liverpool.'' It is just such a reassurance that we seek from the Minister in response to my right hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall pursue the more prosaic task of trying to understand the clause. I was struck by the Minister's response to our previous debate--it told us something about the amendment. The hon. Gentleman was arguing that it would be undesirable to make specific provision for comfort letters because, in some circumstances, the European Commission may give a comfort letter in respect of an agreement--because Community legislation would not bite on it because of its lack of effect on inter-state trade--but that letter may not provide a categorical assurance that that agreement would not be prohibited under chapter I because it may have an impact on competition within the United Kingdom. That is reasonable, but it is equally reasonable to expect that explanation to be written into the Bill to make clear the presumption in favour of comfort letters, except where they were excluded for the reason I have given.
<P>
The Minister seems to be pursuing the contention that there are indeed differences between the prohibition under article 85 and the prohibition under chapter I, but that difference is confined to trade between member states, as distinct from trade within the United Kingdom. In so far as an agreement bites upon trade solely within the United Kingdom--and is therefore not covered by the provisions of article 85, and would not fall to be notified to, or investigated by, the European Commission--it will be pursued within the United Kingdom by the competition authorities in a consistent manner.
<P>
I shall now cite an example of simple set theory, as I understand it. Let us suppose that two sets of agreements interlock. One set concerns both trade within the United Kingdom and trade between member states and the second set applies to trade only within the United Kingdom. The Minister is arguing that if any agreement in the second set interlocks with the first set and could be held to apply to both, it will be governed by the Commission. If it applies to the United Kingdom alone, it will be governed by the UK authorities and would not fall to be considered by the Commission. It follows from that that the Minister cannot conceive of circumstances in which an agreement falls to be considered by the UK authorities alone, but where it is also relevant to the EC jurisdiction, and where the UK authorities would apply rules and procedures that are distinct from the EC jurisdiction.
<P>
On that basis, the Minister argues that he cannot contemplate any circumstances in which a company stands at risk of incurring a prohibition and consequent penalties arising from article 85, because it had previously been considered under chapter I and found to be acceptable. That is the double jeopardy test--the Minister cannot conceive of circumstances in which both chapter I and article 85 apply, and the application of article 85 would be distinct from and different in its conclusion from the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
If that is the hon. Gentleman's contention, it is interesting and one that, in the fulness of time, will probably be tested to destruction. If it were tested to destruction and he was found to be wrong, the Government should put their money--I suppose it is the taxpayers' money--where their mouth is and indemnify companies against such an eventuality. If the Minister is right, that would not eventuate; if he is wrong, some protection needs to be afforded. If the hon. Gentleman resists the amendment, he will be suggesting that double jeopardy may eventuate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend think it more likely that there will be many instances in which there is a conflict between what is decided here and what is decided by European law--and therefore a substantial cost to the Exchequer--or that there will be few such cases, in which case the cost to the Exchequer will be small? If there are likely to be few such cases, that would justify the Minister in not making a fuss about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I think that such cases will be small in number. I hope that there are limited circumstances in which companies that had benefited from an exemption from chapter I prohibition would subsequently be found to be caught by article 85. It is difficult to conceive precisely what such circumstances would be. I suspect that there is an overlap, because it may be only when agreements are tested through Community institutions and as EC jurisprudence develops that we find that Community law bites on such agreements in ways that UK law, as expressed in the Bill, will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I hope that there will be few, if any, such cases. If the amendment were passed, the Government should then ensure that the British authority receives a comfort letter from the European Community before making an Order, so that there is no danger whatsoever of cost. That would force the British authority to square the European authority, so that to all intents and purposes there was only single jeopoardy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, I take my right hon. Friend's point. In an ideal world, there would be an interlocking set of assurances between the UK competition authorities and the EC competition authorities. If the UK authorities had concluded that a particular agreement affected trade between member states but that--because of the size of the agreement, or because trade under the agreement occurred predominantly within the United Kingdom and not across the Community as a whole, or for whatever reason--the agreement should be dealt with under UK legislation by reference to the same tests as would apply in EC law, the Community would give the UK authorities comfort, as it were, that it would not revisit judgments made under UK legislation.
<P>
I fear that over time judgments will be made under EC legislation that develop EC jurisprudence and introduce a whole new set of double jeopardies. Companies which have rested on the UK authority's competence may in time find that it has been overtaken by Community competence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that if the European Commission was not prepared to issue comfort letters to cover the circumstances that we have described, we would be justified in being deeply suspicious of its motives? Unless the Commission envisages the development of EU jurisprudence in such a way that double jeopardy would occur in a whole new body of cases, what possible objection could it have to granting comfort letters now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> There are two reasons why the Commission would not proceed in that way. First, it would not want to provide in Community legislation for such a system of comfort for national authorities, for fear that national authorities would extend the boundaries of their activities so as to take unto themselves many of the decisions presently made by the Commission. The Commission may fear that it would not see many cases. I imagine that the Commission would not want to proceed down that path unless it felt that it was able to impose exactly--the same provisions in each member state. Of course, article 85 is not necessarily transacted in exactly the same way in each member state.
<P>
Secondly, there is a separate constraint, which is that the Commission sees itself as a higher authority. It will presumably want to reserve to itself the impetus in developing jurisprudence. As my right hon. Friend contended in an earlier debate, clause 60 and EC jurisprudence represent the higher authority as compared to the clause that we are currently discussing. UK precedent will be established by the Commission and by the European Court of Justice, and not substantially by the director general or by the Competition Commission. The Commission will not want to surrender much of that authority to UK institutions. British companies will therefore have to seek the comfort that will not be available from interlocking assurances between the two competition jurisdictions. Increasingly, they will examine their agreements carefully, and if they are in any doubt about them, will try not only to have them examined by the UK authorities but to make precautionary notifications to European authorities. If the Minister feels that such speculation is unjustified, I am sure that not only will he tell us, but that he will embrace the amendment, because it would eventuate in no damage or cost to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It has been an interesting short debate, with one or two cameo performances from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) about faith. In the three Opposition Members, we have Faith, Hope and Charity. During the course of the Bill, I shall try to assist all three if I can.
<P>
The general thread in the debate so far has not been about faith, hope and charity, however. Implicitly and explicitly, it has been about Opposition Members' common abhorrence of Europe. They want to turn the clock back. The debate has been not about business or about double jeopardy, but about their inability, whether they like it or not, to accept that, as a general rule, Community law is superior in the legal hierarchy to national law. When something is prohibited by EC competition law, national law cannot authorise it. That has been so ever since we committed ourselves to the Community. British industry has worked with that fact in competition matters for that entire period. The process and the principle of the Bill has the overwhelming support of the business community.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham talks about reducing regulation, but he was a member of a Government who scattered regulation around like confetti. They started off with a bonfire of regulations, but before they were finished, there were more regulations that at the start. We need better, more effective regulation, which is what the Bill is designed to provide. A better and more effective regime will reduce the cost to industry and business and provide a framework to deal with anti-competitive behaviour in a way that they cannot at the moment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham mentioned breweries. The wording of the amendment and the proposals that it contains suggest that he could not organise an amendment in a brewery. We have made generous provision in the parallel exemption clause, which confers automatic exemption from the UK prohibition for agreements that are exempt under article 85, to avoid conflict with EC law.
<P>
The proposal that the Secretary of State should indemnify a company against a breach of articles 85 and 86 should be unlawful under Community law. I find it astonishing that the Opposition suggest that the Government and the British taxpayer should provide a bag of lolly to indemnify companies that may act anti-competitively, driving their competitors out of the marketplace, destroying jobs and investment and undermining key sectors of the economy. They suggest that, in such cases, as a matter of course, the British taxpayer should indemnify such anti-competitive behaviour. It beggars belief, but that was the thrust of the right hon. Gentleman's case, pure and simple. He nods his head--
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> No--shakes.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Well, whether the right hon. Gentleman shakes or nods his head, he is bang to rights on the matter. That is effectively what he is saying.
<P>
When an agreement may appreciably affect trade between member states and the parties believe that it appreciably affects competition, they should as a general rule notify the European Commission for an exemption. That is the advice of the director general in his draft guidelines. If an exemption was issued by the Commission, it would automatically be exempt from the United Kingdom prohibition.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There may be cases when it is not entirely clear whether an agreement affects inter-state trade. The fact that we are aligning our competition system with that of the Community will be of real benefit for business. In such cases, the director general and the European Commission are bound in practice to liaise with one another over which authority should deal with the case. That is envisaged in the notice that was issued by the European Commission on co-operation between it and the national competition authorities.
<P>
If the director general continues with the case and he grants the agreement an exemption, the parties will have the assurance that the matter will have been discussed with the Commission and that the director general will be applying a domestic competition test based on EC rules. That is a practical guarantee that further action by the Commission against the agreement is unlikely. We would also expect the director general to consult the Commission if he was doubtful whether the agreement appreciably affected competition.
<P>
Amendment No. 12 is unclear. I assume that it is intended to have the same result as amendment No. 6. It cannot be accepted for the same reason as those that I have already given. Read literally, the amendment could mean that the Government would have to indemnify a British company that was acting anti-competitively in Spain, as its actions would not be caught by the Bill.
<P>
It is an extraordinary suggestion that the British taxpayer should not only subsidise anti-competitive behaviour in the United Kingdom but that, if a company tries its arm in another country in the Community--and it so happens to be a British company--we would indemnify it for that, too. No wonder the Conservatives left the country's finances in such a parlous state. They have certainly learnt nothing since the general election.
<P>
In his usual formidable way, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire gently prodded me on two issues. I wonder whether the Committee has noticed his menacing approach. However, he always winks and smiles at me before he tries to bite my head off. He is the endearing pussy cat of the Conservative Back Benches, which is why I always try to assist him. I shall try to do so again, but I fear that I may fail. I will chance my arm, however, if not my head.
<P>
Comfort letters will be highly relevant in the application of United Kingdom prohibitions. The director general and the European Commission will be applying a consistent prohibition test and an EC comfort letter will be a highly persuasive authority for the UK system.The director general, in his draft guidelines, considers that comfort letters preceded by a notice under article 19(3) constitute a statement of the Commission to which he and the courts are obliged under clause 60 to have regard. The hon. Gentleman exaggerated his case slightly by saying that comfort letters had no place in the system as it related to the United Kingdom. That is not the case.
<P>
I referred earlier to the issues in connection with intra-state trade in a member state and cited the transport industry as an example. Comfort letters have their place. The draft guidelines issued by the director general make it clear that, as a general rule, he will not depart from the Commission's assessment of an agreement--a response to the hon. Gentleman's point about double jeopardy.
<P>
If the director general continues with the case and grants the agreement an exemption, the parties will have the assurance that the matter will have been discussed with the Commission and that he will be applying a domestic competition test based on EC rules. That is a practical guarantee that further action by the Commission against the agreement is unlikely. In that respect, the double jeopardy is an aunt Sally--to be put up and knocked down.
<P>
Secondly, no one will suffer any jeopardy under the Bill--unless he acts anti-competitively. I cannot believe that the Opposition want legislation in place that will inadvertently lead to the subsiding of anti-competitive behaviour. I hope that my response will persuade the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. Although it was moved as a probing amendment, it is probably slightly over the top in its intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> All right, I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall smile at the Minister to make him feel more comfortable. He has twice used curious phraseology; perhaps he will amend it. Twice he said that the UK competition authority's domestic competition test would result in a practical guarantee that further action by the European Commission against an agreement was unlikely. A guarantee that action is unlikely is not a guarantee. It is either a practical guarantee that further action by the European Commission will not occur, or it is a possible guarantee that action is likely or unlikely. Will the Minister amend his language and say that the practical guarantee is that further action by the European Commission will not occur?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> That was the shortest unsatisfactory answer that we have heard for some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am exceptionally grateful to my right hon. Friend. Following the previous exchange, I want to try to summarise the position. Is it not the case that, as a result of what the Minister said, the Government are merely saying, ``We think that you will be all right, but you are on your own if you are not.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend has put more briefly and more vividly much of what I was about to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Sit down then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> No, the Minister must be patient. He went on at some length, in a spirit that did not do him justice. I have a right to reply to the points that he made and to the substance of the amendment. I trust that they are the same, Mr. Atkinson, so that I can stay in order.
<P>
The Minister kindly referred to the Opposition Front Bench as Faith, Hope and Charity. That is the nicest name that he has ever given me, and I hope he continues trying to find suitable epithets. It is most unusual to call a Whip ``Charity''. However, it is an apt and wise definition. On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins), who does not have a speaking part, I gratefully accept it.
<P>
I take issue with the Minister on his statement that we are against European jurisdiction and do not like Europe. That is quite wrong, and the record shows otherwise. It is an important part of our case that the European jurisdiction has been accepted and that it is one of our treaty commitments, entered into by successive Governments.
<P>
We want to have British jurisdication for those matters that Europe does not deal with, or for those areas supplementary to the overarching competition jurisdiction of the European Community, but in a way that does not cause too many stresses and strains for British business in the form of double jeopardy. The Minister has not quite understood the points that we have been trying to make.
<P>
I was envisaging a rather closer and more friendly working relationship between the European competition authority and the British authority that will be set up under the Bill. The Minister seems to think that that is achievable. British business recognises, as the Minister now seems to recognise, that we have to have two jurisdictions, tackling the same or different problems from different angles. British business should expect either one of those authorities to have consulted the other, and for a rapid answer to be given under both jurisdictions--and not massive double jeopardy.
<P>
The Minister has not given us that reassurance. He says that the Bill will reduce the cost to business. We have already had a substantial debate on that subject, and my hon. Friend's have demonstrated that there will be a massive transitional cost, which we, and business, have put on record. We fear that there will be a bigger continuing cost to business, unless more work is done on overlapping and conflicting jurisdictions. Having suggested a guarantee, we have prised out of the Minister that there can be no guarantee and that double jeopardy and double risk will continue to exist for companies.
<P>
The Minister said that businesses exempt from the European jurisdiction will get an automatic exemption under the parallel exemption procedure. However, clause 10 and the other clauses do not make provision for that. I do not think that the Minister said the same thing about exemptions when he answered an earlier debate in a more sensible manner.
<P>
I understand that there will be a parallel exemption unless the British authorities decide otherwise. The director general is rightly charged with powers that could mean that something cannot be exempt from the British prohibition because it has an impact in the United Kingdom, although it had an exemption from the European jurisdiction on prohibition because it does not damage inter-state trading. That means that there is no automatic exemption that British authorities can modify according to domestic circumstances.
<P>
The Minister made a wild allegation when he said that my amendments sought to indemnify companies who indulge in anti-competitive behaviour. That is not so. I am a hawk against anti-competitive behaviour. The amendments seek to indemnify companies against the actions of the British competition authorities not against their own anti-competitive practices. They are carefully worded to ensure that the question of indemnity would arise only if a company had proceeded with the permission of the British competition authorities and if there was no outstanding action or ban from the European Community. That company would find itself in an unreasonable position if the European Community subsequently expressed dissatisfaction and threatened to take retrospective action.
<P>
It should be possible to ensure that European authorities will not override British authorities on trade in the United Kingdom before the latter grant exemption within the United Kingdom. The Community should concentrate on inter-state trade rather than intra-state trade, so it should be possible for the two jurisdictions to hammer out their respective responsibilities and to offer comfort.
<P>
The Minister went off on an even wilder flight of fancy when he said that our amendment would indemnify British companies that comply with the British rules in Britain but that, for example, trade anti-competitively in Spain. Of course, that is not so. The amendment concerns the jurisdiction of the British authorities and so there is no question of it relating to Spain, Italy, Greece or Portugal. Clearly, the British competition authority has no jurisdiction in Spain. It has its work cut out ensuring that there are no rackets or anti-competitive practices in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Has not my right hon. Friend, in his last sentence, chopped the red herring?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> And fried it as well. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster might wish to return to Kentucky so that we can have fried chicken with the red herring that my hon. Friend has so courteously put on the menu. We are approaching lunch time and such thoughts are on our minds.
<P>
I return to the substance of our amendments. We believe that it would be for the convenience and comfort of business to know that, before the British authorities granted domestic exemption, they had a clear indication that the European authorities would not override that exemption in relation to British jurisdiction. Of course, companies indulging in bad practices elsewhere in the Community would be prey to an action.
<P>
I do not wish to protect companies from such action or from getting their just deserts if they are indulging in anti-competitive practice. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham said, there would be massive transitional costs under the new system. In addition, a company could go through all the processes, get an exemption relating to the British market under the British prohibition regime and still be prey to another action from a different Commissioner who may have woken up on the wrong side of the bed that day in Brussels.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is called a scandal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Minister is being unfair to Commissioners, and I will not be drawn in that direction.
<P>
The Commisioner may then unpick what the British jurisdiction has done--in my view, legitimately--and the reassurances that the company has received. It is because the European authority is superior to the British authority in most respects that British business needs some form of guarantee or promise.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I can see that the Minister will not grant us the cash guarantee that we would like. In view of what he says about the likelihood of lots of mistakes being made in the British jurisdiction, I am not happy to raid the public purse for that, either. I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter with his officials and find ways to recommend to the new competition authority that it works closely with the Brussels competition authority, so that we can get as near as possible to offering British business the guarantee that if it is cleared by the British authority for its British activities, that will remain so unless and until the British authority--not the European authority--changes its mind on the matter. Having put that statement on the record, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exemption for certain other agreements</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 7, line 25, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) In such cases where the Chapter I prohibition is deemed to apply and the Article 85 prohibition is deemed not to apply, the Director shall publish the reasons for such a decision, giving particular regard to the reasons why EU practice is not to be adhered to.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a lower hurdle for the Minister to jump, so I hope that I can persuade him to come over with us. I move the amendment in the same spirit as that in which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry moved the amendment at the start of today's proceedings: to improve the process to make it more transparent, fairer and clearer for those who will have to undergo it.
<P>
We propose to insert at line 25 of clause 11 clarification on how the director general should go about making certain determinations. Whether the chapter I prohibition is deemed to apply, but where the European prohibition does not apply--in other words, where the British authorities, perhaps for good reasons, are being tougher or deciding that intra-state considerations that do not have influence at the inter-state level militate against a practice--the director general should have to publish the reasons for his decision. He should also make it clear in that statement why European Community practice is not being adhered to on that occasion.
<P>
I stress again that I have always believed, and will continue to believe, that there must be two jurisdictions, that it will be difficult but important to try to reduce double jeopardy, and that we need a process that is fair-minded and open for those who will have to go through it, because it will be vexatious, time-consuming, complex and often quite expensive for them.
<P>
The Minister has today given us one good working example--that of the bus industry--in which he and I agree that there may well be cases in which the European Community would say that there is no anti-competitive practice at European Union level, but in which the British authorities may conclude that a company is indulging in predatory pricing, running competitors off the road, and setting out to destroy competitors with a view to then reducing service, raising fares, or both, and that that should be stopped by British action. Where that is necessary, we think it especially important that the director general should have to publish his reasons.
<P>
Despite all that has been said about the Bill, many in business still want to believe that if they are clear in Brussels, they will be clear here. Given the nature of the Bill, it should be incumbent on the director general to specify the reasons for his decision where we take a different line from that taken by the European Community. He should also be forced to address the question of whether there is a legitimate reason for departing from the European ruling or practice. In many cases--in the bus industry, for example--it will be self-evident that he must depart from an exemption or failure to act on the part of the European Union, but the director general should first ask himself whether that is the case and be aware of the jurisprudence from Europe before he concludes his examination and publishes his decision. I hope that by the amendment, as it stands, or in a form of words of the Minister's choosing, we can draw attention in the Bill to the fact that there will be such cases and insist on the director general explaining to business why there is a different approach in Britain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Clause 11 makes it clear that the scope of the chapter I prohibition is not limited by the fact that in a few areas there are no EC regulations giving the EC Commission powers to apply article 85. For example, there is no regulation giving the Commission powers to apply article 85 to agreements relating to international air transport with airports outside the Community, such as transport systems from the United Kingdom to the United States of America.
<P>
In such sectors, even though the Commission has not been given powers by regulation to apply article 85, it does not mean that the sector is excluded from article 85. Under the treaty, member states have the power to apply article 85 in such sectors and the Commission also has the power to make a decision that there is an infringement and can propose measures to bring it to an end. This clause provides that if a member state grants an exemption, under article 85, to such an agreement, the Secretary of State may make regulations so that an exemption may be granted from the chapter I prohibition in respect of such agreements. This clause can, therefore, be seen as an extension of the parallel exemption provision of clause 10 to those sectors of the economy in which there are no regulations giving the Commission power to apply article 85.
<P>
The director general's decisions on the application of the prohibition will be published together with reasons for such decisions. Schedules 5, 6 and 9 contain provision for decision making. We went through that process in detail this morning. In reaching a decision on the application of the prohibition, the director general is required not to act inconsistently with EC jurisprudence under clause 60, save when that clause provides otherwise. He must comply with this obligation in all cases where the chapter I prohibition applies. That obligation applies even in those narrow sectors of the economy where the Commission does not have jurisdiction to apply article 85--for example, in the case of international air transport to airports outside the Community.
<P>
If the party is not satisfied that the director general has complied with the requirement to follow EC jurisprudence under clause 60, the decision can be appealed to the Competition Commission and then to the courts. Businesses therefore have the assurance that where the Bill does not differ from the EC system, for example, in the meaning of the prohibitions, European jurisprudence will apply.
<P>
That is the type of assurance that the right hon. Member for Wokingham was looking for, judging from the points that he put, fairly, to the Committee. I hope that my remarks will assist him either to withdraw the amendment or to make further comments, which I shall consider.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I hope that with your indulgence and to avoid a clause stand part debate, Mr. Atkinson, I might raise slightly wider issues, as the amendment touches on the whole clause. I am surprised that the Minister and the Government concluded that the clause is necessary, as the prohibition is not confined to those circumstances where the Community has established regulations under article 85. Even if there is an area, such as air transport, that is not implementing regulations, article 88 makes it clear that national authorities must do so in accordance with article 85. Therefore, in so far as clause 60 applies in the execution of the chapter I prohibition, why is the clause necessary in order to make clear that which ought to be clear in the Bill in any case? If it is necessary for a reason that I do not discern, why is it not necessary--I am straying ever so slightly here, Mr. Atkinson--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman but I think that he is straying on to a clause stand part debate. There is no reason why we should not have such a debate on clause 11, but I woudl rather not have a clause stand part debate on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I can be quick and the Minister may be able to give me an answer. If it were necessary to have such a clause, by virtue of a reason that I do not discern--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Even though the hon. Gentleman is being quick, he is still out of order. If he wishes to have a clause stand part debate, I have no objection. I urge him to make his further remarks then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, I am happy to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Minister did not really address the issues that I raised. As he knows, I do not comment on civil aviation matters because my wife works for an airline.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise. It was not my intention to embarrass the right hon. Gentleman. I was just citing a practical example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I am sure that that was not his intention. I was just reminding the Committee that I carefully follow that rule, even though that is more prudent than one needs to be in such troubled times. If all right hon. and hon. Members took account of all that their wives or husbands did, many would find the content of their speeches limited.
<P>
The argument did not illustrate the point about process that I was trying to make. All we are asking for is that when the British jurisdication is taking an apparently different view from the European jurisdiction--justifiably so, in many cases--a full statement of reasons should be given why such a decision was reached. I will press the amendment to a Division, unless the Minister concedes my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I think that I conceded the point in my response to the right hon. Gentleman. I made it clear both earlier and in this debate that the director general is required to set out in detail the reasons for a decision. There is a clear process whereby the parties concerned discuss matters with the director general, who can either accept the process or not. If he does not accept it, he puts in writing the details of his proposals. That is followed by a process that involves written and oral submissions. It was debated fully when we discussed clause 5, when I reassured right hon. and hon. Members that a precise set of proposals will in all circumstances protect the individuals concerned.
<P>
I also gave the commitment that the process will come into place only following a clear consultation to ensure that the parties concerned can have some ownership over the way in which the proposals will operate. I gave a commitment to provide every member of the Committee with details of how the process will work. I hope that that explanation will assist the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I apologise to the Committee that I had to leave our sitting earlier to attend minimum wage business.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Pray, tell me what happened?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> They did not get much--thanks to the meanness of some Ministers.
<P>
As I obviously missed some important exchanges, I should like to have time to consider them. I feel strongly about the issue. We shall table a further amendment concerning the process, so that such matters are clearly published. I am not withdrawing what I said, but I would like to study the matter a little further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, be leave, withdrawn.
