								Stephen
Shaw:
							</b>
						</i> Both I and my office welcome the Bill&#146;s
proposals. The office has been calling for them since it was
established in 1994, and there has been a Government commitment going
back the best part of 10 years. We welcome the proposals and believe
that they will give us the proper authority to conduct our business,
which is of considerable public importance and significance. We believe
that insofar as the Bill codifies and in certain respects extends our
powers, it is appropriate. It gives the office and the post holder
equivalent authority with the chief inspector of prisons. When these
proposals were first considered three or four years ago, I argued
strongly that the post holder should benefit from having a royal
warrant, not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>least to denote equivalent status with the chief inspector. But when it
comes to practical issues, will it make a great deal of difference to
how we conduct our business? The candid answer is no, it will
not.</div>
					<a name="07101827000409"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07101827000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause sets
out what we are entitled to do, how we go about our business and how we
conclude our investigations, which in large part reflect our existing
practice. It codifies that, puts it in a public form and reflects the
important work that we do, which includes work that is part of the
state&#146;s compliance with article 2 of the European convention on
human rights. However, in day-to-day terms it will not make a great
deal of difference to how we conduct our
business.</div>
					<a name="07101827000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
very much welcome the proposals, which are largely right, it would be
proper to share with the Committee the issue of whether the Bill as
drafted provides the appropriate degree of independence for the
commissioner, a statutory ombudsman. It is a principle going back to
the first one in Sweden nearly 200 years ago, and a core international
standard of what an ombudsman is, that they should not operate within
the system but be freestanding and conspicuously independent of the
services that they oversee. Under the Bill as drafted, the commissioner
will be operating within a structure determined by the Secretary of
State&#151;in that sense, the ombudsman will be a departmental
ombudsman.</div>
					<a name="07101827000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view,
which I have shared with colleagues in the Ministry of Justice and
elsewhere, is that it would be better if the commissioner was
accountable directly to Parliament rather than to the Secretary of
State and the Ministry. That would have two or three important
benefits. First, the post holder would be more conspicuously
independent; secondly&#151;it may appear paradoxical but I believe it
be true&#151;the post holder would be more accountable were he or she
responsible to and examined directly by Parliament. The third
advantage, assuming that the measure goes through, is that it will be
in place for many years to come, as no Government, of any party, will
want to return to it in a hurry, so what is set up must stand the test
of time.</div>
					<a name="07101827000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the
courts consider the ombudsman or commissioner to be sufficiently
independent under the Bill as it stands to withstand challenges under
article 2? At the moment perhaps they would, but if we consider how the
law is likely to develop, an ombudsman operating under a departmental
umbrella is likely to be challenged about the degree of independence he
or she enjoys. In a recent case, the Parole Board was found wanting on
exactly those grounds. The Ministry of Justice intends to appeal
against that judgment and we shall have to wait for the outcome, but it
seems to me that that is the way that the law is going. There are about
half a dozen references in the Bill to what the Secretary of State may
do or pay for, and it would be better if they were replaced by a
reference to Parliament
itself.</div>

							<a name="07101827000445"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am glad you mentioned that particular aspect of
the Bill, as one of my concerns is that from clause 37 onwards,
investigations are requested by the Secretary of State.
&#147;Request&#148; is an interesting word to use in this context;
it seems to be a dressed-up way of saying things that he can tell the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>commissioner to do. If you look at clause 37, you will see that the
Secretary of State will be entitled to</div>
					<a name="07101827000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;request the Commissioner to
investigate any matter mentioned
in&#148;</div>
					<a name="07101827000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">various subsections
of the clause. Essentially, the Bill specifies what the Secretary of
State may order the commissioner to
do.</div>
					<a name="07101827000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was interested
to hear what you said about the nature of the office. The commissioner
will have similar powers to a High Court judge, but not the
independence. On geographical matters, do you work from an office
within the Ministry of Justice or Home Office,or do you have a
self-standing
building?</div>

probation, prisons and constabulary, and the secretariat that serves
the independent monitoring boards attached to every prison, so my
office is at some stage removed from the MOJ and Home Office.
Technically, it is in a Home Office building, but that might
change.</div>

appropriate if you were not&#151;I use this language
loosely&#151;an employee of a Government Department but, like a
judge, simply appointed by the Government or the
Crown?</div>
					<a name="07101827000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Stephen
Shaw:
							</b>
						</i> Certainly I would have to think about the first
part of what you said about being like a judge. Do I think it
constitutionally more proper for the post holder to be outside the MOJ
and responsible to Parliament? Yes, I do. Indeed, I have made that
point before.</div>
					<a name="07101827000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
say something about clause 37, which is
entitled,</div>
					<a name="07101827000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Investigations
requested by the Secretary of
State&#148;?</div>
					<a name="07101827000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
useful for the Committee to know that I originally asked for the clause
some three or four years ago when the measures were first considered.
It would enable the commissioner to conduct, in effect, ad hoc
inquiries of the kind that I am able to do. I have done some of my most
important work in public life conducting a number of ad hoc inquiries
on matters such as immigration, probation and prisons, and I wanted the
possibility of such inquiries to continue, so argued for the clause. I
believe that it is now thought that if the courts decided that article
2 compliant investigations were required following a significant number
of near-deaths or near-suicides in prisons, they could be carried out
under clause 37.</div>
					<a name="07101827000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
share your view, or I perhaps advance my own, that clause 37
subsections (7) and (10), which talk about the &#147;duty&#148; of
the commissioner to do what the Secretary of State requests and about
&#147;directions&#148; from the Secretary of State, are
inappropriate measures to apply to a statutory
ombudsman.</div>

							<a name="07101827000447"></a>Mr.

						</b> Do you think that the commissioner&#146;s remit
will be wide enough in terms of premises? From my own experience, and
from briefings and so on with outside bodies, I have concerns about the
fact that you cannot look at every form of involuntary custody. I
accept that the military system is excluded&#151;it is under a
different set-up&#151;but is the remit sufficient to cover all local
authority involuntary accommodation?</div>

Shaw:

						</i> No, it is not. My office would like to see an
extension of the remit on complaints in respect of children held in
secure training centres. Under the current sentencing framework, two
children could be convicted of the same offence and receive the same
sentence, but one might go to a secure training centre and the other to
a young offender institution. The child in the young offender
institution would come within my current and future statutory remit,
but the child in the training centre would not come under my remit
regarding complaints. I do not think that I am betraying any secret by
saying that the Youth Justice Board, my office and the MOJ have been
looking at that. My own view is that the remit should be extended to
secure training centres, and I am hopeful that that will be agreed
during the passage of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07101827000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes to
local authority secure accommodation, you have two potential anomalies.
The anomaly at the moment is that, as I said, two children convicted of
the same offence could receive the same sentence and they could go to a
secure training centre or to a young offender institution, but of three
children convicted of the same offence and receiving the same sentence,
one could end up in a local authority secure home. You could argue that
that is an anomaly: should not the same protections
apply?</div>
					<a name="07101827000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trouble
with that is it runs into the other potential anomaly, which is that
many children in local authority care in the same home are not
offenders and would not have access to me. My understanding is that
children in the local authority accommodation have other routes through
which they can complain. I personally am content that that is the case
and that it would create more of an anomaly if just a small number of
those children were able to come to me and the rest
not.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101827000448"></a>Mr.

						</b> Perhaps it could be sorted out by increasing your
remit to cover those children in local authority care by order of a
criminal court as opposed to a family court

						</i> I understand that argument, which in the past
the office has been sympathetic to. The counter-argument is that you
are running a small home for children and you have two different
systems, depending on how the children have ended up in the home. I am
not sure that that is particularly user-friendly for the
child.</div>

					<a name="07101827000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Corporate
Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 has been the subject of
quite heated discussion in Parliament over the last year or so,
particularly in relation to the application of that law  to
custodial and police premises. It is in, but it is a case of &#147;Oh
Lord, make me perfect, but not yet.&#148; It does not apply to the
Prison Service and police cells for  three
years.</div>
					<a name="07101827000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Forgetting
the party politics of this, as a dispassionate but clearly interested
observer, would it assist you or the commissioner if the Act applied to
custodial premises immediately, not least because it seems from the
clauses of the Bill that we are concerned with now that sometimes you
may have to defer or at least have the power to defer an investigation
until criminal proceedings are concluded? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>I can see a situation in which, at the moment, with the three-year
delay, you might be investigating something that ought more properly to
be investigated by the police as opposed to the Health and Safety
Executive, and things may happen or not happen, documents may or may
not disappear and witnesses may or may not have statements taken from
them, which could inhibit either your processes or the Crown
Prosecution Service processes in arriving at
justice.</div>

						</i> Just by way of preface, the office has no view
and expressed no public view on corporate manslaughter. My personal
view is that I welcome the extension, when it comes, to prisons and
police cells. We have a protocol under my current arrangements, a
memorandum of understanding with the Association of Chief Police
Officers, such that where there is a parallel police
investigation&#151;perhaps because a death has occurred and the
police suspect homicide or assisted suicide or, indeed, if other health
and safety or other charges are possible&#151;under the terms of the
memorandum we endeavour to ensure that we do nothing that might
prejudice a
prosecution.</div>
					<a name="07101827000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way
in which the Bill is drafted is, I think, superior to the memorandum
that I currently have, in that it makes it clear that it is my

is or is not appropriate in the particular circumstances. Bearing in
mind that my investigations and those of my office into deaths in
custody are part of the state&#146;s compliance with article 2, I
think that the way in which the Bill is presented will enable me rather
better to conduct an investigation in parallel with something that the
police or the CPS are pursuing than perhaps is the case at the
moment.</div>

						</i> Yes, my own feeling is that, if clause 37 is to
be used as the basis for a significant number of near-death or
near-suicide investigations, it would be sensible in due course to
revisit what is actually said there, because the procedures will be
different. Whereas in a death-in-custody investigation there will be an
inquest&#151;that is the public examination&#151;where there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>a near-death or near-suicide, by definition there will not be an
inquest. By definition, to be article 2 compliant I have at the very
least to consider whether the evidence should be presented in public

hearings.</div>

question,  Mr. Shaw. The provisions of part 4 for

deemed  to be cost-neutral and your budget in 2005-06 was
&#163;5.7 million. Given the discussion that you have had about the
possible extension of your role and given comments, for example, from
Mr. Garnier, about some of the aspects of potential

There is the case of D, where I am conducting the article 2 compliant
investigation; there is a case 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>known as SP, where the Ministry of Justice and lawyers representing SP
have agreed that article 2 is invoked and an investigation is to take
place; and the case of JL, which is the most recent case, where the
court appears to be saying that the fact of a near-death occurring may
trigger a need for an independent investigation. If it appears that it
could be argued that the state has some responsibility, and in the
prison context it would not be hard to argue that that trigger had been
reached, in those cases you would need to have what the court called
the full D process, involving hearings and lawyers. The numbers are
difficult to predict, but there are many self-inflicted injuries in
prison. There are between 150 and 200 cases a year of people being
resuscitated. If each one of those cases were to trigger a D-type
inquiry, we are talking about substantial sums of public

there has been no improper interference with any of my decision-making.
Indeed, I hope that I would have been bold enough to have resigned had
there been so. That is not to say that prisoners, when I have made an
adverse adjudication, have not said, &#147;Well who is it,
Mr. Shaw, who appointed you?&#148; and &#147;Who is it,
Mr. Shaw, who pays you?&#148; When I have to answer that
it was the Secretary of State who appointed me and it is the same
people up in Bootle who pay the rest of the Home Office and the
Ministry of Justice who pay me, the prisoner tends to turn around and
say, &#147;Aha.&#148; So, there is no doubt that the legitimacy of

Cohen</b> (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab): I have a number of
questions, Mr. Crossman, so perhaps we can treat them in a
bit of a quick-fire way, because of time constraints. One aspect of the
Bill gives the courts greater discretion over tariffs for indeterminate
sentences, particularly for exceptionally serious sentences. What are
your concerns about indeterminate sentences and the parts of the Bill
that relate to them? Also, the Government have talked about taking into
account an offender&#146;s level of risk, although they have not
spelled out in detail what the mechanism for that would be. Would that
ameliorate some of your concerns?</div>
					<a name="07101827000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, certainly. Before I answer that, I
must say from Liberty&#146;s perspective that we do not generally get
into sentencing issues, but there are many organisations that do. We
commented mainly on the original White Paper, because the issue at hand
was confidence in the criminal justice system, which we think is a
reasonable subject for us to comment on. However, our comments on this
matter have been brief and we do not claim it to be our particular area
of interest or expertise.</div>
					<a name="07101827000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had concerns about
tariffs. I have mentioned confidence in the criminal justice system.
Part of the problem that we identified about what is
proposed&#151;taking away the automatic reduction of a sentence by
half for a certain type of new offence that fits into the category that
is beyond serious and into the extremely serious range&#151;is that
it will create a sort of blip in sentence lengths. At some point, you
have the cut-off point up to which all sentences must be reduced by
half. Then, presumably, there is a range of sentences&#151;remember
that we are still talking about extremely serious offences across the
board&#151;where because that requirement to reduce the sentence by
half has been removed, you would expect judges automatically to lift
the amount of sentence, so you suddenly have an extra hierarchy of
seriousness and increased sentence length. At a time when there is a
lot of public concern, which is often expressed, that they do not
understand how sentencing works, adding that extra layer might be
problematic. As I said, the issue is not one of significant principle
for us. We asked whether it would actually do good or harm to
confidence in the criminal justice
system.</div>

that, to remove powers from the Parole Board must imply that there is a
perceived problem with the way in which it operates and that it is
necessary for the Executive to take back some powers. As a general
matter of principle, in individual cases the role of the Executive
should be kept to an absolute minimum and independent bodies, whether
the judiciary or the Parole Board, should have as much input as
possible. I am not sure what the policy drivers are to make such a
decision, but there might be good reasons for doing so. I do not know
but, if by doing so, public confidence in the parole system is
undermined, it should be approached with
caution.</div>

						</i> We do not have a problem in principle with
conditional cautions, but with conditional cautioning that is intended
to be punitive. Cautioning has long been considered to be the way in
which people can be kept out of the criminal justice system so they do
not have to go to court and are given&#151;albeit a
clich√(c)&#151;one last chance not to get on to the treadmill of
the criminal justice system. Having practised as a criminal lawyer, I
can say that, when once a person is in there, it is difficult sometimes
to get out of
it.</div>
					<a name="07101827000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cautions have
their role, as do conditional cautions. When legislation specifies that
the purpose of cautioning can be punitive, that is a cause for concern.
The punitive element of sentencing is for judicial determination; it is
not something that the police should be doing. Their role is not to
punish. That was what happened when the conditional cautioning scheme
was rolled out originally. It has now been extended, so our concern is
about the punitive element. Hopefully, the intention is to use cautions
in respect of younger people as a good thing, but I feel more strongly
about making them punitive.</div>

								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> What was interesting about the way that the
matter was described was that it seemed to be part of the ongoing
rebalancing of the criminal justice debate that has been taking place
for many years. The explanatory notes indicated the need to put the
compensation payable to victims of miscarriages of justice on an
equivalent basis to that paid to people who had suffered injury as a
result of criminal injury. I cannot see why the two situations
necessarily match up. Having a two-year cap because that matches up
with what happens in cases where people have been injured during
crimes, has no logic other than it being the same number. It is the
same with the way a cap is imposed on criminal injury
compensation.</div>
					<a name="07101827000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more
appropriate approach would be to view this in the same way as one might
approach civil litigation. Of course there should be a limitation
period. The idea that someone can turn around many years hence and say,
&#147;I want to claim for the loss resulting from this wrongful
conviction,&#148; is incorrect, just as it would be for someone who
turns around many years after a civil action and says, &#147;I wish
to claim.&#148; That is why we have limitation periods. A six-year
limitation period as in civil cases would be appropriate. The
imposition of a cap, albeit a high cap which I am sure would not often
be reached, seems odd when the basis of loss is not one that would
generally be capped. Generally the upper limit would be determined by
looking at all the factors involved. However, as I said, half a million
pounds&#151;which I believe is the cap&#151;is a high amount, so it
is not a point that we would press particularly
hard.</div>

						</b> Let us move on to the criminalisation of extreme
pornography. You  expressed concerns that the legislation could
be drawn too wide, and indeed the Bill includes, as part of extreme
pornography, the phrase that I referred to on Second Reading,
&#147;appears to&#148; which seems very wide. Do you feel that that
is a wide definition? What are your
views?</div>

								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> Let me begin by saying that we have no
issue with the principle of the offence, especially in situations when
people are involved in activity and there is coercion involved. There
is a gap in the criminal law, especially if someone does not fall
within the realms of the Obscene Publications Act 1964, which deals
with possession with intent to sell  for
gain.</div>
					<a name="07101827000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of my
original points was that usually a criminal offence is created because
there is a need to do so. What was surprising was that the original
White Paper said that there was no evidence to show a greater degree of
criminality as a consequence of people seeing this type of material. I
understand that further research has now been done that might indicate
a causal link. I have not seen it. However, that is the starting point.
I was surprised that the offence was being created without some
evidence behind it, but I do not take issue with the principle behind
it.</div>
					<a name="07101827000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
with the breadth of the offence. For a number of years, there has been
a legislative tendency to draft offences extremely broadly. The Sexual
Offences Act 2003, which has some similarities, created a range of
extremely broad offences that one would not object to in principle but
which create concern as to the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>number of people who might be criminalised. There was a tendency to say,
&#147;It&#146;s okay, we&#146;ll require some extra authorisation
before prosecution can take place, be it from the Director of Public
Prosecutions or the Attorney-General.&#148; That in itself is not
grounds for overbroad criminalisation. It is a bar against improper
prosecution, but technically if you commit a crime, you commit a crime,
whether or not you are then prosecuted.</div>
					<a name="07101827000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry, I realise that you
asked me to be brief and I have given a lengthy answer. My concern
about this offence, is that the range of activity that will be covered
could include activities, such as sadomasochistic practices, that
people might find peculiar but that frankly do not harm anyone apart
from those who participate in them. I know that a number of people have
expressed extremely strong concerns about this, and we share those
concerns. There will be people who cause no harm to anyone else, who
engage in private activities or who possess material that clearly
involves acting and where there is no suggestion of any coercion. That
falls within the breadth of the offence. The defences that accompany
the offence do not seem to be particularly relevant. They seem to
revolve around someone not being aware that they are possessing
material. There needs to be some limitation. I would base that around
the idea of knowledge of consent or actual consent of those who have
partaken in the
material.</div>

						</b> That is interesting, but let me take you further on
this. I raised the issue on Second Reading. You did not quite get to
the point that it is not just the activity itself happening for real
that is covered, but also when it &#147;appears to&#148;. That
would presumably be ritualised or, as you say, acted out. I think that
Ministers would probably argue that not having &#147;appears
to&#148; would open up a huge loophole. How would you cover not just
the act, but a bit beyond that&#151;or would you not go beyond the
act?</div>

						<i class="I">

								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> I think that you are right and have
identified a real problem. What illustrated this issue to me was the
idea that &#147;appears to&#148; clearly covers things that are not
real such as acting and representation. Because it was realised that by
putting that wording in a lot of certified material in films could fall
into the definition, it was necessary to introduce a defence that the
film might be certified, but if an excerpt is taken from a certified
film it becomes an offence again. This offence ties itself up in knots
somewhat because it is trying to identify the correct parameters of the
criminal law by setting them so broadly that little loopholes have to
be created that are, frankly, not particularly
impressive.</div>
					<a name="07101827000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
example I gave in the briefing was the film &#147;Casino
Royale&#148;, in which there are sections that may well fall into the
definition of the offence if taken as cuts on their own. For anyone who
is wondering which bits I am talking about, they are the torture
scenes. That film was certified as suitable for 12-year-old children to
see when accompanied by an adult. That is the danger of having an
offence that is based partly on the need to criminalise and partly on a
subjective concept of what is moral and proper. As soon as you start
doing that, you get into grey areas about where the law should
end.</div>

						<i class="I">

								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, although it is not necessarily
criminalisation. The parts of the Bill that concern me are when it gets
into the rather grey area of where the criminal law starts and ends.
The provisions to remove people from properties for antisocial
behaviour, unlike the provisions in relation to crack houses where this
legislation has been introduced, will presumably involve families.
There will therefore be children who are moved from one place to
another, who will be relocated and re-housed. I was very
concerned&#151;I am sure that we will come on to this part in more
detail later&#151;by the lack of any accompanying provisions to
ensure that appropriate provision is made for families that are
removed.</div>
					<a name="07101827000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would say something similar about the special immigration status
provisions, which will clearly lead to the families of those who are
given special immigration status having conditions placed upon them as
a consequence&#151;that is what the Bill says. As far as I can see,
that flies directly in the face of what the children&#146;s
convention says is the appropriate treatment of children. Therefore,
for us, sometimes, it is not so much about what the criminal law says;
it is about the line between what is punitive and what impacts on those
who have done nothing wrong themselves. They are dealt with by the law
because of the actions of their families.</div>

just to press him on what basis he makes that assertion, given that,
for example, in clause 64 we define quite clearly in subsection (6)

person&#146;s life, or indeed, under clause 64(6), other aspects that
I will not go into in the Committee today. I was interested in the
definition, from Liberty&#146;s perspective, of whether this is a
real objection or, in a sense, a technical objection that needs later
clarification, or whether the objection is specifically on a freedom of

						</i> It is both of the first two. It includes
the technical aspect, as to how it will be determined that the purpose
of an extraction of the type that we are talking about might be for
purposes of sexual arousal. More broadly, there is concern over the
idea of criminalising activity where you are dealing with something
that, in itself, is perfectly legal&#151;a film that has been
censored and given a 12 certificate. A part might be extracted for the
purpose of sexual arousal and the possession of that extract becomes a
crime. It is where you feel comfortable about the limits of the
criminal law, when no one else is being affected. Obviously, no actors
were harmed in the making of this film. So it is about where you define
the limits of where the appropriate criminalisation is to be.</div>
					<a name="07101827000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is difficult, because, as
I said at the beginning, we do not have an issue with the creation of
this offence. The difficulty arises when you are dealing, effectively,
with offences involving morality; it is very difficult to draw a
specific line where the criminal law should begin and where it should
finish. This is the Government&#146;s offence. We will obviously try
to make suggestions as to where we think that that line should be
appropriately drawn, and we do not pretend that it is easy. We will try
to make positive suggestions, but frankly we would be uncomfortable
with the idea of something being criminal simply because it is going to
cause sexual arousal, if no other criminality is being
alleged.</div>

Mr. Garnier, for succinctly putting one of my other concerns
into a far more condensed version than I did. The problem is, indeed,
that this is extremely subjective. When making a subjective
determination on criminality, some jurors might think, &#147;Oh, that
is horrible stuff. I do not like that. They must be guilty&#148;,
when dealing with acts that are not causing harm to other
people&#151;obviously parts of the Bill will cover areas where people
are being hurt, and that has rightly been criminalised&#151;and it

way in which this offence is defined, when referring to rape. If you
are talking about a depiction of rape in a film, that is something that
will have occurred in many classified films, but it is not rape because
it is acted. If it is actually rape, that is non-consensual; someone
has been coerced into something against their will. Therefore it is
appropriate to make it a criminal offence to possess such material.

							<b class="B">
								Gareth
Crossman:
							</b>
						</i> We are saying that there should be a
moratorium on further speech offences, further incitement offences and
further speech offences generally. Let me explain why. The development
of speech offending has been somewhat piecemeal. Since it first became
a criminal offence to incite someone to racial hatred in 1965, to the
current version of the offence in the Public Order Act 1986, to the
extension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>to incitements to racial and religious hatred in 2006, incitement to
hate&#151;which is not a crime in itself&#151;has been criminalised
for certain things. Other speech laws include encouragement to
terrorism, and, where no intent is required, a recklessness test.
Several things arise from that rather piecemeal approach. One of them
is that it seems that there is no logical reason why people would
choose to offer the protection of the criminal law to a certain type of
speech incitement offence, but not to others. Why, for example, will it
now be an offence to incite someone to homophobic hatred, but if I
incite someone to hatred on the basis of their sex or disability, it
will not be an offence? Why? There is no illogical reason for that. The
justification seems to be that there has not been a case made for it,
but the case for introducing an offence might be made by those who
lobby most effectively to introduce that
offence.</div>
					<a name="07101827000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is an efficacy issue. Do those offences work? How many
prosecutions do we have? I think that Lord Basham said that there had
been 79 prosecutions since 1987 for incitement to racial hatred. That
works out at about four a year, so the legislation is not used a lot.
Maybe the chilling effect is greater. I remember that when I was
looking into racial and religious hatred, I looked at the British

experience. It referred to the trial taking place at the time of two
members of the British National party for racial hatred. The BNP
website said&#151;this will not be word-perfect, but was the
sentiment&#151;that they must ensure that they gain maximum publicity
and membership from the publicity that the trial generates. Possibly,
those who originally created the offence of incitement to racial hatred
did not intend that it should provide succour, promotion and membership
opportunities for members of extreme right-wing
parties.</div>

						</i> Ideally, you should adopt the model that
was used for the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, which included
the need for intent and the specific protection to cover free
expression. That would be the logical approach to take. The difficulty
is that, while one can understand&#151;if one wants to introduce
those offences&#151;why those extra protections might be needed,
there is no logic to it because religious incitement has a distinct
nature, it is not immutable in the way that other things are and there
is no logic with which to approach the religious model. The more
obvious choice is the racial model, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>but that does not have the protections of free speech that the religious
model has. That is why there needs to be a review of how those laws
operate.</div>

						</i> I did look at them, although only very
recently in the past few days or so. I looked at them with interest
because there have been some concerns about how, on the one hand, to
provide the proper protection that is necessary for children to be kept
safe and, on the other, to address all of the problems that can arise
from the notification process. When members of the Government went to
the States, they saw what was being applied there and felt concerned
that that level of public awareness might prove counterproductive. One
aspect of the current model is that the police know where people are
and those people know that the police know that; if they were hounded
out of their homes, no one would know where they would be and they
might be a greater danger. Therefore, I looked at that issue with
interest and do not see how the clause, as it is drafted, would work.
There are major problems in the drafting.</div>
					<a name="07101827000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may, I shall explain where
I think problems might arise. It states that there is a presumption
that the responsible authority should disclose information about the
relevant previous convictions of the offender to the particular member
of the public. That would create a presumption that one would have to
inform someone, but in relation to whom would that presumption apply?
Which member of the public would that be? Also, the person who would be
given that information would not have asked for it but would be given
it whether or not they wanted it. They are told whatever level of
information is considered appropriate. A further problem arises from
the fact that conditions can be imposed upon that person&#151;who may
never have asked for that information&#151;about what they may do
with it. What conditions are they? How will they be enforced? Will
breaching them involve some sort of civil liability? You cannot enforce
a civil liability on somebody who has been given information, whether
or not they wanted it, and is then told that they cannot use
it.</div>
					<a name="07101827000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more practical
thing that struck me is that if you are one of these people who is
given this information it puts you in an intolerable position if you
are then given conditions. If you are given a certain level of
information about a person, because they pose a risk and it is
necessary to protect children, but you are then told that there are
conditions upon this information and you cannot pass it on to certain
people, what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>happens if a child is hurt in that area and it is found out that you had
that information? You are not a public figure. You do not have the
backing of an official role. You are just a person who has been given a
piece of information. That is an intolerable position to put
individuals in. It is fine when you are talking about people who are
performing roles, such as head teachers of schools, because there is a
clear delineation about what they can and cannot do. The way that this
is drafted will put people in very difficult positions and I do not see
quite how it will be
enforced.</div>

about incitement to hatred. There may be many things that you wish to
do against those who sing foul, homophobic nonsense. You may wish not
to allow them into the country if they are from overseas because you
believe that they are not conducive to the public good. If you run a

do not think anyone would dispute that it is appropriate that the law
places limitations on free speech. That is clearly the proportionality
model that is incorporated in the Human Rights Act and it has been
recognised through interpretation of the common law as well. But before
you can place a restriction, you have to be satisfied of various
things. First, you have to be satisfied that it is for a legitimate

talking about the approach that is taken under the Crime and Disorder
Act 1998, it is more about taking activity that is already criminal and
aggravating it because of the intention behind it. I do not see that as
being particularly problematic. If you commit an assault, it is
aggravated if you do it for racial or religious motivation. I can see
that the same thing could easily apply to an assault based on
homophobic reasons. But that is a very different thing, because you are
dealing with something that is already in the realm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>of criminality. I think concern arises when you take something that is

						</i> I think that it is the issue of
specificity; inciting hatred towards particular individuals, that is
different from a sort of general incitement to hatred against a
particular group of people that contains many people and is
non-specific. I know that Stonewall has been making this case for a
number of years and it is keen that the offence be introduced. You look
at lyrics such as this and you can imagine why people might feel that
it is unacceptable to have people calling themselves musicians coming
out with this. That is fine, but we are talking about the criminal law.
Without the specificity of an individual offence being committed
against a particular individual, it is difficult to use a broad brush
of criminality.</div>
					<a name="07101827000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you know
that there is an offence of incitement to hatred against homosexuals,
it is unlikely that unless you are a dancehall artist, for example, you
will be prosecuted. These are likely to be high-profile prosecutions.
The chilling impact of knowing that there is such an offence, in the
same way as knowing that there is one of incitement to encouragement of
terrorism or incitement to racial hatred, is that it might make you
feel that you are being persecuted, but it is likely that the people
who will be prosecuted most will be black dancehall artists. I imagine
from the examples that we have been given that they are the people who
would be
targeted.</div>
					<a name="07101827000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sorry, I
lost my thread somewhat. The point that I am trying to make is that
what is deeply unpleasant is not necessarily a subject for the criminal

inciting an act of actual violence or other crime, you are getting into
a grey area of what should be criminal.

country, or do you think that they would have improved in any

						</i> That is an impossible question for an
organisation such as Liberty to answer; we do not do empirical,
statistical research into these issues. The Commission for Racial
Equality might be in a far better position than we are. Based on the
number of prosecutions there have been, I would not say that it has
been a particularly used offence; I think that of the 79 prosecutions
there were 44 convictions. I hope that community and race relations
have improved considerably since the 1960s; I think that that has
happened for a range of reasons, but whether the existence of an
offence of incitement to racial hatred is one of them I could not
say.</div>

								Les
Lawrence:
							</b>
						</i> We welcome the Bill in terms of the fact
that it is a wide-ranging and largely an enabling one. It is a
framework that, in the sense in which it is intended, we welcome very
much. We certainly welcome the emphasis placed on community-based
interventions of young offenders. We are very supportive of the youth
rehabilitation order and the way in which the Bill strikes a balance
between punishment and protection, reform and rehabilitation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>
					<a name="07101827000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we
recognise that being radical is not always something that comes easily
to legislation, we would have liked to have seen a shift towards what
we call prevention and early intervention, which is much the intent of
children&#146;s services or young people&#146;s services. That is
illustrated by the integrated youth support service and so on. We
should also like to see an emphasis on greater partnership working,
responsibilities and concepts of duties to co-operate between the youth
justice system and the children&#146;s trust arrangements that exist
in all local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07101827000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we have a slight caveat in that, although the Bill is enabling, the
devil is always in the detail of the statutory instruments and
guidance. The Local Government Association would obviously be keen to
engage with the Department in the formulation of guidance to ensure
that it is of benefit to both the Government and local authorities in
general.</div>

							<a name="07101827000522"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> In relation to the practical working of the
youth rehabilitation order, the bottom line as far as you are concerned
is that it is deliverable. Let us consider if from the perspective of
the point of sentence. In the delivery of measures of rehabilitation
for young people and to place them in appropriate places, funding is
often the barrier. For the funding and the place to be matched up with
the time that the sentence is ordered is often something that does not
happen. It is not obtainable. What assurance can you give that the
orders specified in the Bill are
deliverable?</div>
					<a name="07101827000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Les
Lawrence:
							</b>
						</i> Where we see an advantage in the youth
rehabilitation order is that, in the current system&#151;certainly
previously&#151;there has been an increase in the number of young
offenders who are subject to custodial sentences. It is now recognised
that the medium or long-term benefit of those custodial sentences is
reducing. The degree of reoffending among young people who have been in
the custodial system is much higher than even within the adult
arena.</div>
					<a name="07101827000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The youth
rehabilitation order is a mechanism whereby we can begin to refocus the
intent behind community sentencing. It must be structured in such a way
that it brings a benefit back either to the community or to the
offender such that we could then begin to link it with the concepts of
restorative justice. We must make certain that both the victim, either
an individual or the community, and the perpetrator get a benefit back
that brings about a long-term benefit in terms of the youth justice
system as a
whole.</div>
					<a name="07101827000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
exampled by the differential costs. Here, I can agree that the order is
deliverable. I am sure that colleagues round the table know that it
costs roughly &#163;24,500 per six months to keep a young person in a
custodial situation. However, if community sentencing is used in the
most effective form and it is linked with a YRO, that would cut the
cost to about &#163;6,500 for the same period. That shift in
resources will not happen overnight. Any change in the system will take
a significant time to evolve, but a shift in existing resources will,
in our view, bring about a significant change in the understanding and
acceptance of the youth justice system, and a whole panoply of benefits
to not only the offender, but the victim or the subject of the
offender&#146;s misbehaviour.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>
					<a name="07101827000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
involvement of the police; the youth offending service; in some cases
the NHS, because often the youngsters have mental health issues; the
child and adolescent mental health services and local government as the
lead in facilitating the implementation of these orders in conjunction
with the courts, I think not only that the measures will be
deliverable, but that the long-term benefits will be there for all to
see.</div>

							<a name="07101827000525"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Dealing with the specific requirements within
that order, there are local authority resident requirements, drug
treatment requirements, education requirements and, separately,
fostering requirements. All of those inevitably impact on resources.
All of those orders are dependent on recommendations from the youth
offending team and the social worker of a local authority, for example,
to be deliverable. All of those things are very much within the
province of the local authorities. The provision sounds good, but I
question whether it is likely to happen on the
ground.</div>
					<a name="07101827000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
useful to hear, in terms of your members association, whether you feel
that the capacity is presently there to deliver those types of
requirement. To take one example, adolescent drug and alcohol services
are bereft across the country with one residential drug rehabilitation
centre in the whole country. Can these requirements be
delivered?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Les
Lawrence:
							</b>
						</i> I would like to convince you that it is not
only possible, but that it can be achieved in reality. Over the last
three or four years, local government has had to deliver services in a
much more integrated way than has been the case, dare I say it, for
central Government. Yesterday, in a speech to the adults and children
conference in Birmingham, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools
and Families indicated, interestingly, that the Government are
beginning to understand, at long last, that the way in which local
government works in a joined-up manner is something that they need to
do.</div>
					<a name="07101827000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you look at the
type of arrangements that exist on the ground, such as local area
agreements, which link the drug and alcohol element to teenage
pregnancies and in turn to the NHS through the primary care trusts, you
begin to see that the building blocks are already in place to enable
the intent behind the rehabilitation orders to be fulfilled. Often
these things will utilise many of the same people who assist in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>providing the enforcement, revocation and amendment of rehabilitation
orders. I hope that I can begin to convince you that this is an intent
that we fully
support.</div>

							<a name="07101827000526"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Referral orders and, in a sense, the conditional
cautions inevitably have an impact on the youth offending team. Do you
have any comments about their role in those orders, which is within the
remit of the local authority, and about their ability to
deliver?</div>
					<a name="07101827000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Les
Lawrence:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, if those come into being, they can be
used as part of an early intervention and preventive strategy. The
situations that give rise to the conditions under which such a caution
is given can be addressed early enough to turn around the challenging
circumstances that these young people often face. What tends to be the
case at the moment is that, once they get into the youth offending
system, every time they are ratcheted up by one incident and before
long they are in a custodial situation. Often you will find that young
people are being incarcerated&#151;I will use that phrase&#151;for
offences that adults would never be incarcerated for. That is one of
the drawbacks of the current process. If you have these extra tools in
the box, as it were, you can ally that, through partnership working,
with much more intervention and with preventive strategies, using
outreach workers, or, as you rightly say, workers within the youth
offending service, to bring about a stop at that point, and also offer
the assistance and the help to address the issues that have given rise
to the circumstances in which the young person has found themselves.
That is beneficial, not only to the young person but to the wider
community as
well.</div>

								Ann

						</i> It is often a lot cheaper. Through the local
strategic partnerships in Coventry, we have different youth activities,
with some bad boys and girls, especially bad girls, funnily enough,
because if you get a bad girl you will find that you usually have six
or seven bad boys somewhere quite close. For a very small amount of
money, you can actually get them to think about what they want to do in
their community and, if they have something to do that is not sport,
because not all girls want to do sport, for &#163;2,000 or
&#163;3,000 you can get a group off the street. We got a group of 19
off the street and the crime figures went down

Heath:
						</b> Let us return to the youth rehabilitation orders,
because there is general realisation that, if they work as the
Government intend, they will save money and be more effective, which is
the most important part. I just worry that there is not yet an
equivalent provision across the country of some of the elements that
will be required for this measure. Local authorities vary enormously in
what they can provide and what they do provide. I am a little surprised
that the LGA is quite so bullish about the prospects of putting those
building blocks in place in the very near future.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Les
Lawrence:
							</b>
						</i> We are as supportive as we are because we
are running at the moment a project called Children in Trouble and we
are running four pilot schemes in different parts of the country. It is
in conjunction with the Magistrates Association, the police and the
Howard League for Penal Reform, and it is testing a range of options
with custody in the extreme. That is simply because it is felt that,
given the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>number of youngsters who are ending up in custodial situations, there
may be a way of providing much earlier support, earlier intervention
and working with the young people to see whether we can facilitate a
change. That is change not only in the way that people view young
people but change within the communities from which many of these
youngsters come, and also to overcome what I call the intergenerational
perception of older people of young people and of young people of older
people.</div>
					<a name="07101827000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those pilot
schemes have started. We have the National Foundation for Educational
Research involved, who will undertake the evaluation. That evaluation
will start early in the new year. So, in a sense, we have begun to get
evidence that this type of arrangement&#151;not taking the youngsters
into custodial situations&#151;is beneficial. The magistrates and the
police are both supportive, there is collective working and the extra
element within the pilot projects is the third sector. We have
organisations like the NSPCC and NCH, the children&#146;s charity,
working with us as well and that is making for quite an interesting,
collective coming together of various groups.</div>
					<a name="07101827000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final element that is
beginning to come out of these projects, but which is also something
that many local authorities have begun to use, is what I call
peer-mentoring. Often, youngsters who were in the system themselves
become the mentors of those who are entering the system. Because they
are able to talk the talk and relate in a much more effective way, it
adds an element to assist us in moving many youngsters away from
becoming entrenched in the youth justice
system.</div>

						</i> The type of foster carers that you have
alluded to are essential. I will not hide from you that it will be
difficult to recruit them, but the quality of foster carers in many
local authorities is of a very high order, I would suggest. Local
authorities are constantly seeking to recruit and refresh, and they
offer opportunities for carers in a range of circumstances, not
depending only on age, ethnicity, or
challenge.</div>
					<a name="07101827000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
sometimes undervalue those who take on the role and therefore it is
incumbent on local authorities to ensure that they are never left on
their own, they are fully supported, they have access to services in
the round, and that, again, we work in partnership with other agencies
who can often provide skilled support that the local authority cannot.
I have referred to the third sector in many instances but the local
authority has the lead role. If you adopt the principle that is
enshrined within the Children Act about the statutory responsibility
for vulnerable children and use that as your working principle, I think
that we will be able to overcome the difficulties you allude to in

trust there would be, an expectation that that responsibility would de
facto be delegated to Government offices in the region to enable there
to be arrangements that are either on an authority-by-authority basis

local authority. That type of arrangement would easily facilitate the
intent behind the clause. In that sense, you will be able to find that
a relationship would be built up, not only between local authorities,
but with the court system. Given that there is now a move, again
through local area agreements, to devolve roughly 10 per cent. of the
Youth Justice Board&#146;s funds, then you have the beginnings of the

you envisage sitting down in Birmingham and Coventry and reporting to
the government office for the west Midlands or directly to the Ministry
of Justice with a plan, so that the Secretary of State can then tell
the courts that arrangements are sufficient in any given area for him
to certify that these resources or systems are available? I am not sure
where the  initiative will come from. I know that you both
represent very large authorities, but there will be smaller county
authorities with smaller resources. I just do not have any idea about

of my original premises. If one looks at the amount of money that is
currently spent by the Youth Justice Board wholly and totally on
custodial arrangements, one will see&#151;I repeat the figure&#151;
that it costs &#163;24,500 for every six months that a youngster is
in a custodial situation. The cost to take that same young person and
provide the kind of intense community sentencing arrangements with a
menu of options is &#163;6,500. That is available at the present time
and shows the disparity between the cost of one process and another.
One could bring about a change so that existing resources were
re-focused and re-targeted to enable that change, and I feel that the
YRO is a mechanism for doing that. If representatives of the Youth
Justice Board were here, they would send the same

expense, it would be a good thing to do something better and cheaper
outside of prison&#151;there is no question that keeping youngsters
in custody is expensive. Do you think that it would be sensible for the

without it going to court. Is that right and, if diversion is to be our

						</i> That depends upon what you mean by,
&#147;going to court.&#148; I will use the discussions that are
ongoing within the Ministry of Justice on childcare proceedings and
family courts, where much of the emphasis is on preparation and
pre-assessment, and where the court intervention is based around what
are called directions. Thereby, the judge is involved, but at a stage
that is not in full public session. The directions are used to bring
about a much quicker solution. I suggest that that is a good model to
look at in terms of YROs. The court is still involved and judicial
supremacy in this regard is exercised through the concept of
directions. Therefore, because of the early work, the implication and
implementation of such a process becomes much easier, better understood
and, dare I say, less
costly.</div>

state of affairs. Could you spell out again what brings that about?
What sort of mechanism would stop that happening and cut into the

there another administrative process? Perhaps a youngster could appeal

						</i> I know that it sounds simplistic, but I
would mention the whole process of early intervention, working with
families, early identification of youngsters who are in danger of
getting into trouble, and the use of outreach services from the youth
offending services. Those constructs and the passage of information
between organisations are all elements that help to reduce the numbers
of people going into the youth justice system.</div>
					<a name="07101827000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Look at those
local authorities which have a very good relationship with the police.
I will use an example from my own local authority. We have police
located in schools. They become part of the school population. Respect,
confidence and a relationship build up between the young people and the
policeman lodged in the school. That often happens through safer
community 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>partnerships. They have reduced the incidence of crime, not only within
the immediate locality of the school at what they call &#147;tipping
out&#148; time, but also in the wider community because respect for
police and for their authority is greatly enhanced. That is
irrespective of the nature of the communities within which those types
of arrangements have been set up and it requires, as I say, the kind of
partnership arrangements that Ann was referring to through strategic
partnerships and similar measures.</div>
					<a name="07101827000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often youngsters who become
disengaged from society are seen as dysfunctional. They get themselves
into a cycle which leads them inevitably into a custodial situation. It
can start from a caution, moving on to an antisocial behaviour order,
then they break the ASBO and so on. Often, despite the best endeavours
of staff, the provision made by youth offending institutions for
education, training and the appropriate improvements in health and
well-being, is not as conducive to supporting the rehabilitation of
these young people as it should be. My final point&#151;and it is a
strange conundrum&#151;is that the Children Act 2004 created the
concept of a child or young person as being from 0 to 19. In the youth
justice system, the cut off is at 18. At 18 a young person suddenly
becomes an adult, but as far as the responsibility of a local authority
under the Children Act goes, that person should be supported until the
age of 19.</div>

of how local-authority led arrangements are going to work. Over the
last few years there has been a greatly increased level of partnership
working at local authorities and across agencies. From your experience
at the Local Government Association, do you think that something like
the local criminal justice boards or the children&#146;s trust, or
perhaps even the local safeguarding children boards are the best way of
ensuring co-ordination? I heard what Ann Lucas said about pooling

children&#146;s trust as the overarching strategic body, but in terms
of the nature of the vulnerability of the young person, that would
either stay within the trust arrangements or go into the safeguarding
board, which has specific responsibility around very vulnerable young
children. As the safeguarding board in every case has a close
relationship with the trust arrangements&#151;often the chairman of
the safeguarding board is part of the trust arrangement&#151;that
linkage is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>already there. Equally, the youth justice arrangements within most local

called ahead of the game, which ran along side the Home Office&#146;s

solely on street workers; the whole remit of trafficked women and
indoor sex workers was too large. We welcome wholeheartedly taking away
the term &#147;common prostitute&#148; from the statute book. It
has been our experience that that was the most unequal and unfair term.

Hollobone:
						</b> Stonewall and others who are in favour of this
legislation have given us some very difficult evidence about lyrics,
particularly in rap music, which has been very homophobic and, in their
view, incites people to hate gay people. They would like to see
legislation brought in to make that an offence. You may have had an
opportunity to see some of the evidence that they gave us. Do you think
that anything should be done about such violent and homophobic
lyrics?</div>
					<a name="07101827000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Don
Horrocks:
							</b>
						</i> On the specific question of rap lyrics, I
did hear the evidence. Our fundamental point is that we still believe
that extending the law is unnecessary because what we have now is
adequate, and is not being used. As far as rap is concerned,
Evangelical Alliance member organisations have long campaigned against
hate images and lyrics, so we know about that. We know that many groups
have been campaigning against them, too, against record companies and
so on. There is a law against video and film porn&#151;in fact, this
Bill is supposed to be tightening up in that area&#151;so why not
extend it to music lyrics? The problem with creating criminal law in
this area is that you want to enforce a law against incitement to
violence and murder, which is what those rap lyrics are doing.
Incidentally, it is not only gay people who are targeted by rap music.
For example, rap lyrics gratuitously attack women, race and religion,
encourage early sexual behaviour and the taking of drugs and celebrate
the carrying of guns and knives. How far do we want to go on this? It
is not only gay people who are targeted.</div>
					<a name="07101827000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I want to make
is that it was suggested that the current law on incitement is
insufficient to deal with rap artists&#151;I heard Beenie Man
mentioned, whose lyrics incite people to murder homosexual people.
However, there are two points to make. First, Ben Summerskill was not
quite right to suggest that it is only a particular group, such as
homosexuals, that needs to be identified. There is a case, el-Faisal
2004, where Mr. el-Faisal, who was an extremist Islamic
preacher, was convicted in 2003 of incitement to murder under existing
legislation&#151;section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act
1861. What was he doing? In a number of speeches that were recorded and
distributed, he was inciting or exhorting audiences to kill Americans,
Jews and others indiscriminately.</div>
					<a name="07101827000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to draw to the
Committee&#146;s attention to another point, which is something that
we began to consider only today, so I accept that it needs further
analysis and consideration. The Serious Crime Bill is going through
Parliament at the moment, and it is interesting that, in July, Gordon
Brown stated clearly that that Bill was being brought in to fill the
gap and extend the law to cover where incitement legislation did not
cover. I know that the Bill is awaiting its remaining stages in the
Commons before it receives Royal  Assent, but it repeals the
common law offence of incitement and replaces it with a series of
offences of encouraging or assisting an offence. In our view, from an
early examination, it is intended to cover&#151;or should
cover&#151;the lyrics that Stonewall is complaining about.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>
					<a name="07101827000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, that Bill was
introduced following a Law Commission report that specifically intended
it to fill the gaps in incitement law and to clarify
the law on incitement because of current uncertainties. If we are
reading it right, the Government intend to widen incitement law under
the Bill. If that is right, they are extending the law to catch people
who encourage crime, even if no specific offence is committed. It is
reform law, not codification of existing law. If I am right, we already
have a set of new provisions coming in. Admittedly, I cannot be certain
today what the Bill will achieve, but in our view&#151;I could go
into a lot more detail about existing legislation&#151;we feel that
existing legislation or legislation that is provisional at this stage
is sufficient to address the gap that Stonewall particularly wanted to
fill.</div>

Given that it was going to proceed, however, the outcome was the best
that could have been achieved. It is interesting that we campaigned
against that Bill along with a lot of other groups that are not in the
religious lobby. It was seen as some sort of victory for free speech.
The fact that the law does not seem to have been used terribly much
since, and the fact that it makes it absolutely clear to many people

that it was probably the best
outcome.</div>
					<a name="07101827000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
still reservations about it. The police have to action the law and make

constitutes an offence, and there is still a feeling that it is too
much to expect them to get it right. We have on record instances when
the police have got it wrong and we have had to complain to chief
constables. Police have been round to people&#146;s houses and warned
them; we have then 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>contacted the chief constable, who has admitted that they were wrong,
and they have had to go round and apologise. In the meantime, a chill
factor has been brought into community relations. We are still worried

observations on that. As far as I understand, the laws have just not
been used at all. We have had no reports of their having been used. Of
course, the argument was advanced during the passage of the Racial and
Religious Hatred Bill that those laws should form a precedent, in the
way that existing race hate laws were used. The fact that they have not
been used was advanced as an argument for why the Bill was needed. It
was rejected at the time because they were not seen as helpful
precedents, because race and religion were very different, as are race
and sexual orientation or sexuality&#151;in the latter case, you are

sensitive and concerned about protecting freedom of speech, precisely
because of community tensions. The feeling that I get from over there,
certainly from what I have been told, is that if any of those laws were
used, floodgates could open. There has therefore been a keenness not to
use those laws.</div>
					<a name="07101827000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, it might be worth saying that the harassment law that was
included in the sexual orientation regulations in Northern Ireland was
struck down in the High Court by judicial review. It was struck down
because of its rushed introduction and because of concerns over free
speech and religious liberties. That harassment law had been declared
by the Government to be compliant with the European convention on human
rights, but the High Court disagreed. The Government had gone too far
and rushed the legislation through without proper
consideration.</div>
					<a name="07101827000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
judicial review concluded, if I may summarise it, that the orthodox
Christian position is that the practice of homosexuality is sinful and
that that belief is protected by article 9. For that reason it was
struck down. If that shows anything at all, it shows the mistake of
rushing ahead with legislation without checking whether the balance is
right.</div>

Ireland, the homophobic hate provisions are based on the race hatred
legislation. I am not an expert on Northern Ireland, but I do not think
that those provisions have in any way stopped fairly vigorous
profession of faith among the evangelical community. I am making a
genuine attempt to discover the extent to which the chilling effect,

day, there would be a severe impact on freedom of speech: on legitimate
disagreement, legitimate argument, even on the legitimate causing of
offence and the legitimate expression of hatred. Let us admit that
there is a legitimate expression of hatred. The Bible encourages
Christians to hate sin. So if one accepts that there is a legitimate
expression of hatred, the fear is that if the Bill is drawn in a way
that has such a low threshold as Ben Summerskill has suggested, and as
seemed to be proved by his comments on the protest in Parliament
square, we would be very concerned. We feel that it would have a
chilling

the consequences of this legislation could cause Christians and other
people to live in fear. I was interested to hear the Police Federation
representative yesterday saying that the police are in fear of not
being seen to act. If a climate of fear is being introduced, on which
side is it actually coming? If you want me to be theological in
answering your question, yes, Christians do hate the sin rather than
the sinner. Let me ask, why do we always talk about Christians in this
debate? I am a Christian, but we are talking about religion and belief,
not just about Christianity. Most of the major religions take the same
approach here.</div>
					<a name="07101827000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
not talking about inciting people to hatred. I have never come across
incitement to violence and murder, which is where we believe the law
should really be reaching. Even Peter Tatchell made it clear that he
did not like this legislation and that the existing legislation should
be strengthened&#151;or actually used, because it is there&#151;to
tackle incitement to violence and murder, whereas expressing views,
however offensive they may be, should not be the subject of
legislation.</div>

						 Two main points need to
be made. If you go through the existing law you will find that there
are a lot of statutes that already deal with this matter. For example
section 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 includes tougher sentences
for offences motivated by hatred of the victim&#146;s sexual
orientation. As we know, under the Public Order Act 1986 it is an
offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in
a way that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress. This has
been used to arrest people for making homophobic comments. There is
also the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which makes it a civil or
criminal offence to harass somebody. There are offences for actual
bodily harm and assault under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861,
and the offence of common assault under section 39 of the Criminal
Justice  Act 1988.</div>
					<a name="07101827000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, a comment was made
on 11 October 2007 in a press release from the Crown Prosecution
Service that</div>
					<a name="07101827000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;homophobic
crime is being tackled head-on, and with
success,&#148;</div>
					<a name="07101827000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that is

						<b class="B"> </b>Current levels
of crime in this area do not justify changing the law. The Metropolitan
police performance briefing shows that homophobic hate crime is down by
8.5 per cent. and talks about figures of 1,294 incidents in 2005-06 and
1,184 in 2006-07. That compares to racist hate crime, which is down by
11.9 per cent., from 11,322 incidents in 2005-06 to 9,976 in
2006-07.</div>
					<a name="07101827000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">A comment
was made in response to Question 165 referring to the Crown Prosecution
Service saying that there has been a 167 per cent. rise in the number
of convictions, but according to the figures for the period between
April 2006 and March 2007, the Crown Prosecution Service prosecuted 822
cases identified as having a homophobic element, compared with 600
cases in 2005-06. Those are the actual figures. They are divided into
42 Crown prosecution areas, and these are the figures for the
equivalent in the 43 police forces for the whole of England and Wales.
They illustrate the low level in the whole of England and Wales of
crimes with a homophobic
element.</div>
					<a name="07101827000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then we must
look at the Home Office figures, which say that nationally, the police
recorded 50,000 racially 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>or religiously motivated hate crimes last year. The British crime
survey, which is based on interviews with a wide sample of people and
picks up crimes that are not reported to police, indicated that there
were 260,000 such events last
year.</div>
					<a name="07101827000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then we come to
what the Metropolitan police say. They reported 11,799 incidents of
racist and religious hate crime and 1,359 incidents of homophobic hate
crime in the 12 months to January 2006. However, the police estimate
that most racist and religious hate crime, and as much as 90 per cent.
of homophobic crime, goes unreported.</div>
					<a name="07101827000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would say that if you look at
the figures from sources such as the Home Office and the Crown
Prosecution Service, they illustrate that the law appears to be
justified in the current areas of racially or religiously motivated
hate crime, but not to crime motivated by sexual orientation, which the
new law proposes to address. Even if 90 per cent. is unreported, we are
talking about 800 cases in the whole of England and Wales. I appreciate
that in those figures there are differences because
&#147;incidents&#148; now include both crimes and no
crimes.</div>

						 It is extremely
difficult, which is why, I imagine, that the Committee is deliberating.
Can the law really tackle an area that deals with speech and judgments
on it? We thought that new section 29J inserted by the schedule of the
Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 attempted to do that. In other
words, if a decision is made that this legislation must pass&#151;in
this case, we do not accept that it should&#151;we would want an
equivalent to that new section 29J in order to make it absolutely clear
what people can and cannot say.</div>
					<a name="07101827000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it, if no one
was sure, and someone made a certain comment, the police would tell
them that they were under investigation or suspicion, and the case
would go to the Crown Prosecution Service, after which it would pass to
the Attorney-General. I think that Mr. Summerskill was
telling us that, after that process, which could last 18 months, a jury
would decide. I feel that the impact of legislation such as that, which
introduces confusion, rather than clarity, would be deleterious to
community relations and the
public.</div>

in Committee. We do not know what it will look like, but perhaps we
will next week. For present purposes, however, let us set aside your
arguments for why there should not be such a law, although they have
plenty of intellectual coherence about them. There is going to be one;
we have to deal with the world as it is, and not as we would like it to
be. Given that that is the case, do you think that at the very least
such a law should require intention to cause harm, be it physical or

						 We made it
clear in our submission that, given that the legislation would proceed,
we required something similar to new section 29J and that intent should
be spelled out clearly&#151;not something like
&#147;recklessness&#148;, which is a very vague concept. We had the
argument about &#147;recklessness&#148; during the progress of the

far too vague as a legal concept, and unworkable.</div>
					<a name="07101827000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, the language would
have to be threatening, as is required in the 2006 Act. If you recall,
originally, the concepts of &#147;insulting&#148; and
&#147;abusive&#148; were also in there, but were transposed to new
section 29J, which put them on quite the opposite side of the fence,
because it meant that actually people could abuse and insult religious
beliefs and people who held them. We were quite happy with that. I
remember standing on a platform with Blackadder and agreeing with him
that he could abuse and insult me. We agreed with that, and we do not

						 Incitement to
murder and violence seems to me to be the area that is most workable
and gets at what we really want to prevent. As Shami Chakrabarti has
made clear, surely more speech legislation and
authoritarianism&#151;interference with everyday discourse and so
on&#151;cannot be the right legislative path. Our view is that the
Bill should be used to get at the real problem. If rap lyrics are
identified as a problem, let legislation or some monitoring body be
introduced to oversee the whole industry. Such a suggestion has been
made. The problem can be tackled in that way. Do not introduce
something because rap lyrics are a problem for one group and end up
effectively making every preacher in the land wonder if he is breaking

important in relation to freedom of speech. One of the things of
concern is, for example, that it appears that we are already living in
a country in which there is an atmosphere of unease and a real fear
that any criticism, even if it were justified criticism, of homosexuals
may lead to a person being labelled &#147;homophobic&#148;. This is
not only seen in Christian cases. I draw attention to the recent
incident at Wakefield council when professional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>social workers did not investigate sexual abuse by a homosexual foster
couple as early as they should have, partly due to the fear of being
labelled &#147;homophobic&#148;. The proposed criminal law would
make that type of fear even greater, with the even more severe label of
&#147;homophobic hate crime&#148;. The consequent serious effect on
free speech and the potential disastrous consequences for child abuse
