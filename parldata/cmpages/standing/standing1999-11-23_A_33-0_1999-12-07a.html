Amendment made, No. 783, in page 153, line 37, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) ``Authorised unit trust'', ``authorised open-ended investment company'' and ``recognised scheme'' have the same meaning as in Part XVI, and associated expressions are to be read accordingly.'.—[Mr. Timms.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I come in at the tail end of consideration of this clause with a query. Subsection (6) empowers the authority to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``exploit commercially the information contained in the record, or any part of that information.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Exploit commercially'' is a slightly unfortunate term for information contained in the published record. I presume that any such exploitation is restricted by the duty on the FSA to make records publicly available for inspection, but at the same time to preserve their confidentiality where appropriate. Could the Minister give some reassurance about why such a potentially exploitative phrase is lurking at the end of the clause?
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance about that. Subsection (6) would enable the FSA to publish the record or to sell information contained in it. It is included to lessen the likelihood of people taking advantage of information that is not available to others by requesting it and selling it on to a third party. If there is to be commercial advantage it should come to the FSA, which can use any income thus derived to reduce its fees. The hon. Gentleman is right; safeguards are needed. Any activity in this area would need to be subject to the other objectives and requirements set out in the Bill for the FSA. I do not think that anything inappropriate will happen here, but we are trying to ensure that, if there is commercial benefit to be had from this information, the FSA has the opportunity to obtain the benefit and to pass on the advantages to those whom it serves.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 947, in page 154, line 27, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) a person appointed to make a report under section 136.'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, Chapter VI of Part XVI or Chapter II of Part XVII.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As a mixture of Government and Opposition amendments have been tabled to the clause, it might be helpful if I first outlined its purpose and background. The FSA, together with the Secretary of State, will need access to a great deal of confidential information to carry out its functions under the Bill. Other parts of the Bill provide it with the powers it will need to obtain that. This part of the Bill imposes the corresponding safeguards to reassure businesses that confidential matters will be kept confidential subject only to being disclosed when that is necessary for a proper regulatory purpose.
<P>
The present separate regulations for insurance and banking are already subject to a statutory obligation of confidentiality which, however, allows the disclosure of information when that is necessary for certain specific purposes, for example for the investigation and prosecution of crime. Those exemptions are often referred to as gateways through which information may be passed. The restrictions give effect to a number of EC directives which cover the different financial sectors of the financial services industry. The provisions of these directives are quite detailed in their effect and, in order to ensure that the UK continues to conform to them, it is proposed that this part of the Bill, together with the regulations that will be made under it, will be used to create a confidentiality regime, which is similar in effect to those that already exist in the different areas of investment business and banking.
<P>
The creation of a single regulator means that there will be an opportunity for some rationalisation of the existing structure. It establishes a basic principle regarding information about a person's business or other affairs that is disclosed to the FSA—the competent authority, which hon. Members will recall is a role that will now be taken on by the FSA—the Secretary of State, FSA employees, or an auditor or expert appointed to assist the FSA, known collectively as primary recipients of such information. The information will be regarded as confidential, subject to the qualification that it is not confidential if it has already been publicly disclosed, or it is in the form of a summary or collection of data from which it is not possible to ascertain information relating to a particular person.
<P>
When the information is established as confidential, the primary recipients, together with anyone who has directly or indirectly obtained it from a primary recipient, are prohibited from disclosing it further unless the person from whom it was obtained gives his consent. If the information relates to a third party, the consent of that person must also be obtained before disclosure may take place.
<P>
Government amendment No. 947 will ensure that a skilled person who is appointed to produce a report under clause 136 is included in clause 305 as a primary recipient. Although subsection 6(a) of clause 305 makes express provision for ``a competent person'' appointed under part X to be included as a primary recipient, doubt has arisen as to whether it is clear that the provision covers persons appointed to make a report at the request of the FSA or the Secretary of State.
<P>
I do not know whether you want me to respond to Opposition amendments, Mr. O'Brien, or whether it would be more helpful for Opposition Members to speak to them first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> May I speak to our amendments, Mr. O'Brien?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Our amendments take Government amendment No. 947 further. The Minister said that clause 305 deals with the treatment of confidential information disclosed to primary recipients and clause 305(5) sets out a list of those primary recipients, including persons who are employed by the FSA—a competent authority—and the Secretary of State. We believe that the word ``employed'' is too narrow and that the provision should cover individuals who work for the FSA and its agencies, but who are not actually employees. That would cover consultants, for example, of whom I gather there are many working for the FSA, and assorted secondees. Amendment No. 900 would widen the term ``employed'' to ``or engaged'' to scoop up the various other people who are not on the direct payroll of the FSA.
<P>
Amendment No. 901 refers to clause 305(5)(d) and extends the category of primary recipients to persons
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appointed by the FSA or the Secretary of State to carry out a function under this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To some extent, that overlaps with clause 305(5)(e), which refers to experts, such as those investigators appointed under part X.
<P>
Amendment No. 902 refers to clause 305(6) and those who are considered to be experts for the purposes of clause 305(5)(e). Subsection 6(a) refers to persons
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appointed by the Authority or the Secretary of State to conduct an investigation under Part X''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Investigators can also be appointed under chapter VI of part XVI, which deals with collective investment schemes. The Director General of Fair Trading can investigate recognised investment exchanges and recognised clearing houses, as we debated last week. That comes under chapter II of part XVII. I realise that the Director General of Fair Trading is, strictly speaking, not appointed by the FSA or the Secretary of State, and that the drafting of the amendment is therefore technically not correct. However, the director general should be considered a primary recipient. We would be grateful for the Economic Secretary's comments on that.
<P>
Although the original copy of the amendment was correct, I have now noticed that there is a drafting error in my version of amendment No. 902. However, the thrust of it is still there. After ``Chapter VI'', it should read ``of Part XVI'' not ``or Part XVI'', and then should read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or Chapter II of Part XVII''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Of'' and ``or'' have been transposed, but no doubt the Economic Secretary got the gist of the amendment long before we spotted it and its intent remains intact.
<P>
I recommend the three amendments, as they would define more closely those people covered under the FSA.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As currently drafted, the term ``employed'' is used in its widest sense, in order to be compatible with various directives. For example, article 25 of the investment services directive refers to a person who works or has worked for the FSA, and therefore we have been advised that the amendment is not necessary. I take the point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton), but that point is covered.
<P>
Perhaps the only concern behind amendment No. 901 is to achieve something along the lines of amendment No. 900, in order to make it clear that the concept of ``employed'' in clause 305(5)(d) stretches as widely as possible. If so, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are satisfied that the combination of subsections (5)(d) and (5)(e) has the same effect as amendment No. 901.
<P>
Amendment No. 902 would stretch the application of the term ``expert'' to people appointed to conduct an investigation under chapter VI of part XVI—investigators of authorised unit trust managers, as the hon. Gentleman said—and to people appointed to conduct an investigation under chapter II of part XVII, namely the Director General of Fair Trading. The extension of the definition of ``expert'' to the part XVI people is unnecessary.
<P>
Hon. Members should cast their minds back, or refer to Hansard, to the debate on amendments Nos. 855 and 856, which were proposed to clause 255. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms), stated that the investigation provision would be better included in the part X provision. That was on 31 November. I am sorry, I mean the 31st sitting, on Thursday 2 December. We undertook then to table amendments at a later stage. In so doing, clause 305 will automatically cover the provisions currently covered by chapter VI of part XVI.
<P>
We do not think that the proposal to make the Director General of Fair Trading a primary recipient is appropriate. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that people standing in the shoes of the FSA are subject to the same provisions as it is. The director general is not in that position as he carries out investigations or makes reports under his own powers, which will be dealt with separately in the gateways order.
<P>
I hope that that meets all the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman, and that he will be able to withdraw the amendment in the light of those undertakings.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> If the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham obtains a copy of today's amendment paper, he will see that all the corrections to which he referred have been made. He must have an earlier publication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Brien. I was up late last night working on what is now a very out-of-date copy of the amendment, but I am glad to see that the Clerks have beaten us on the grammar.
<P>
The Economic Secretary almost mentioned 31 November. Certainly that debate could have been anywhere in the mists of time, and 31 November seems eminently possible given the amount of time that we have spent on the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Which year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Which year, indeed. A millennium leap year perhaps.
<P>
I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for agreeing with us. She has said that the Bill deals with what we are trying to cover. Given that undertaking, we shall not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): May I ask whether the director general is bound by confidentiality elsewhere, or is that assumed to be the case? I understood the Economic Secretary to say that she agreed in principle that he should be bound, but that this was not the clause in which to do so.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I would need to write to the hon. Gentleman to confirm the current position. I have given an undertaking that that matter will be dealt with separately in the gateways order. I do not envisage that we would introduce any measure that would contradict his wishes in that regard. However, I am not entirely sure of the exact position. Perhaps I could write a note to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Given that clauses 304 and 305 were drafted some time ago, has anyone checked whether they will conform to the Data Protection Act 1998, which will come into force on 1 March 2000? If any aspect of those clauses will be affected by that Act, will the Economic Secretary tell us about it briefly?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe that that matter has been checked and that it is all right. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) This section shall not apply to confidential information which is contained in a privileged communication.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) For the purposes of this section—
<P>
(a) prescribed functions shall be limited to functions under this Act;
<P>
(a) purposes or prescribed purposes shall be limited to a purpose reasonably contemplated by this Act;
<P>
(c) prescribed proceedings shall be limited to proceedings under this Act or Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993; and
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 905, in clause 308, page 156, line 7, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or information contained in a privileged communication'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 306 will allow the Treasury to make regulations that will provide exemptions from the obligation of confidentiality imposed on primary recipients under clause 305. Amendment No. 904 is a probing amendment intended to determine the limitations on the Treasury in making those regulations. Clause 306 will not limit the scope of those regulations under clause 305.
<P>
Amendment No. 905 relates to clause 308, which will give the Treasury the power to make regulations that permit the disclosure of information by persons other than primary recipients or persons obtaining confidential information directly or indirectly from a primary recipient. The amendment makes the point that those regulations should not apply to information in privileged communications.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I have said, clauses 305 and 306 relate to the gateways for disclosure. We must be guided by European directives in that regard. We propose to make regulations that provide the widest possible gateways, consistent with our directive obligations. We believe that that is right because all the gateways are intended to assist domestic or overseas regulatory or law enforcement bodies. Clearly, it would be undesirable to create unnecessary impediments to the work of those agencies.
<P>
In contrast, clause 308 deals with the disclosure of information not by the FSA but to it, and to other persons carrying out functions under the Bill. Such information is not subject to the directives, but it might be subject to other restrictions on disclosure. Clause 308 would allow the Treasury to make regulations removing such restrictions.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 903 and 905 seek to make explicit the provision preventing the FSA from disclosing privileged communications, either through the gateways provided for under clause 306 or as a result of regulations made by the Treasury under clause 308. The only privileged communications in the FSA's possession will be those voluntarily handed to it by authorised persons, because the FSA does not have the power to require a person to produce a privileged communication.
<P>
As in parts I and X, when a person volunteers a privileged document to the FSA, he must make clear that he is waiving that privilege only in respect of the FSA. If he does not, he risks losing that document's privileged status. If he makes it clear that he is not waiving privilege more generally, then, to the world at large, the document will remain privileged and the FSA will not be able to disclose it further without his consent. If he has not specified that he wishes the document to retain its privileged status, it could be argued that nothing would prevent the FSA from disclosing that document through its gateways, just as it can disclose other confidential documents.
<P>
I am satisfied that no privileged document could be further disclosed without the consent of the authorised person who volunteered it. That is achieved with the current wording of the clause. Although I agree with the intention of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), the amendments are not necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 904 would limit the gateways that we could open under clause 306 to those concerned with the purposes of the Act and functions of the FSA, including its power to prosecute certain criminal offences. We cannot agree to that. We intend to open up the most appropriate gateways in a wide range of circumstances and consistent with the directives. The amendment would unnecessarily narrow the scope for those gateways, and would thus create impediments to interdepartmental co-operation. For example, the amendment would stop the FSA passing on to the Department of Trade and Industry information that it found out in the course of an investigation about possible breaches of the Companies Act, which is allowed by the directives.
<P>
Amendment No. 904 would also stop the FSA passing on information about an occupational pension scheme to the occupational pensions regulatory authority. If the FSA had information that could help prevent another Maxwell problem, should it be prevented from passing it on? We believe not.
<P>
In the light of what I have said about the implications of the amendment, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I understood the Economic Secretary correctly, she said that, unless a person made it clear that he wanted the information that he provided to the FSA to be treated as privileged, it would not be so treated. That, I believe, was the net meaning of what she said. If that is so, it should be made clear in the Bill. The industry's general view is that, if it is given in an attempt to help, information provided to the FSA should be privileged. If the Bill is about to change the present situation—I do not know whether it will—it could cause considerable upset, even unintentionally. I believe that such information should automatically be privileged unless the FSA asks for it not to be, but if the position is to be as the hon. Lady described, it is important to draw attention to that fact.
<P>
I understand the Economic Secretary's comments about amendment No. 904, but I am somewhat uncomfortable that clause 306 does not limit the scope of regulations that the Treasury can make. I do not know the answer, but if the clause does not contain at least some indication of the territories covered, it will smack of the Stasi lurking in the background.
<P>
We shall probably not press the amendments to a Division, but I feel that the clause is too wide, and I ask the Government to consider whether it might be tightened up on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 948, in page 156, line 30, after `company' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or insolvent partnership'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 949 and 950.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Insolvency Act 1986 provides that the directors of a company or partnership that is experiencing financial difficulties may propose that the company come to an arrangement with its creditors whereby the creditors agree to receive a proportion of their debts in full and final settlement rather than petition for the company to be wound up. In some cases, creditors may feel that such an arrangement is in their interests, for example, if it seems likely that the costs of an insolvency will consume the greater part of the company's resources.
<P>
The proposed arrangement must be put to meetings of shareholders and creditors. If both meetings produce a decision in favour of the arrangement, all the creditors are bound by it, regardless of whether they attended the creditors' meeting. That condition is subject only to the creditors' right to ask the court to take action when their interests have been unfairly prejudiced or some material irregularity has occurred in the conduct of one of the meetings.
<P>
The clause gives the FSA the same right as a creditor to petition the court in opposition to a proposed company voluntary arrangement as a creditor and the right to be heard by the court at a hearing of an objection made by another person. That is in line with our general policy of giving the FSA the same rights in insolvency procedures involving authorised persons as creditors so that it can stand in the shoes of consumers, as it were, to represent their interests.
<P>
The amendments reflect the fact that company voluntary arrangements can, despite their name, apply to partnerships as well as companies. The amendments make it clear that the FSA's powers extend to arrangements involving partnerships.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This may seem a rather simplistic point. I assume that the arrangements would apply when the FSA has become involved in taking over a business that it regulates and that is experiencing difficulty or has become insolvent. However, I am not clear about the context in which the FSA is stepping into shoes.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not think that that is the context in which the FSA would be in the consumer's shoes, as it were. It would become another party to possible insolvency proceedings and would represent the interests of people in such circumstances as though it were on a par with one of the creditors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does that mean when the FSA acts on behalf of consumers?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The petition shall be served on the Authority not less than five days before the date fixed for the hearing of the petition.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 906 provides for the FSA to be heard at the hearing of any administration petition in respect of any company or partnership that is an authorised person or an appointed representative or which has carried on a regulated activity in contravention of a general prohibition.
<P>
Any responsible insolvency practitioner will usually notify the FSA in those circumstances. However, the hearing of a petition might take place without the FSA being aware of it, and it should be a requirement that notice of a petition is served on the FSA. The amendment would require the petition to be served on the FSA at least five days before the date that had been fixed for hearing the petition.
<P>
Amendment No. 912 has the same effect in the context of a voluntary winding up, where clause 321 applies. Amendment No. 914 covers essentially the same territory as those to clause 314 and clause 321. In the case of an individual's bankruptcy, the amendment would provide for the FSA to be served with the petition at least five days before the date that had been fixed for hearing the petition in court. Thus, the FSA would always be notified of the relevant petitions in advance of the hearings.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I appreciate what the amendments are intended to do. There is clearly no point in giving the FSA the right to be involved in insolvency proceedings if it is not aware that they have begun. The amendment would deal with that situation, but in doing so it would place an undue burden on persons with no connection to financial services or regulation. For example, a company's supplier might want to recover an unpaid bill. To do that, it might petition to put the company concerned into administration or to have it wound up. There is no reason why the petitioner should know that the company was doing financial services business or why he should be put to the expense of finding out. Instead, the intention is that the FSA will deal with the problem by making a rule to the effect that it is the authorised person's responsibility to inform the FSA as soon as he is aware of a petition that has been presented to put him into administration, wind him up or declare him bankrupt. Such an FSA rule will achieve the outcome that we both seek. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy not to press the main point, but I am not satisfied that putting the obligation on the authorised person will be effective when he has gone to the wall. What will happen if he does not comply? Will he be punished? Would it be possible to find another mechanism—perhaps an arrangement with the courts—to automatically advise the FSA? I take the Minister's point that someone in some minor situation might not know that he is dealing with an authorised business in financial services. Equally, however, it is not sound practice to rely on the person who is in trouble.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, and we can certainly look to see whether there are better mechanisms. However, the question is which of the mechanisms before us—probably, neither is perfect—will deliver the result that we both want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point is made and we shall look to see how the issue might be handled. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can be brief or I could even have moved the amendment formally if it would have helped the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Just tell us a little about the amendments.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Government amendments Nos. 951 and 952 propose technical changes, which would put it beyond doubt that the FSA is entitled to receive all documents and to attend all meetings, under whatever statutory provision. Government amendment No. 953 is intended to address an oversight in clause 315. It would give the FSA the same rights to receive documents sent to creditors and to attend creditors' meetings or committees as the Bill provides in respect of administration and winding up.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 908 and 913 would achieve the same outcome by a slightly different route. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press them. Amendment No. 915 would give the FSA the right to receive any document sent to a creditor in respect of bankruptcy proceedings. The hon. Gentleman spotted an omission on our part. He is right to argue that if the FSA has a right in respect of winding up and administration, it should also have it in respect of bankruptcy. We shall table another amendment to achieve that in due course, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As always, it was worth hearing the Minister's case for the Government amendments and she seems to have endorsed one of my amendments. Amendment No. 908 was intended to apply when the winding up was voluntary, and would have been especially important if the earlier amendment to clause 315 had been agreed. Amendment No. 913 relates to clause 321 and would extend provisions to voluntary winding up. I accept the Minister's word that the Government amendments achieve the same purpose, though it has not been double checked, which perhaps it should. I am delighted that the Government intend to implement our amendment No. 915 and we are happy not to press it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 907, in page 158, line 29, leave out `an authorised person' an insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or has been an authorised person or an appointed representative or is carrying on, or has carried on, a regulated activity in contravention of the general prohibition.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For reasons that are not apparent, the application of the clause, which deals with voluntary liquidation, is limited to authorised persons, whereas the provisions on administration and compulsory liquidation also include appointed representatives and those carrying on a regulated activity in contravention of a general prohibition. Our amendment would extend the provision to the other categories of person.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment seeks to ensure that the FSA's right to be involved in the voluntary winding up of authorised persons should also apply to former authorised persons and to those who are or have been appointed representatives or who are or have been carrying on authorised business in breach of a general prohibition. As the hon. Gentleman has no doubt noticed, we have used this formula elsewhere in this part of the Bill, for example in clause 317, which deals with compulsory winding up. In this instance, however, it would be inappropriate, so I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
The FSA has two interests in respect of insolvency procedures. First, it is concerned to look after the interests of particular consumers who may have invested or deposited money with authorised persons. Secondly, it needs the power to ask the courts to wind up businesses which may not be insolvent but perhaps have been involved in regulatory abuse or crime. The difference between authorised persons and people listed in the hon. Gentleman's amendment is that the first factor should not apply in these instances. Former authorised persons and appointed representatives—persons breaching the perimeter—should not handle clients' money, so the FSA's interest in winding them up would apply if they were involved in some other sort of activity. People breaching the perimeter would be a matter of definition. If the FSA became aware that people were trying to wind themselves up voluntarily, the right course of action would be not to participate in the process but to apply to the court to have the case made into a compulsory winding up. Therefore I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I fear that the Minister has sunk me with her answer. It sounded all right, However, I still think that there is a pretty simple point that arrangements should be the same whether liquidation is voluntary or compulsory. I understood the Minister to say that if matters to which it was relevant applied in a voluntary liquidation, the FSA would apply to make the liquidation compulsory. If that is possible, I grant that the point has been taken. I trust that that is so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I question whether the clause is necessary. It prevents the FSA from presenting a petition to wind up a European economic area or treaty firm unless the permission of the home state regulator has been obtained. This is different from the present law as we understand it. Under part V of the Insolvency Act 1986, it is possible to petition for the winding up of overseas companies—for example, for non-payment of debts. This is an important protection for United Kingdom creditors, so should not be given away lightly. I am a little puzzled as to why the Bill withdraws the authority's power, or circumscribes it in the way that it does. We can find no provision in the investment services directive requiring such a clause. Perhaps the Minister has information about which EU directive specifies the need for it.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The clause reflects the principle that insolvency is of necessity a prudential matter which is the responsibility of the home state regulator rather than the host state regulator. An unrestricted right for a host state regulator to apply for the winding up of a passported firm would be inconsistent with the single market principle of national regulation. Clause 318 therefore prohibits the FSA from applying to wind up passporting firms, except in instances when it has been asked by the home state regulator to take action on its behalf. Of course, that restriction does not apply to other UK creditors of incoming firms, nor does it mean that the FSA is powerless to intervene in relation to an EEA or treaty firm without the co-operation of the home state regulator.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The FSA has powers of intervention on incoming firms under part XII which are enforceable by injunction. However, it is clearly not right to allow a host state regulator—even when that regulator is our own—to undermine the single market by seeking to wind up a passporting firm in its own courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification which, however, is not entirely satisfactory. I accept that prudential supervision is a function of the home state regulator. We do not dispute that there should be restrictions on the authority's ability, as it may be wise to have them. However, under the clause, the authority may not, in any circumstances, present a petition for winding up, even when prudential supervision is not at issue. The Minister seems to have taken a general point about the single market and unnecessarily given away the authority's powers in circumstances in which it may be necessary to protect UK creditors; such powers exist under present legislation. The Minister's explanation is therefore not entirely convincing.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman puzzles me. The best thing for me to do is reflect on his comments and write to him if a further point needs to be addressed. However, if there is not, I shall explain why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Minister for that and look forward to the letter. In view of that, I shall not press the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Under clause 320, the liquidator of a company must report to the FSA if it appears that the company was, or had been, carrying on a regulated activity in contravention of the general prohibition. At present the obligation to report applies only when the company is being wound up on a petition presented by someone other than the FSA­a creditor, for example. Amendment No. 910 would extend the requirement to provide reports to the FSA in cases of voluntary winding up of companies. Amendment No. 911 is a consequential amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, his amendment seeks to ensure that the power applies to companies wound up voluntarily as well as those wound up compulsorily. Occasions on which that would be an issue would be few and far between, as controllers of such a business would, no doubt, go to great lengths to avoid their businesses being wound up if that could lead to their exposure. However, I agree that if such an eventuality did arise, the liquidator should be under a duty to inform the FSA. In light of that, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be happy to hear that I would like to accept his amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is gratefully received.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 954, in page 161, line 38, leave out from `rules' to end of line 39.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 955 to 957.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The clause gives the FSA an entirely new power to petition for the bankruptcy, or, in Scotland, the sequestration, of the estate of sole traders carrying on financial services business. This is because there is no reason why the FSA should have powers in relation to companies and partnerships that it cannot exercise in relation to sole traders. We announced in our July 1998 consultation document our intention to put matters on all fours.
<P>
The clause provides that the FSA may present a petition for bankruptcy or sequestration in relation to any individual who is, or has been, an authorised person, or who is, or has been, carrying on financial services business without authorisation. Such a petition may be presented only if the individual appears to be unable, or to have no reasonable prospect of being able, to pay a ``regulated activity debt''—a debt incurred in the course of doing financial services business.
<P>
The key difference between the clause and clause 317 is that it does not provide for the bankruptcy of a sole trader on any ground other than inability to pay his debts. There is no equivalent of the power to wind up a company or partnership on the ground that it is ``just and equitable''. The reason is that it is not meaningful to apply such a concept to sole traders. A sole trader's business is not legally distinct from the proprietor's personal finances, and thus there is no separate entity to be ``wound up''. So long as a person can pay his debts, there is no way in which he can be declared bankrupt.
<P>
The amendments are technical changes to ensure that the powers that we are taking are consistent with the general law of bankruptcy as it applies in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This is our old friend market abuse, which has caused us so much trouble and strife so far. Will the Minister remind the Committee where we are on the issue of intended or unintended market abuse? Some people find it difficult to grasp the concept of unintentional market abuse, but such abuse is not impossible. Actions by traders and others might be construed as market abuse if they disturbed the market in such a way that some people made money and others lost a lot of money. As the actions of the person triggering the event might not have been intentionally abusive, it would be unfair for clause 333 to require him or her to disgorge profits and suffer the penalties. What is the Minister's stand on that? Could innocent actions be subject to the clause?

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We have debated this issue at length. Intention is not a requirement in market abuse as currently defined. Negligent behaviour can damage markets. I refer the right hon. Gentleman to earlier debates in which we drew a different definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am not talking about negligent behaviour, but innocent behaviour which, although not negligent or reckless, might be construed as market abuse. This is a good example of where penalties are attached to innocent conduct in defiance of a basic, and often commented on, principle of English law. It is not convincing to say that that is tough because that is how the clause is drafted.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not really clear about the right hon. Gentleman's problem. The market abuse definition does not catch innocent behaviour. Is he referring to the copper miners whom we discussed earlier? I hope that we have dealt with that issue. No definition in the clause should catch innocent behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is a significant assurance if the Minister is saying that innocent behaviour cannot be caught. I was not going to give the example of the Zambian copper workers. Instead, I am thinking of someone who is actively and innocently engaged in the market. I realise that we will revisit this whole concept of market abuse and I do not intend to trigger a long debate. I shall examine the Minister's comments.

Clause 333 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 334</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of Authority to require restitution</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Here, the authorities and not the courts will have the significant power to make a restitution order. I would prefer such an order to be subject to the normal disciplines of disclosure, procedural fairness and scrutiny that obtain in a court. If the FSA did that, it would be a markedly different route for the person at the sharp end, who would not have the same procedural defences as they would if the matter were subject to a court procedure. I realise, of course, that they could appeal against such an order and, presumably, take it to the tribunal, but that seems to be a secondary defence and it would be better if these cases, too, were subject to court proceedings. Why is the authority to be given these powers?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The clause provides for the FSA to have the power to require restitution from authorised persons directly, without having to apply to the court—although those persons would, of course, have the right to refer the matter to the tribunal. It is a new statutory power, but the existing rules on self-regulating organisations already include the power to require redress. It will allow the most appropriate route to be followed in a particular case, as well as avoiding unnecessary duplication.
<P>
If the FSA is applying to the courts anyway for an injunction in relation to an authorised person and it believes that that person should pay restitution, it makes sense for the application to the court to cover both the injunction and any restitution. However, where the FSA uses its internal disciplinary procedures in relation to a particular contravention, it makes more sense for it to have a direct power to require restitution to be paid, rather than having to pursue concurrent disciplinary and court-based proceedings in relation to one set of facts. If a reference is then made to the tribunal, it will be appraised of the overall picture and therefore better placed to reach a just decision. In that sense, the power complements the FSA's range of disciplinary powers in relation to authorised persons. In many ways, securing appropriate consumer redress and discipline in an authorised firm are two sides of the same coin. The clause does not apply to unauthorised persons.
<P>
If this power were removed, as the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) appears to argue for, it would be more complex for the FSA to secure redress for those who had lost out as a result of a contravention by an authorised person. It would also mean that where a person exercised their right to refer the disciplinary case to the tribunal, two separate judicial bodies would be considering the same set of facts. That is clearly an unnecessary duplication and could lead to complications between the court and the tribunal—they could have conflicting opinions on the case or about which body was more expert in the area. I can see no benefit in removing that power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thought that the Minister presented that beautifully, so I shall not pursue the matter.
