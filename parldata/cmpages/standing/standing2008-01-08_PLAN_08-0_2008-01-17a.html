Minister for Local Government (John Healey):
						</b> On a point of
order, Mr. Illsley. The hon. Member for Beckenham asked me
late on Tuesday&#146;s sitting about the National Audit Office and
the bodies that it audits, and I promised to get back to her with a
list. That list demonstrates that it is standard practice for the NAO
to audit national bodies such as the infrastructure planning commission
and those that essentially are non-departmental public bodies. I have
responded to the hon. Lady and, for the benefit of Committee members,
made available a list of the bodies that the NAO currently has
responsibility for
auditing.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): I was
reflecting over lunch&#151;a very light lunch&#151;on the
Minister&#146;s comments in response to my amendments and new clause.
I understand that he will never be persuaded to put on the face of the
Bill the level of detail that new clause 6 goes into, but am equally
aware of the discussions that he will have with the Select Committee
Chairs and wonder whether he would give an assurance that he will
report back to us on those discussions in Committee, or on Report if
the timing so determines, and give further consideration to the
possibility of putting something very general in principle on the face
of the Bill: simply a commitment to the House having a vote and being
allowed scrutiny. In other words, amendment No. 280 without new clause
6. I am not asking for an assurance that he will do that at this stage,
but simply that he will report back in the light of those discussions
and give further consideration to that point of
principle.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000520"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
Illsley. I will indeed report back to the Committee or the House on the
progress of discussions and proposals for scrutiny arrangements for the
important provisions on national policy statements in the Bill. I
recognise the importance of the parliamentary scrutiny and how strongly
that is felt by members of the Committee and will reflect on all the
points that have been raised in what has been an extended and useful
debate, including those that were put so clearly and strongly by my
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield,
Attercliffe.</div>

will be much easier to keep us in order than it was.</div>
					<a name="08011785000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I thank the Minister for
those assurances and also the efforts that the hon. Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe made? I would, however, like to have a vote on
the principle of scrutiny by Parliament, which should not take long in
this Committee. I accept the assurances that the Minister gave, but
think that it is so important, both inside and outside the House, that
proper arrangements are made for parliamentary scrutiny and that they
are accepted and understood that I would like to get our views on the
record. Therefore, if the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe is
minded not to press amendment No. 280 to a vote, I would like to do so
myself.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I, too, welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. Just before we adjourned, the
Minister was explaining why my amendment, new clause 6 and the other
amendments in the group were not necessary. They all related to public
participation, accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. In these
current days when everything before Parliament is guillotined and
timetabled and when perhaps 100 amendments will go untouched and
undiscussed when Bills are on Report, I am really not happy that we
will not put something on the face of the Bill. I do not want to be
stubborn, but think that it is one of the most important issues in the
Bill. I would like to press the amendment to a
vote.</div>

							<a name="08011785000561"></a>Mrs.

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 229, in
clause 5, page 3, line 2, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) Before
designating a statement as a national policy statement for the purposes
of this Act the Secretary of State must publish a process and timetable
for the production of that national policy
statement.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011785000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would put a clear process and timetable for the designation
of national policy statements in the Bill. It refers particularly to
statements that are likely to be passported through. It is important
that we have a discussion about and hear the Minister&#146;s views on
the timing of this process. The more that we receive information from a
wide variety of sources, the more conscious I am that seeking final
approval for a national policy statement could be a lengthy process. I
tabled the amendment in the hope that the Minister will give us some
assurances and that we can tease out our concerns about the length of
time that it will take for national policy statements to go through the
system. It is probably very difficult to do that for any new policy
statements, but let us concentrate for a while on the air transport
statement and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
waste statement. This morning the Minister set out how he expected the
current aviation policy statement to become a national policy statement
because of the review that is already promised between 2009 and, I
think he said
2014&#151;</div>

						</b> I appreciate that
advice.</div>
					<a name="08011785000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
work is going on on Heathrow&#146;s third runway, which is pretty
controversial itself. Far be it from me to give my learned friends any
help, but I would have thought that, if the Government hope to make the
air transport policy into the national policy statement on air
transport, progress on runway 3 will be exceedingly slow, because
everyone will be waiting for the finalised national policy statement.
And that is only one aspect of
aviation.</div>
					<a name="08011785000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the Minister also tell us how he expects DEFRA to process its waste
statement, or even whether that, which is regarded as a national
statement, will become a national policy statement? What impact will
that have, when everyone is currently concentrating hard on replacing
landfill and all its associated difficulties with a variety of
interesting new technologies, some of which are completely
unpronounceable but may well be infinitely more
effective?</div>
					<a name="08011785000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
existing policy statements arise, we would be most grateful if the
Minister could give us some idea of the time scale that he envisages
for those becoming national policy statements. Given that he was saying
earlier today that one Select Committee will be looking at those, how
does he expect that Committee to deal with more than one policy
statement at the same time without giving us all parliamentary
constipation? If we could have some idea of the practicalities of that,
I would be most grateful. This is a probing amendment to try and get
that
information.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>
					<a name="08011785000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key question is the
Government&#146;s justification of a clear distinction between the
way in which existing policy has been framed, and especially consulted
on, and that which will apply to a national policy statement. It is
fair to say that people around the country, interest groups, campaign
groups and industry bodies would perhaps approach Government policy set
as an intention in a White Paper&#151;but perhaps tested in some
specifics at planning inquiries under the current state of
affairs&#151;slightly differently once the Bill is in effect and
there is a national policy statement. Once the policy is set, any other
means of people commenting on it with regard to individual applications
will be circumvented, and, obviously, that policy will inform the
IPC&#146;s
decision.</div>
					<a name="08011785000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
therefore important that we hear from the Government how something that
moves from existing policy to becoming an NPS will meet a higher level
of scrutiny, and, as the hon. Member for Beckenham said in introducing
her amendment, just what the timetable and processes for that would
be.</div>

Healey:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Beckenham for
making it clear that she is treating this as a probing amendment. The
hon. Lady said that her principal concern was with the
&#147;passporting&#148;, as she put it&#151;not a term I would
use&#151;of existing policy statements into a designated category as
national policy statements. The hon. Lady seems to be concerned that
that process might take too long, and that underpins her remarks on the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011785000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Lady was kind enough to acknowledge, I went into detail on the
stages in the process and their likely timing in view of the aviation
White Paper having the potential to become a national policy statement.
I hope that that was helpful as a background to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011785000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, the amendment would require the Secretary of State to set out
a timetable for new policy statements, as well as for pre-existing
ones, and as the hon. Lady acknowledged, that would be quite difficult.
It is not clear how far-reaching
the</div>
					<a name="08011785000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;process and
timetable for the
production&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011785000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is the amendment&#146;s terminology&#151;would be.</div>
					<a name="08011785000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle at the heart of
the proposal is the importance of national policy statements being
produced in a timely, efficient and open manner. We will follow that
principle in designating existing statements and in drawing up new
ones. The national policy statements will vary considerably in
complexity depending on the type of infrastructure that they deal with.
It is therefore right to leave judgments about the timing and
consultation periods&#151;the process necessary to reach the point of
legitimate designation&#151;to the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="08011785000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the matter of waste
strategy, if the Committee follows my logic, it is not a matter for me
but for the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
to decide and explain whether, and particularly how and when, an
existing strategy or policy statement on waste may become a national
policy statement</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>
					<a name="08011785000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have explained the stages and
the standards that we would require of any policy statement being
designated as a national policy statement for the purposes of this
Bill. We would not expect to designate a strategy for waste before
2010. I hope that that is helpful to the Committee and to the hon. Lady
and that she will withdraw the amendment on that
basis.</div>

entirely reassured by the Minister&#146;s reply because there is such
concern outside this place about the potential for
&#147;passporting&#148;&#151;I stick with that word&#151;the
aviation policy without meeting the high standards that the Minister,
and the Committee, wish to see in a national policy
statement.</div>
					<a name="08011785000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that I was trying to work out whether the consultation
was too long, but the fear is whether it will be skimped. I therefore
hope that he can reassure the Committee and those outside this House
that the existing policy statements will meet all the requirements of
every other national policy statement in respect of consultation,
sustainability and the various directives that are meant to govern
them. I should be grateful to have the Minister&#146;s explicit
assurance on that matter before I withdraw the
amendment.</div>

require any policy statement that a Secretary of State wanted
designated as a national policy statement to meet the standards and
criteria set out in the Bill, particularly those on consultation and
sustainability, regardless of whether it was precisely the same as or
largely based on an existing strategy or policy statement or produced
afresh. Such a statement would also have to have gone through the
process that we propose for Parliament to exercise proper scrutiny.
That would have to take place and those standards would have to be met
before the designation could be
given.</div>

Government policy on flood risk is very clear; it is in PPS 25 on
planning, development and flood risk, which says that you should look
to the lowest flood-risk areas first and to the highest ones only when
no suitable alternatives are available. That is a very sound policy,
which we would expect to be incorporated within the national policy
statements.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Planning Public

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>
					<a name="08011785000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all very concerned about
sustainability and climate change. One of the suspected consequences of
current climate change is the flooding we saw last summer and a number
of Members are suffering from floods in their constituencies as we sit
here now. I have an interest here, if not a registrable one, because I
have a home very close to Dungeness power station. Many of the
potential new sites and the current sites of nuclear power stations are
on the coast. I must say that I never expected to see a nuclear power
station even proposed for Dungeness again. However, we could have the
problem of rising sea levels and continual
flooding.</div>
					<a name="08011785000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government tell us regularly that they have no intention of building
their 3 million new homes on flood plains. Given the system that they
are trying to put in place, however, I do not know whether they can
even get close to that figure, and put houses anywhere anyone would
wish to live, if they do not put them on flood
plains.</div>

the Government have said anything of the sort. If they want 3 million

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000573"></a>Mrs.

						</b> Indeed. My right hon. Friend is quite right. Perhaps
my use of irony did not come over quite as effectively as I hoped. I
absolutely accept what my right hon. Friend says. Even with safeguards,
we are expecting a lot of houses to be built on flood plains. We
therefore want assurances that the sustainability policy within the NPS
includes a very clear statement on flooding so that all of
us&#151;house builders, the Environment Agency, the water companies,
the county councils who have to deal with flooding, the Highways
Agency&#151;can be reassured that flooding issues will be taken very
firmly into account in the development of national policy
statements.</div>
					<a name="08011785000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011785000574"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): In supporting these
amendments it is important to look at what we are trying to achieve.
Some might argue that an appraisal of the sustainability of any aspect
of a national policy statement would not meet the definition of such an
entity if it did not include an assessment of flooding risk. It is
important to many organisations to put the measure in the Bill,
including the Environment Agency, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Beckenham said. It would create a discipline for those who draw up the
statements to look at the important matter of flooding.</div>
					<a name="08011785000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members will recall the
floods last July and the scene of the electricity transfer station near
Tewkesbury being saved by a major operation. Had the operation not been
successful, vast areas would have been without electricity for a long
period. If we imagine that situation occurring to a larger, more
strategic power generation plant, we can imagine the problems that we
could be building up.</div>
					<a name="08011785000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is vital that flooding be
included in policy statements as an item to consider with regard to the
potential for future problems. The building of a major highway or any
sort of structure could have major 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>impacts on the management of river systems and flood plains, so it is an
important issue. Some might say that the amendment would place an
onerous obligation on those who will draw up the statements, but it
should not do that because there are circumstances in which it would be
a perfectly simple, one-line job to fulfil the requirements. Other
circumstances might require a more important and detailed look at the
situation, but that would only happen if there is a problem. The
amendments would require an appraisal of sustainability to include
consideration of flooding risk.

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): May I add my support for
the amendment? Indeed, the issue of flooding was envisaged in the White
Paper, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08011785000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;National
policy statements would also need to reflect the physical impacts of
climate change on nationally significant projects and the need for
resilience throughout their lifespan to factors such as increased risk
of flood, subsidence or coastal
realignment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In an era
of climate change, it would clearly be sensible to reflect that vital
aspect in national policy statements.
</div>
					<a name="08011785000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully accept that
the issue of sustainability must be reflected in policy statements. The
difficulty is that an expression that would define that is not in the
Bill. It is essential to underline, as amendment No. 224 would, the
issue of flooding and its overriding
importance.</div>

Healey:
						</b> The hon. Member for Newbury was absolutely right
about the importance of the sub-station that was affected by the July
floods in Gloucestershire. I visited it in the days immediately
following the floods and saw for myself the heroic efforts of the
emergency services and the armed forces to protect the power station.
That is one of the reasons that Pitt drew the lesson that he did in his
interim report, and that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made it clear that the
Government have fully accepted all 15 urgent recommendations, including
those from Pitt, that we take steps to ensure that such critical
utility infrastructure is properly and better protected in future. That
is different, however, from specifying a particular feature, such as
flood risk, in the Bill, and singling out its consideration as a
requirement in the production of national policy statements.</div>
					<a name="08011785000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should explain why the
appraisal of sustainability, which the Committee has already discussed,
and which will be required of every Secretary of State who produces a
national policy statement, deals with the matter. Appraisals of
sustainability are central to our consideration of future
infrastructure needs and to our sustainable development objectives. The
Bill contains the necessary provisions to ensure that national policy
statements take into account environmental and sustainability
considerations, including relevant documents such as PPS25 on the risk
of flooding. We have also made it clear that national policy statements
must integrate all the environmental, social and economic aspects of
policy. Ministers will have to take all those issues into account when
drawing up the statements, and that will include flood
risk.</div>
					<a name="08011785000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might also
interest the Committee that under clause 5(6), Ministers
must</div>
					<a name="08011785000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;give reasons for
the policy set out in the statement.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>
					<a name="08011785000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can expect an explanation of the
factors, which in some instances will include flooding, to be drawn out
at that point. Finally, national policy statements will be subject to
public consultation and scrutiny in this House. I am sure that the
scrutiny in this House will ensure that all relevant aspects, including
the risk of flooding, will be properly taken into account in the final
versions of the national policy
statements.</div>
					<a name="08011785000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
accept that it is right to single out a specific feature in this way.
We have given a clear commitment that the Secretary of State will have
a duty to consider the issue of sustainability when producing a
national policy statement. Therefore, I do not believe that the
amendment advocated by the hon. Member for Beckenham is necessary to
achieve the ends that she has in mind.</div>

						</b> We are motoring through quite nicely. The reason for
this group of amendments is to tease out the confusion between national
policy statements that are site-specific and those that are not. What
will be the consequences of national policy statements that are
site-specific? The Minister will be aware that in the statement on
energy policy and nuclear power last week, the Secretary of State for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
said:</div>
					<a name="08011785000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The NPS
will need to be as site specific as it possibly can be in relation to
possible future nuclear sites.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
10 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 529.]</div>
					<a name="08011785000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal
(Mr. Gummer) made precisely that point on nuclear power
stations. Most of us could indicate where in England and Wales the
nuclear power stations will go and where they should go in Scotland.
However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon
pointed out, the problem is that having a national policy statement
that is site-specific is tantamount to giving planning permission.
There are also provisions within the clause that, while not
site-specific, could produce information that identifies sites or gives
otherwise clear indications of where the Secretary of State expects
development to be.</div>
					<a name="08011785000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we recognise that it is
difficult not to be site-specific, we would prefer policy statements
that are not site-specific because of the difficulty of implicit
planning permission. I am intrigued that the Minister is so interested
in that particular Secretary of State and hope that he will become
Secretary of State some day. However, a national policy statement
should be a statement of policy, not a statement of detail, in which
the Minister and the Secretary of State specify where those sites will
be. I am not entirely convinced that that is the best way forward as a
principle.</div>

Ripon might also have views on that&#151;our view is that the
national policy statement should be a statement of policy rather than
specifics. I am not writing these things, but one could argue that
nuclear power stations should be sited close to the sea without saying
that that should be at Dungeness or
Sizewell.</div>

						</b> We are indeed, because most of the time we are
trying to find out what the Minister means and what the thinking is.
For instance, I would suggest that when a national policy statement is
site-specific, that is in effect tantamount to giving planning
permission. There are consequences that flow from that. I am trying to
get the Minister to be forthcoming on whether he thinks it is correct
that a national policy statement will, in effect, give planning
permission for various developments, or whether a better way forward
would be to lay out the terms and conditions for such developments and
allow the contractors to come forward with their own site-specific
proposals.</div>
					<a name="08011785000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
contractors are in the private sector, even though it is regulated.
Highways, of course, are not. I suggest that it is entirely up to them
to know where they want to develop. There could well be arguments about
where a new port should
go.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>would like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the amendments so
that we may gather whether he foresees difficulties if a policy

particular.</div>
					<a name="08011785000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think we
all agree that there is a big problem. The hon. Lady tried valiantly to
defend the idea that it might be possible to have a national policy
statement for some sectors without getting into the business of
site-specifics. However, I suspect that, were the Government to consult
on the new generation of nuclear power stations, for example, and
talked about the coast in general, a legitimate question from the
public might be, &#147;Are the Government considering prioritising
existing sites over new ones?&#148; As soon as that question is
answered, we are into site-specifics.</div>
					<a name="08011785000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000596"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> It might be possible for the Government to put
forward a non-site-specific proposal in their statement, but I wonder
how it could get through parliamentary scrutiny without becoming much
more specific. Members of Parliament represent constituencies, and the
one thing that they will want to know is whether it will be in their
neck of the
woods.</div>
					<a name="08011785000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000597"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
that intervention. We are obviously musing on the same matters, in
particular with regard to amendment No. 181, which he has also
tabled.</div>
					<a name="08011785000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3
recognises that there may well be site-specific aspects to NPSs, but
that those would be of huge concern to local people. I say
&#147;local people&#148; because the Minister has talked about the
consultation that will be undertaken at a national level on the
NPS.</div>
					<a name="08011785000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the site is
identified, that will call into question the effect that it will have
on a particular local community. I want to make extra provision for
consultation through local authorities in the area, so that we have the
best local debate possible on how a proposal might proceed. Therefore,
when it comes to national consideration and detailed scrutiny of the
NPS, all the information will be there for this House and anybody else
who is examining it. Important local factors that could affect the
introduction and operation of an NPS might come to light only if the
views of local communities were considered in
consultation.</div>
					<a name="08011785000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
all own up to the fact that even the best local authority reaches only
some people when consulting on its local development
framework&#151;those who are very active in the community and who are
aware that it is coming up. The best local authorities, which hold
excellent roadshows and produce clear literature for people to respond
to, still do not get to
everybody.</div>
					<a name="08011785000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">When there
is potential for a nationally significant scheme to come to an area, it
will receive coverage. There could be huge anxiety in that area, and
there ought to be a process in the Bill that allows the local
authority, as the leading democratic organisation, to bring together
that opinion and knowledge and ensure that it is fed into the process
of compiling the NPS. Contingent on that is the need for resources to
come with that for those local authorities that suddenly find
themselves the beneficiary of being considered for a nationally
important scheme through an NPS.</div>

						</b> I am listening carefully to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s reasoning and he is on to a good thing. However,
there could be a slight problem because we were advised in the evidence
sessions that county councils will be expected to assist potential
objectors. There could be a conflict in assisting in the implementation
and development of a national policy statement, on the one hand, and
being duty bound to assist objectors to a development, on the
other.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
highlighting what might at first appear to be a potential conflict. New
clause 3 seeks to establish a process to enable local authorities to
bring opinion together, not to co-ordinate systematic objection, but to
ensure that, along with national consultation and scrutiny, a local
element is fed into the process. I hope that the Committee will be
sympathetic to the new clause, which I think would improve matters when
NPSs have site-specific
allocations.</div>

Curry:
						</b> I am beginning to think that the chairman of the
IPC had better be a theologian because how many angels can get through
the eye of a needle is likely to be one of the more pressing questions
to come before him in the early
stages.</div>
					<a name="08011785000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
preferred national policy statements which end with a conclusion that
certain infrastructure of national importance should be built at a
certain place. I would not bother with the IPC at all because the key
document in all of this will be the planning statement. However, we
have decided to have an IPC. The issue now is where the interface lies
between the planning statement and the practical decision to give
planning permission. The problem is that the issues that will be
subject to planning statements, by definition, are so big and are of
such national importance that it becomes very difficult in practice to
draw a distinction between a framework and a specific application for a
particular site. The Government will have to try to tread that line.
The Minister said that the framework document will be submitted to
scrutiny outside and, particularly, inside Parliament. However, the
only question that people will be interested in asking in the course of
that scrutiny is, &#147;Where?&#148; It will be difficult for a
Minister to appear before a Select Committee, whatever shape it
takes&#151;and he or she will appear before it&#151;but the
question will be, &#147;Where do you have in
mind?&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody
will be working from a clean sheet, because we all know that, in
practice, there is a shortlist. We will know of only a handful of sites
that are relevant to the siting of a new nuclear power station.
Frankly, there is probably only one site relevant to the storage of
nuclear waste, which would be such a controversial issue and subject to
such detailed work that it would be almost impossible to see anything
other than a site-specific conclusion at the end of any process. If it
is going to be buried, it would be buried in Sellafield&#151;that
would almost certainly be the outcome.</div>
					<a name="08011785000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">On ports, we know which are
nationally strategic, because the Bill includes size criteria that in
themselves serve to define which ports may want to expand to create
greater national capacity, although I accept that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>there may be a slightly more open agenda on other matters. To what
extent, in practice, will a framework document in the circumstances I
described lead to nothing more than an entirely duplicate application
for planning permission? Will it lead to a scrutinisation of the
planning statement that will, in practice, be almost entirely
replicated in the planning permission process and IPC
scrutiny?</div>
					<a name="08011785000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that the issue is
difficult. The Minister wishes to use the IPC to deal with issues of
national importance, and I am extremely sympathetic to what he is
seeking to achieve, but trying to maintain a distinction does not work.
My hon. Friend is striving nobly to an end that is difficult to
attain&#151;it is like finding a manager who will make Newcastle
United a decent football team once more. Equally, the Minister is
drawing a distinction that is difficult in practice to sustain because
the overlap is so enormous. As soon as we move away from the abstract
to talk about specific sectors, we will almost immediately start to
talk about places. Frankly, that is rightly part of the scrutiny
process. In a sense, both the Minister and my hon. Friend are
struggling to deliver something that is undeliverable because of the
lack of distinctions.</div>

herself. I would certainly be prepared to help her out if she wants to
withdraw the amendment and I urge my hon. Friends to resist
it.</div>
					<a name="08011785000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
national policy statements are intended to provide the primary
reference point for the IPC&#146;s  work, it is important
that they provide a sufficient framework. The statements will also
provide the framework for major investment decisions. Again, the
greater the degree of clarity and certainty that we can properly
include in national policy statements, the more helpful they will be
and the more likely it is that that essential investment will be
considered. I honestly cannot see how a national policy statement that
serves the function we will require of it for the IPC, given the role
that it will play in encouraging greater investment, can work for
transport, rail and road networks, for which the location is intrinsic
to the infrastructure. Such situations are different from those
involving certain forms of electricity and power generation such as
renewables, where location specificity simply is not as intrinsic to
the policy statement and framework as seems sensible and natural to
produce.</div>

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I understand what
the Minister is saying about certain types of operation where the
national policy statement would, in effect, be location-specific or
very close thereto, but will he deal with the point raised by my hon.
Friend at the beginning? If a national policy statement states that we
need x power stations of a certain kind and there are three possible
locations, and three is what we need, to all intents and purposes, that
is the planning permission. Once the national policy statement has said
that and has identified a small number of sites, which by the nature of
the operation cannot go anywhere else, planning permission is
effectively being given. If that is the case, how does the Minister
justify not giving those affected by the proposals exactly the same
rights to consultation and participation as they would have had a
separate application been made? I understand his logic and I am asking
him to follow it through.</div>

on to that.</div>
					<a name="08011785000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
dealing with the contention that somehow we can have national policy
statements that prescribe specific locations. I simply do not
understand how that can make sense. For example, if a national policy
statement on aviation determined, through the process of preparing and
designating it, that a third runway was required at Heathrow, it is
difficult to see how one could set out the policy statement without
specifying that that third runway was needed at Heathrow. Similarly, it
is difficult to see how a national policy statement that determined
that it is important to expand the road capacity from A to B could be
set out if it did not actually say that. At the heart of the hon.
Lady&#146;s argument is a real problem for the concept of a national
policy statement, which she says she strongly supports. She says it
would be a good innovation.</div>
					<a name="08011785000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to deal with the
question of whether any site-specific or locational references would be
tantamount to giving planning permission or pre-empting the
consideration of permission of an application. The same sort of
territory concerned the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon. As I
have tried to explain, it is not tantamount to planning permission; it
is not pre-empting the proper consideration of any application. A
site-specific national policy statement would provide the framework for
examination by the IPC, but it would not prejudge the decisions that
the IPC would be required to make. By identifying particularly suitable
or likely suitable sites or, indeed, unsuitable sites, it will reduce
the debate about suitability and those associated issues at a local
level as part of the application process. In many ways it will help to
achieve what we have set out to do, which is to ensure that those big
debates about need, policy and other such considerations are not
repeated whenever an application is considered in the planning process.
Again, that is broadly welcomed as a feature of what we are trying to
do.</div>

						</b> The Minister says that the national policy
statement would reduce the debate about suitability. Would it not
eliminate the debate about suitability? Therefore, the inquiry that
would be conducted by the IPC would be nothing more than going through
the motions; it would be a ritual dance that had only one
conclusion.</div>

details of an application. It could&#151;I am sure that it
will&#151;in some cases reject an application on a particular site or
it could set conditions on an application to mitigate the effects on a
site.</div>

what the Minister was expecting of the interchange between the NPS and
the IPC but I am again confused. He said that the IPC would be able to
turn down planning applications. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>Would the IPC be able to turn down a third runway at Heathrow? Or would
the fact that that project was specified in the national policy
statement mean that all the IPC could do in response to local
residents&#146; complaints would be to set conditions, which would be
such that the third runway would not be viable? Would it be able to do
that?</div>

its remit and the role that we wish it to
play.</div>

							<a name="08011785000610"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The Minister has been very helpful. I accept that I
was wrong to say that what is proposed would be tantamount to planning
permission in certain circumstances. To take the Heathrow analogy, a
specific application for a third runway could be turned down despite
the fact that the NPS says that there should be a third runway. There
would thus be one of two situations. First, the unelected IPC might
overturn the NPS, which has been the subject of democratic
parliamentary scrutiny. Most people would regard that as unconscionable
and most of those who think that it speeds up the planning system would
see it as self-defeating. Secondly, the application might be turned
down because detail or design conditions are attached. In that event,
perhaps I should have said that a site-specific national policy
statement is tantamount to outline planning permission. It would surely
be that at the very least.</div>

Curry:
						</b> In the Minister&#146;s first remarks on this
group of amendments, he said that the NPS was the &#147;primary
reference point&#148; for the IPC. If it is a primary reference point
for the commission, I do not see how the commission can turn down an
application based on a named project in the NPS. But if it is a primary
reference point for people putting in applications that is certainly a
different
matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000613"></a>John

						</b> I am surprised that the Committee seems to be
making rather a meal of this proposal. Of course the commission could
turn down an application for a development on a site, despite it being
deemed a suitable site for a particular development. The application
itself may be deemed unsuitable and the IPC could perfectly well turn
down that application&#151;or set conditions on it&#151;if it felt

that it was not a suitable application or development for that site or
if the national benefits set out in the national policy statement were
outweighed by some of the local disbenefits or problems with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>particular applications. In all honesty, I think that hon. Members
recognise that there are limits to how specific I can be when asked to
suggest how an IPC that we have not yet set up might hypothetically
consider, in general terms, applications that have not yet been
submitted, within a policy framework that we are still discussing how
to produce and that is not yet in place.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): I am grateful for the clarity
that the Minister has brought to the role of the IPC and to the powers
that it will have. The hon. Member for North Cornwall mentioned the
democratic deficit with regard to the IPC and national policy
statements. Notwithstanding the fact that I appreciate the scrutiny
that the Committee is trying to apply to that, could the Minister
explain for the benefit of the Committee what the substantive
difference would be between the IPC taking the decision under these new
proposals and a judge taking a decision at a public inquiry
now?</div>

							<a name="08011785000618"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> My hon. Friend has made a good point and draws me
on to the areas of concern that the hon. Member for North Cornwall
raised on democracy and consultation. His general argument is right: it
is critical that those in any location who might be affected by a
potential development should be properly consulted. He is right that
they need to be properly informed and to understand the possible
implications of any national policy statements that include specific
locations within their draft terms. It is important that they also have
the chance to give their views. That is why we have clause 7(5) in
particular and why clause 8 requires the Secretary of State to consult
with local authorities when any aspect of a national policy statement
draft includes specific locations.</div>
					<a name="08011785000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000619"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister, who is being
extremely generous. Does he agree that if the IPC were conducting an
inquiry with reference to an NPS that referred to a specific location,
it would be virtually impossible for the IPC to turn down the
application on the grounds of locational suitability? It would be a
golden thread running through the inquiry. Whatever anyone else might
say about the merits of the application, the question of its location
would be a touchstone and could not be
challenged.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000620"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> An important part of the process proposed in the
Bill is that there should be the scope within national policy
statements to identify locations that the Government, after
consultation, parliamentary scrutiny, the production and finalising of
the national policy statement and everything that should be taken into
account in that assessment, judge to be suitable for a particular type
of development. Locations might also be found to be unsuitable. That
will inevitably be, and is designed to be, an important framework and
starting point for the IPC in considering applications.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>
					<a name="08011785000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Clwyd, West makes a reasonable point, which is similar, but
in slightly longer terms, to the one I made earlier. The IPC&#146;s
consideration of the suitability or unsuitability of a site is likely
to be shorter if that matter is already part of a national policy
statement. However, that is not equivalent to there being an automatic
green light for any application that may come forward for such a site,
nor is it tantamount to saying that the IPC cannot turn down an
application for a site that has been deemed suitable in a national
policy
statement.</div>
					<a name="08011785000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the concern over consultation, there will be an opportunity
to consider issues specific to an application at the local stage in
relation to site layout, siting, access and the environmental impact.
Again, a central feature of the proposals is that in certain national
policy statements, the Secretary of State will have the discretion to
identify particular locations as likely to be suitable or unsuitable
for the infrastructure that they have in mind, taking into account
consultation and parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000621"></a>Mr.
Curry:
						</b> I am intrigued by the designation of unsuitability.
No doubt 99.9 per cent. of the UK is unsuitable for the development of
nuclear power stations and, by definition, ports. Is it not sufficient
to designate what is suitable, given the purpose of a policy statement?
Areas that are unsuitable will take up pages and pages with entirely
superfluous
information.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000622"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> What we are discussing is not a
requirement to identify suitable or unsuitable locations, but the scope
to do so when it is appropriate in a national policy statement. It may
or may not be appropriate to identify unsuitable locations. I can
imagine, as I am sure the right hon. Gentleman can, that there would be
a strong interest during consultation and parliamentary scrutiny in a
confirmation that certain locations are unsuitable for developments in
some national policy statements. All we propose in the Bill is that the
Secretary of State should have the scope to identify locations that are
likely to be suitable and, on the other hand, to decide that it seems
sensible to identify locations that would be
unsuitable.</div>
					<a name="08011785000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 181 to 183 would prevent the identification of a
statutory undertaker as being appropriate to carry out work. Under
clause 5(5)(e), the Secretary of State can identify one or more
organisations, as appropriate, to carry out a specific type of
development. In certain cases only certain developers such as the
Highways Agency or Network Rail will be in a position to provide the
sort of infrastructure that a national policy statement covers. We are
simply allowing organisations in such circumstances to be identified,
where appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08011785000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have dealt with new clause 3 to the extent that there are duties on the
Secretary of State to consult when there is a location-specific element
in a national policy statement. Quite honestly, we already expect local
authorities to represent their communities and, by and large, even
Liberal Democrat councils do so pretty effectively. I do not think that
this provision is needed to force them to do so. It is certainly not
needed to set out how they should do it. The hon. Member for North
Cornwall has not really made his case for the new clause. I hope that
he will not press it to a Division, because I would have to ask my hon.
Friends to resist it.</div>

						</b> I listened with interest as the Minister set out
where he feels there are already provisions in the Bill that would
allow local communities to have a thorough opportunity to give their
view when an NPS was being constructed with site-specific locations
contained therein. He pointed in the direction of clause 7(5), which
talks about the Secretary of State ensuring that appropriate steps are
taken to publicise the proposal. That comes back to the point that I
was trying to make in my earlier remarks about a bit of publicity that
will reach perhaps one group of people who are quite often engaged with
these sorts of things.
</div>
					<a name="08011785000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could be talking
about a very significant development that will affect an area for many
years to come. If it is a facility that has a lifespan to it, once it
is established we may well find that in 50 years&#146; time when it
comes to be replaced there will already be a brownfield site. We could
be talking about sites that will have some form of facility on them
virtually in perpetuity. To say that the Secretary of State will
publicise this, is not good
enough.</div>

							<a name="08011785000625"></a>Dan

						</b> I have looked at those subsections because the
Minister mentioned them. I can see how he might feel that they would be
sufficient, but I am keen to see something in the Bill that says that
there will be significant local consultation in any such area that has
been identified, and that the resources to carry that out would come
from the centre and would not fall as a burden on local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08011785000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
back to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)
said when the White Paper was introduced, the key question when our
party was considering the IPC was whether it would be able to say no.
Notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s statement that in certain
circumstances it might well say no, there is no great confidence across
the country that once something is in an NPS and set in tablets of
stone, and has gone through scrutiny in this place and elsewhere, the
IPC will be able to overturn it on a few technicalities. The most
important part of the process for such a locality will be at the
NPS-setting stage. It is therefore my intention to press the new clause
to a vote. I thank the Minister for his comments, but I am not
convinced that what is in the Bill at the moment is good
enough.</div>

						</b> Let us wait and see. I have a
great deal of sympathy and it is highly possible that he will have a
great deal of sympathy with our three amendments and we could come to
an arrangement. Because we were conscious of the difficulties that
could arise from site 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>specificity and the implication that a site-specific national planning
policy would give to sites, we tabled what I thought were three fairly
innocuous-looking amendments to tease out a worthwhile and necessary
debate. I certainly did not expect the complications and implications
that have emerged in our discussions.</div>
					<a name="08011785000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the Minister for being so clear, open and candid, but I am even more
confused than when we started. Apart from anything else, and while
wishing to stay in order, we have a wonderful view of the IPC being
able to refuse or to make very difficult a planning application for
something in the national policy statement that has been agreed by the
House and through general consultation. Those on the IPC would not only
then be taking on Parliament, but the Secretary of State and the
Department to which they are responsible for both their employment and
their pay and rations. It would be a brave commissioner who would do
so, particularly as, under paragraph 4(2)(c) of schedule
1:</div>
					<a name="08011785000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may remove a person from office as the chair, or as
a deputy or other Commissioner, if the Secretary of State is satisfied
that...the person is otherwise unfit to perform the duties of the
office.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would imagine
that many Secretaries of State might throw a real wobbly and decide

							<a name="08011785000649"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> We have had a good discussion on
the clause, but one thing that always concerns me, as someone who was
scarred by the experience of the Child Support Agency, is that the
minute a policy is agreed on in the House, one looks immediately for
the difficulties that will emerge. We have gone through a number of
those that we have foreseen, but I still think that the clause,
although it is acceptable in principle, has some problems that we will
need to tease out still
further.</div>
					<a name="08011785000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have tried
by amendment to clarify and tighten up a number of the issues involved
in the production of these statements, because we have grave concerns
about the detail and practice, which we will undoubtedly come back to
in debates about subsequent clauses.</div>
					<a name="08011785000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain concerned about the
sheer number of these national policy statements that we could be faced
with. It is not just we in Parliament who could be faced with them but,
of course, the British public, because, as the hon. Member for North
Cornwall made clear, we should not just consult the usual suspects
about these national policy statements. We must ensure that we engage
with a much wider public. It is highly possible, indeed likely, that,
because Parliament will be involved in the scrutiny in whatever form
that takes, there will be a greater interest than there would normally
be when the Department consults. Certainly, if there are site-specific
policy statements, I would expect a huge level of interest,
particularly if people feel that their peace of mind and their
environment are going to be disturbed.</div>
					<a name="08011785000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we could face a
situation, as I have already said, of parliamentary constipation as we
try to get these national policy statements through the House so that
everybody knows the direction in which they are going, including the
developers and the communities in which these developments will be
sited. </div>
					<a name="08011785000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister give us some idea of the number of policy statements that he
expects? For instance, yesterday I heard that we were going to have one
on fossil fuels, one on nuclear energy and one on renewables; that is
three statements from just one Department on one subject. We could go
on for ever with these statements. How many will we have on transport?
Will there be statements on ports and ancillary roads, roads, rail and
air? We could go on for ever. If the Minister can give me a total, I
will be happy.

get another angle that implies another national policy statement. I am
sure that the Minister wishes and hopes that he will only have to deal
with a dozen. Even if there are only a dozen national policy
statements, getting the British public and Parliament to deal with them
will cause huge congestion in the consultation system, however it is
developed. That is before we get into any other areas of continuous
review.</div>

currently believe that they will be under the Bill. Although I support

what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee said about

central to the proposed new system. They will set the strategic policy

						</b> We are moving on to some of the more arcane detail
of bringing national policy statements into being. The clause deals
with the review of the statements. The amendments would ensure that
once a national policy statement is in place, it is fit for purpose
whenever a new planning application emerges. Subsection 6(1) bothers me
because it
states:</div>
					<a name="08011785000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must review each national policy statement whenever
the Secretary of State thinks it appropriate to do
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to
hearing what the Minister has to say about this. The problem is
that</div>
					<a name="08011785000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whenever...appropriate
to do so&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">could be, and
is likely to be, a reaction to a planning application. Any review
process will, of necessity, take time. A continuous review and an
annual report, which we are proposing, would allow the NPS to be always
up to date.</div>
					<a name="08011785000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, I should not like the Minister to think that we expect
legions of civil servants to sit and read national policy statements
and all the technical papers and advice involved in major
infrastructure projects on a daily basis, but there ought to be a
mechanism whereby technical literature and developments are under
continuous review. That way, as soon as there is a new development that
could have a bearing on an NPS, it would be flagged up to the Secretary
of State and the review could begin at that stage rather than
later.</div>

							<a name="08011785000657"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I am listening to the hon. Lady and agree about the
wording of the clause. I must say that the drafting is rather
strange&#151;I have not seen anything quite as strange as this for
some time. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I read <i class="I">Private Eye </i>and various
other things.</div>
					<a name="08011785000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

Secretary of State must review each national policy statement whenever
the Secretary of State thinks it appropriate to do
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
always being told about words that are otiose. Surely the clause should
state that the Secretary of State must review each NPS
&#147;periodically or from time to
time&#148;.</div>

some years ago. Perhaps I should read it more
often.</div>
					<a name="08011785000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with including a reference to a time scale as opposed to the process
being continuous is that we never know when a technological development
may emerge. If &#147;from time to time&#148; is defined as, say,
once a year, given the technological fervour in areas such as waste
disposal, that review may come after the technological development and
the desire for an infrastructure contractor to build a new
facility.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>
					<a name="08011785000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example&#151;it may not be
entirely appropriate, but because it is current it comes immediately to
mind&#151;E.ON has made a planning application for a carbon capture,
coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth as a response to a Treasury
competition to design carbon capture facilities. Good on the Treasury
for encouraging that research; I do not have any problem with it as
long as it does not cost us any money&#151;I put that in before I am
accused of committing us to vast expenditure.</div>
					<a name="08011785000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is highly possible that a
company would wish to make a planning application for a carbon capture
power station but the NPS is not sufficiently up to date to allow the
IPC to give it planning permission. That is why I have a problem with
specifying a time scale and why I think that these matters should be
kept under continuous review.</div>
					<a name="08011785000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I do not suggest
that we have a whole section, either in the Department for Communities
and Local Government or anywhere else, reviewing the literature; it is
not that difficult these days, especially with the internet. We all
want clean technologies, sustainable development and better
infrastructure, but in order to get innovative new ideas tried, tested
and out into the public domain, it is better to keep things under
continuous review. That is preferable to the Secretary of State
suddenly waking up one Tuesday morning before coming in for questions
and saying, &#147;Wouldn&#146;t it be a good idea to look at the
NPS for waste?&#148; That is not a sufficiently robust system, but it
is what will pertain under clause 6(1) as drafted. Heaven knows, in a
couple of years we will have a new Secretary of State. With the best
will in the world, reviewing NPS will not be at the forefront of any
Secretary of State&#146;s mind as he or she tries to deal with the
mess that is left by this Government. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>We are
worrying about it and believe me, we need to worry.</div>
					<a name="08011785000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is somebody in the
Department whose remit it is to keep an eye on technological and other
developments in these sectors, they can be flagged up continuously and
that will allow the market to develop for the infrastructure projects
that we want.</div>

that would not be a cause for concern within the Department, but it
might be a concern in the House. However, I will not go over the hon.
Lady&#146;s argument as we seem to be making
progress.</div>
					<a name="08011785000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
concern about NPSs being reviewed continuously. If an NPS is to mean
something to people, they have to know that it is in place for a
certain period. Amendment No. 73 suggests that they should be reviewed
annually. That might be too short a period. However, if they are
continuously being reviewed, that could call into question the whole
purpose of having them because it could affect people&#146;s
confidence that they can submit an application in line with an
NPS.</div>

Rogerson:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for that point of
clarification. My feeling was that we should put a time limit on the
NPS and my suggestion was to review it annually. Amendment No. 73 is a
probing
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011785000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 74 is on the related issue of an NPS being suspended. If something
comes to light, as is set out in clause 10, which leads the Secretary
of State to feel that an NPS should be suspended, it is not a trifling
matter. There might be applications in the pipeline on which a great
deal of expense and community anticipation are hanging. As the rest of
the Bill seems to be quite fond of a period of 28 days for everybody
else to conform to, I thought that the Secretary of State should have
to answer after 28 days as to why a suspension remains in place. It
might be slightly mischievous of me, but I felt that it would be useful
for the Minister to clarify in what circumstances he envisages an NPS
being suspended, how rare that might be and how soon it would be back
in place or an amended NPS brought to the House for consideration. This
issue is important because crucial applications could be before the IPC
in that
time.</div>

						</b> I support amendment No. 185. I also want to echo
the point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. We
learned our law within 25 miles of each other and I share his
bemusement at the
expression</div>

Secretary of State thinks it appropriate to do

					<a name="08011785000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that what is intended in the clause is probably very similar to what my
hon. Friend intends in the amendment&#151;in other words, the NPS
should not be regarded as being cast in tablets of stone, but as being
capable of development. The point is that things move forwards,
especially technology. I am concerned that if statements are not kept
under review, an application for development could be rejected because
of a national policy statement that was developed on the basis of an
old technology and does not accommodate the new
technology.</div>
					<a name="08011785000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was not
so long ago that the Government regarded nuclear power as an
unattractive and unpalatable option. Now it is regarded as the solution
to all our electricity generation problems. If the statement that it is
an unpalatable option had been in the form of an NPS, it would not have
been possible for a new developer to come forward with an application
for a new nuclear power station, notwithstanding the fact that nuclear
technology and nuclear waste disposal technology have moved on apace in
recent years.</div>
					<a name="08011785000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">What the

Lady&#146;s proposition is practical, but am sure that it is not
sensible. The central question is why review when a review is not
necessary. Surely, the time to review a national policy statement is
when the relevant circumstances have changed, rather than to be
required somehow to do so continually or when circumstances have not
changed. As she rightly pointed out in her example, one circumstance
that might allow for a review would be a significant development of
technology.</div>

					<a name="08011785000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">A development
of science might be another example. For instance, if better science
and analysis demonstrated that the environmental effects of a
particular type of renewable technology were not as good as had been
thought, that might change the substance and circumstances of an
element of the national policy statement and suggest the need for
review. To simply review for review&#146;s sake or when there has
been no significant change in circumstances is not a practical or
sensible
proposition.</div>

						</b> At the risk of getting into Sir Humphrey
territory of reviewing reviews and announcing the review of the review,
how will we know that a review is necessary unless a review has taken
place? The Minister said that we will not conduct a review unless
circumstances have changed. How will the Secretary of State be aware
when significant circumstances have changed without having some sort of
eye on what is happening in the sector and with
applications?</div>

whether circumstances have changed to the extent that a review is

						</b> Is not the problem with the subsection as drafted,
however, that it is a strange mix of the mandatory and the
discretionary? There is a positive duty on the Secretary of State to
review national policy, but only when he feels that his state of
digestion impels him to think about it. Frankly, ought not it to be
mandatory all the way through? Currently, we have this strange
compulsion, but only when the Secretary of State feels it necessary.
Surely, it should be a question of periodic review. There need not
necessarily be continuous reviews, but there certainly should be
something that an aggrieved person can latch on to so that they can
say, &#147;Well, you should have reviewed it at that particular point
but did
not.&#148;</div>

review periodically when there is nothing to review? In the end,
someone will have to make a judgment about initiating that review
process. The national policy statements are produced as the
responsibility of the Secretary of State, and it is appropriate that
that responsibility and initiative lies with the Secretary of State. It
is also appropriate for this House to take a view if the Secretary of
State seems reluctant to have a review when there appears to be a
change of circumstances that would warrant it. Any interested party
could latch on, to use the hon. Gentleman&#146;s words again, through
the rights under clause 12 to impel or challenge precisely that

					<a name="08011785000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">English is a
glorious and flexible language, and I do not have any problem with it
becoming the international language. However, it is because of its very
flexibility that I suspect we are using the word &#147;review&#148;
in two distinct senses. I am using the word in the sense of keeping up
to date&#151;keeping a review of the technological and scientific
literature. I suspect, if I may put words into the Minister&#146;s
mouth, that he is using the word in the more formal sense of setting
out on a review of the NPS, with all the consultation that is
required.</div>
					<a name="08011785000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are

						</b> I think that the hon. Lady is being half-helpful.
Let me start with the good news. On the positive side, having spent
five years in the Treasury, we did, indeed, use the word
&#147;review&#148; often in the sense that she is suggesting. We,
as a Government, keep all taxation policy constantly under review,
which I think is the meaning that she intends. Clearly, in the context
of the Bill and of potential revisions to national policy statements
that have gone through the sort of formal process that we discussed
under the previous clause, &#147;review&#148; has a different
import.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>
					<a name="08011785000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that distinction, the hon.
Lady must accept that it does not make sense to have a continual, or
even a periodic, process of review. It makes sense to have a review
when the circumstances that would suggest that it is necessary have
changed. I do not think that it is necessary to try somehow to write
into primary legislation an expectation or obligation that a Secretary
of State would keep a close eye on all developments relevant to his or
her policy area, including on national policy statements. It is part
and parcel of the job that we do as Ministers, but, ultimately, as I
have said, if a Secretary of State is failing to do that and is
failing, therefore, to have the sort of formal review&#151;let us
call it that, although it is not the technical term used
here&#151;that either an interested party or Parliament might think
the Secretary of State should have, there is scope to challenge that,
and it would be appropriate to do
so.</div>

opened to a review if it was not necessary. Quite the

However, the purpose of clause 12&#151;let us say linked to clause 6,
just to remain in order here&#151;is to give an explicit right and

discharging his or her duties under this Bill, whether that is to do
with the production of a national policy statement, or a review, or a
failure to review when circumstances warrant it.</div>

						</b> We thought that we would use our substitution,

use the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham to get in a
football joke while she is gone.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>
					<a name="08011785000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to assure you,
Mr. Illsley, that although the number of amendments is
almost as great as the number of goals that West Ham would normally
expect to score in the course of a season&#151;self-deprecation is,
of course, very important&#151;those amendments largely hang together
and the concepts behind them are fairly straightforward, so I will not
need to be terribly long.</div>
					<a name="08011785000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">This group of
amendments is about strengthening the consultation and publicity
elements of the Bill. It follows on in large measure from some of the
evidence that we heard from a range of witnesses during the oral
evidence sessions. I hope that the Minister will accept that the
amendments are designed to strengthen and improve the Bill; they are
not designed to be
obstructive.</div>
					<a name="08011785000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
back to our starting point in relation to the national policy
statements, the underlying rationale of the amendments is that, because
of the importance of the statements and their potential impact not only
on the general public good but on individual communities and
individuals, it is crucial that certain minimum standards of publicity
and consultation should be set out in the Bill. In our view, not only
is that morally right but it is politically right. For reasons that we
gave in earlier debates, that would make it more likely that they will
command public acceptance and legitimacy. It is also practically right,
because it would make it less likely that there will be the types of
legal challenge that cause delay. Frankly, it would also strengthen the
position of the Government and the commission if they were faced with
such legal challenges.</div>
					<a name="08011785000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be in
everybody&#146;s interests, frankly, to strengthen the Bill. Although
the current clause makes some provision for such publicity and
consultation through regulation, it is better to strengthen what is set
out on the face of the Bill. It still leaves flexibility, but we want
to strengthen
it.</div>
				
					<a name="08011785000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="08011785000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 186 deals with a point that I raised with some
witnesses and which other witnesses volunteered during evidence, namely
the Aarhus convention on access to information, public participation in
decision making and access to justice in environmental matters. The
Government accept this as a benchmark that should be achieved as a
matter of good practice. It relates to the potential for any legal
challenge involving European and human rights issues and it seems to us
that it is good and right to incorporate this.</div>
					<a name="08011785000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would insert a
new clause to provide for early public participation, when all the
options are open and effective, and a fair and transparent framework.
That may sound a little like motherhood and apple pie, but it is in the
convention to which the Government signed up. We have lifted the text
from articles 6.4 and 7 of the convention, so we cannot see how the
Government should have any difficulty with the amendment as it is
something to which they, as a matter of policy, adhere. Putting it in
the Bill should proof it against potential challenge and would also
make realistic the commitment to participation and an acceptance too
that we take the environmental impacts of these important
infrastructure projects seriously when looking at the
balance.</div>
					<a name="08011785000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remaining
amendments can almost be taken as a package.
Amendment No. 187 seeks to lay down certain minimum consultation
periods and so it broadens the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>areas within the subsection to which application is required. We then
set out minimum standards in relation to a consultation period of not
less than 12 weeks. We do not think that is at all unreasonable in the
circumstances. Secondly we set a minimum level of publicity. None of
this is difficult or onerous. It is the sort of formulation that is
well known and accepted in planning law and planning practice. It will
not create vast expense but it is the sort of thing that is accessible
to individuals and local communities who may be affected by the Bill.
In the overall scheme of things it would not create any massive delay,
but would give people a decent chance to be aware of what it is and get
their tackle in order if they want to make
representations.</div>
					<a name="08011785000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 189 would provide that the main environmental agencies and the
devolved Executives are consulted specifically on national policy
statements. The Environment Agency in its written submission and
evidence was concerned that it should be in the loop. It seems only
right, too, that bodies such as the Historic Buildings and Monuments
Commission and the Local Government Association should be involved.
Partnership and close working with local government is something that
the Government often stress as being important. If such applications
are to go smoothly, it is far better to have them involved at the
earlier stage and to give them the assurance that they will be
involved. It is not just a question of good intentions and practice;
they would have the comfort of knowing that they have the right to be
involved. I suspect that that reduces the risk of challenge. In (4A)
and (4B) it is proposed that we make the parallel arrangements for the
devolved Administrations, whose rights ought equally to be
respected.</div>
					<a name="08011785000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister is in a receptive mood, amendment No. 245, which should
perhaps refer to (4D) and (4E) rather than (4A) and
(4B), would give the public a minimum period in which to make
representations. Thirteen weeks is not unreasonable because, sometimes,
national policy statements will involve complex issues both of law and
fact. Thirteen weeks is not an unreasonable period for people to be
able to make meaningful representations. In the overall scheme of
things, it would not create massive delays. Better 13 weeks for the
public to get their act together than the length of time it takes for a
judicial review on the basis that there was inadequate consultation to
begin with.</div>
					<a name="08011785000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would stress the importance of the environmental report and
the appropriate impacts directive, and would take account of the
importance of the environmental assessment of plans and programmes
directive and, when appropriate, the habitats directive. The Government
sign up to and endorse those directives, so we are simply asking them
to adopt what they regard as good practice and policy. It would not be
terribly onerous for them to take the measures on board.</div>
					<a name="08011785000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 190, we come
back to the Minister&#146;s point that there will be certain
instances in which national policy statements will be location-specific
or, at least, they will create a shortlist of locations. The amendment
would apply the same logic and established techniques that I mentioned
to ensure that there are advertisements at a local level, and that
local publicity is meaningful rather than rarefied at a national
level.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>
					<a name="08011785000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 191 is connected
to amendment No. 190, but it stresses the importance of consulting not
only national local authorities and the devolved bodies, but the local
authorities that would be directly affected by such cases. If there are
only three or four locations for, say, an airport, port or power
station, it is surely right and sensible to entrench the rights of the
local authorities affected to be consulted.</div>
					<a name="08011785000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 246 would make
explicit measures that seem to be in the Bill on the scope to modify
proposals after consultation. There ought to be that scope. I am sure
that the Minister will want to take on board and amend proposals when
sensible and cogent points are made by consultees, and the amendment
would give him the opportunity to do so.</div>
					<a name="08011785000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 247 states what
most people would, I hope, regard as good practice. Certainly, the
measure would be consistent with the approach generally adopted in
judicial or quasi-judicial matters, which is to say that it would give
the people involved a right to a reasoned decision. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08011785000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State shall give reasons for designating a statement as a
national policy
statement&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">if people have
exercised their right to make representations to the contrary. When the
Secretary of State makes a decision, as is his or her right, it seems
only just and fair that they give a reasoned decision as to why. The
measure would not be onerous or complicated, but it follows from the
good practice that one expects, and which is increasingly enshrined in
both domestic and European law.</div>
					<a name="08011785000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hope that the Committee does
not see the amendments as obstructive; rather, we are seeking to
improve the Bill. I hope that they find favour with the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08011785000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000691"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> We are discussing this group of
amendments slightly later than I had anticipated, so I shall be yet
more brief than I originally intended. I shall speak to amendments Nos.
90 to 95.</div>
					<a name="08011785000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that I shall not tempt my hon. Friend the Minister down the road of
amendment No. 94, which suggests that the Secretary of State might
publish options that were &#147;seriously entertained&#148; as well
as the final view that he or she arrives at on any statements and
revisions. I am sure that if my hon. Friend went that far, he would
have every Secretary of State in the Cabinet and several civil servants
sticking pins in his image because of what they had to give away from
discussions held before they reached their final decisions.</div>
					<a name="08011785000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to probe the Minister a
little particularly on amendments Nos. 90 to 92, which deal with
subsection (2). Precisely what do the words mean? Subsection (2)
states:</div>
					<a name="08011785000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must carry out such consultation, and arrange for
such publicity, as the Secretary of State thinks
appropriate&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011785000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is that
different from what I suggest in my amendments, which would have
subsection (2) simply say that the Secretary of State must carry out
consultation and
publicity?</div>
					<a name="08011785000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does
the subsection state:</div>
					<a name="08011785000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as the Secretary of State thinks
appropriate&#148;?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>
					<a name="08011785000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the words are irrelevant and
otiose, and need not be in the clause, because the Secretary of State
will carry out the consultation and arrange for the publicity that
people will generally consider to be reasonable and appropriate. I
accept that we cannot prescribe in detail every situation, or the
details of the publicity and consultation that will be appropriate to
every policy
statement.</div>
					<a name="08011785000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">What do the
words</div>
					<a name="08011785000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as the Secretary
of State thinks
appropriate&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011785000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">actually
mean? Are they significant? Do they mean anything in practice? If they
do not, why are they there? If they do, is it possible to conceive of a
situation in which the Secretary of State might think that no publicity
and no consultation were appropriate? Technically, that would be an
entirely logical reading of that form of words. I presume that we will
get the Minister to say that that is not what is intended. If it is not
what is intended, why do the words make it a logical
possibility?</div>
					<a name="08011785000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
the argument that because one cannot be absolutely prescriptive in an
Act of Parliament about the nature of consultation and publicity for
every situation. In the end there may have to be a test of what is
reasonable in the courts or through a judicial review. But, again,
thinking ahead to that potential test, if the subsection had my
wording, which simply says that there should be consultation and
publicity, the test would be whether the consultation and publicity
were such that the venerated man on the Clapham omnibus&#151;I
suppose that these days it could be a woman&#151;would think it
reasonable in the
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08011785000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as the subsection is worded now, that would not be the test that would
be put to a judicial review. The test would be whether the Secretary of
State has been reasonable in coming to the view that he or she thinks
is appropriate, which is different. It is not whether the man in the
street thinks that something is reasonable but whether the Secretary of
State has come to a reasonable decision about what he thinks is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08011785000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
trying to tease out the difference in that regard, and whether there is
something slightly sinister behind the restrictive nature of what the
consultation might be and what the Secretary of State might think,
which might be totally different from what outside groups that expect
to be consulted might think, or whether the subsection is, in fact,
almost irrelevant&#151;that is, it is a nice form of words and we can
discount their meaning because we can presume that Secretaries of State

Rogerson:
						</b> I have tabled two amendments in this group. One
is on a significant matter, and one is just to make a point that was
made to me by somebody who had looked at the Bill. Amendment No. 55
concerns publicising the consultation in formats accessible to people
with disabilities. It seeks to ensure that the consultation is in an
appropriate form for everybody. I am sure that the Minister will say
that that is Government practice anyway, and that we are very good at
doing it, but the fact that organisations that represent people with
disabilities suggested the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>amendment would tend to indicate that they do not feel that that is
necessarily always the case. I hope that the Minister will bear that in
mind when considering this group of
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011785000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 160, which may seem rather specific, refers to two local papers.
The matter was raised with me by someone else who looked at the Bill.
Of two local papers in an area, one might have a much higher
circulation than the other, and it may be possible to meet the
provisions of the Bill by advertising in the paper that is not as
widely read as the other one. That is the issue that was raised with
me. It is a relatively minor point, but it is important to make it
because it is essential to ensure that consultation documents and
advertising reach all members of the community and amendment No. 55 may
be helpful in that respect.</div>
					<a name="08011785000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members who have
already spoken to their amendments raised some important matters and
made some very good points and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response to them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000693"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I speak briefly in support of amendment No. 189,
which would include in the Bill a list of statutory consultees, and
especially to subsection (4)(c), which relates to the National Assembly
for Wales.</div>
					<a name="08011785000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is particularly important because in the fullness of time the
Committee will consider new clauses containing framework powers in
favour of the Welsh Assembly, which will empower it to make primary
legislation in connection with the Wales spatial plan and local
development plans in Wales.</div>
					<a name="08011785000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">If those clauses are enacted,
the Welsh Assembly will obtain primary legislative competence in
respect of a large and important area of planning law in Wales and it
is therefore likely that planning law in Wales will start to diverge
significantly from that in
England.</div>
					<a name="08011785000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are
talking about national planning statements it is essential that the
need to consult the Welsh Assembly Government is stated in the Bill,
especially with regard to the developments in Wales in terms of primary
legislation..</div>
					<a name="08011785000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000694"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Most, if not all, of the amendments are reasonable
and have led to an interesting debate. Like the hon. Gentleman, I will
speak briefly to amendment No. 189 and the need to consult the Welsh
Assembly Government, the Environment Agency, the Countryside Council
for Wales and the Welsh Local Government Association when a national
policy statement relates in whole or in part to
Wales.</div>
					<a name="08011785000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the
Minister will say in response that the Environment Minister from the
Welsh Assembly Government would be party to the whole thing in any
event, but it would be as well to have it in the Bill and to have a
statement from the Minister to that effect, including references to the
other statutory consultees, as it is an important
matter.</div>
					<a name="0801183000001"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000695"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> If there is anything sinister in
the difference in the wording, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Attercliffe suggested, I am unaware of it and it is
completely unintended.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>
					<a name="08011785000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal was framed to make
it clear that responsibility for complicity and consultation about the
decisions and developments of the national policy statements rests with
the Secretary of State. I can assure my hon. Friend that in discharging
those duties the Secretary of State would act reasonably. If he did not
do so, he could be challenged.</div>
					<a name="08011785000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Bromley
and Chislehurst and for Beckenham mentioned the Aarhus convention
several times and I am glad to note the context in which we are
returning to that matter. Essentially, the UK has ratified that
convention and we are obliged to ensure that our domestic legislation
is consistent with it. Public involvement at the three important stages
of the Bill&#151;the production of national policy statements, the
pre-application hearings and the hearing of applications&#151;ensures
that that is the case in these provisions and the effect of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments would be
negligible.</div>

							<a name="08011785000696"></a>Robert

point?</div>

							<a name="08011785000698"></a>Robert

						</b> Is the Minister saying that it is the
Government&#146;s intention that any regulations that prescribe the
forms of consultation will ensure that the consultation is fully
compliant with the Aarhus
convention?</div>
				
					<a name="08011785000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000699"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> Giving people an early and effective opportunity
to have their say is at the heart of the Aarhus convention. We will
ensure that that
happens.</div>
					<a name="08011785000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
emphasised, we have a strong commitment&#151;this is a shared
interest with Opposition Members&#151;that proper information and
consultation will underpin the production of any national policy
statement. However, in response to a number of amendments, I do not
think that it is appropriate to set out detailed procedures and
processes in the Bill for the production of information and publicity
or for consultation. That is not least because the accepted standards
for good information and consultation
vary.</div>
					<a name="08011785000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
consultations often centre on the code of practice on consultation. I
did not know this before this afternoon, but last year we had a
consultation on the consultation code and on whether that guidance
should be revised. As a result of that consultation, we propose to
revise the guidance on consultation in order to ensure that all sorts
of people can be consulted effectively and kept properly
informed.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000701"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> No, it is worse than that&#151;I am not reading
from brief.</div>
					<a name="08011785000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
expect any consultation on national policy statements to reflect that
revised guidance, but it is not available at the moment. I make that
point to underline the view that it is not sensible to specify that
sort of detail in primary legislation because it becomes
rigid,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>inflexible and difficult to change. Such detail might not be appropriate
for every type of national policy statement because they will vary from
type to type.</div>
					<a name="08011785000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
concern that the hon. Member for North Cornwall raised with amendment
No. 55, in the spirit of what I have just said and in the spirit of the
code on consultation, it is important that all parts of the public and
all communities are consulted properly on proposals for national policy
statements that might affect them. Certain disabled people have
particular requirements. Those are met through the disability
discrimination legislation and the development of national policy
statements will be subject to the terms and the imperatives of that
legislation. Therefore, it is not necessary to incorporate such
measures in the Bill. Where it is necessary to publicise the proposals
of national policy statements locally, we have determined that it will
be thorough and effective. We will consider the needs of disabled
people in that process. Given that reassurance, I hope that he will not
seek to press his amendment to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="08011785000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I sit
down, I wish to double back and deal with the point made by the hon.
Members for Clwyd, West and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy about statutory
consultees. There is provision to specify statutory consultees. I
suggest to both hon. Members that identifying particular statutory
consultees in the Bill is not the best way to do it. However, I can
reassure them that we intend to include the Ministers in Scotland,
Northern Ireland and Wales as statutory consultees on national policy
statements that extend to their respective areas. Beyond that, we will
specify the statutory consultees through regulation. We have the
provision in the Bill to do that and will consult widely on who should
be statutory consultees.</div>
					<a name="08011785000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again, certain parties
might be appropriate and rightful consultees for certain national
policy statements and others might properly be consultees for all
national policy statements. That will vary and is not an appropriate
matter to be specified in the Bill. I hope that I have been able to
give Members sufficient reassurance and clarity and that they will
therefore not press their amendments to a vote and let clause 7 stand
part of the
Bill.</div>

Neill:
						</b> The scheme proposed is fairly straightforward. We
seek to extend the time period for bringing a claim by way of judicial
review from six to 12 weeks. I touched on some of the reasons involved
in relation to the earlier amendments on publicity, but it is perhaps
just as cogent here.</div>
					<a name="08011785000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The factual and legal issues
for those instigating a judicial review are likely to be complex. The
scale of what is involved is likely to be substantial. In terms of
fairness and a sort of equality of arms argument, a period of 12 rather
than six weeks is appropriate, just and proportionate and likely to be
advantageous at the end of the day in making sure that further
complaint is less justifiable. We hope that the Minister will look on
that with favour. A 12-week period for something as important as
national policy statements on nuclear power, airports and so on does
not seem at all unreasonable. It is not likely to create a significant
delay in the overall scheme of things with major capital projects of
that kind.</div>
					<a name="08011785000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
what that this set of amendments seeks to do. The
first is amendment No. 195, but its provisions are
replicated throughout the group. Amendment No. 248, which again is
largely replicated elsewhere, deals with the simple point that the time
for bringing a challenge should run from the date of publication of the
Secretary of State&#146;s decision rather than from the date that it
is signed or takes effect. It is a simple reality that sometimes there
is a delay between an Executive decision and publication. The amendment
provides protection for the individual or the group, because they will
not know about the decision until it is published. There have been
complaints in other contexts where there is a delay in publication of a
decision. I am sure that that is not what is intended here, but things
sometimes go awry.</div>
					<a name="08011785000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would ensure
that those who have to consider whether to bring a challenge have 12
weeks from the time that they first knew about the decision. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>That seems only just and there are consequential amendments on that.
Amendment No. 249 makes equivalent changes so that the clause would
read:</div>
					<a name="08011785000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Secretary of
State&#146;s compliance...is published&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011785000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Publication triggers the knowledge to
enable people to consider whether they want to bring a review or
not.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000723"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I support the amendments. They are reasonable. They
add to the clause as it stands. As the hon. Gentleman said, six weeks
is not a great deal of time when there could be a week&#146;s time
lag between the decision and publication. When consulting planners
and/or lawyers and then taking specialist counsel&#146;s opinion, six
weeks is no time at all. It is much shorter than the usual time limit
on a judicial review. The hon. Gentleman put his case very
strongly.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000724"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but it
is not just the legal profession that could take time. He comes from a
rural constituency and I can imagine that in the middle of a busy time
for farmers, it would be exceedingly difficult to get an argument
together in six weeks.</div>

							<a name="08011785000725"></a>Mr.

the
way&#151;</div>

afternoon. I understand entirely what the hon. Gentleman is saying. In
many cases farmers measure time by seasons rather than by weeks. I
quite understand what he was
saying.</div>

							<a name="08011785000729"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> That probably takes the edge off what I just said.
There is no need to add much more. The case has been very strongly made
by the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. It would be reasonable
to extend the time, not so that people can spin matters out&#151;part
of the raison d&#146;être of the Bill is to speed matters up,
properly and reasonably&#151;but because imposing a six-week limit
would be entirely unreasonable and against the spirit of the
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000730"></a>Dan
Rogerson:
						</b> I shall not press amendment No. 75 to a
Division. The hon. Gentleman made a strong argument for the amendments
he tabled, and I believe that they would improve the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011785000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000731"></a>John
Healey:
						</b> It is indeed the case that the usual rule in
judicial reviews is that claims must be filed promptly and, in any
event, not later than three months after the grounds on which they are
being made first arose. However, under the Town and Country Planning
Act 1990, a six-week period for commencing proceedings applies to
statutory challenges to local development plans. In many ways, the
production of national policy statements is comparable to local
development plans for the purposes of the
provision.</div>
					<a name="08011785000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
overall process of obtaining development consent for nationally
significant infrastructure projects can be very long. The hon. Member
for Meirionnydd Nant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>Conwy rightly said that part of the rightful purpose of the Bill is to
speed that process up. It is in the national interest that any legal
challenges are filed promptly and without delay. The final form of a
national policy statement will come after extensive public consultation
and is likely to have been subject to extensive public and
parliamentary scrutiny, which will help to pick up potential defects so
that they may be corrected. Usually, there will be little or no need
for courts to get involved at the end of the process; at least, there
ought to be little or no
need.</div>
					<a name="08011785000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also no
need for the Bill to set out the period in which a
judicial review can be brought or to include a date by which to publish
the Secretary of State&#146;s activity in relation to that. National
policy statements will be drawn up and designated through the clear and
open process that we debated this morning and afternoon. Throughout,
and at each stage of the process, there will be considerable reference
to interested parties, so actions on behalf of or by the Secretary of
State that could result in legal challenge will therefore be obvious to
those interested parties at a much earlier stage, not just at the time
of publication.</div>
					<a name="08011785000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I hope that hon. Members will not feel it necessary to
press the amendments to a Division, and that clause 12 stands part of
the Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011785000732"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am a little disappointed by the
Minister&#146;s response. I hope that he is right about the
transparency of the arrangements, but I am particularly disappointed
about the time limit period, because we do not believe that the
comparison with local development frameworks is valid given the size
and complexities of the issues that we are dealing with. They are chalk
and cheese&#151;and the size and complexity of the issues is the
difference. This is much more like those other substantial issues that
are sometimes dealt with by judicial review. The idea that taking a
further six weeks to consider where to build a power station, port or
airport will make a significant difference to the national interest
does not stack up. I am sorry that the Government are rigid on
amendment No. 195, because it was designed to help rather than hinder.
I shall therefore press it to a Division.</div>
