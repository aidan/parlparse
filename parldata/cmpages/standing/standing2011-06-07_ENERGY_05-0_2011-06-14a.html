                  </strong> I will be brief, because there are some meaty
amendments to be dealt with today. The intention in amendments 128 to
130 and in amendment (a) to Government amendment 66 is to tackle the
poor energy efficiency performance of service family accommodation.
Amendment 128 would amend the definition of domestic private rented
property to include service family accommodation. It would clarify that
any future regulation of the energy efficiency of domestic private
rented properties must include SFA properties, of which there are about
50,000 in the country. Amendments 129 and 130 would designate service
family accommodation as a type of property needing to benefit from
energy company 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 174<a class="bkMark" name="Column174">&#160;</a>
                  </div>obligation or ECO subsidies, potentially to complement the green deal,
given the hard-to-treat nature of SFA properties. Amendment (a) to
Government amendment 66 to clause 105 would amend the
definition of “residential accommodation” to include SFA
properties.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members will be aware of the issues relating to the condition of
service family accommodation. I have lobbied the Ministry of Defence to
refurbish armed forces accommodation in north Kingston, in my
constituency, and I am pleased to say that work is finally under
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">According
to a survey by the National Audit Office, almost one third of service
families describe the condition of their house as poor. Along with the
bathroom and the kitchen, energy efficiency was one of the three
biggest sources of complaints. Some 1,500 assessed SFA properties are
in the bottom two standards, out of four, for condition; 23,400
properties require solid wall insulation and 13,000 properties require
loft
insulation.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we ask servicemen and women to risk serious injury or death as a result
of their duty, the least we can do is accommodate them and their
families in warm homes. I recognise that the MOD already has a
long-term commitment—this is within a 20-year time
frame—to upgrade all its properties, and that SFA properties are
technically eligible to benefit from the green deal already, but I am
concerned about the scale of the ambition. In March, I wrote to my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, urging his
Department to be a first mover with respect to the green deal, given
the potential cost savings both to the SFA tenants and to the
departmental budget, but unfortunately I have yet to receive a
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
service personnel and their families pay their own utility costs, the
savings that would arise from improving the energy efficiency of their
properties would deliver real financial help. The amendments make it
plain that the MOD, acting in effect as a social landlord—it is
not a registered social landlord—must act. I very much hope that
my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board the amendments and
pursue the MOD as vigorously as is
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000028">&#160;</a>

permission, before I respond to the very important issues raised by my
hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park, I will briefly update the
Committee on progress on the commitments that I made last week. At the
suggestion of the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, I agreed to share
our working summary of the secondary legislation with the Committee. As

informal meeting has been arranged. In response to concerns raised in
Committee, I have instructed my officials to investigate the
strengthening of assessor impartiality in the Bill. I am happy to say
that we therefore intend to insert a statement in clause
3(4), so that the code of practice can make provision about the
impartiality of assessors, and I commit to doing that. I am still open
to having a meeting with interested members of the Committee, but I
hope that that will give sufficient reassurance to the hon. Members for
Wansbeck, for Hyndburn, and for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, and to my
hon. Friends the Members for Wells, for Stourbridge, and for
Winchester, all of whom voiced concerns on that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000033">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, inquired about her freedom of
information request. As I explained last week, I have asked all
contributors to contact the Energy Public Bill Committee directly, and
I understand that many have done so. The Clerk has agreed to compile a
list, so that the Committee can decide whether to view
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000034">&#160;</a>

my Department’s work with the Cabinet Office’s

its website in early July, and I will pass on the address as soon as I
receive
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000035">&#160;</a>

hon. Members for Brighton, Pavilion, and for Southampton, Test, pressed
me on the crucial issue of consent. As I explained last week, that
issue relates to property law and rests primarily with the Department
for Communities and Local Government. We will therefore work across
Departments, and I have written to my right hon. Friend the Minister
for Housing and Local Government to seek his agreement to the general
approach, and to raise the important issue of retaliatory evictions,
which we will move on to later. To assist us, I intend to set up a
stakeholder group to consider the issues in more detail and to report
back with its findings by the end of the
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000036">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
turn to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond
Park. I strongly support his intention to improve the energy efficiency
of MOD accommodation. On amendment (a) to amendment 66, I can confirm
that local authorities are already required to report on their action
to improve service family accommodation under the Home Energy
Conservation Act 1995, into which we are determined to breathe new
life. The definition of residential accommodation in the Act includes
service family
accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
128 would include service family accommodation in the definition of
domestic private rented property, but there are several reasons why we
might not want such homes to be caught by the private rented sector
policy. PRS regulations are targeted at commercial landlords who rent
their properties at market rates. In comparison, the Ministry of
Defence cannot be classed as a commercial landlord. It offers
subsidised housing and makes no profits from the properties.
Additionally, its accommodation is occupied under licence, as opposed
to under the tenancy agreements that form the basis of PRS properties,
which are caught by the PRS provisions under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
my hon. Friend is absolutely right: the houses need to be improved and,
in some cases, the solution will require far more extensive and costly
improvements than have been supported in previous programmes under
previous Governments. As a result and at my hon. Friend’s
urging, my officials have been discussing with the Ministry of Defence
how our energy efficiency policies might help, and I have asked them to
set up a joint working group to look specifically, as a matter of
urgency, into improving the energy efficiency of service family
accommodation. On the face of it, the type of measures required in the
properties, such as solid wall insulation, can be expected to be the
bread and butter of the new energy company obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000045">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The energy
companies will be actively looking to take an area-based approach,
tackling groups of properties of similar construction so that they can
achieve economies of scale. Ministry of Defence properties should be
highly suitable for such an approach, with the additional advantage of
having a common landlord. My officials will continue to engage with the
Ministry of Defence to examine whether any factors would work against
MOD housing benefiting under the green deal and ECO, and I am happy to
include my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park in that process. We
will consider whether there should be specific focus on those
properties under future implementing
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
assure my hon. Friend that powers already exist in the Bill to enable
us to target properties of a specified description. If a specific
regulatory focus on service family accommodation were needed, those
powers would allow us to introduce that specific focus without the need
for the changes proposed under amendments 129 and 130. I share his
concern to ensure that we do our very best for service family
accommodation, not only because we need to make sure that it is
included in the retrofit of United Kingdom housing stock to ensure that
we meet our climate change targets, but because our service families
deserve to live in warm, efficient and comfortable homes. With my
assurance that MOD properties will be improved under our new proposals,
I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his

                  </strong> I apologise. The amendments relate to the
definition of the private rented sector for the purpose of chapter 2.
Government amendment 133 seeks to clarify that low-cost home ownership
accommodation will be excluded from the definition of domestic private
rented property. Low-cost home ownership accommodation is designed to
allow people to buy part of a property and rent the remaining part.
Without the amendment, in many cases the tenancy agreement portion of
the arrangements would mean that such properties could be caught by the
regulations. However, from a policy perspective, this form of
accommodation should be excluded, because it is designed to support
home ownership rather than renting. It should therefore be treated in
the same way as owner-occupier property for the purposes of the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000054">&#160;</a>

logic that the Minister has just outlined—low-cost home

wording of Government amendment 133 could include any other

                  </strong> Further to the announcement made by the Secretary
of State on Second Reading, I am pleased to introduce this suite of
Government amendments, which seeks to introduce a minimum energy
efficiency standard in the domestic rented sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have
listened carefully to the parliamentary debate during the passage of
the Bill so far, and have taken the views of stakeholders, including
Friends of the Earth and the National Association of Citizens Advice
Bureaux, on board. People are concerned that requiring a review before
deciding whether to regulate the sector would create too much
uncertainty. Landlords would not be able to plan effectively for energy
efficiency work and regulation might not go ahead. We have responded to
those concerns with a measure to introduce a minimum energy efficiency
standard for domestic private rented property, which sends a clear
message that energy efficiency must improve. We are moving to a much
firmer legislative position.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
amendments 126 and 145, and with clauses 39 to 41 no longer standing
part of the Bill, our regulations will no longer be conditional on a
review, and the Secretary of State will have a duty make the
regulations. As a result, landlords will know what is required of them
and when, and tenants will be provided with 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 182<a class="bkMark" name="Column182">&#160;</a>
                  </div>assurance that cold, draughty rental properties will be a thing of the
past. New clauses 32 and 33 introduce provisions for a minimum standard
to come into force no later than 1 April 2018. That standard, which
will be set at band E, will ensure that approximately
682,000 homes will have to be
improved.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The prospect
of the minimum standard will give landlords a strong incentive to act
sooner. They will be able to make the required improvements over the
coming years and plan around their tenancy changes. In 2018, the
regulations will mop up those few remaining landlords who have yet to
change; inaction will not be a viable option. It is important for
Committee members to understand that 2018 is not the date on which we
expect the process to start, but the date on which the finish line
should be
crossed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000080">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman’s point is borne out by
a range of long-dated regulatory approaches that have proved very
effective, not just in the housing sector but across a range of
Government policy under the present and previous Administrations. It
has been shown that if private individuals or investors are given
sufficient notice of a change that will come about by law—if it
is made clear in primary legislation and if it is widely
disseminated—change happens. I will not list the various
relevant measures, but there are plenty of examples from a range of
disciplines where that course of action has been effective. We have no
reason to believe that it would not be so in the private rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000082">&#160;</a>

a moment suggest that there will not be some recalcitrant landlords who
will require the full force of the law to be brought, but most
landlords are solid, law-abiding citizens who want to act within the
law and want best practice to be driven forward. The measure will have
the benefit of creating a level playing field and will not unfairly
discriminate against landlords who want to improve their properties. We
can have a lot of confidence in the
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000083">&#160;</a>

relating to the obligation on the Government to have eradicated fuel
poverty by 2016. The date of 2018 in the clause is a strong
acknowledgement, first, that the 2016 deadline is gone. More than 5
million people are living in fuel poverty, but an opportunity is being
missed to make faster progress. To demonstrate the urgency with which
the Government are tackling the problem, it would have been more
sensible to align the date in the clause with the 2016 deadline, rather
than set it at
2018.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000084">&#160;</a>

which she puts very well. Ultimately, the date is a matter of judgment
and balance. I do not think that we would pretend that there is
anything perfect about 2018; there are arguments in favour of setting
an earlier date, and I am sure that some would argue for further delay.
We have sought to come up with a date by which even 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 183<a class="bkMark" name="Column183">&#160;</a>
                  </div>properties with long-term tenancies will have gone through a tenancy
cycle and the landlord will have had an opportunity to upgrade and
retrofit properties while they are vacant. The most hard-to-treat

be made, and having taken everything into consideration we have landed
up at the date of 2018. In 2016, of course, it will be a legal

an assured shorthold tenancy, which rolls over; I have been there nine

certainly want something done about its energy efficiency. I agree with
the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion that to bring the date forward
to 2016 would afford my landlady—particularly since she lives

needs to be done and the property should be brought up to the standard,

the date of 2018. There have been wide-ranging discussions. As well as
the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Department for
Communities and Local Government obviously has a real interest in the
matter, and there has been constructive, positive dialogue with
colleagues across Government. Although I cannot recall the exact
information off the top of my head, I believe the tenancy cycle is
simply the average time of the average tenancy—in other words,
the average period after which a landlord would expect the property to
become free. Most tenancies, I am told, are 12 to 18 months, so by
2018, we expect that 80% to 90% of tenancies will have
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000104">&#160;</a>

hung up on that single issue. Although it was an important contributing

landlords and supporting the private sector and we want more private
accommodation to become available, as well as greater liquidity and
investment in the housing sector—an objective I am sure the hon.
Gentleman shares. It is therefore important that we do not ride
roughshod over the economic interests of landlords, but balance that
impact with a strong element of social justice and a clear
determination to drive the policy through to a successful
conclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000108">&#160;</a>

seven-year roll-out. The programme will kick off only at the end of
2012 and we are talking about a date early in 2018. My arithmetic tells
me that that is not seven years but just over five. Perhaps if he
redoes his calculations, we have already hit his five-year roll-out
target. I stress again that the 2018 back-stop is the finish line. We
are not waiting five years to start the programme; 2018 is the point at
which we expect it to have concluded. I think that a five-year
programme is pretty reasonable, and we will work with the sector to
encourage take-up.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000113">&#160;</a>

we do in the success of the policy and roll-out of the framework, but
we start with a great deal more optimism than the hon. Member for
Hyndburn has about the potential of this revolutionary new market
framework. He is slightly gloomy as well as slightly out with his
arithmetic. We are optimistic about the measure’s potential to

will not lose money on it and my house will be warmer and

optimism, and because it was in their commercial interests to do it,
act way before the five years were up? Where is the opposition to the
measure from landlords? I do not understand it. Which landlords’
organisations say that they do not want to do this because they do not

class on our side, we are obviously taking a step in the right
direction, although if we look at the total housing stock, there are a
few other landlords to take into consideration. We are talking about a
little more than five years, not seven; and we will work to encourage
the sector. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman, although my
experience is rather more theoretical than his ownership-based model.
There are clear incentives for landlords to do this. Obviously, he will
report back on how his portfolio is faring, and we look forward to

                  </strong> I want to clarify one point. The Minister said that
in 2016 tenants can request something. Where there is no tenant and the
property is one of the vast number of empty homes that we have, it
would be helpful if the Government or local authority could provide a
nudging process. Bearing in mind the number of housing problems we
have, particularly in my area, it would be useful to get those
properties into the mix and have some sort of warning notice issued to
landlords perhaps in 2016, maybe by the local authority, or something
similar.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000118">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady makes a good point, and I understand
the intention behind it. Of course, it runs up against a fundamental
problem. The green deal is basically predicated on a
paid-for-through-savings model. If no one is in the property, there are
no savings to be made because there is no cost to doing it. It is
conceivable that if those properties were really poor they could
benefit from the ECO subsidy. However, it would be difficult to frame
legislation that pushed the model of the market framework on to
properties where there was no money to be saved because there was no
energy being expended in the first place. One would need to look at
rather different instruments and local authority programmes—I am
skiing off-piste here—that would be appropriate for addressing
the problem of low-grade vacant properties. I do not think that the
matter lies within the scope of the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000119">&#160;</a>

many properties could be brought back into use. In the context of the
green deal, there are a lot of properties that can be made much more
energy-efficient much more quickly, which would help generally, and
bring them into use. Consumer Focus, which did some work

properties are F or G-rated. They could be improved up to an E grade
for less than £1,500, with the average cost of such work being
£270. A lot of people will not necessarily apply for an
assessment. If an assessment is going to cost £200, they will
not want to go through that. It would be helpful if the Minister
considered
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000120">&#160;</a>

proposals will mean that no landlord will have to pay up front to
install the measures. The green deal or ECO will do that for them, with
tenants repaying the green deal through their energy bill savings. We
recognise that there are other costs on landlords, such as time and
hassle, which is why we are committed to ensuring that the benefits of
these requirements meet or exceed any overall costs to
landlords.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a result of the new provisions, amendment 150 makes a consequential
amendment relating to domestic energy provision. The amendments send a
clear signal of our intent to secure improvements to the very
worst-performing rental properties in the private sector. I note that
amendments 29, 123, new clause 25 and parts of new clause 24 and
amendment 30, have now been largely superseded by the Government
amendments I have just described. However, they go further in a number
of areas. Amendment 30 and new clauses 24 and 26 propose that minimum
energy efficiency standards come in earlier—2016 rather than
2018. We have had a good run round the houses on that. The Government
amendments are a significant step forward, and they create regulatory
certainty. For that reason, we expect that 2018 will be the latest date
that landlords take action, not the first. The proposal is about giving
landlords adequate time to make the improvements well ahead of the
regulations
biting.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clauses 24 and 26 would prevent a landlord’s agent from letting
or marketing properties that fall below the minimum standard. I am
sympathetic towards the sentiment of those new clauses, which seek to
strengthen further regulations in that area. However, that aspect of
the new clauses is unnecessary. The requirement prohibiting landlords
from letting their properties unless they comply with the minimum
energy efficiency standard will bite on landlords and anyone acting as
their agent, including letting agents or estate agents. That is
absolutely implicit within the Bill, and no letting agent will want to
market properties that have not met the requirements. Additionally, new
clause 24 would put a named minimum standard in primary legislation and
that would make it a duty of the Secretary of State to review and to
raise that standard. New clause 41 would provide for increasingly
stringent minimum standards with E being the minimum in 2015, rising to
B from 2022. It would also make it a duty for the Secretary of State to
publish a plan for achieving a minimum standard of A from 2030. That is
a very ambitious road
map.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
I agree with the sentiments of the new clauses, which seek to ensure
the continued improvement of the sector, it is not appropriate to
create a legal duty. We are clear that band E should be the minimum
standard 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 189<a class="bkMark" name="Column189">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from 2018. Beyond that, we have the power to increase the standard
through secondary legislation if necessary and if there is clear
evidence to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 25 would allow the Secretary of State to suspend regulations in
local areas if there was evidence of a negative impact of supply. The
new clause is not necessary, as we remain committed to ensuring that
there are no overall negative costs on
landlords.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
new clause 26 would grant local authorities the right to enter a
landlord’s property to carry out improvements and to charge the
landlord if they fail to comply with the regulations. That is a
strengthened enforcement position, but we need to be careful with such
powers. Those powers would engage article 1 of the first protocol of
the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to
property. I am concerned that the powers are not a proportionate
interference with the rights of property owners. Additionally, the
Protection of Freedoms Bill will rationalise powers to enter premises,
and granting further access here would run contrary to the
implementation of that legislation, to which the Government have
committed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000127">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As members of the Committee will see from the
notices of amendments, I had suggested a series of changes to new
clauses 32 and 33, and I hope that the Minister will consider them even
though they have not been formally accepted. I reiterate that when the
Government’s new clauses are not published until after the
deadline for tabling amendments, that creates difficulties for hon.
Members. First, Government new clause 32 stipulates that a landlord may
not let a property unless it complies with the minimum standards as set
out in the regulations. A property might be marketed to let while still
falling below the standards, but a contract could be signed only once
the necessary improvements had been made. That might cause confusion
and delay in the occupation of a property, and might make the
regulations harder to enforce, with the potential for properties to
slip through unimproved. I call on the Government to stipulate instead
that a property may be marketed to let only once it meets the standards
that are set in regulations. That would be easier to enforce and would
mean that the potential tenants could take on a property confident in
the knowledge that it had already met a minimum energy efficiency
standard, rather than relying on the landlord’s commitment to
make those improvements in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000130">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 190<a class="bkMark" name="Column190">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, I
would like to see it explicitly stated in new clause 32(2) that the
improvements that are made to the property must bring it up to above
the minimum standards. That might seem over-fastidious, but I am sure
that none of us wants to have even the slightest loophole. Currently,
the new clause states that the obligation is only to make the
improvements that are stipulated in regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly—I
am sure that Members on both sides of the Committee will make this
point again and again—I share the disappointment that has
already been voiced about the starting date for minimum energy
efficiency standards in 2018, which is two days after the statutory
date for the eradication of fuel poverty. As we all know, a quarter of
tenants in the private rented sector live in fuel poverty, and twice as
many private rented properties have the worst energy rating compared
with the owner-occupied sector. In my constituency alone, fuel poverty
affects more than 5,000 households—around 12% of all
homes—and it is unacceptable that so many people will have to
wait longer for much-needed improvements to their homes because of the
Government’s failure to act quickly enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Perhaps to
make up for that late start, Government new clause 32 allows for a
so-called hard start. Although I welcome the sentiment, I fear how it
will be implemented. By stating that letting the property may be
defined to include continuing to let the property, the Government are
at risk of creating a situation in which people in private rented homes
may have to be evicted in order to have those homes improved before the
rigid 2018 start date. I would prefer to see an earlier, softer start
date, which meant that any property could not be let or re-let if it is
below the standards by 2016. I admit that that still creates the risk
that a tenant who stays in a property for many years might not have the
improvements made—something to which the hon. Member for Wells
has referred—but I am disappointed that a tenant’s right
to request energy efficiency improvements will now not be introduced
until 2016 instead of 2015.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fourthly, I
believe that it is essential to lay out the timetable that should be
followed for increasing energy efficiency standards, as was done for
built housing. At the very least, I would like to see an addition to
the new clause that requires the Secretary of State to review the
regulations and increase the minimum standard at regular intervals.
Ideally, I would like the Government to lay out now what the increases
in the standards will be, as I have done in new clause
41.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
I may take a few moments now to refer to new clause 41. I have already
stressed the importance of tackling fuel poverty and the way in which
fuel poverty is absolutely linked to ill health. Reports have shown
that there is a 2% cumulative increased risk of heart attacks, for
example, with every one degree change in ambient temperature. Colder
homes are a killer, and tens of thousands of excess winter deaths in
England alone cannot be ignored. That is why it is important to look at
the provisions that I have set out in new clause 41, which
would mean that by 2015 no band F or G properties could be let or
marketed to let; by 2016 no new lets of band E properties would be
permitted; and by 2019 the letting of band D properties would be
outlawed, followed by band C properties in 2022. Given the amount of
work that is needed to ensure that all properties that are let or
marketed to let have an energy 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 191<a class="bkMark" name="Column191">&#160;</a>
                  </div>rating of band A, I want the Secretary of State to bring forward a plan
to achieve that target by 2030. He has explained that he thinks that
that is too ambitious and too rigid.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We can argue
about the precise dates, but we all want to see a forward plan so that
we know what the dates will be. Not only will that provide the
reassurance that privately renting tenants need that the poor-quality
housing that blights their sector will be weeded out once and for all,
it will help landlords as well. We all know that energy efficiency
improvements are needed, and the tabling of Government new clauses 32
and 33 is proof of our understanding that such improvements will not be
achieved through voluntary action alone. Surely it is better to lay out
once and for all what the Government expect from the private rented
sector and when they expect it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000136">&#160;</a>

which anticipates exactly what I want to say next. The landlord would
be aided if he knew exactly what was expected of him over time, so that
he does not have a situation where the property is empty while he makes
a certain amount of improvements to bring it up to band E only to find
out a few years later that he needs to do the same thing all over again
to bring it up to band C or D. It is much fairer to the landlord, as
well as much better for the tenant, for that plan to be set out in
advance, so that we have a forward trajectory for increasing energy
efficiency beyond band E into the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
dynamic would lead to many properties being improved ahead of the
timetable, it would be to the social benefit of tenants and the
economic benefit of landlords, and it would have the environmental
benefit of reduced emissions. When there is a win-win-win scenario like

               <p class="tabbed">I
will finish with a few points about new clauses 32 and 33. I have
spoken before about my concerns over the amount in the Bill that is to
be set out in secondary legislation, and the lack of a definition of a
minimum standard in primary legislation provides a further example of
that. I want to see the Government make firm on their commitment to ban
the most energy-inefficient properties by stipulating in the Bill that
the minimum standard will preclude bands F and G from being rented. In
England, there are 680,000 such properties, so the scale of the need to
act is
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the Government have made it clear that they are using new clauses 32
and 33 to replace clauses 39, 40 and 41 in the Bill, as drafted. I have
no concern about losing clause 39, as it simply provides for a review
of energy efficiency in the private rented sector. I am sure that none
of us need that review to tell us that we have a big need for minimum
energy efficiency standards. Clauses 40 and 41, however,
give the Secretary of State 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>the power to make regulations, which would, in turn, give local
authorities the power to issue notices to landlords to make
improvements to their homes. Despite the new minimum standard, those

board the fact that the Minister has made comments about European

properties? That is an essential tool for local authorities in dealing
with absent landlords. One of the particular problems in my

authorities to deal with the problems that the hon. Member for Hyndburn
mentioned: overseas absent landlords who cannot be contacted; landlords
who refuse to co-operate and prefer instead to pay a fine—we

                  </strong> I rise to speak to amendments 29 and 30, which we
tabled, as well as to address the Government’s new clauses. The
aims of our amendments are, first, to ensure that the introduction of
the energy efficiency standard is included from the start of the green
deal—the Minister has spoken about that in some depth. Our
second aim is for the minimum efficiency level for domestic rented
properties to be introduced no later than 1 April
2016.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000145">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the Minister’s comment that the Government intend to
remove the review before introducing the green deal to the rented
sector and that there are to be no conditions placed on the
introduction of the minimum standard. Under clause 40, the Government
intend to bring in a minimum energy efficiency level for domestic
properties in 2018. Although that is a welcome move in the right
direction, we want this brought forward to 2016, the same year as the
eradication of fuel poverty is intended under the Warm Homes and Energy
Conservation Act
2000.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
case for a more robust approach to the private rented sector could not
be more explicit, and I shall echo some of the statistics referred to
by hon. Members earlier. People living in private rented homes are more

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 193<a class="bkMark" name="Column193">&#160;</a>
                  </div>than four times more likely to be living in a cold home than people
living in social rented homes. The private rented sector has a greater
proportion of the most energy-inefficient homes—those in energy
performance certificate band G. Such homes are twice as common in the
private rented sector as in other sectors. Nearly 10% of
properties in the private rented sector are rated as band G, while 18%
are in band F; 28% of private rented sector properties are in the
lowest two bands for energy efficiency and half the properties in that
sector are not considered by the Government to be of a decent
standard.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
health consequences of poorly insulated properties are well
established. The annual cost to the NHS of winter-related diseases due
to cold housing is an incredible £859 million, and it is
estimated that 1.3 million children live in F and G-rated properties. A
Friends of the Earth-commissioned report on the health impacts of cold
housing by Professor Sir Michael Marmot, the director of the
International Institute for Society and Health at University college
London, found that countries with more energy-efficient housing have
fewer excess winter deaths. There is a relationship between excess
winter deaths, and low thermal efficiency housing and low indoor
temperature. About 40% of the excess winter deaths are attributable to
cardiovascular diseases and about 33% of these deaths are attributable
to respiratory diseases. There is a strong relationship between cold
temperatures, and cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Children
living in cold homes are more than twice as likely to suffer from a
variety of respiratory problems as children living in warm homes, and
the mental health of any age group is affected negatively by fuel
poverty and cold housing. More than one in four adolescents living in
cold housing are at risk of multiple mental health problems compared
with one in 20 adolescents who have always lived in warm housing. Cold
housing also increases the level of minor illnesses such as colds and
flu, and exacerbates existing conditions such as arthritis and
rheumatism.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
main findings on the indirect health impacts of cold housing and fuel
poverty, and on other social benefits deriving from improved housing,
were that cold housing has a negative impact on: children’s
educational attainment, emotional well-being and resilience; and
dietary opportunities and choices. It also has a negative impact on
dexterity and increases the risk of accidents and injuries in the home.
Investing in the energy efficiency of housing can help to stimulate the
labour market and economy, as well as to create opportunities for
skilling up the construction work force. The key conclusion of the
report was that improving the energy efficiency of the existing stock
is a long-term sustainable way in which to ensure multiple gains,
including environmental, health and social
gains.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
groups are very supportive of the minimum efficiency standard, and
other members of the Committee will have received letters from them. I
have a long list of those organisations, but I shall highlight just a
few: Age UK; the Centre for Sustainable Energy; Citizens Advice;
Crisis; Consumer Focus; Disability Alliance; the End Fuel Poverty
Coalition; Friends of the Earth; Macmillan Cancer Support; the National
Childbirth Trust; National Energy Action and the National Pensioners
Convention.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000151">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I return to
the experiences of people living in cold homes. I do not know whether
hon. Members saw the BBC documentary “Poor Kids”. I urge
anyone who has not seen it to watch it. It is still available on
iPlayer—I can see a Member with his iPad now—and it is
definitely worth taking an hour to watch it. It raised a number of
issues relating to fuel poverty. It was a very difficult documentary to
watch, but I think that the issues it raised are the reason why all of
us are in this
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
of the key points that came out of the programme were that 85% of
children living in damp houses suffer from breathing problems; more
than 1 million homes in the UK are classified as unfit to live in; and
60% of poor families turn off the heating in the winter to save money.
Sam, an 11-year-old featured in the documentary who lives in a private
rented sector home, said, “When the gas runs out, the whole
house is freezing.” I again urge anyone who has not seen the
documentary to watch
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Energy
Saving Trust data show that tenants in the worst homes—those
rated F and G—would save on average £488 on their fuel
bill if their property were improved to a minimum standard. That would
have a significant impact on those homes and those families living in
fuel
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
echo the point made by the hon. Member for Wells: Consumer Focus
research has found that of the 28% of private rented properties in band
F or G, 39% can be improved to band E for less than £1,500, and
of the 66% of homes rated E, F or G, one third can be improved to a D
rating for less than £1,500 and an additional third can be
improved for less than
£3,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to say that one reason why we are dealing with this point
is that the number of households renting privately in England has risen
by 1 million since 2005. The number went from 2.4 million in 2005 to
3.4 million in 2010. This is a very significant proportion
of our housing stock in the UK, and the number looks set only to expand
in the next few years, with demand outstripping supply. With a steady
stream of tenants, what reason will private sector landlords have to
take their property off the market to improve it without a clear
indication of when they will be required to
act?<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is worth noting that 179 Members of Parliament from across the
political spectrum signed early-day motion 653, calling for the minimum
energy-efficiency standard from 2016. That included 34 Liberal Democrat
Members and 16 Conservative MPs. People should not have to wait until
2018 for a minimum energy-efficiency standard for the private rented
sector to be introduced. Some of the reasons why that is the case have
been mentioned, but I will go on to discuss a number of
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
the benefits for consumers, the climate and the taxpayer will be
unacceptably delayed if the introduction of the minimum standard is
pushed back to 2018, rather than taking place in 2016, as those 179 MPs
have called for. There have been discrepancies over the arithmetic, and
there has been talk of seven years and of five years. The point is that
seven years on from this year, 2011, is an unnecessarily long time to
wait for the introduction of the minimum standard. Such a long lead-in
time could reduce what is called the announcement effect, which
encourages voluntary action by landlords before a standard comes into
force.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000158">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Worryingly,
the Government have announced a measure that they say is
intended to tackle the high rate of fuel poverty in the rented sector
but which does not come into force until two years after the date by
which they have a legal obligation under the Warm
Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 to end fuel
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000159">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Alongside
the legislation, it is essential that landlords have the financial
help, greater incentives and information that they need to improve
their properties. The green deal will help, but will the Government
help further by raising the £1,500 tax break—the
landlord’s energy saving allowance—currently available to
landlords for energy-efficiency measures, or do the Government plan to
provide assistance through another mechanism? Will the Minister answer
that question in his
response?<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000160">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Citizens
Advice, Friends of the Earth and the Association for the Conservation
of Energy state that if a landlord has ignored a local authority demand
to install energy-efficiency measures or fails to meet the minimum
standard, the local authority should have the choice to carry out the
work itself, charging the landlord, as an alternative to simply issuing
a fine with the property remaining unimproved. That will also give
councils the flexibility to deal with properties where the landlord is
based overseas. Will the Minister say whether the Government have given
any thought to that very helpful proposal not just to impose a fine,
but to require local authorities to make the improvements themselves
and pass on that cost to the
landlords?<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
aspect of the amendments and new clauses relates to whether the minimum
standard should be increased over time. Consumer Focus has estimated
that setting the minimum standard at energy-efficiency band D would
enable 300,000 households to afford to keep their rented homes warm,
which they cannot do today. Will the Minister share with the Committee
when the Government plan to raise minimum energy-efficiency standards
to band
D?<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000162">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is concern about an unintended consequence of the Government’s
proposal, which is the prospect of eviction. Tenants demanding energy
efficiency measures from their landlords must be given proper legal
protection from eviction. Many tenants will be deterred from making
requests to their landlord for fear of being evicted, which is known as
retaliatory eviction and is made possible by section 21 of the Housing
Act 1988. Work by Citizens Advice and others shows that for many
tenants, fear of eviction is a barrier to asking for improvements and
maintenance works in rented properties. Under the Housing Act 2004,
tenants are protected from retaliatory eviction when the landlord fails
to protect their deposit. Will the Minister inform the Committee
whether the same principle will be extended to tenants who make energy
efficiency requests under the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Without
such a provision, the Government risk encouraging tenants to demand
energy efficiency from landlords without having given them protection
from the potential consequences. It is worth noting that the Minister
for Housing and Local Government, when he was the Opposition housing
spokesman, declared his opposition to retaliatory eviction in an
interview with <em>Environmental Health News</em> in 2008. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000164">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">There
are two competing thoughts in my mind. One is the desire not to make it
over-complicated because the more legislation you pile on the more
expensive it is to be a landlord and ultimately the more expensive it
is to rent...Then again we need sufficient protections in place to make
sure retaliatory evictions do not
happen.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000317">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 32 will introduce domestic energy efficiency standards from
1 April 2018. It will prevent landlords renting out a property below
that level of energy efficiency, as demonstrated by the energy
performance certificate, until they have made relevant energy
improvements, such as those that can be paid for through the green
deal. If clause 40 is removed from the Bill and replaced with new
clause 32, the Government will effectively have removed the original
mechanism whereby local authorities are required to serve a notice on
landlords whose properties are not up to
standard.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
originally conceived—and as in amendment 30, which is in my name
and the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore, and in new clause
24 in the name of the hon. Member for Wells—the minimum
efficiency standards measures were to deal with recalcitrant landlords
who had not already improved their properties through other mechanisms
in the Bill. The Government have removed the local authority measures,
and right-to-request regulations for tenants have been set back from
2015 to
2016.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
currently conceived by the Government, the Bill will provide for
minimum standards in 2018 without any proactive mechanisms to encourage
improvements by landlords in the interim. Earlier, the Minister said
that 2018 would be the finish line, but there is no explicit means of
enforcing that. There is also the risk that tenants will be evicted in
the run-up to the introduction of the minimum standard, as there is no
provision to allow tenants to remain in F and G properties
after
2018.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have many concerns about what is missing from the Government’s
proposal. It does not include letting agents as well as landlords, and
it does not include the marketing as well as the letting of a property.
If it were an offence to market a below-standard property, that offence
would be committed before the property was let to the tenant, rather
than only afterwards. The proposal does not make it explicit that the
energy efficiency improvements made must bring the property up to the
minimum
standard.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposal also does not make explicit what the minimum standard should
be, which is very bizarre. The Minister said earlier that it would be
set at E. A press release from the Department of Energy and Climate
Change, “Huhne gets Tough on Landlords of Draughty
Homes”, stated that under the proposals,<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“From
April 2018 the government will make it unlawful to rent out a house or
business premise which has less than an ‘E’ energy
efficiency
rating”.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000318">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
that has not been made
explicit.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the Government’s proposal, properties cannot continue to be let
after the minimum standard comes into force, which means that tenants
could be evicted. Our concern is that the provision should stipulate
that they cannot be re-let, so that tenants are not thrown out of the
properties in which they reside. The amendment does not say that the
minimum standard should be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 197<a class="bkMark" name="Column197">&#160;</a>
                  </div>increased. We heard the Minister say just a moment ago that it will be
set at E, but that is not made explicit. The amendment is weaker than
what is already in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me talk
about the cost of reaching the standard, and why having a minimum
standard in 2016, rather than in 2018, will not have a negative impact
on supply. To avoid regulation, some landlords’ organisations
have wrongly suggested that the necessary energy efficiency measures
will be too costly and that some landlords may choose to take their
properties off the market. The cost of meeting the minimum standard is
less than might be expected and is well within the levels of finance
associated with the green deal and ECO, which would mean no up-front
costs for landlords, or even finance directly by landlords from their
own resources, and no impact on rents or
supply.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
the standard has a soft start and works with the natural turnover of
the rental market. There will be no reason for tenants who are in an F
or G-rated property when the standard is introduced, or in the last few
months before its introduction, to be removed so that landlords can
improve the property, as that does not have to happen until the next
time the property is ready to be let to another tenant after 2016. All
those factors mean that there is absolutely no risk to housing supply
and no reason to delay the introduction of the minimum standard until
2018, which is two years after the Government’s legal obligation
to end fuel poverty; it would mean two years’ unnecessary delay
to all the benefits for tenants, taxpayers, and the climate, and to the
reduced NHS costs that the minimum standard would bring in
2016.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">European law
will soon require landlords or their agents to show the energy
performance certificate of the property to the prospective tenant. It
will also require the energy efficiency rating of properties when sold
or rented to appear on all commercial advertising and marketing
materials. If the offence is simply to let an F or G-rated property but
not to market one, enforcement will be a case of retrospective
prosecution of landlords after they have signed a contract with a
tenant to let the property. That means that the tenant will have signed
a contract and could have moved into the property without it having
been improved. The local authority will have to track down properties
that have been let at F or
G.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
advantages of creating an offence of marketing F and G-rated properties
are that landlords could be prosecuted before the property is let,
rather than us always waiting until a contract has been signed and a
new tenant is in situ. Letting agents would be liable for prosecution
for marketing and letting, as well as landlords. As there are far fewer
letting agents than landlords, enforcement would be much easier. The
marketing of an F or G property is easier for an enforcement authority
to track than the signing of a contract. Spotting a property marketed
with a false energy rating can be easily checked on the national EPC
database.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, a strong minimum energy efficiency standard for rented
homes from 2016 would be a significant advance in the fight against
cold homes. However, it would not mean “job done” on fuel
poverty. Latest Government figures show that there are 4.5 million
households in the UK that cannot afford to heat their homes. We
discussed that in depth last week. Millions will continue to live in
homes so cold that they make them ill and cost a fortune to heat. That
is why it is vital 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 198<a class="bkMark" name="Column198">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that as well as ensuring a strong, minimum energy efficiency standard
for the private rented sector, the Government include warm home
amendments to the Bill to ensure a tangible plan or strategy for the
policies. That will see sufficient homes insulated and made energy
efficient in order to end fuel poverty and meet our national carbon
emission
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000176">&#160;</a>

about the standards set and the dates attached to them. However, I have
concerns about properties that may not fall within the green deal,
which are a significant part of the property portfolio that might
become tenanted properties. We can provoke landlords into making
properties energy efficient, so that they might become part of another
tenant’s green deal for further upgrading, if necessary, if the
changes are not made in one go by the landlord. It would be handy to
have the local authority involved, and for it to have the ability to
serve notices where there are energy efficiency issues; that is good. I
will deal with the retaliatory eviction stuff later. Most of the points
that I wished to raise have been
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000177">&#160;</a>

Ultimately, we are not in a very different place, if we compare the
difference between a 2016 end date and a 2018 end date with the
previous Government’s lack of progress in meeting their fuel
poverty targets. Since 2004, we have been going backwards at a speed of

advised that keeping them will result in duplication. We expect that
local authorities will enforce the minimum standard without issuing

through my response to the points that she raised. First, her overall
point is that our amendments are somehow weaker, which is absolutely
not the case. We entirely reject that. Our amendments are tough, but
they are also proportionate. It would be entirely wrong to suggest that
we will not act, but we want to future-proof the Bill and to be able to
act
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are unleashing huge investment in our housing stock, which means not
only that different products, technologies and interventions will come
down in price, but that there will be a significant step change or leap
forward in the products available on the market. We do not want to
start prejudging, before the market has even got going on that scale,
the sorts of decisions that the Secretary of State should be making in
the second half of this decade on the level of ambition, and on what is
practical, economical, affordable and realistic, as well as ambitious.
In the Bill, we are leaving the Secretary of State and successive
Secretaries of State significant elbow-room to maintain that level of
ambition as the market
develops.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000194">&#160;</a>

still enforce minimum standards. However, we are looking for a much
more streamlined approach with no need for clunky
notices.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000195">&#160;</a>

Minister said that local authorities will be involved with F and
G-rated homes. How will the measure work with the housing health and
safety rating system, which works up to standard assessment procedure
rating 38? The measure works up to rating 35 for F properties; how will
that align with local authority enforcement and the housing health and

detailed technical information then, because I cannot give him the

on enforcement, local authorities will be able to prohibit landlords

2018. That is a change—a move forward that is going to drive
innovation and economies of scale. Once the legislation is in force we
will have an early opportunity to review. The Secretary of State will
be accountable to Parliament, to report on progress of the green deal
every year. That is integral to the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are not
going to leave the market in the dark. We are not going to wait until
2018 to announce our next step forward. It is implicit in our approach
that we will work collaboratively with industry, stakeholders and
landlord groups, so that there is a long-term vision. We cannot, as
much as we would like, see that far ahead at the moment. I have no
doubt that once the green deal is up and running, the Secretary of
State will at an early stage come forward with ideas of where we should
move on to in the 2020s. It could even be before then, if there is a
step change in technology and
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Underpinning
all this is the golden rule. The legislation does not simply will an
end; the ends are provided in the means of the golden rule, the
pay-as-you-save mechanism and the additional support available from
ECO. We cannot divorce the practical response and the means from the
ambition of the Bill. If we start to stretch the distance between what
is practical and capable of delivery and what we are requiring
landlords to install, we could end up with legislation such as that on
fuel poverty, where we legislate for something that cannot be reached.
The Fuel Poverty Bill 2008-09, mentioned earlier by the hon. Member for
Liverpool, Wavertree, has been on the statute book for years, yet we
are going backwards. As a result, it is totally discredited legislation
in the eyes of many, because it bears no relation to reality. There is
that judgment—and I accept it is a judgment—of what
should be ambition and what is
credible.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000210">&#160;</a>

Landlords will not be permitted to let properties, and it is implicit
that that also affects letting agents. I tested this myself, because,
while we have strong legal advice that letting agents being covered is
implicit in the Bill, I appreciate the hon. Lady’s point. She
is—I think—referring to new clause 24, which would
prevent an agent of a landlord from letting or marketing properties
that fall below the minimum standard. That aspect is unnecessary. The
requirement prohibiting landlords from letting a property unless it
complies with the minimum energy efficiency standard will bite on
landlords and anyone acting as their agent, including a letting agent.
That is implicit in the Bill, and, given that, no letting agent will
want to market properties that do not meet the
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000226">&#160;</a>

wording and the inclusion of “marketing to let”. I am
sorry to keep returning to it, but this is about whether measures
should be in place when a property is let or when it is marketed to
let. If the latter, that ensures that tenants have that greater degree
of confidence. In fact, the issue that I was raising at the point at

                  </strong> There are two points that the Minister has not yet
responded to. One was the helpful suggestion by Citizens Advice,
Friends of the Earth, and the Association for the Conservation of
Energy about what to do with landlords, particularly if they are based
overseas, who do not respond to demands by local authorities. It was
suggested that energy efficiency improvements could be made by the
local authority, and that the landlord could then be charged.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000239">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My other point
was about provisions in the Housing Act 2004 to ensure that retaliatory
eviction does not occur for people whose deposit has not been
protected. Are the Minister and his Department looking to extend that
same protection for tenants who reasonably request energy efficiency
measures?<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000240">&#160;</a>

discussed some amendments that relate to later clauses, but we have not

basis that the Minister said in one of his responses—I do not
have the quote in front of me—that we need the means to reach
our fuel poverty targets. We strongly believe that bringing down the
minimum efficiency standard to 2016 would ensure that we meet our fuel
poverty targets by 2016. That should not be an excuse to ignore the
fuel poverty targets. We should be doing everything in our power to
ensure that we meet those targets. Come the next clause, we will seek
to move that

reduce enforcement costs, increase compliance, improve energy
efficiency and help landlords to get access to appropriate information
about the green deal and other schemes such as the landlords energy
saving allowance. In June 2009, the Department for Communities and
Local Government looked to establish a national register for landlords,
but that was rejected by the present Government in June last year. No
official record of private sector landlords exists, but we know that
some landlords are members of the National Landlords
Association.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000276">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In 2008, a
little more than 14% of all English households were housed in the
private rented sector. The 2008 Rugg review estimated that the private
rented sector in England contained around 2.6 million properties in
2006, up from 1.8 million in 1988, and the sector has continued its
growth since 2006, with more recent estimates suggesting that by the
end of 2008 more than 3 million English households were in the private
rented sector. The sector is dominated by small landlords: in 2006, 73%
of all landlords were individuals or couples; a little more than 70% of
landlords owned fewer than 10 properties and 84% of individual or
couple landlords owned 10 or fewer properties.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000277">&#160;</a>

does the Minister intend to monitor the take-up of the green deal in
domestic private rented properties? Has he done a study of what the
expected take-up of the green deal will be in domestic private rented
properties? Without a register for the purposes of the Bill, how does
he intend to ensure that all F and G-rated domestic private rented
properties are kitted out under the green deal by 2018? How does he
intend to root out rogue landlords who do not fulfil their green deal
obligations? How does he intend to ensure that all domestic private
rented property landlords are aware of all the green deal obligations
and information? How does he intend to ensure that all domestic private

                     </span>
                  </strong> I rise to echo the arguments made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree. There are three key points in the
amendment—one of the most progressive this Committee has dealt
with—namely, information, cost to local authorities and consumer
empowerment. On information, it is clear that a register of landlords
will give the Government a huge advantage in pushing the green deal. I
note the Secretary of State’s
comments:<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000281">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Green Deal will be a revolution… The most ambitious
energy-saving plan ever put
forward.”<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000324">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>If
he is to achieve that, he needs to reach out to those in the private
rented sector and empower them. There is no better way to do that than
to have a database of landlords, so that landlords can be aware of the
benefits of the golden rule, the advantages that the scheme will give
their properties and the advantages of the ECO. As things change and
develop, if the Government have a register of landlords they will be in
a far better position to meet their own target of work on 14 million
properties completed by 2020. I read that figure somewhere; I will
stand corrected if that is not the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At local
level, a register would allow local authorities to deal with landlords
in a progressive and positive way, and it would help them to roll out
the Government’s programme. Local authorities will be key to the
proposals, but they may be swamped by complaints or by having to deal
with the worst cases that come through their doors. If we do not accept
the amendment, we may be dumping a huge cost on local authorities,
which will have to trace landlords in such cases. As someone who has
worked in local government, I can tell the Committee that officers
spend hours and hours trying to find out who a landlord is and trying
to deal with the tenant at the same time. The landlord often cannot be
found, because the property has gone through a letting agent or a
management company; it is really difficult to trace some landlords.
Without a register of landlords, the cost to the local authority will
grow.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned, because it is fair to say that some local authorities in
areas where there is a large private rented sector are facing some of
the biggest cuts. Where 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 209<a class="bkMark" name="Column209">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will the resources they need come from? A local register of landlords
would be a cost saving to local council tax payers by enabling their
authorities to deal effectively with private landlords and tenants who
approach those landlords seeking assurances or pursuing complaints
about the green deal. It would be an important step
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000284">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third reason is consumer empowerment. There is an opportunity for local
authorities to receive a commercial charge. I have mentioned
organisations such as NetMovers and others, which are shameless
promoters; they would be willing to pay local authorities for access to
a register and database. I should have expected the Government to be on
the side of consumers and to welcome consumer empowerment. If such
information were made publicly available, consumers would have a much
better choice as the private sector steps in to provide information
about rented properties to potential
tenants.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000285">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a clear consumer-driven argument why we should have a local or
national register. I am sure that the private sector would be willing
to step in to provide such information. At the moment, local
authorities keep a lot of information on the private rented sector as
well as registers of landlords, but such information is not holistic.
It might contain just those who have been accredited, or who have been
subject to enforcement action elsewhere. There are different lists with
several silos of activities in which local authorities are engaged. The
bringing together of such a register for the purposes of the green deal
would allow local authorities to provide a better service and enable
them to provide information to consumers. I have set out the three main
reasons for such a
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000286">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
E.ON’s submission to members of the Committee, it states that a
key challenge for the private rented sector is<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000287">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“to increase the
market value of energy
efficiency”,<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000325">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>so
by empowering consumers, landlords will be put in a position whereby
they must improve and approach a green deal provider and assessor. They
will be put on the back foot when trying to compete in a market, so
such a measure will increase consumer choice, as well as drive up
standards and increase the energy value within the market value of a
property. E.ON says that a register
will<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“provide
additional incentives for landlords to make improvements to their
properties”.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Although
energy performance certificates do help, E.ON
continues:<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000289">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
information provided is often not interpreted as financial savings by
potential
tenants”.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000327">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
get round that. This information would add to the market value and
consumer choice. I expect the Government to be on the side of
consumers, on the side of choice, on the side of private enterprise and
on the side of the free market, so the third point, on marketisation
and information to the general public, is the
key.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000290">&#160;</a>

essential as it would make sure that the measures on energy levels in

                  </div>what in terms of energy efficiency. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Hyndburn said, at the moment, local authorities have a fractured
knowledge of what properties landlords rent out and their condition.
The Housing Act 2004 gave local authorities a limited licensing power
and obviously they how have a register relating to that, but that
licensing applies only to houses in multiple occupation of a certain
size—three storeys and five residents, I believe—so
licences and therefore registers cover not just a limited amount of the
total, but a tiny fraction of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000291">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is making a good point. The Minister
for Housing and Local Government is a strong advocate of selective
licensing, which aggregates data in the private rented
sector. That is another silo of information that is part of this matrix
that local authorities can use when dealing with the private rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000292">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Indeed, the Secretary of State in his latest
proposals on HMOs envisages only licensing in very limited numbers of
areas across the country where an article 4 direction has been
undertaken. Therefore not only would the information be partial across
the country, it would be in the hands only of certain proactive local
authorities. We are legislating here for something that applies
universally across the whole country so that after a certain period any
landlord anywhere in the country who wishes to rent out a property will
have to abide by certain minimum energy efficiency standards. In
approaching any form of enforcement, local authorities will not just
have their hands tied behind their backs, they will have no hands at
all, so to
speak.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
an illustration, the properties that are licensed and
therefore registered in Southampton under present HMO and Housing Act
legislation number 900 out of a total of about 9,000 that are estimated
to be landlord rented properties. There is, therefore, a long way to go
before we could say that even a remotely comprehensive register was in
place. When proposals were put forward previously to develop a national
landlord register, the suggestion was not that a national licensing
route should be followed but that a much more user-friendly, limited
and genuinely useful national web-based register should be
developed.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such a
register would, according to the cost-benefit analysis, have a net
benefit in terms of its ability to provide information and property
advertising, perhaps at the expense of NetMovers, and other resources
which would accrue to the benefit of both landlords and tenants.
Crucially, it would provide a comprehensive view of whatever part of
the country and, without any great endeavour, would enable a
landlord’s compliance with letting arrangements and the energy
efficiency of that property to be
questioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
alternative is that the matter would pretty much lie in the hands of
those people who are negotiating to rent a property. Someone might pick
up during the course of negotiating a rental agreement with a landlord
that the property did not comply with the Bill, which I hope we will
put on the statute book. That assumes a number of heroic acts on the
part of the person who takes out that rental arrangement. They must
look at the energy performance certificate and report the level it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 211<a class="bkMark" name="Column211">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is at, which someone then has to pursue. At that point the only way of
identifying the landlord is by direct reference to the leasing
arrangement. We need a much better method than that to ensure that the
arrangements
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000296">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
simplest and best method is a simple, easy to operate and not onerous
web-based national register of landlords, which may fit the bill. The
last assessment estimated the average annual cost of such a web-based
register to be some £40 million. A limited registration fee
would deal with the development costs. As I have described, the annual
benefits that accrue would outweigh the annual cost over time. That is
not a particularly onerous or unreasonable regulatory
burden.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000297">&#160;</a>

£40 million figure factor in those private sector companies that
provide consumer advice and would be willing to pay for it? That sum

                  </strong> I am saying very clearly that the sector is
already governed by a well-established legal framework. As things
stand, we do not see a compelling argument why we should move towards a
regime that would impose significant regulatory and financial
burdens. I appreciate the simplicity and clarity
of the Opposition arguments in favour of heavier regulation of the
sector. I understand the intent behind that, but it would impose a
further burden either on the taxpayer or on the private rented sector.
We are committed to fewer regulatory approaches, greater discretion and
localism and, wherever possible, avoiding putting further economic and
regulatory burdens on to
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000307">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is making a robust defence, but I
still do not think that it holds up. We need to go beyond the Committee
stage. I want to press him on the point about encouraging more
landlords into the sector. I want to hear what he has to say about
consumers and choice. They seem to be bottom of his
list.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000308">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Absolutely not. What consumers want most of all is
a wide range of properties to choose from, which means ensuring that
the Government do not discourage new entrants into the market. We need
to be sensible about imposing new burdens and additional
regulatory or financial penalties, which might put off new entrants and
people investing in the sector, or could even dissuade landlords, who
might withdraw from the sector. We need a healthy, vibrant sector,
which is not served by over-regulation. As I have said, my colleagues
at DCLG have looked at the matter in some detail and have come to the
conclusion that the sector is already governed by an existing
established framework. However, we will set out in secondary
legislation the steps that local authorities must take to identify
relevant
properties.<a class="bkMark" name="11061455000309">&#160;</a>
