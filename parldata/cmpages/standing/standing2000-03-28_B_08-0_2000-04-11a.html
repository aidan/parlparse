<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This group of amendments deals with the penalties that can be imposed on persons exercising their right of access who have contravened the restrictions and exclusions placed on them under chapter II and schedule 2. It will be most convenient for me to speak to each amendment; they are clearly related, but they each deal with a specific aspect.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 would amend subsection (4). The Bill provides that those who contravene the restrictions placed on walkers will be treated as trespassers and will be denied access to the land in question for the remainder of the day. I should be glad to hear whether the Minister agrees that a loophole exists; if so, the amendment would close it. It would ensure that, if a person breaks or damages a wall, fence, hedge or gate, he, too, would be denied access to the land for the rest of the day. Unless the Minister says otherwise, subsection (1)(a) only partly covers that point, and it is possible that the provision could be insufficiently enforced. The amendment attempts to introduce greater clarity.
<P>
Amendment No. 82 would replace the penalty of being excluded from access land for the rest of the day with a summary conviction of a fine not exceeding level 1 on the standard scale—a fairly low-grade fine. On Second Reading and in Committee, we debated what appears to be some inequity of treatment between those who commit an offence as landowners or farmers and those who commit a similar offence who have simply gained access to the land. The amendment seeks to get to the heart of that inequity. I think that the Minister will take the point that quite serious offences could be committed by walkers for which the existing punishment does not fit the crime.
<P>
The Government have made clear their intention to impose fairly serious penalties on landowners who commit offences under the Bill, so it seems that we should try for some fairness. We agree that much of the damage that can be done to wildlife or to the land itself is extremely serious, and that damage should be treated equally seriously, regardless of who does it. As has been said, if a walker intentionally or recklessly damages land, or engages in an activity for a commercial purpose, he can only be asked politely, presumably by the tenant of the land or—more likely—by the gamekeeper, to leave the land for the rest of the day. However, that probably does not meet the purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some of the activities referred to in schedule 2 are criminal offences under the present law and that the Bill as drafted preserves those criminal offences? The offence to which the hon. Gentleman refers is recognised by the criminal law, so there are other possible punishments as well as the requirement on the offender to leave the land for the rest of the day as outlined in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Yes, but in practical terms—taking my earlier example—the gamekeeper, who is unlikely to be an expert in criminal law, will be left to deal with the situation. If the offender refuses to leave, what should the gamekeeper do—call the police? By the time a policeman arrives, hours later, the damage will have been done. This is an attempt to be practical about what will actually happen in these circumstances. A new situation will arise if the Bill creates new offences. Activities which are presently not criminal offences may be offences under the Bill. My basic point is that, to expect walkers and gamekeepers to be experts in criminal law, is impractical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I am fully in sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's desire for decent law enforcement in terms of a rapid response from police officers in rural areas and the appointment of sufficient wardens. If the hon. Gentleman is worried about delays in the police answering calls about offences, such as criminal damage, how does creating new, and what I would call, bogus offences, provide a more reasonable response than that in the Bill at present?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure that recklessly damaging land is a bogus offence. My point is one of equity. The Bill creates new offences. If landowners commit them, they will be liable to the criminal law. The Bill already goes down a route that may prove difficult to enforce. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman and I agree on this. We could have an interesting debate on whether civil rather than the criminal law—as he may wish to suggest—would be more appropriate in these circumstances. However, we are dealing with a Bill that creates new criminal offences for one group rather than for everybody. The point of amendment No. 82 is to ensure that all those who commit an offence under the terms of this part of the Bill are treated in an equal way. The issue is not controversial as clearly we all believe that the law should apply to everybody equally. That is what this amendment seeks to achieve.
<P>
The majority of walkers are responsible and if they commit offences will—at worst—do so unintentionally. The prospect in the back of people's minds that something may be illegal should act as a disincentive and make people more careful in observing the general code of good conduct for walkers that will be needed. I hope the Government will accept the amendment as doing so would put into practice the Ministers' frequent statements during our debates that the Bill places an onus on walkers to exercise their responsibilities and to ensure that wildlife is not damaged. I am sure that that is not a controversial statement and can be accepted on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 is a probing amendment that provides an alternative to amendment No. 82. It enables those responsible for enforcement—whether they be gamekeepers, wardens or the police—to exclude persons for one month from exercising their right of access when that right has been abused through the contravention of the restrictions contained in schedule 2 or part II. Exclusion for one month demonstrates that contravention is serious, as people will know that they will not merely be ticked off and asked politely to stop. Such demonstration is necessary because contravention may involve serious damage. In practical terms, the arrangements proposed by the amendment will more effectively prevent reoffending. If the Government do not wish to adopt amendment No. 82, which proposes the use of the criminal law, they may find amendment No. 83 more acceptable. I could say that it provides a softer option, but, in fact, it gives them a third way. [Interruption.] I thought that that would wake the Minister up. Certain signals have a Pavlovian effect on Labour Members. I shall leave it to the Minister to describe the effect on him of phrases such as the ``third way'', as I would not wish to intrude. Amendment No. 83 gives the Government the option of using the civil law within the overall framework that they propose while sending a stronger signal than that which is provided by the penalties contained in the schedule.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 seeks to crack down on persistent contraveners. The Bill ensures that a person who contravenes restrictions or exclusions placed on him by access provisions is liable to be excluded for the remainder of the day from relevant land or any other land within the same ownership. The amendment seeks to close another loophole by excluding a determined and persistent offender from moving on and recommitting the offence on an adjacent area of access land that is under different ownership or tenancy. It would have the practical and beneficial effect of preventing excess confrontation and could, therefore, reduce the need for policing of the new access areas. I agree with the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) that the policing arrangements will be practically difficult because of the nature of the areas in which the legislation will operate. The other beneficial effect of the amendment would be to prevent damage to wildlife and to the interests of the land occupier.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 is a probing amendment. It seeks to elicit from the Minister comments on the need for flexibility to deal appropriately with contraventions and abuse. The schedule 2 restrictions that are not currently offences in their own right are inevitably of varying degrees of severity. Some of them are much more serious than others. The amendment would provide for proportionality between the act committed and the penalty faced by the offender. We can all envisage what would constitute moderate and not very damaging offences, but everybody would regard as much more serious the deliberate disturbance of ground-nesting birds, damage of nests and destruction of eggs. Amendment No. 125 seeks to make the penalty fit the seriousness of the offence.
<P>
Amendment No. 126 would have substantially the same effect as amendment No. 84. It seeks to deal with persistent contraveners and would allow the Government to ensure that people who persistently—and, one must assume, deliberately—contravene are dealt with with appropriate dispatch. Amendment No. 128 is self-explanatory. It attempts to deal with the persistent offender and ensure that the new right of access is treated responsibly. People who abuse that responsibility would have the fitting punishment of not being allowed to have a right of access to any access land.
<P>
The amendments, including amendments Nos. 130 and 131, attempt to improve the practicality of the Bill and are designed to tighten the penalties and restrictions. They would also make them appear practical and fair to people who use the new regime. We want to encourage responsibility and minimise the prospect of damage to wildlife and land.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) has done the Committee a service by tabling the amendments which enable us to explore the penalties that apply to people who do not obey the rules.
<P>
I have tabled four amendments to the group. Amendment No. 158 reads cryptically. It inserts subsections (1)(a) and (1)(c), but alert Committee members will realise that there is no subsection (l)(c). The amendment relates to a previous debate on night-time access. It has the same purpose as amendment No. 81 and would introduce an express prohibition on breaking the boundary markers of the land.
<P>
Amendment No. 159 deals with the curious penalty of refusing a person access to land that is within the same ownership on the day he or she transgresses one of the rules in schedule 2. That is a recipe for confusion. I cannot understand the logic for stipulating land that is within the same ownership. How would a trespasser know who was the landowner? That is nonsense. It would be simpler to say that if a person has trespassed, there is the clear penalty of refusing access to any access land on that day. My amendment does that more elegantly than the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ashford because it deletes rather than inserts words.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 relate to another matter. There is no real gradation within the penalty system for the offences. Clause 24 imposes a restriction to protect areas of particular conservation interest, which are the most sensitive areas of all. It would be reasonable to expect clear signals to be given to walkers not to enter such areas, so I suspect that an offence could be committed only with intent and that a higher penalty should apply.
<P>
In my discussions with environment bodies before tabling the amendment, it was suggested that I was being far too lenient in proposing that the penalty should not exceed level 3 on the standard scale, depending on the enormity of the crime. I resisted the temptation to suggest anything more draconian, but there is a distinction between some of the transgressions that could apply under schedule 2 and clause 24, which the law should recognise.
<P>
I understand the point raised by the hon. Member for Stafford that other laws on criminal damage could be used by the courts in the case of a serious offence. However, throughout our proceedings we have stressed the need for clarity in the Bill and I believe that the amendments are sensible. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply. Perhaps we shall reconsider the matter at a later stage as a consequence of his views on the matter and how he envisages the Bill will work in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): We have had an interesting discussion this morning about an important matter. There is some concern, to which I referred last week, about the public perception of the Bill, which is not assisted by the fact that landowners who transgress will be subject to a fine of £2,000, but trespassers will not be sanctioned under the criminal law. Unfortunately, much has been made of that imbalance, which the amendments are designed to redress.
<P>
I am not saying that walkers or landowners are irresponsible people, but we must cater for the small minority who will inevitably transgress, human nature being what it is. We must ensure that the whole panoply of law applies equally to both sides, sections or interests. The sanction in clause 2 for an individual who fails to observe the restrictions set out in schedule 2 is that he or she will become a trespasser and lose the right of access for the remainder of the day, but how is anyone to know the limits on access to any area of land? How will anyone know whether he or she has trespassed?
<P>
The provisions are unworkable. Even calling a person a trespasser reminds one of the law of trespass, which is probably the least efficacious and workable body of law in England and Wales. Every law student knows about the old wooden lie that trespassers will be prosecuted; they cannot be prosecuted except in very limited circumstances of criminal trespass, which I am sure will not apply under the Bill. In any event, the trespass sanctions, such as they are, will apply in this case, so if a walker—one of a tiny minority, I am sure—behaves badly, that will be the only sanction available.
<P>
It is unacceptable that if someone has committed criminal damage or disturbed livestock or wild birds or animals—and I understand what was said earlier about offences under schedule 2—requesting that person to leave should be the end of the matter, whereas landowners would be open to a fine of £20,000 in some circumstances.
<P>
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors believes that byelaws, would help to address the problem. Its briefing material states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Byelaws are essential to back-up the various provisions of the Bill in particular in relation to the exclusions contained in Schedule 2. It is important that the Bill provides for them to be both applied and enforced. The RICS urge that a set of model byelaws be drawn up nationally, based on Schedule 2 and including provisions for closures. These byelaws will then be adopted by local authorities with appropriate modifications where necessary to suit local circumstances. It is important that this should not result in a lengthy period of negotiation and approval before they become operational.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The briefing continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Chartered surveyors working in areas with access agreements state that byelaws appear to work in providing an understandable statement of restrictions. It is easier to police and stop people contravening their ``right of access'' if their attention can be drawn to local byelaws and the fine for contravention. The inclusion of a financial penalty for infringement of byelaws is also a more successful deterrent than the withdrawal of the ``right of access'' for 24 hours.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
While that is a different approach from the one that has been argued this morning, it might also offer a solution. The imbalance that I have mentioned causes great concern outside Parliament and in rural areas.
<P>
Amendment No. 131 is entirely appropriate. It concerns intentional obstruction. If a transgressor refuses to supply his or her name or address, or gives a false name and address, what will the warden or other person interested in the land be able to do about it? It is not good enough simply to tell someone who may have committed a serious transgression to go away. Someone who behaves badly should pay for that in some way. The Bill is a recipe for conflict. What will happen if a walker does not want to be excluded for the rest of the day? I can well imagine less fraught encounters degenerating into violence. We need to cater for that possibility. Otherwise the Bill will be of no use to anyone.
<P>
The amendment would operate in a similar way to the duty not to obstruct a water bailiff. It is an offence, when walking on the river bank, to refuse to give one's name and address to a water bailiff who asks for it, or to give a false name and address. The amendment is not quite as draconian as the provision relating to water bailiffs, as it includes the word ``intentionally''. The law on water bailiffs, as I recall, uses only the word ``obstruct''. The amendment would address all the concerns raised by hon. Gentlemen this morning. The legal obligation for a person who transgresses to give his or her correct name or address means that any more serious transgression can be followed up if necessary after the person has been ejected from the land.
<P>
I am wary of people using reasonable force. Being a criminal lawyer, I have seen degrees of reasonable force and do not favour the notion, except when it is used by trained people such as the police. I am concerned about its application to a landowner or warden who might not be aware of his or her limits. I do not want to see conflict on the hills any more than anybody else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the difference when such matters are handled professionally. For example, private firms have had to be brought in because the police cannot cope and prevent serious offences by people intent on disrupting grouse shooting in Yorkshire and Scotland. Stewards at such events are professional, well trained and know exactly what they are doing. Someone with temporary responsibility as a part-time keeper, or someone involved in the conservation and maintenance of heather, trying to get rid of someone who is especially obstreperous is likely to lead to serious trouble. I wholly support what the hon. Gentleman says.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. That situation would be a recipe for disaster. The last thing that any of us wants to do is to include a proposal that will cause conflict. We are all trying to consider a balance to redress the present imbalance; we hope to put in place an Act that will work.
<P>
I urge the Minister to consider whether he approves of the byelaw route, to which the RICS has referred, or the amendment. The amendment would go a long way in addressing the issue because there would at least be a duty to give correct details to whomsoever requests them. To expect the police to be on hand is unrealistic. Regrettably, it is often difficult to get a policeman out to the rural community in which I live without considerable delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's experience is the same as mine. It is difficult enough to get a police officer to attend a burglary or even an assault. It is inconceivable that one would attend a call regarding an accusation of trespass.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am sure that that is right—there would probably be many more pressing matters. It is also unlikely that a police officer will be keen to get involved when he knows that the name and whereabouts of the alleged trespasser are not available—the hills are open places. I say that in all sincerity and hope that the Minister will respond. The amendment is useful; what the RICS says is also worthy of consideration.

<P>

<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): This is an historic moment for me because this is the first Committee to which I have been appointed. Like you, Mr. Stevenson, I was elected to another body, with a dual mandate during my first two years of service here. I am delighted that new clause 3, which stands in my name, has been picked for debate. I hope that the Government will be minded to include it because it is important.
<P>
It has become clear to me, from correspondence that I have received since the Bill's publication, that there is a glaring omission. Landowners will be put to additional expense as a result of more people having access, and that should be recognised somehow. I could have drafted the new clause in wider terms to contain more general rights of compensation. The Government have argued that there is no general right of compensation, but have yet to answer the argument that payment of compensation for proven losses is required. I would pray in aid the Highways Act 1980, which contains several provisions by which the owner of a private road can be made to pay compensation. Here, a parallel situation would involve a land owner who had given up his voluntary and exclusive right of enjoyment of land. Such a case is currently pending; unfortunately, I have forgotten the name of the person pursuing it. The landowner is claiming a massive loss of value of woodland to which access has been granted under existing provisions. Many have called on the Government to recognise in the Bill that land value might be reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend might be referring to Lord Rotherwick.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. The Minister might wish to share his view of Lord Rotherwick's case, which is especially pertinent, in his response to the new clause.
<P>
In the hope of gaining Government support for the new clause, I have not sought to include a wide right of compensation. The Government might come forward on Report with an amendment. For the reason already given, I would have preferred voluntary access, but now that access will be compulsory, we seek the reduction of conflict wherever possible.
<P>
I have received representations from several landowners and from organisations representing landowners. They would greatly value compensation being written into the Bill. The good intentions of walkers and ramblers are reflected in the Government's use of the Bill to open up of access. If those good intentions are real, I do not see why such people would not welcome the new clause.
<P>
In Yorkshire, if somebody knocks over part of a stone wall, he has clearly caused damage. It should be incumbent on a person entering or remaining on access land for the purposes of open-air recreation—walking or rambling—who causes damage to a stone wall, fence, hedge, stile or gate, to own up, make good the damage and bring the damage to the land owner's attention. Such a person should offer to compensate the land owner for the damage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the situation is an example of the folly of not having direct linear access? It would be possible to provide a controlled way on to a moor or other area on which people wished to walk if one had such access. Some people know how to get about, but safe, easy access could be provided for the many who know little. A land owner would be able to make the necessary arrangements, so avoiding damage to the rest of his property, which might include valuable, rare and, unfortunately, sometimes ill-maintained stone walls.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point so eloquently. I could not agree with him more; a direct linear access provision would be a welcome addition to the Bill. Will the Minister reconsider the matter and propose changes on Report?
<P>
A direct parallel already exists with regard to policing the arrangements proposed in the new clause. If one runs over and kills a sheep on the North York moors, one is obliged to report the incident to the local police, who will inform the landowner. Existing laws can be relied on to deal with such needs. The new clause could easily be policed under those arrangements, which would ensure that anybody who damages a stone wall, fence, stile or gate will report it immediately and before leaving the vicinity. The new clause is important because the landowner will obviously be put to great expense and inconvenience in making facilities good with repairs that would not have been necessary without the access granted by the Bill.
<P>
It is only common sense—I would say that, would I not, Mr. Stevenson?—and fair to ensure that damage is made good and that landowners receive compensation for the cost involved. The new clause would set the landowner-visitor relationship off on the right footing. If it were agreed to, landowners would know in advance that they would be compensated. They are already compensated for the accidental death of a sheep that has been run over, albeit that the motorist involved will probably have been travelling too fast.
<P>
That is an appropriate parallel and genuine walkers and ramblers would welcome the inclusion in the Bill of a provision such as that proposed. It would help to reduce the potential for conflict between landowners and genuine walkers who do not commit wilful damage, but accidental damage that any one of us could cause. I have been known to climb stone walls, and, as one gets older, one is perhaps not quite as delicate as one was in youth. The new clause seeks recognition of accidental damage, and I am sure that walkers would accept it. I hope that the Minister will also accept it, for the reasons that I have set out and because it would be policed under existing provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I should like to add one or two comments to this sensible debate. The Bill allows more walkers greater access to the countryside. The Opposition welcome that and we support well-behaved walkers, but we do not welcome the small minority of walkers who will cause trouble in the countryside. Unfortunately, a small number of walkers bring the vast majority into disrepute. That is not an anti-rambling comment; it is merely common sense. The Committee should try to improve the Bill and to educate the small minority into behaving properly in the countryside. However, some form of deterrence is needed to deal with the people who will not behave properly. The proposed deterrent of merely telling a trespasser that he may not return to the land for the rest of the day is not adequate.
<P>
We are not discussing clause 14, but I shall use it briefly to illustrate my point. It ensures that, if a landowner erects a false sign, he will be liable for a level 3 fine of some £1,000. However, trespassers, who may have committed a large amount of damage in effecting an entrance to the land, can merely be turned off the area for the rest of the day. A proper deterrence is needed.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford tabled amendments Nos. 83, 125 and 128 to remedy the disproportionate effects of the Bill. Amendment No. 213 has the same purpose. I remind the Committee that people become trespassers only if it can be proved that they have caused damage or harm. Such action puts someone—usually whoever is trying to make a living from the land—at a financial disadvantage. If the Minister will not accept that trespassers should be fined, he must at least accept that they should be subject to a fitting deterrence. Merely turning them off the land for a day is not appropriate. The Minister should accept amendment No. 83. It is reasonable to deter someone from having access to a particular piece of land for one month.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 159, 84 and 126 relate to land that is within the same ownership. If nothing else, I hope that the Minister will give us a concession on that. The definition of owner is technically defective because it does not relate to the definition in the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948. The Minister will have to table an amendment on Report to rectify that. I do not like the definition of ownership. Land can be held in many ways—as a beneficial owner in fee simple; under a full agricultural tenancy under the Agricultural Holdings Acts 1986 and 1948; as part of a farm business tenancy—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we will discuss the definition of ownership in the next debate. I hope that he will oblige me by being patient. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I accept that the next amendment involves the definition of ownership. Nevertheless, we are debating the ability to turf trespassers off land that is under the same ownership. I want to demonstrate the nonsensical way in which the Bill is drafted. Who will know what land is under the same ownership? Two pieces of adjacent land might erroneously appear to be owned by the same person.
<P>
Finally, in order not to detain the Committee, I want to move on to new clause 3, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh). It is very sensible. I am fortunate to represent an extremely attractive part of the countryside, and I would encourage everyone to walk in the Cotswold area of outstanding natural beauty. The Cotswold way is excellent. The path stretches many miles and is well worth walking, but it is necessary to go over stiles, which are signed and marked. If people use their right to wander more generally over downland, they might clamber over and damage Cotswold stone walls, which I have already mentioned. Cotswold limestone is soft and particularly susceptible to damage. It is extremely expensive to repair, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York made clear, is also the case with walls in her area of Yorkshire. Anyone who unintentionally or intentionally damages stone walls should be required to pay for that damage.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said, it is all very well using the panoply of the civil law in respect of trespassers, but anyone who has had anything to do with that civil law knows how difficult it is to apply. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) said, it can take several hours to get a police constable to the scene of a burglary. It would take even longer for a constable to come from Cheltenham police station to investigate an offence of trespass. I do not want to disparage the police, but one would have to wait a long time because they do not have the manpower to deal with such problems. We need to look at making the mechanism in the Bill for the payment of recompense for any damages easier to operate. That is my core point. The Bill at present is not adequate in that respect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I may be missing something, but my understanding of the criminal law is that there is already an offence of criminal damage. Anyone found guilty of the offence before a magistrates court or a Crown court—if the relevant limit is such that the case is heard before the Crown court—can be subject to a disposal of the court, which would mean the offender compensating the owner for any damages. Given that fact, is it not correct that this is a superfluous new clause and is it not dangerous to duplicate the provisions of the existing criminal law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. However, as a lawyer who will have advised many clients in rural areas, he will know that to have to go through the legal process—to have to go to court, to give evidence—over a broken wall is a difficult burden to place on a hard-pressed farmer.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): My hon. Friend will know that Cotswold stone walls stretch into my constituency of North Wiltshire. He should not speak as though he were alone in his concerns. The difficulty is that to prove criminal damage it is necessary to prove the intention to cause damage. What we are discussing is accidental damage to Cotswold stone walls, for example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Amendment No. 131 creates a new offence and is complementary to the existing criminal law. It enables whoever is in charge of the land to pursue the usual avenues of the criminal law. It creates a duty not to obstruct; in other words, to give full information if it is sought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to hon. Members for their interventions because they give one time to think. The problem here is the burden of proof. We need to create a mechanism whereby it will be easier to obtain recompense for any damage. If we rely on the criminal or civil courts, we may be storing up problems for ourselves. Damage will be caused by a small number of walkers. Any claim for criminal damage arising from this would require expensive lawyers and representation. I know that the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas), who is a lawyer, will be only too keen to create extra work for himself. Trying to obtain recompense for a wall that has been knocked down, a stile that has been broken, a gate that has been left open resulting in stock straying all over the place or lambs that have been killed by a dog will be an onerous process for a harassed hill farmer. I know that Ministers will not give us much in the Committee, but we are storing up problems for the future if we do not remedy this issue now.
<P>
<B>Miss Mclntosh:</B> The new clause, which I hope my hon. Friend will support, would be a good-will gesture on the part of walkers and the Government—if they accepted it—which could help reduce conflict. If we rely on the criminal law, we will lose much good will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for proposing the new clause because it outlines a number of likely situations. I do not know whether it would be practical or workable, the Minister will probably tell us not. However, even if he tells us that it would not work, those situations will undoubtedly occur and we need to have mechanisms to deal with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggested that I intervened solely to create business for lawyers, but I forgive him for that inappropriate innuendo. However, is it his understanding that the new clause would create a civil offence, some sort of hybrid creature, or would the new clause require the intervention of a criminal court to determine, if nothing else, the issue of causation and quantum of damage?
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> On a point of order. Would it not have been more appropriate for the hon. Gentleman to put that question to me, as I tabled the new clause?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I fear that I do not have to encourage hon. Members to intervene or to put questions to other hon. Members because they seem more than willing to do so. What hon. Members do is entirely a matter for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This is a case of a lawyer intervening on a non-lawyer, so the hon. Gentleman will undoubtedly win the argument. When we start to consider causative effects, the minutiae of civil and criminal law and the burden of proof, I fear that you might rule me out of order, Mr. Stevenson, because it might not be strictly relevant to the Bill. However, what I have already said will give the Minister a large clue about the problems with the new clause.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> We have started with an interesting and, at times, rumbustious debate, which raises some relevant points.
<P>
The amendments would increase the penalty for those who trespass on access land. We are aware of the concern about the penalty that should apply to trespassers. I absolutely agree that adequate penalties should be available and accept that a fair balance should be struck between the penalties imposed on landowners and walkers. Having said that, for reasons that I will explain, I remain convinced that the Bill's approach is fair and sufficient.
<P>
As set out in clause 2, trespass occurs where a user breaks any of the restrictions in schedule 2, fails to comply with a restriction imposed on the land by chapter II or simply enters land from which access is excluded under chapter II. I wish to consider the amendments in two parts because they suggest two types of changes, although I doubt whether either is necessary.
<P>
The first type relate to the criminalisation of trespass. The hon. Member for Ashford said that it was fair to criminalise restrictions because part I already imposes new criminal sanctions on landowners. However, the Bill applies a light-touch access regime and there are few, if any, obligations on landowners. The criminal sanction on landowners for obstruction of a means of access under clause 37 is very much a last resort, and would apply only after two notices had been served by the access authority requiring the obstruction to be removed. The only other general criminal sanction on landowners is in clause 14, which makes it an offence to display a misleading notice. In contrast—one could argue this the opposite way from that which the hon. Member for Ashford suggested—walkers are already subject to the criminal law; for example, if they cause damage, leave litter, uproot wild plants or commit any of several other offences. Amendment No. 82 would set a level 1 fine of £200 for trespass, and, under amendment No. 125, trespassers would be asked to leave the land and not return for the remainder of the day, in addition to being fined £500.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 212 and 213, tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), would make it an offence to breach any restriction imposed on land for the purposes of nature conservation or heritage preservation, with a fine for contravention of up to £1,000.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Nature conservation restrictions apply in sites of special scientific interest. The Bill introduces a new criminal offence of intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging any important feature of an SSSI. An offender would be liable to a fine of up to £20,000 in a magistrates court and an unlimited fine on indictment. It is not as if significant penalties are not already available.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I am listening carefully to the right hon. Gentleman. He is of course right that penalties are available for criminal offences committed in areas restricted for nature conservation purposes. However, no penalty exists for disturbance, which may be a real problem with respect to nature conservation. The possibility of disturbance to nesting birds, for example, could be a good reason for restricting access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall take advice on that, but I understand that the offence of reckless action that causes damage or disturbance would cover what the hon. Gentleman has described. We shall certainly return to this matter when we discuss wildlife penalties towards the end of the Bill. However, we certainly intend that reckless disturbance of wildlife, whether on SSSIs or elsewhere, should be properly dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister has even more starkly illustrated the disproportion between the penalties for some offences in the Bill, such as the £20,000 fines for damage to SSSIs and the penalties in clause 2, under which a trespasser may merely be turned off for a day, which is no deterrent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman can contain himself, I shall come a little later to trespass, which may lead to criminal damage or be committed without criminal damage. However, I should like to pursue the logic of my remarks in a rational and appropriate order.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford raised a point about persistent offenders, by which I presume he meant serial trespassers. Someone who causes damage—and this answers the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)—will be liable to criminal sanctions. Criminal penalties are not appropriate merely for trespassing without doing damage or harm. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been distracted at least twice by hon. Members holding discussions. If they want to do that, perhaps they will go outside.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I simply wanted to help the hon. Member for Cotswold by drawing a distinction between action leading to criminal damage, and therefore criminal sanctions, and simply trespassing without causing damage, for which I do not consider a criminal penalty appropriate. On the other hand, in the matter of serial trespassing or the continual breaking of restrictions on trespass, an appropriate response would be for the landowner to seek an injunction in the civil courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I do not want to go down that legal avenue, but the Minister must realise that taking civil action is long and difficult. It would impose a high burden on hard-pressed farmers. We should consider allowing farmers to use the criminal route against those who continually trespass and do damage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman's last few words are critical: he referred to those who trespass and cause damage. I have made it quite clear that those who cause damage expose themselves to criminal prosecution. Those who merely trespass—not only those who do so inadvertently, but those who do it deliberately—cannot justifiably be subjected to criminal prosecution. I realise that civil action will take time and that it will require due process—so will criminal prosecution—but I see no other way of dealing with the problem. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting some sort of summary penalty to be imposed at the time, in the open countryside? Should a warden grasp hold of the offender and accuse him of continual trespassing, even without the necessary evidence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> We are not dealing with trespass in someone's back garden, but with trespass on land that may be miles from the nearest town or village—and from the nearest police station. Secondly, does not amendment No. 131 assist in the process by putting a duty on the transgressor to provide adequate details to the aggrieved person. One problem with trespass is that if the person ejected from land decides not to give a name and address, or gives a false name and address, it is exceedingly difficult to do anything about it in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall deal later with amendment No. 131. The eagerness of hon. Gentlemen to make their points before I have had the chance to discuss the amendments is a little disconcerting. The hon. Gentleman said that it is unrealistic to expect the police to be on hand in wild, uncultivated country. The police would, of course, not be there for several hours—and they might never arrive. To make a breach of the restrictions automatically a criminal offence would achieve little or nothing, especially if no harm had been done. To criminalise all the activities listed in schedule 2 would be heavy handed and disproportionate.
<P>
We see no reason to impose such a penalty on those who, perhaps inadvertently, break the restrictions. I agree that a distinction should be drawn between those who deliberately and repeatedly go off access land or inappropriately go on to access land the next day, and I have tried to deal with that. However, some people may do so inadvertently. Trespass in itself has never been a criminal offence, except in certain limited circumstances—for instance, if the person is carrying a firearm or is on railway land. Parliament has rightly declined to make trespass an offence unless some harm or immediate potential for harm can be shown to exist. To criminalise trespass on access land would place landowners or open countryside in a far more favourable position than landowners generally, yet we are contemplating trespass on some of the most remote and uncultivated countryside. That does not make sense. Let me be clear: the right of access will cease to apply to those who breach any restrictions specified in schedule 2 or chapter II. It will not apply to any land that is excluded from access, and those in breach will be trespassers, who may be dealt with in the usual way. I remind the Committee that the Public Order Acts will continue to apply to aggravated trespass, which is a special offence.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, who has temporarily left the Room, mentioned the disruption of shooting or other sporting pursuits. People who engage in such disruption will be rendered trespassers, and are likely to fall foul of the Public Order Acts. What more protection do hon. Members want? I doubt whether people who are intent on damaging property care whether they are trespassing or whether they have a right of access, because such activity is their way of life.
<P>
Many of the restricted activities are already criminal offences, as my hon. Friends the Members for Clwyd, West and for Stafford correctly pointed out. Part III increases the penalty for those convicted of wildlife crimes. There is no reason to duplicate that provision in part I. Furthermore, we see no reason to criminalise all restricted activities. If activities that are not already subject to the criminal law cause specific problems, access authorities will be able to make byelaws to prohibit them. Such activities might include bathing in a watercourse that is used for a private water supply in a busy area.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall come to the hon. Lady's remarks and to the new clause shortly; I am saving those matters for my peroration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy spoke about model byelaws. I clearly understood his point, and I recognise that there may be a case for the use of byelaws to address specific problems in particular areas. However, we must be cautious about criminalising activities that do no harm. Swimming is a good example. It is generally innocuous, but, as I said, it can cause genuine problems in particular areas. Local byelaws and restrictions are the best way of dealing with such problems, rather than general criminal law. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy; it is appropriate to look to byelaws as an appropriate remedy and not to deal with local problems automatically or on a blanket basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has already given the assurance that I seek, but I should like to check. Will he reconsider the point made in amendment No. 213 about the protection of land restricted under clause 24? Will he also give assurance that the reckless disturbance references that he mentioned do not apply only to places of shelter and nest sites? Will he confirm that they relate not only to SSSIs but to land that will be restricted for other purposes, which may be species-specific?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am well aware of that issue. I think that I said on Second Reading that we are seeking protection for non-SSSI areas where wildlife may be equally significant and which can be dealt with in a species-specific manner. I think that I also said that we would make further proposals on the matter, which we are considering closely. I hope that I shall satisfy the hon. Gentleman when the Committee comes to later provisions, or on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who has been courteous in giving way so often. The category of people who inadvertently cause damage will probably be the most common cause of trouble. How will people claim compensation for damage? The only remedy is to bring an action for trespass and claim damages in the magistrates court, where an award of £5 a week might be made. No one will bother to do that unless the damage is significant, but someone will be out of pocket.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall deal with that problem when I respond to new clause 3, tabled by the hon. Member for Vale of York. Financial redress cannot be sought on a summary basis; it must go through the courts, which is a lengthy and sometimes bureaucratic process.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second type of amendment would widen the definition of land to which trespassers may not return. The Bill provides that they cannot return to any land that is in the same ownership for the remainder of the day. The intention is to prevent someone who has breached a restriction and been removed from access land from immediately walking back on to the land in exercise of the right of access. That is the most sensible way to deal with a possible abuse.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 proposes that trespassers should not be able to return to the same land for a calendar month. I doubt whether that would be a necessary or measured sanction or, indeed, enforceable, no matter how many wardens were appointed.
<P>
As for amendment No. 82, the hon. Member for Ashford might not realise that, in conjunction with amendments to schedule 2, such as amendment No. 104, which is about sleeping, and the restrictions in schedule 2, such as those on camping and bathing, it would have the extraordinary effect of making a criminal offence of sleeping, camping or bathing on any access land, however remote. I do not think that that was his intention, and it is not something that I could support.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 159, 84 and 126 would increase the area of land to which a trespasser may not return. That ranges from a prohibition on returning to any access land to a change in the definition of owner. A change in definition would extend the land to which a trespasser could not return from the agricultural holding on which the breach took place to land owned by the same freeholder. There is no justification for excluding a trespasser from such a wide area. The provision would not be enforceable. In addition, it is not realistic to assume that landowners would know whether a walker was responsible for breaching a restriction on someone else's land. The deterrent might also be disproportionate given that a breach of a restriction may be relatively minor. The offence needs some gradation. If people commit a criminal offence, they will be liable to prosecution in the usual way. The Bill reinforces that principle.
<P>
Amendment No. 128 proposes that, when someone is convicted of an offence on access land, the convicting court may also prohibit that person from entering any access land for a specified period. I accept that there may be a case for excluding someone from access land for a limited period if they commit an offence that results in significant damage or injury to anything or anyone on access land, such as the offence of egg stealing or poaching. Clause 39 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill, which is currently in Committee, provides for exclusion orders. The effect of an exclusion order would be to prohibit the offender from entering a place specified in the order for a specified period of not more than one year. That is a much better provision; rather than specifying a period of time, it enables the court to exercise its discretion, although it can make an order for up to a year.
<P>
Amendment No. 130 relates to enforcement of restrictions and proposes that landowners or their agents may be enforcement officers in addition to any wardens who are appointed. The Bill includes a power for local authorities to appoint wardens, although we envisage that they will not be needed in every area—they should be concentrated in honey-pot areas. Wardens appointed by local authorities will be seen as authoritative and independent. Landowners themselves have said that local authority wardens act as a useful go-between between owners and users, and we would expect them to liaise with landowners and user groups in assigning wardens to cover access land. Local authorities will have powers to appoint any fit person as a warden, so wardens need not necessarily be full-time employees of the appointing authority. Landowners and their agents do not need the powers provided by the amendment to enforce the restrictions in schedule 2; they already have them, so the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
We do not believe that we should create a criminal offence of obstructing a warden who is enforcing restrictions, as proposed in amendment No. 131. We consider that the existing law is sufficient. For example, it is already an offence to use threatening behaviour against another person. Therefore, we believe that the law already adequately protects wardens.
<P>
New clause 3 would have the effect that an access user who damages any wall, fence, hedge, stile or gate would be required to make good the damage and compensate the owner—a reasonable proposition, with which I sympathise. Like the hon. Member for Vale of York, we are not prepared to tolerate thoughtless damage to people's property. The new clause would require restitution for such damage, but it goes no further than the current law of the land. A person who damages another person's property commits both a criminal offence and a civil wrong. The person may be prosecuted for the offence and damages may be awarded in both the criminal and civil courts. Therefore, I completely accept the hon. Lady's point, but the new clause is unnecessary although well-intentioned.
<P>
In addition to the provisions for compensation arising from conviction for criminal damage, the person affected can also sue for civil damages. I accept that the process of law can take time, but any form of restitution that involves the courts will take time. If the person sues for civil damages, the case will be decided on the balance of probabilities, as opposed to the criminal burden of proof. It is difficult to see what more could be offered. A right for land owners to levy on-the-spot fines would be the alternative, but the hon. Lady is not seeking that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Is the Minister suggesting that the Government would have been more minded to accept the new clause if I had drafted it more broadly to include an element of compensation for the loss of land? Does he not accept the spirit in which it is drafted? It is a good will gesture to land owners. It would encourage people who cause not wilful damage—such damage is adequately covered—but accidental damage to report it voluntarily to the land owner, obviating the need for court action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not suggesting that the new clause might have been more acceptable if the hon. Lady had drafted it more widely. Her ingenuity in seeking a means of securing a place on the statute book for her new clause knows no limits. I cannot agree to add a good will gesture to land owners. I have already shown great good will to the Country Landowners Association and others. I have seen them many times and expect to continue to do so, while the Bill proceeds and afterwards. As I have repeatedly told land owners, I am anxious to protect their legitimate interest.
<P>
I should also say to the hon. Lady that there is nothing to stop a socially minded citizen leaving a note, as one should if one accidentally damages someone else's property—for instance, if one damages someone's light when reversing a car, as I did the other day. The other person may then make contact and proper restitution may be made in the normal way. I would expect a publicly minded citizen who caused damage to a wall to ring up the farmer or, if appropriate, to leave a note on the gate. I do not know whether there are many such people.
<P>
The hon. Lady made an interesting point when she alluded to the Wychwood case; my omniscient officials immediately drew attention to the details. Lord Rotherwick was compelled by order to create a 1.5 km path through his woodland. He claimed £1 million compensation, which seems high, subsequently raising the sum to £1.5 million. The Lands Tribunal ruled that the claim was out of time because the path was created in the later 1980s. However, the Ramblers Association and Oxfordshire county council expressed regret because they would have liked damages to be considered by the tribunal.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt exhaustively with all the points. I understand and entirely support the view that trespass leading to criminal damage should be criminally prosecuted. However, making trespass that does not cause damage a criminal offence cannot be justified. We must be proportionate in our response. The Bill is sufficient and proportionate; I hope that that is acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister has raised an interesting matter by suggesting that Lord Rotherwick would have been able to claim compensation in that case. Was the Minister suggesting that any person whose property was devalued by the Bill would be able to claim compensation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not suggesting that. I raised the case, possibly unwisely, because the hon. Lady had alluded to it and because it seemed interesting. There might have been an expectation of compensation, had the matter not been ruled out of time because the action had been brought by the owner far too late. It is possible that there would have been compensation, but the issue was very specific—a path created through a woodland—whereas the Bill is about a different issue. It is a reasonable assumption that the compulsory creation of a path through a privately-owned wood, against the owner's will, would give rise to compensation, but the Bill does not cover that.
<P>
I hope that, for the reasons that I have given, hon. Members will accept that the Bill makes balanced and adequate provision for the purposes that we are considering, and—except for those that I have promised to reconsider—not press the amendments.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank the Minister for his full response to an important group of amendments, concerning one of the central problems in the Bill.
<P>
I am interested in the Minister's remarks about a light-touch regime for landowners. I gently suggest that perhaps those who must live under it may not feel that it is a light touch. I am not sure that the Minister's argument that criminal action will be contemplated only as a last resort and after several other stages makes the regime any lighter in touch. As was pointed out in the debate, the amendments presented the Minister with various choices. I understand his arguments about the disadvantages of introducing new criminal offences, but it is not clear to me whether he was arguing that the relevant provisions create no new occasions of damage that are not already covered by the criminal law. If so, I accept his assurance, but I am not sure. I suspect that actions that may not be criminal offences could be offences under the Bill. I expect that the Minister will take guidance on that point and perhaps reassure me.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 would not invoke the criminal law, but would establish a tougher civil regime. The Minister rejected that, saying that enforcement would be difficult in practical terms, but it would not be much more difficult than at present. Presumably, the only way to enforce a decision to turn someone off an area for the rest of the day would be for the warden—who would no doubt have better things to get on with—to hang around the area. If the practicality argument holds against amendment No. 83, it holds against the clause. It is not desperately convincing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy argued that amendment No. 131 would be a simple way of introducing greater equity to matters. He also suggested the alternative of byelaws as set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. A range of options is open to the Government and I hope that they will consider them, because it is felt at present that possible infringements by different groups of people are not treated equally under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman hear the Minister mention that it would be possible under the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill to exclude a person from ``a place specified''? Does he agree that the crucial question is whether ``a place specified'' can be taken to be the generic place—access land? Those who, for example, steal eggs, should be excluded from any land where they could steal eggs rather than the specific part of the land where they have been apprehended committing an offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's general point, but as, happily, I am not a lawyer I cannot comment on whether that kind of generic application of the clause would apply. One could think of other kinds of generic application. The phrase ``a place'' could mean all the land owned by an individual landowner or all the land farmed by a particular tenant. It could be interpreted a number of ways. I do not know what the legal position would be. As the hon. Gentleman says, it would be good if the Minister could clarify that point. Certainly, the Government should address the real issues here either in this Bill or in future Bills, as the Minister has said that they will.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Here we stray on to the same point that my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold raised earlier, the definition of owners. The amendments provide different options, but all have the common feature of expanding the definition of owner given in clause 2. During the second sitting of the Committee, when the Minister was absent, the Under-Secretary referred to the case of the Duke of Northumberland who owns 90,000 acres. He said that a person will not necessarily be excluded from all 90,000 acres, particularly as the Duke himself does not know where the boundaries of his land lie. He said that light-heartedly, but I use his remark to raise a fundamental misunderstanding about land ownership on the part of those who drafted the Bill.
<P>
The Bill and the Under-Secretary's remark imply that, when the rights are attributed to a tenant rather than the owner, they apply to a smaller parcel of land. Two issues need to be addressed. First, there is the issue of what land should be covered. In other words, from what land should the person be excluded for the day? Secondly, how does the walker know who owns or leases the land? We debated that earlier, but it is important here. In deciding who is categorised as the owner, we need to consider how easy it will be to inform the potential miscreant which land they have to stay off for the rest of the day. Applying ownership to farm tenancies, as the Bill appears to do, massively oversimplifies the issue and is based on the belief that this means a smaller parcel of land than ownership would. The reality is that land ownership can fall into a multitude of categories. There are the large estates, such as the Duke of Northumberland's, but there are countless owners of smaller parcels of land, sometimes as small as a few acres. Many owners have a few hundred acres; some farm the land themselves and some have tenant farmers. Tenancies may cover only a few acres or thousands of acres, and they may be held with more than one landowner. A tenant may have the tenancy of several parcels of land. That is so particularly if one of the owners is a national body—perhaps a conservation charity. Such bodies—for instance, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds—often purchase areas of particularly attractive moor or hill land, letting them to whoever farms the adjoining land.
<P>
The Bill mentions farm tenancies as they are defined under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 and the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold may have been mistaken when he said that the Bill should have referred also to the 1948 Act; I believe that it was consolidated in the 1986 Act. However, my hon. Friend is a chartered surveyor—I am not—and he will probably correct me.
<P>
The Bill provides that farm tenancies are effectively owned by the tenant. In that case, the true owner would lose the right to exclude; it would pass to the tenant. That seems fundamentally wrong. It is not a simple matter. It will not necessarily cover only smaller parcels of land. I accept the logic of ownership including farm tenants, but if the land is tenanted it will exclude the owner. It is a recipe for chaos. Which land is included? What will be the result of the tenant having more than one landlord—will it be the land of the tenant or the land that the tenant rents from the landlord? Many questions remain to be answered.
<P>
Ministers will not be surprised that my second point relates to shooting tenancies. I am aware that the Committee has mixed feelings about grouse shooting, gamekeepers and landowners. I know that the views of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), are different from mine. However, he is a reasonable man and I know that he will put those feelings and consider the matter objectively.
<P>
Many shooting tenants have exactly the same role on the land as farming tenants. They should therefore be included in the Bill. Indeed, so should other tenancies. Amendment No. 311 refers to anyone to whom the landowner has granted the right of occupancy for a period of not less than 12 months—in other words, to someone who has an enduring right to occupy the land. That would include shooting tenants. It would occasionally include other uses. Shooting tenants may not always be tenants in law but licensees. However, the result is the same. Such tenants may be individuals or companies. The tenancies are not held only for the shooting days, as was suggested in a previous debate, but usually for the whole of a calendar year and often for a number of years in succession, because it cannot be done effectively only one season at a time. Shooting tenants occupy the land for the full 365 days of the year and often for many years in succession.
<P>
Much open moorland has no farm tenant because it cannot be farmed economically. Managing the land for shooting may be the only form of land management taking place, and shooting may be the only economic return. In that respect, it is no different from farming sheep or cattle, in as much as the purpose of the activity is to generate an economic return. Land used for shooting could be just as intensively managed as land used to rear sheep or cattle.
<P>
If I make the point now, it need not be repeated in later debates, but looking after moorland is a 365-day a year job. Moorland keepers are on the land almost every day, and not just on the days when shooting occurs, as some hon. Members seem to imagine.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the heather is in itself a time-intensive activity. For example, a recent article states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Game Conservancy research has shown that ideally for red grouse, 15 per cent. of the heather biomass should be grazed annually. Less than that, grouse decline, and at about 25 per cent. they decline rapidly.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The worst scenario was a combination of sheep and rabbits, which took a staggering—and of course disastrous—85 per cent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of heather biomass. That does not just destroy the land for shooting purposes; it destroys heather moorland generally. Once heather moorland is destroyed by 85 per cent., recovery is almost impossible without active management, probably involving reseeding.
<P>
Moorland management also involves predator control, which goes on throughout the year. In addition, one has to count one's stock. Hon. Members may be surprised to learn that keepers have to spend a significant amount of time out on the moor counting and estimating their stock of birds.
<P>
I am trying to demonstrate that the role of somebody who manages a moor for shooting is no different from that of somebody who manages it for grazing by sheep or cattle. As an occupier, such a person is in exactly the same position as a tenant farmer. The amendment would allow people with an interest in land to register that interest, which is one way of reflecting the points that I have made. Amendment No. 311 would extend the clause to cover anyone to whom the landowner has granted occupancy for a year or more. The amendments are alternative, not complementary, but both try to recognise that there is no clear land area distinction of the sort implied by the clause.
<P>
I return to the example of the Duke of Northumberland. It is probably reasonable to say that nobody should be excluded for the day from an area of 90,000 acres. Indeed, it would probably take somebody all day to leave such an area. It is more important for the legislation to be consistent. It is rather odd for the question whether a person happens to be on a plot of land owned by the Duke of Northumberland or on a site occupied by his tenant to determine the size of the area that he must leave. Snowdonia and the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy contain a vast range of ownership types and scales. Ironically, and almost by sheer chance, a miscreant may find himself excluded from a plot of land comprising 50 or 80 acres in one area and from a plot of several thousand acres if he breaches the rules in another area 200 yd away. That approach is not consistent.
<P>
The amendments address a key problem to which we shall return later during our consideration of the Bill. A number of provisions contain the term ``owner'', but the reference contained in the clause needs greater simplicity and consistency, as it is currently complicated by the distinction between owner or tenant. In my view, the clause should refer to owner and tenant. The term ``tenant'' should not depend on the particular legislation listed in the clause. It should include other forms of tenant who have occupied land for at least a year.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I rise in support of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) and amendments Nos. 238 and 311. I want to add to the sensible approach that he took. I know that Ministers take the matter seriously. I have already declared an interest—I am a trustee of the Game Conservancy. Not only the DETR but the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food thinks highly of its work on conservation matters, especially in the uplands. The question of ownership is important, especially m relation to such matters.
<P>
Ministers do not fully understand the way in which tenants are likely to be set against landlords. The relationship works well in many cases, but vesting the management decision in tenants will not work. That is a hopeless solution to a real problem. A tenant vested as the owner of a property will be allowed 28 days for a management decision on a question of closure. That is not enough for the events that my hon. Friend mentioned. There are many other such events—lambing, tupping, gathering, bracken spraying, shooting, grouse counts and important keepering tasks. As my hon. Friend said, shooting days are merely by-days for a keeper. They will be out seven days a week and on call 24 hours a day to look after what is a crop. The work is hard and demanding.
<P>
When representatives of the Game Conservancy called on the Minister, who received them courteously, they left him with charts that showed the important timings of the main periods of game keeping activity. The activities, on grouse moors in particular, involve heather burning, fox control, crow cage trapping, stake trapping and shooting days.
<P>
There is also the question of the management of moorland, especially with regard to the breeding season of upland waders in England—quite apart from grouse—such as the golden plover, the curlew, the lapwing, the dunlin, the greenshank, the snipe and the red grouse. All those birds are natives of moorland. The landlord, not the tenant, should be responsible for running areas.
<P>
The clause is important and leads to the question of the fundamental importance of key game habitats. I do not know whether the Minister has seen the wonderful, major book produced by the Game Conservancy called ``A Question of Balance''. If he has not, I will arrange for the organisation to send him a copy. It goes into great detail about not only birds and conservation aspects but, most important, habitats. We are considering habitats in particular.
<P>
The Minister agrees that heather moorland is one of the country's most priceless and beautiful assets. It is considered internationally important and its retention is the highest conservation priority. It is important that the way in which it is managed is carefully enshrined in the Bill and that the current effective practice is not upset. I do not mean to stray outside the terms of the amendments, but I must return to the 28 day-period and the management and ownership of the ground. A period of 28 days is not enough for the management of a priceless asset of great international importance.
<P>
Regardless of the Committee's views on shooting, it should accept that the shape and looks of the uplands—the well preserved, well conserved and well run moors—are a result of the value and sporting rights of shooting. The care, effort, experience and talent of thousands of people who are involved in the uplands has maintained the most beautiful scenery in the land. It would be wrong to give the management structure away for the sake of a minor change. We should vest the management of the land in those who own it rather than their tenants.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made the gist of his amendment clear. I strongly support him and urge the Committee to understand that we need to reach a sensible conclusion on this important matter. I received a fax this morning from a moorland owner who says that he and many of his colleagues are anxious that they should be able to continue to manage the moorland for the greatest benefit of the uplands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I apologise for straying into such detail when we discussed the previous amendments and I do not want to detain the Committee for long. We are producing a recipe for further conflict between people with different land rights. Owning land is often complex. The ability of an owner in fee simple to grant varying degrees of rights might cause problems. A licensee may have virtually the same rights as someone who is subject to a farm business tenancy, but only one category is covered by the clause. A long lease on sporting rights might be a more important right than the rights of the owner in fee simple, let alone those of the farm tenant. There are omissions.
<P>
The clause does not allude to the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, which may well have been consolidated in 1976 because the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 created a different class of agricultural tenancy. The Under-Secretary will need to take advice on that. Each landholding is different and will cause difficulties. In some circumstances, estate owners will have land that is owned in fee simple, subject to the Agricultural Holdings Acts, held on long sporting leases, subject to mineral working leases, or a combination of those categories, which could be complex.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to give agricultural tenants the ability to exercise their rights in clause 2. No one would argue with that, but there should be a mechanism for the agricultural tenant and the owner to reach an agreement. That should include someone with a long lease of sporting rights.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, we travelled over this territory on the second day of our deliberations. The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex said that 28 days is not enough to manage heather moors. It is open to the owner of a heather moor to convince the access authority that restrictions are needed for longer. I return to a point that, no doubt, will be made many times during our deliberations—something that one must pinch oneself to recall after listening to all the horrors that lie in wait for landowners once the access provisions become law—vast areas of uplands, including areas every bit as special as those described by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, are already open to the general public without the dire effects that some anticipate.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments would widen the definition of land to which trespassers may not return by another means. Amendment No. 238 would give those with an interest in land—which could be any interest, such as sporting rights—an option to designate that interest. A trespasser would then be unable to return to any land subject to the same designated interest.
<P>
As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, concern was expressed in all earlier debate about the operation of clause 2(4). Therefore, it might be helpful if I explain again how the legislation will work. Clause 2(4) provides that someone in breach of any of the restrictions under chapter II or schedule 2 may not return to land in the same ownership on that day. ``Owner'' in the context of ownership is defined in clause 41 as the person entitled to the rack rent of the land, generally the freeholder, but clause 2(5) modifies that definition to provide that, if there is an agricultural tenant, the tenant is the owner.
<P>
There is some misunderstanding about clauses 2(4) and 2(5), the purpose of which is to demarcate the land to which the trespasser may not return. The clauses do not affect the right of anyone who has the power to exclude trespassers to exclude them from that demarcated land, whether that person is the owner, tenant, sporting lessee or grazier of that land, their agents or gamekeepers. The matter of determining whether someone has the power to exclude others is a matter of private law between the freeholder and his tenants, lessees and graziers. For example, a sporting lease might provide that the lessee could turn away anyone who enters the land without the owner's or lessee's permission. I want to make it quite clear that we are considering changes to the territory to which trespassers may not return for the rest of the day, not changes to who may eject trespassers from that territory.
<P>
I shall use an example to illustrate the effect of amendment No. 238. If a person has shooting interests in several areas of land and designates each of those interests, the effect of the amendment would be that a trespasser on one parcel of land would not be able to return to any land in which that person had an interest. I certainly do not know how a walker is to know where that land is, nor is it clear how the person with shooting interests would enforce such a restriction on multiple estates.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 311 and 294 would have a similar effect to an amendment that we discussed several sittings ago. They would remove tenant farmers from the definition of owner, where appropriate. They would also include in the definition of owner anyone to whom the owner has assigned occupancy of the land for at least a year. Since the assigned occupancy would be within the boundary of the freehold land, the amendment would have no material effect, except to exclude a farm tenancy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In reading his brief, the Under-„Secretary said that the matter of who could deter a trespasser was a matter of private law. The Under-Secretary will know that virtually all tenancy agreements provide that the landlord and tenant may join one another in an action for trespass. The Bill overturns that longstanding legal provision. Will the Under-Secretary explain why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> There is a misunderstanding here. The Bill will not have that effect. Owners' rights will not be affected by the clauses. In practice, we do not need the amendments. Clause 2(4) provides for the exclusion of trespassers for the remainder of the day on land effectively within the same freehold ownership or, where there is an agricultural tenancy, the same tenancy. To go further that would engender confusion as to where the errant walker can and cannot go. If a walker does move on to other land held by a different owner, he must continue to abide by the restrictions or he will lose his right of access to that land too. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary has tried to help us. He has rightly emphasised that we are discussing the issue of the demarcation of land rather than the power to evict people for contravening clause 2 and schedule 2. On that, I am four square with him. The wider issues of ownership and the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex are important and we will return to them when we come to the 28-„day rule and weekends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> This is the first time in Committee that the Under-Secretary has not dealt sufficiently seriously with an important point. It is true that a large area of the uplands is already open. Much of this is desert. I was not referring—nor was my hon. Friend—to those uplands. I accept that people will be able to apply to close those, but that will result only in endless applications, all of them genuine, covering long periods, to enable the owner to undertake the necessary tasks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right. However, the amendments are, as the Under-Secretary rightly said, about the land from which people are removed if they contravene their obligations and responsibilities. They are not about land management, on which I stand four square with my hon. Friend. We will come to that issue later in our sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If some of the uplands for which access already exists are desert, that is not due to thousands of walkers tramping over them. One reason, among others, may be over-grazing. I have walked from Holy Island to Barnard castle in two shifts. For days at a time we never met another person. In the whole 150 miles, I doubt that I passed more than 20 walkers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary is used to being isolated on various issues, so being physically isolated in that way just adds to his experience. The point he makes is right, of course. There are a multitude of reasons why some areas of land have become deserts, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex describes them. Both he and I want to ensure that those are not added to, and that some redress is achieved. We will return to these issues.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is right to point out that the issue is one of demarcation. However, his argument was less convincing from that point on. He referred to the issue of how a walker will know whose land he is on. Whatever form of demarcation is chosen, the question of how a walker is informed about ownership remains. The importance of the question is not minimised by having this particular form of demarcation. An inconsistency is created because the clause refers to agricultural tenancies rather than owners. Some individuals or companies do not let all the land in their ownership, some they farm in hand—in other words, they farm it themselves. The inconsistency is in the fact that the miscreant walker with whom we are concerned must know the whereabouts of the land to which he or she is prevented from returning. In that respect the Under-Secretary is right, but I do not see how transferring the relevant parcel of land from the owner to the tenant makes a jot of difference. Ownership might, in the extreme example that was used, relate to the holdings of the Duke of Northumberland. Equally, it might relate to a small parcel of land—50 or 100 acres—in the hills. That provides no consistency. A tenant could have a few hundred or many thousands of acres—possibly more than many owners. A shift of 50 or 100 yd in the site of the offence—say, to the other side of the nearest stone wall—could mean the miscreant was in a wholly different situation with respect to ownership of the land. I can see no logic in the arrangement.
<P>
If the objective of the provision is to enable a miscreant to be removed or prevented from returning to a piece of land of a reasonable scale—not hundreds of square miles but more than a few acres, as anything else would be meaningless—we should tackle the question in such quantitative terms and not by ownership or occupancy.
<P>
A final technical point that I did not mention in my introduction, and which the Under-Secretary really will need to think about, concerns the fact that often the same individuals are concerned in both tenancy and ownership. For tax reasons—inheritance tax, usually—it is common for a farming company, whose directors may be the owners of the land, to be the tenant of the family.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No doubt we can reflect on that point, but perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. The person with the right of possession has the right to evict, and nothing in the Bill will change that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I was not in any way suggesting otherwise. We are concerned not with the person with the right to evict, but with the demarcation of the area of land from which someone may be evicted. However, I fail to understand the logic of transfer from owner to tenant randomly according to whether there is a farm tenant. From the frown on the Under-„Secretary's face I am obviously not making a good case. However, there seems to be no logic in narrowing things down to tenancies when it is quite a random matter whether land is tenanted, untenanted or farmed in hand by the owner. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reflect on that and the technical point that I have just mentioned. I shall keep waffling for a moment so that he can read his notes in case he wants to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I am anxious to help in arriving at a sensible answer. Will my hon. Friend endorse again the point that we both tried to make—that the amendment is not an attempt to stop access? It is to do with the way that moorland and other land have been managed for generations. Often, the only way to manage it is a traditional way, but the arrangements work and do not result in confrontation. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and I are anxious that, if we go down the road suggested by the Bill, we shall have set up a three-way confrontation. That would be a thoroughly unhappy state of affairs, not wanted by anyone who has any part in the running of the uplands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is right on the wider issue. We have accepted ad nauseam that the Bill will become law and we are concerned with making it a practicable, workable piece of legislation.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We may have to live with the fact that there may be a difference between us. We are trying to focus on an identifiable area of land from which the right of access is lost—the area to which the exclusion relates. We are not willing to contemplate the loss of access to the entire freehold estate, as the hon. Gentleman proposes, when there has been a breach on just one of the estate's tenancies. The hon. Gentleman says that the method is arbitrary; perhaps it is, but at least it has the merit of addressing the territory on which the offence—if that is what it was—occurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The method is arbitrary and wholly illogical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am not sure how logic comes into it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Logic does come into it. If there were two miscreants, and one committed an offence on tenanted land of 500 acres and was prevented from returning to those 500 acres and the other committed an offence 100 yards away on land that was not tenanted, but farmed in hand by the owner, who happened to own 10,000 acres, the effect of sanction on those individuals would be utterly different. How would the Under-Secretary explain and justify that one would be evicted from 500 acres and the other would be evicted from 10,000 acres by virtue of the clause? That is the illogicality of the proposal. Perhaps we shall have to disagree on the matter as I find the provision wholly absurd. We will come to many wider issues of ownership but, in order to expedite matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
