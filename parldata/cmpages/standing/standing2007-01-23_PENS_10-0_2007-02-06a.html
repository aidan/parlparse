					<a name="0702072000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Welcome back
to the Chair, Mr. Taylor. We come to one of the big issues
in our deliberations. I make no apology for going through the new
clause in some detail, because it deals with a crucial issue for the
Committee and for the legislation before us. It replaces the
possibility of oral evidence, so I am going to be the Punch and Judy
man, giving the Pensions Policy Institute&#146;s views on means
testing and the Government&#146;s views on means testing, in a kind
of seaside show. We could have had the real thing had the Government
taken a different view. However, we have the promise of another
seminar, on 20 February, and Members will be keen to put that date in
their diary&#151;while tickets last. I, personally, am really looking
forward to it.</div>
					<a name="0702072000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Means-testing
matters because it is on the increase. We are discussing a system under
which we have large-scale means-testing, despite the fact that the
current Chancellor said when Labour was in opposition that it was his
party&#146;s aim to reduce means-testing. Almost 50 per cent. of
people now retiring are means-tested. I am on common ground when I say
that if we carry on as we are, the figure will rise to 70 or 75 per
cent. by the middle of this century. There is a sort of consensus that
that cannot be allowed to continue; it was very much a theme of the
Turner report.</div>
					<a name="0702072000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister extolled the virtues of means-testing in a previous sitting,
saying that it put money into people&#146;s pockets and that it was
therefore a good thing. However, it is a bad thing for all sorts of
reasons. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 327</div>does not necessarily provide help to those who need it most. For
example, about 1.5 million people who are entitled to pension credit do
not claim it, despite large expenditure on advertising campaigns, and
indeed, the sterling efforts of the Pension Service. I have visited my
local service, and it has pushed the boat out on home visits and so on.
I am sure that that has happened throughout the country.</div>
					<a name="0702072000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">People do not claim pension
credit for a number of reasons. They may think that it is all too
complicated or intrusive, or that they could not possibly qualify. If
one reads across to the means-tested benefit with the worst claim
record, council tax benefit, elderly constituents of mine who own their
own homes, so they are capital rich but cash poor, do not imagine for a
moment that they could claim council tax benefit.</div>
					<a name="0702072000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a problem because a
large proportion of people who are entitled to means-tested benefits
will never claim them. When pension credit was introduced, in a massive
act of cynicism, the Treasury itself calculated that 1.4 million people
would never claim it. The Treasury has a shrewd idea about the limits
of means-tested benefits.</div>
					<a name="0702072000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Means-testing also makes it
difficult, if not impossible, for people and their financial advisers
to predict whether it is worth their while saving for retirement. That
is a key issue. There is much discussion, quite rightly, within and
outside Government about the buzz phrase &#147;financial
accountability&#148;. Everything is relative, I suppose, but one of
the gloomier aspects of those seminars that seemed to stretch over last
summer was the average person&#146;s dismally low ability to think
through their financial options, particularly on pensions. I do not
have the survey with me, but a recent study showed that if anything,
the problem is becoming worse among younger people. The new generation
that is coming up ought to be worried because they will live longer and
save less, but they have even less understanding of the system.
Means-testing makes it difficult, because it is a disincentive to save.
That is why we support measures that are part of a package to boost the
basic state pension. We concluded before the last election&#151;I do
not want to get into this debate again&#151;that the only reliable
way to get help to the poorest pensioners was to do just
that.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0702072000523"></a>
							<b class="B">Mark
Pritchard</b> (The Wrekin) (Con): On that important point, my
hon. Friend is right. Apart from means-testing being a disincentive for
saving, does he agree with Help the Aged, which suggested that it was,
in fact,
pernicious?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000524"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> The Americans would say that
&#147;pernicious&#148; is a ten-dollar word, but I suppose that it
covers the point. The word that I often use is
&#147;cancerous&#148;, because means-testing eats away at private
savings. Although other factors may be at work as well, much of the
collapse in savings generally since 1997 is attributable to the surge
in means-tested benefits. I cast no aspersions on those who are
involved at the end of a phone or on home visits in trying to deliver
means-tested benefits, but, with the best will in the world, there are
natural limits to how far they can be pressed on those who need or
deserve them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000525"></a>Mark
Pritchard:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that, while we can be
technocratic about the details and discuss the minutiae of a Bill,
means-testing helpfully draws us out from the details and reveals a
fundamental philosophical difference between the positions of the
Opposition and the
Government?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000526"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> There is a philosophical difference. As my hon.
Friend invites me on to that territory, let me deal with it. I believe
that the Chancellor, who is about to be Prime Minister, actually likes
people being dependent on the state in all sorts of ways, whether
employed directly by it or dependent on it to earn a decent living
through means-tested benefits and so on. As Conservatives, we take a
different view. We believe that the more people are dependent on
handouts from the state, the less likely some of them are even to claim
them in the first place, and the more demoralising it is for people who
do claim them. That is another extremely good reason for wanting not
just to stop the increase in means-testing but to reverse
it.</div>
					<a name="0702072000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the issues
that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
(Mr. Hammond) raised on Second Reading was how we start
rolling back means-testing in a clear-cut manner. One way was to gain
consensus on an aspiration to do so, which means that, as and when
funding is available, whoever is in Government will boost the state
pension above and beyond what is in the current
package.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000527"></a>The
Minister for Pensions Reform (James Purnell):
						</b> Since we are
on the topic, does the hon. Gentleman agree that another way to put the
philosophical difference is that pension credit has managed to
lift 2 million people out of absolute poverty, and 1 million
out of relative poverty? It has in large part corrected the disgraceful
situation that we inherited from the Conservatives. He said in response
to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) earlier
in this Committee&#146;s proceedings that his party would not have
introduced the pension credit. Does that not show clearly the
philosophical difference between the two
parties?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000528"></a>
								Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> The Minister is being a little selective. When I
said that we would not have introduced the pension credit, I was
responding to the allegation that we would scrap it. That is not our
policy. The last thing that the pensions system needs is another period
of turmoil and change. The key issue is reducing the amount of
means-testing, and people&#146;s dependence on
it.</div>
					<a name="0702072000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can bandy
figures around. The Minister is aware that there are still 2 million
pensioners living in poverty, 1 million of whom live in deep,
persistent poverty. On any view, he is not reaching the 1.5
million or 1.6 million who are not claiming the pension credit
to which they are entitled. My basic point is that there are limits to
means-testing.</div>
					<a name="0702072000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
notice that the Minister did not respond to my point about a consensus
on the aspiration to boost the state pension even further when fiscal
circumstances allow. That, in the long run, must be the way to make a
real difference to the amount of means-testing. Within the limits of
this Bill, the issue is whether a particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 329</div>level of means-testing will still prevail after the reforms and, if so,
what it will be&#151;I will come to that in a moment&#151;and what
effect it will have on the success or failure of the system of personal
accounts.</div>
					<a name="0702072000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Association of British Insurers points out in one of its briefings, the
Government project that the figure for means-testing will fall from
about 45 per cent to around 29 per cent by 2050 post the reforms. It
says that this will be a</div>
					<a name="0702072000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;welcome shift that would return
means-testing entitlement to its previous levels.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important, in parenthesis, to make
the point, and I think someone made the point this morning, that there
will always be some means-testing in the system. There will always be
an irreducible minimum of people who need means-testing to deliver to
them the top-up benefits of whatever sort that they actually
need.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000529"></a>Mark
Pritchard:
						</b> It is very relevant that on Second Reading this
issue was covered in great detail. The possible reduction in the number
of people claiming means-tested benefits was mentioned. The googly in
that is the fact that we are likely to see an increase in the number of
economic migrants coming from the new European Union countries, which
will completely throw out all the figures that the Government have
suggested. We have had 2 million new economic migrants since 1997 and
0.5 million are expected in the next year. During questions on the
Floor of the House the Secretary of State admitted that people coming
from European Union countries would have their pensions topped up by
pension credit.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000531"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a perfectly legitimate
point and we had a lengthy debate earlier on in the Committee about
so-called frozen pensions. One thing is clear, whether people are
coming from eastern Europe or going from here to other countries, there
are enormous movements of people&#151;both young people who want
decent jobs with reasonable pay and older people who are looking to
retire in other countries or over here. One of the issues that has to
be addressed is to what extent they are likely to be in receipt of
top-up benefits. That could be pension credit here. If my hon. Friend
remembers, there was a discussion about whatever the equivalent is to
top up the incomes of pensioners in Canada, Australia or wherever. That
is an issue that we shall have to come back to.</div>
					<a name="0702072000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">And in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

called&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000533"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Indeed. I was saying that the ABI was concerned
because, as it says, alternative modelling suggests that means-testing
will not fall by as much as the Government have predicted. It also
says:</div>
					<a name="0702072000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
long-term forecast of this nature includes a large number of
assumptions and so can never be certain.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 330</div>
					<a name="0702072000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that issue, I want to deal in a bit of
detail with the assumptions made by the different warring factions on
the levels of means-testing. Those assumptions are very important. The
ABI says:</div>
					<a name="0702072000040"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
ABI believes that much greater clarity is needed on the impact of the
Bill on future levels of means testing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with that, hence new clause
2.</div>
					<a name="0702072000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that the new
clause says&#151;it seems perfectly modest to me&#151;is that the
Secretary of State should from time to time lay reports from the
Government Actuary on rates and coverage of pension credit entitlement,
likely future rates&#151;projections into the future&#151;and
anything else relevant to the eligibility for and take-up of pension
credit. The reports should be published every five years. Whichever
party is in government, it is important that the Government focus,
whether they like it or not, on the penetration of means-tested
benefits following these
reforms.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000489"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0702072000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first view
on all this is, of course, that of the Pensions Policy Institute, which
disagrees quite significantly in its projections as to the range of
pension credit eligibility under the Government&#146;s proposals. The
PPI&#146;s document on pension credit, produced some months ago,
states that</div>
					<a name="0702072000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;future
eligibility for Pension Credit is very
uncertain.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">It therefore
presents its estimates as a range and sets out how it has arrived at
that range.</div>
					<a name="0702072000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to be
clear, it is not that I think that the Department is wrong and the PPI
is right, or vice versa; it is simply that the PPI is working on a
different set of assumptions. It is our job, in the absence of any oral
evidence session, to try to work out which set of assumptions is more
likely to be the case. I think that the PPI&#146;s argument is that
the Government&#146;s assumptions are on the conservative
side.</div>
					<a name="0702072000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider
the PPI&#146;s assumptions, particularly in the modelling paper that
it published alongside its report. First, income from the basic state
pension is projected to grow in line with average earnings growth,
reflecting the new policy. That seems perfectly reasonable. Secondly,
income from the state earnings-related pension scheme/the state second
pension grows considerably faster than earnings, as people receive more
SERPS and S2P as the system matures, especially at the lower end of the
pensioner income
distribution.</div>
					<a name="0702072000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
private pension income grows by less than earnings, reflecting current
experience of pension contributions not keeping pace with the
increasing costs of private pension provision. That seems to me an
important issue and one on which there is a legitimate ground for
dispute between the PPI and the Government. How does one project the
growth in private pension income into the future? I guess that, if
personal accounts are a roaring success, those figures will have to be
adjusted. We shall return in a moment to how the Government approach
any assumptions to do with private pension
income.</div>

income from other sources&#151;including non-pension saving, other
state benefits such as disability benefits, and earnings&#151;grows
broadly in line with average earnings, reflecting growth in earnings

state benefits. We have heard in debates in Committee that some
benefits will still be pegged to prices, rather than
earnings.</div>
					<a name="0702072000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PPI
says&#151;I suppose that it would say this&#151;that those
projections seem
reasonable</div>
					<a name="0702072000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;compared to
what we know about the likely trends in each of these components. They
are equivalent to assuming all income grows at 2 per cent. a year,
real, between 2005 and
2050&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PPI then
says&#151;this is the really important
bit&#151;:</div>
					<a name="0702072000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
this scenario, Pension Credit eligibility under the White Paper
proposals remains roughly at today&#146;s levels of 45 per cent. to
50 per cent&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has
examined other models, and it concludes that its
estimates</div>
					<a name="0702072000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;give a range of
the possible extent of Pension Credit...of one-third to two-thirds
in 2050, with a base case of no change from today&#146;s level of 45
per cent. to 50 per cent...This would mean between 4 million and 6
million households eligible for Pension
Credit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
PPI&#146;s document is helpful, because it sets out the basis on
which it has approached the issue. In fairness, it has been in
discussion for some time with Department for Work and Pensions
officials, trying to narrow any gap between them. Certainly as recently
as last month, when we contacted the PPI, it confirmed that it
was</div>
					<a name="0702072000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;still in discussion
with DWP analysts to understand the differences between our respective
projections of Pension
Credit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to say
that it is working not to &#147;close the gap&#148; between the
projections,</div>
					<a name="0702072000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but rather
to understand the different assumptions that drive the results and
identify scenarios that are consistent with each
projection.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
PPI ends charitably by
saying:</div>
					<a name="0702072000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Projections
of this nature are inherently uncertain, and there is not a single
right answer!&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
institute also tells me in a separate
e-mail:</div>
					<a name="0702072000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are
unlikely to change our projections, because they still seem reasonable
to us.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more recent
item may have come under the umbrella of written evidence, but I think
that all members of the Committee have had the benefit of the
PPI&#146;s latest briefing note, No. 36, which
asks:</div>
					<a name="0702072000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Will the
Pensions Bill solve the problems of state
pensions?&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Answers on a
postcard, please to the Minister.</div>
					<a name="0702072000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institute goes on in the

which is
headed:</div>
					<a name="0702072000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Incentives
to save in Personal Accounts will depend on individuals&#146;
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is only
fair to summarise the paper in a bit of detail. The institute makes the
point that without reform,</div>
					<a name="0702072000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the proportion of households
eligible for Pension Credit was expected to grow...to 70-85 per
cent. by 2050.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It states
that there will be a reduction in the reformed system,</div>
					<a name="0702072000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;although 30 per cent. of
households being eligible would be historically high for Pension Credit
and its predecessor
benefits&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div>
					<a name="0702072000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Government
expectations of private saving were too high.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 332</div>
					<a name="0702072000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I shall return to the
Government&#146;s approach and assumptions shortly, and I hope that
the Minister will be even more helpful about that. The institute also
comments:</div>
					<a name="0702072000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
other types of individuals&#151;notably people in their forties and
fifties in 2012 with no prior saving, and those who are likely to rent
in retirement&#151;incentives to save could be considerably
lower&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The document
continues with a reflection, echoing our debate earlier today,
about</div>
					<a name="0702072000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the importance of
information to help people make the right
choice.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns
remain, therefore, and in a press statement only a couple of days ago
in <i class="I">Pensions Week</i>, the institute was reported as
saying:</div>

the self-employed, one of the groups that the hon. Gentleman mentioned,
will automatically be involved&#151;which they will not. Does he
recognise that we are consulting on whether the other
group&#151;people who have reached their 40s or 50s without really
having accumulated any saving&#151;should automatically be enrolled?
Does he furthermore recognise that people who do not have any saving by
the time they are in their 50s are the ones for whom the kind of safety
net that he, too, supports are designed? The safety net is to help
people in that situation, who would otherwise, in time, be in
penury.</div>

							<a name="0702072000535"></a>Mr.

						</b> People who are getting to the end of their
working lives and who have not made any savings may well need help from
the state. I do not think that there is any contest about that. I am
delighted that the Minister is consulting about that, and I look
forward to hearing, when he makes his speech, whether the Government
have moved at all in their projections of means-testing levels after
the reforms.</div>
					<a name="0702072000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to steal the Minister&#146;s thunder, but I am looking at a
summary from the DWP website about projections of pension credit
entitlement. It projects
that</div>
					<a name="0702072000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;around a third of
pensioners will be eligible for Pension Credit by 2050 under the reform
proposals&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
it states that the estimates do not include the effect of personal
accounts. On one level, I can understand that. We are debating personal
accounts and we even have the joy of another Bill to look forward to in
a little while, which will set out more of the details. However, it is
something like &#147;Hamlet&#148; without the prince when we try to
estimate the relevant levels without making some assumptions about the
effect of personal
accounts.</div>
					<a name="0702072000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DWP
summary goes on to
state:</div>
					<a name="0702072000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pension
Credit eligibility becomes primarily concentrated among single
pensioners, mostly
women&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div>
					<a name="0702072000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;hardly any pensioner
couples are likely to be eligible by
2050.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
interesting to know whether all those assertions had been agreed with
the PPI as part of the continuing discussions. The document
states:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 333</div>
					<a name="0702072000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Eligibility is strongly
linked to the higher Pension Credit rates for disability and caring;
approaching a half of those eligible for Pension Credit in 2050 get
higher rates of Pension Credit because they also receive disability
benefits, are carers, or have additional housing
costs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also talks
about capturing robustly</div>
					<a name="0702072000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;changes in the projected
distribution of pensioner incomes as well as changes in average
incomes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document addresses an issue that is taken up in the regulatory impact
assessment about the &#147;modelling approach&#148;. I believe that
some of the modelling has changed in recent times. It says that the
Government have used the Pensim 2 model because it enables
them</div>
					<a name="0702072000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to generate a more
plausible future distribution of pensioner incomes than is likely to be
possible from a static simulation model, and to assess the effect of
varying key
assumptions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The document
goes on to
say:</div>
					<a name="0702072000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
reduction in Pension Credit...is driven in part by a projection
that incomes in the bottom half of the pensioner income distribution
(which is most relevant to Pension Credit entitlement) are likely to
grow faster than average. This primarily reflects projected increases
in state pension
entitlements.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
it would be interesting if the Minister pinpointed where the
PPI&#146;s analysis varies on some of those issues.</div>
					<a name="0702072000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move to the regulatory impact
assessment. The Conservatives do not have the Pensim 2 model to play
with, but I imagine that the Minister whiles away many a tedious
evening by feeding some assumptions into it in the DWP basement. The
RIA tells us that the Government&#146;s projections of pension credit
are</div>
					<a name="0702072000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;based on the Pensim2
dynamic micro-simulation
model&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is
presumably different from the original steam model&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that has been developed in
DWP.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It tells us that the
model</div>
					<a name="0702072000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;builds up
projections of income from a series of equations and assumptions that
generate labour market and pension histories for a representative
sample of the population. It simulates the accrual
of...pensions&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so
on.</div>
					<a name="0702072000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The RIA goes on to
this key
point:</div>
					<a name="0702072000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Projections
in the White Paper were based both on Pensim2 and a more traditional
&#145;static&#146; microsimulation modelling
approach&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">an
abacus, presumably. It
continues:</div>
					<a name="0702072000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
reflected that Pensim2 was a relatively new model and so it was
important to validate its findings against another model. In the light
of further analysis...analysts now consider that Pensim2 provides
more robust projections of Pension Credit entitlement, where the
distribution of individual pensioner incomes is the key determinant. In
particular, Pensim2 provides a technically superior approach to
projecting future changes in the distribution of incomes from state
pensions when entitlement to these is widening considerably over
time.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There we
have it. It rather looks as though the Government are now more
confident about their projections than they were before. I assume that
it will be part of the Minister&#146;s case that because they have
Pensim 2 and the PPI does not, they are right and it is wrong. I am not
in a position to make a judgment on that Mr. Taylor, and
nor, I suspect, are you. I do not spend a lot of my time on dynamic
micro-simulation, but I dare say it has its up
side.</div>

the <i class="I">Parliamentary Brief</i> cover story that we discussed earlier,
&#147;Would you buy a pension from this man?&#148;, and the
comments of Mr. Steve Bee, who is a well-respected expert in
this field. I reiterate that I shall not get into an argument about the
meaning of the word &#147;tax&#148;. Steve Bee is content to
describe it as a tax, but the Minister takes umbrage about that. I have
no desire to get into what seems to be a purely semantic
argument.</div>
					<a name="0702072000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Bee&#146;s
central point is that for savers,</div>
					<a name="0702072000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Pension Credit system will
leave them just &#163;11.70 a week better off than a non-saver. That
is slightly more than a 40 per cent. tax on saving and is exactly why
millions of people on modest earnings should be very wary indeed about
this proposal for a National Pensions Savings
Scheme.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then touches
on the issue of how much people have to save, saying:</div>
					<a name="0702072000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the loss of
&#163;8.30 in weekly income doesn&#146;t sound
much&#148;&#151;</div>

not&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is worth
reflecting that the typical capital cost of that amount of weekly
income for a 65-year-old is around &#163;7,000
today.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000538"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> Does that mean that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
policy is to abolish the savings credit? As he knows, that is what he
has just described. Does he recognise that that would lead to an
increase in the number of people on 100 per cent. withdrawal rates?
That was the situation under the previous Government, when there were
twice as many pensioner families on 100 per cent. withdrawal rates as
there are now.</div>

indeed, if the Minister is patient, we will come out with our policies
in due course, as I have explained before. What I am trying to find out
from him, as the guy who is trying to introduce the system, is how he
will deal with means-testing and, crucially, how it will affect the
likely success of the personal accounts
system.</div>
					<a name="0702072000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his article
in <i class="I">Parliamentary Brief</i>, Mr. Bee said that
&#163;8.30 of weekly income was the equivalent of about &#163;7,000
today. He went on:</div>
					<a name="0702072000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A &#163;7,000
investment that yields not one penny&#146;s worth of value is a
rather disastrous investment for anyone to have entered into
voluntarily, let alone to have been swept into through the process of
auto-enrolment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, he said:</div>
					<a name="0702072000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The problem with a
pension system where so many people could be potentially penalised by
saving is that no financial adviser would ever recommend that saving
for a pension was either suitable or advisable for
everybody.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
it comes down to is this: we are trying to help the Minister clear the
ground. If personal accounts are to have a chance of succeeding,
various things must happen. As I explained on Second Reading, they
include restoring confidence in the existing pension system and sorting
out the issue of levelling down. Crucially, they also include
controlling and, if possible, reducing means-testing, the effect of
which on pensions saving is bound to be pernicious&#151;the word used
by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin&#151;or cancerous, to use
my own phrase. There is also the issue of potential mis-selling, on
which we touched in a separate debate.</div>
					<a name="0702072000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
means-testing is an extremely important part of the issue, and my
concern remains that there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 335</div>still a yawning gap between the projections made by the Pensions Policy
Institute&#151;a highly regarded independent body&#151;and those of
the DWP. However, I am always open to reason, and the Minister may well
be able to take us through the differences in those assumptions and
modelling techniques and to satisfy the Committee that the Government
are more likely to be right, although I suspect that there is no right
or wrong, black or white, in any of this. That would be extremely
helpful; indeed, it would be almost as good as attending the seminar in
a week or two&#146;s time or the even better option of having had
oral evidence from the PPI and the DWP&#146;s boffins&#151;had they
been able to take time out from changing the oil on the Pensim 2 model
to come along and talk to the
Committee.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): Mr. Taylor, thank you
and welcome back to the Chair for this afternoon&#146;s proceedings.
As you will know, I have not spoken for about 10 clauses, so I might be
tempted to speak for a very long time to make up for that. However, as
you might also be aware, I said a few things about means-testing on
clause 19, so I might also be tempted simply to refer hon. Members to
my earlier speech and to sit down. However, I am sure that hon. Members
would not want me to do that, because this issue is crucial to the
Government&#146;s pension plans.</div>
					<a name="0702072000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know, from none other than
Lord Turner himself, that it is crucial. In the commission&#146;s
final report, he said:</div>
					<a name="0702072000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lower rates of return
for
individuals&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
meant in relation to
means-testing&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
the possibility in extreme cases of negative real returns, would make
it dangerous to proceed with an automatic enrolment system without
individual advice, but introducing individual advice would
substantially increase
costs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
therefore clearly critical.</div>
					<a name="0702072000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We know from
this morning&#146;s sitting that the Minister has promised us some
information on 20 February, but we still have not heard from him on a
narrower point: even given the Department&#146;s assumptions about
the number of people on means-testing in 20, 30, 40 or50
years&#146; time, what proportion of the target audience for personal
accounts are likely to be subject to means-testing? The suspicion must
be that the proportion will be an awful lot higher than the
Government&#146;s base figure of 30 per cent. If there are the
fantastic models in the basement of the Department that the hon. Member
for Eastbourne talked about, with all sorts of newfangled additions, it
must be possible to come up with some sensible
estimates.</div>

earning below &#163;5,500 or so will not automatically be enrolled.

						As
we discussed earlier, the issue is important precisely because people
must have a clear sense of what the returns will be before they decide
to be automatically enrolled in personal accounts. At this
morning&#146;s sitting, I mentioned the apparent confusion in the
Department over what the returns will be for people who are
automatically enrolled in personal accounts. A new piece of information
has become available since then. On Second Reading, the Secretary of
State said in response to a question that I put to him that</div>
					<a name="0702072000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the vast majority of people will
be able to look forward with some confidence to receiving &#163;2
back for every &#163;1 put in.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the Secretary of State&#146;s
opening bid. Later in the debate he came back and clarified that he was
talking about only</div>
					<a name="0702072000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
large majority of people with a good work history, saving from the age

					<a name="0702072000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that is not the same thing at
all.</div>
					<a name="0702072000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DWP then
issued the paper entitled &#147;Financial incentives to save for
retirement&#148;, which clarified
that</div>
					<a name="0702072000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the system that we
propose, in combination with the introduction of personal accounts,
will see the large majority of people...expecting a payback well
in excess of
&#163;1...for...&#163;1&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is hardly an impressive payback at all, and will considerably change
the financial incentives that people who are thinking of saving and
personal accounts will face. That is particularly so if they are
individuals with large amounts of debt, as many of them could be, who
might therefore need to decide whether to pay that off before going on
to save in personal
accounts.</div>
					<a name="0702072000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought
that we had got to the Government&#146;s bottom line on the
issue&#151;that &#163;1 gives &#163;2 in certain circumstances
and &#163;1 gives &#163;1 in the majority of
circumstances&#151;until this morning when I received an answer from
the Minister which was dated yesterday. I asked him what estimate he
had of the proportion of the target audience for personal accounts that
could be expected to receive a return greater than &#163;2 for
every &#163;1 invested. The Minister&#146;s answer
actually says &#163;2 million for every &#163;1 invested,
which would be extremely impressive, although I would want advice on
the funds proposed. Assuming that the reply is an answer to the
question that I put to the Minister about &#163;2 for every
&#163;1, the answer is
now:</div>
					<a name="0702072000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Information

					<a name="0702072000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, we have
gone from &#163;2 for &#163;1 to &#163;2 for &#163;1 in some

good, how can it be that from the starting point of giving such
categorical advice and assurance as the Secretary of State was able to
on Second Reading, with the majority of people getting &#163;2 for
&#163;1, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 337</div>we now cannot say anything at all about payback rates? The
Minister&#146;s answer finished with the following
sentence:</div>
					<a name="0702072000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
figures that the Department has show that while the payback depends on
factors such as investment performance, the vast majority of people can
expect to benefit in retirement from saving in personal
accounts&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0702072000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">which could
mean anything at all. The Department has got in a bit of a muddle over
the issue. It has been rowing back rather fast and I think that it is
nervous about putting on the record what the returns will be, in case
it cannot deliver. That is not a good background for launching the
accounts.</div>
					<a name="0702072000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, we had a debate about the individuals who might be
particularly vulnerable to losing money in personal accounts. The
thrust of the Minister&#146;s comments in that debate, when he
responded to the hon. Member for Eastbourne, appeared to be that the
Department was perhaps going to shave off some of the vulnerable groups
such as the self-employed, or women in later life. The problem with
that is set out very neatly on page 9 of the Department&#146;s paper,
&#147;Financial incentives to save for retirement&#148;, where it
says that</div>
					<a name="0702072000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a level of
payback cannot be guaranteed, and the choices and characteristics which
may leave a small number of people at higher risk of low payback may
not be apparent to either individuals or Government during working
life&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
there will be some fundamental uncertainties that will make it
difficult in a mass means-tested system to filter out people who may be
vulnerable. That is well highlighted by the PPI report, &#147;Are
personal accounts suitable for all?&#148;, which helpfully goes
through a series of categories of individual, described by contribution
record, income decile and work characteristics, to figure out whether
they would benefit from saving in a personal account.</div>
					<a name="0702072000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider individuals with
a full national insurance record, whether in the lowest income decile
or the highest, which are categories that the Minister has not
mentioned so far, and those individuals who are renting and likely to
be receiving housing benefit. Even for a woman aged 40, the return
would be something 50p for every pound put in. There are a lot of
vulnerable people who might go into personal accounts and not be better
off. It is not only those with high debt characteristics who are paying
high levels of debt interest. We know how difficult it must be to cater
for that type of person; the Government would not easily know what
debts they had and what interest they were paying. There are also
others who might not be better off, however: the self-employed; older
people; people who receive housing benefit, and people who receive
council tax benefit. The proposed new clause focuses on pension credit,
but it relates to a lot of other means-tested benefits as
well.</div>

Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I am listening
with interest to the hon. Gentleman, as always. Given the legal dispute
about the guarantees in Government leaflets that is before the courts,
has he given any consideration to the position of people who are
auto-enrolled in personal accounts and later find out that that is not
the best thing for them, and the sort of comeback that they may seek,
whether against the Government, the board or the delivery

						</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right to indicate that
people automatically enrolled in accounts by a Government who sell the
scheme almost as a no-brainer saving scheme, because one gets &#163;2
for every &#163;1, would be very angry if they found that they were
losing money as a consequence of investing in the scheme. They would
certainly mount a claim for compensation and they would look closely at
what Ministers and others have said about the benefits of the scheme.
Perhaps that is why the Government are desperately rowing back. If
those individuals were able to demonstrate that the Government were
saying that the vast majority of people would get &#163;2 for
every &#163;1 but that it had been shown later that that was
going to be only 50, 40, 30 or 20 per cent., they would have a strong
compensation case.</div>
					<a name="0702072000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

						</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is nodding to show
that that is the sentence, but I am not sure what his complaint is. It
seems clear to me what that refers to. Surely it means that because we
do not know at the beginning of somebody&#146;s working life whether
he is going to end up on housing benefit or council tax benefit, or for
how long he is going to work&#151;he might end up with caring and
other responsibilities&#151;we cannot just run the Pensim model and
say for certain to an individual at a particular age that he will
benefit. The more uncertainty there is about those characteristics, the
less attractive it will be to save.</div>

							<a name="0702072000551"></a>James

be the case for any projection over 50 years. It is perfectly
possible that he will come into Government and get rid of housing
benefits in
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 339</div>40 years&#146; time. Does that mean that anybody who has not
saved on the basis that he might end up on housing benefit will have
been mis-sold because he changed Government policy? Of course there
will have to be a general qualification about projections over many
years.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000552"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister says that there will be a general
qualification. There was not a lot of general qualification about the
first thing that the Secretary of State said to me on Second Reading,
when he said that the vast majority of people could expect &#163;2
back for every &#163;1 put in. If the message that the Government are
sending out is &#147;invest in this scheme with confidence; it is
almost a no-brainer to get a decent return,&#148; that is very
different from an extremely qualified set of statements that point out
to people that if they fall into five, six, seven or eight different
categories, they might end up losing from saving.</div>
					<a name="0702072000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point, which I think the
Minister understands, is that there is great risk in a system in which
a large number of people who have personal accounts face means-testing,
and there is much danger for the Government in giving general advice
that appears to indicate to people that it is almost a no-brainer to go
into the scheme.</div>
					<a name="0702072000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because, as the hon. Member for
Eastbourne suggested, people have very low financial literacy, they
will make decisions in a broad-brush way, depending on whether they
think that going into personal accounts is an obviously sensible thing
to do. The more they are advised&#151;whether by the generic form of
financial advice that the Government are talking about; by a leaflet;
by what the Secretary of State says or by what the <i class="I">Daily Mail
</i>says&#151;that the matter is complex and uncertain, the more
likely they are to say, as many people seem to be doing at the moment,
&#147;I am not going to bother with this; pensions are far too
complicated. Why don&#146;t I just stick my money into a house
instead?&#148; That is the risk of building this type of personal
account scheme on top of a low basic state pension with a lot of
means-testing. Those are the issues that the Government have to
clarify.</div>
					<a name="0702072000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eastbourne put that case very well, but I have to point out
gently that he is not proposing much that would make a great
difference. He is entitled, as are the Government, to throw stones at
my party for wanting to spend more on the basic state pension, partly
to reduce means-testing. However, if he is not going to do that, the
price that he and the Government have to pay is that there will be a
lot of means-testing in the system for a long time to come. He offered
a very vague hope, designed to be a key differentiator between the
Conservative party and the Government, when he said that what he is
after, unlike the Government, is a consensus on an aspiration for less
means-testing. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge explained
what that meant on Second Reading, when he indicated that he hoped that
in 20, 30 or 40 years&#146; time there might be less means-testing in
the system.</div>
					<a name="0702072000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
really think that that will be the basis for a particularly popular and
successful campaign that will sweep across the country. I can hardly
see pensioners chanting in the streets, &#147;What do we want? A
consensus on an aspiration for less means-testing. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 340</div>When do we want it? When it is fiscally prudent.&#148; I understand
the points that the hon. Gentleman is making, but he is throwing darts
at the Government without having policy of his own that would achieve
anything different. The point here is that if this or any other
Government decide to scrimp on the level of the basic state pension,
they will have to accept the very high level of means-testing, which
may be the fatal flaw that undermines the success of these
proposals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000553"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> This has been an important debate and no worse
for hearing it for the second time today from the hon. Member for
Yeovil. I want to address head-on the points that both hon. Members
have made. </div>
					<a name="0702072000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I start by
saying that what we are doing here is implementing the recommendations
of the Pensions Commission. It produced some very well-thought-through
research and evidence for its sets of proposals. Anyone who wants to
move away from those needs to explain how they will afford to do so.
There will, of course, be a balance within any system between the level
of the safety net and the level of the universal benefits. Some people
will think that there should be a contributory element. That is what
the Pensions Commission recommended. We agree with that. We think that
it strikes the right balance between benefits that go to people on a
contributory basis and benefits that protect people against poverty or
give them money if they have extra needs based on disability or caring,
for example.</div>
					<a name="0702072000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
on both Front Benches to have credibility in this debate, they have to
say how they would fund a system that would produce a different
outcome. We have already been through the proposals of the hon. Member
for Yeovil. He cannot tell us either where he would get the 5p to get
to &#163;115 or what he would do about the majority of pensioners who
would be above &#163;115 in 2050. If he is telling them that he will
improve their incentives to save by getting rid of the extra money they
receive because they are disabled, I am not sure that that will have
them chanting in the streets at the next election either. He has
refused on a multitude of occasions to answer that question because he
knows that it is the fatal flaw in his
policy.</div>
					<a name="0702072000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Eastbourne have slightly
the same problem. They like to make this rhetorical case about
means-testing in general, but when there is a proposal to reduce
means-testing in practice&#151;the changes that we are making to the
savings credit&#151;the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
says:</div>
					<a name="0702072000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I want to highlight
... the proposed change to pension savings credit that will create
a band of 100 per cent. withdrawal rate... Almost 1.5 million
pensioners will be worse off... I urge the Minister to look again
at that provision. I guarantee that our colleagues on both sides in the
other place will want to do so if he does
not.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 16 January 2007; Vol.
455, c. 680.]</div>
					<a name="0702072000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole point of what we are
doing here is to reduce the overall level of means-testing. As the hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, there are two ways of doing
that. Either one can have universal benefits, in which case one needs
to say where the money for doing so would come from, or one has to
reduce the generosity of our current targeted system. We think that the
savings credit needs to be altered so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 341</div>that we reduce the overall level of means-testing. Presumably the hon.
Member for Eastbourne agrees with that objective. If so, I do not see
how he can say that he does not agree with the changes that we are
making to the savings credit.</div>
					<a name="0702072000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is no great
help to the debate to talk about the problem of means-testing in
general, but, when the Government come up with practical ways of
reducing the amount of means-testing, oppose them on the basis that
they are taking money away from people. The fundamental reason why the
Government have brought in pension credit is to target the people who
have the least resources and to strike that balance between
redistributing to the poorest and making sure that pensioners share in
the overall prosperity of the
country.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000554"></a>Mark
Pritchard:
						</b> Given that the Government are introducing
measures to reduce means-tested benefits, does the hon. Gentleman then
by implication and even by definition agree with us that means-tested
benefits are, to quote Help the Aged,
&#147;pernicious&#148;?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000555"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> No, I do not. The whole point is that we must get
the balance right. We must have the right level of pension credit to
target poverty, people with disabilities and people with greater caring
needs. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not saying that he wants to
take money from those people and the &#163;30, &#163;40 or
&#163;50 a week they receive for those extra needs and because they
have lower incomes. The level of means-testing must be right, and that
is the debate that we are having
today.</div>
					<a name="0702072000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we had not
changed the system, the percentage of people on means-testing would
have approached 70 per cent. or more, and that would have been too
high. We believe that the changes&#151;both the savings credit fix
and the changes to the basic state pension&#151;will ensure that we
have a pension credit system that is properly targeted, and works as an
insurance system for people with unsuccessful work careers, by
providing a safety net against poverty, and for those with greater
needs in retirement, who should be given more help. If the hon.
Gentleman wants to tell his constituents that he against that, he is
welcome to do so when he
intervenes.</div>

proposals will bring
about.</div>

Government&#146;s view is obviously that 29 or 30 per cent.
is about the right, or acceptable, level. Presumably, one reason for
the fierce debate behind the scenes with the PPI is that they believe
that 45 or 50 per cent. is unacceptable. Is that right and, if so,
why?</div>

								James
Purnell:
						</b> We think the proposals are sensible. In 2050, for
example, half of those on pension credit will be those with extra needs
because of disability or because they are caring. It is right that they
should be provided with help. We do not think it would be a great boon
to humanity if we took money off them as a way of reducing the number
of people on means-tested benefits. I disagreed earlier that
means-tested benefits are a tax, because they give more money to
people. It is a good thing, not a bad thing, if someone whose wife
suddenly becomes disabled receives extra money from the state. It is
not a tax that takes money from people. That is the point that I have
been trying to make since this morning. I shall come to the detailed
points that the hon. Member for Eastbourne made about the PPI, and with
that slightly prolate preamble, I shall turn to my
speech.</div>
					<a name="0702072000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
have set out our long-term projections for pension credit entitlement.
I shall deal with the comments made by the hon. Member for Yeovil under
three headings. The first is the exact intention of his amendment and
why we believe the DWP&#146;s approach is the right one, and I shall
set out the forecast that we intend to provide. The second is the
overall number of people on means-tested benefits. The third is
incentives to save, and means-testing.</div>
					<a name="0702072000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">We supplied our long-term
projections for pension credit entitlement in the RIA that accompanies
the Bill, and we published modelling assumptions underlying our
projections and had them validated by the IFS. We have also published a
document on financial incentives to
save.</div>
					<a name="0702072000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to
the points made by the hon. Member for Yeovil, I should like to say
that there is a balance between trying to answer people&#146;s
questions in parliamentary debates and publishing detailed 40 or
60-page documents. If he wants me to reply to his questions by saying
that he can read our &#147;Financial incentives to save for
retirement&#148; document, I am happy to go do so. However, if he
wants me to try to be helpful, I hope that he will treat those
contributions in the context in which they are given&#151;as part of
a parliamentary
debate.</div>

						</b> Later on, the Secretary of State made it clear
that he was saying that the vast majority of people with a full working
life would have those expectations. The point that we have consistently
made is that means-tested benefits are there for people who do not have
successful working lives to give them insurance against ending up in
poverty. One could have a 100 per cent. incentive for everybody to save
by saying, &#147;Whatever you end up on through your own provision
and saving is what you will get in retirement&#148;. I do not think
that the hon. Gentleman is proposing that system. He may want to say
that that is what he is proposing, but even his proposals will have a
means-tested safety net&#151;he has acknowledged that
previously.</div>

						</b> Well, I shall turn to that later, when I shall
make the point that the proportion of people on guarantee credit is
virtually the same under our proposals and the Pensions Policy
Institute&#146;s proposals. That is really where the kernel of this
debate lies.</div>
					<a name="0702072000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause 2
asks for a five-yearly report on information on pension credit. I hope
that we can do better than that as we already regularly publish that
information&#151;usually annually. The Department already publishes
annual long-term estimates of benefit expenditure, which include
pension credit. Those estimates also feed into the Treasury report on
long-term fiscal sustainability. Estimates of current and projected
case loads are used to calculate those expenditure projections. We
shall publish those case load projections for the first time this
month. As with the expenditure estimates, those projections will then
be published annually. Rather than accepting an amendment that asks us
for those figures every five years, it would be better to stick to the
current practice of doing so every
year.</div>
					<a name="0702072000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Estimates of
current pension credit take-up are included in the annual
&#147;take-up of income-related benefits&#148; reports published
under the independent national statistics guidelines. The number of
pension credit recipients is published quarterly on the DWP website. I
hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne is satisfied that we are not
shying away from publishing such information.</div>
					<a name="0702072000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman also asked that the five-yearly report be produced by the
Government Actuary. We do not believe that that is the right approach.
The Government Actuary provides advice to Parliament on national
insurance contribution levels and benefits, and provides oversight in
relation to the national insurance fund. However, pension credit is not
a contributory benefit; in other words, it is not based on a person's
national insurance contributions. The Government Actuary's Department
has never had responsibility to report on benefits that are
income-related. Indeed, that is not just our view; it is the view of
the recent Morris review of the actuarial profession, which recommended
that, for policy and operational reasons, projections of benefits paid
from and contributions paid to the national insurance fund should also
be covered by the DWP and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. Any
suggestion to increase the remit of the Government Actuary's Department
to include income-related benefits would go against that and other
recommendations in the Morris review. Therefore, I see no reason for
legislating to produce information less frequently or for removing
those responsibilities to the Government Actuary. However, I realise,
of course, that the purpose of these amendments is to elicit a general
debate and I will now turn to that.</div>
					<a name="0702072000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me start by saying that the
PPI is a highly respected body and it is true that forecasts spanning
30, 40 or 50 years require a wide range of often quite bold
assumptions. Depending on those assumptions, one can come out with
quite different results. It would not be appropriate to think in terms
of what is the right or wrong outcome as the question is what are the
appropriate assumptions and what does the model allow us to do? The DWP
and PPI estimates are the result of detailed underlying assumptions and
the projections used to produce them. At a basic level, we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 344</div>are saying that the Government project that improvements in future
pension incomes will tend to be more focused on lower-income pensioners
and will push more pensioners clear of pension credit entitlement. The
implication of the PPI&#146;s findings is that lower-income
pensioners will see less improvement and that therefore more will
remain eligible.</div>
					<a name="0702072000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
could be a number of reasons for the difference in projected outcomes.
First, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, there is a difference in
the assumptions that we make about private pensions. Both projections
assume that private pensions income will fall relative to earnings, so
our projection about private pensions is not hugely optimistic. The
estimates are cautious; if personal accounts are successful, as we hope
they will be, the amount of saving will be greater than that suggested
by that basic case.</div>
					<a name="0702072000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The key point,
however, is that under our models we and the PPI agree that the amount
of private saving makes a relatively small difference to the overall
number of people on pension credit. Perhaps a more significant
difference is how we assume the increase in spending on the state
second pension will be distributed; the differences between our
projections and the PPI&#146;s largely revolve around S2P. There is
no difference between us on the projection of total S2P expenditure in
2050, but it seems likely that we are making different projections
about which pensioners receive the money and how much they receive.
That is the crucial point.</div>
					<a name="0702072000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Spending on S2P will increase
more than fivefold by 2050 in real terms as more and more pensioners
have the chance to build up substantial S2P records and as the
improvements to S2P coverage in the Bill take effect. As the hon.
Member for Eastbourne said in detail, the modelling approach of the
Department for Work and Pensions uses Pensim 2, which directly models
the build-up of S2P by people as they go through their working lives.
We believe that that provides the most realistic projection of how S2P
entitlements will be distributed in future. Pensim 2 is a very
sophisticated model, and the one that the Pensions Commission used as a
key tool for much of its
analysis.</div>
					<a name="0702072000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I started
to say earlier, the methodology and equations underlying Pensim 2 have
also been validated by the IFS. Members with an interest in the matter
can find the IFS findings and recommendations for further development
in a working paper on its website; I am sure that Members will look at
that with keen
interest.</div>
					<a name="0702072000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Pensim 2 model makes projections based on people and their forecast
likely S2P and other entitlements. PPI uses a very different approach.
It takes information on current pensioners and projects the current
distribution forward using a number of assumptions and adjustments.
Clearly, we believe that the approach used by the Government and our
analysts is robust, because it is based on the contribution histories
and projected working careers of individuals. We therefore think that
it is an effective way of modelling what will happen with S2P and who
will benefit from it. It also fits closely with what we should expect
to happen.</div>
					<a name="0702072000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
will substantially increase spending on the basic state pension by
improving coverage and uprating in line with earnings. Spending on the
state second pension will also increase, with better coverage and more
focus on low earners. As I said at the outset, we are proposing to
limit the scope of pension credit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 345</div>relative to general income growth. In that context, it is hard to see
why pension credit entitlement would not fall below the levels that we
see now.</div>
					<a name="0702072000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel that
our projections are good at modelling the distribution of S2P.
Furthermore, it would be surprising if all the changes&#151;the
increased spending on the basic state pension and S2P, the greater
redistribution and the fact that the coverage measures will
particularly benefit low earners and those with interrupted
careers&#151;did not result in the kind of reduction that our model
forecasts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000563"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I shall give the Minister a chance to gather his
thoughts. Does the PPI accept that a large part of the difference is as
he described, and does it accept that its assumptions are less
sophisticated than Pensim 2? Has there been any discussion about
allowing the PPI access to the Pensim 2 model to run its own
calculations in order to see whether the gap can be narrowed between
the two
parties?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000564"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I do not think that the PPI&#146;s assumptions
are more, or less, sophisticated. It is just that it has a different
approach to modelling. When the hon. Gentleman comes to our seminar, he
can ask those very questions if he wants
to.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000565"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I hope that we will have a tour of Pensim 2,
which I envisage as being like the Enigma code-breaking machine, in
several Nissen huts full of whirring machinery with WRENs servicing it.
That will all be very interesting and I hope that the working paper to
which the Minister referred will be available, along with any others
that there may be. It is important to establish whether it is accepted
on both sides that the Pensim 2 model is more sophisticated and
therefore likely to produce more accurate results. It seems such an
obvious way to narrow the big gap between the PPI and the
Government.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000566"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That illustrates the slightly difficult position
that we are in regarding our response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
desire for a consensus between ourselves and the PPI. All we can do is
explain to the PPI, or others, the basis of our forecasts and if it
continues to be confident about its forecasts, we cannot countermand
that and force it to reduce them. I am being very careful not to say
that its methodology is any worse or better than ours&#151;it just
uses different methods. All I am saying is that our methodology has an
advantage in the modelling of distributional effects.
</div>
					<a name="0702072000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, it would
seem odd if, despite the changes I have suggested, one ended up with
the same level of entitlement in 2050, compared with what we have now.
Our forecasts have those methodological features and they also fit with
what common sense suggests would happen based on the changes we are
proposing.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000567"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The PPI figures obviously have a huge funnel of
doubt in 2050, with a minimum means-tested figure of 30 per cent. and a
maximum of 65 per cent. Will the Minister remind me whether his
colleagues in the Department have a similar funnel of doubt in relation
to the central estimate, or is there simply a point
estimate?</div>

							<a name="0702072000568"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, we looked
at two models when preparing the White Paper, which produced two
slightly different results. Under Pensim 2, we came up with a figure
of 27 per cent., and we got a figure of 32 per cent. under
PSM&#151;the pensions simulation model. I am sure that I shall be
corrected if that turns out not to be the case.</div>
					<a name="0702072000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the hon. Member
for Yeovil has read our document on projections of pension credit
entitlement. It goes through a range of issues and assumptions, which,
if varied, would affect the overall outcome. If he reads it, I think he
will find that it makes a persuasive case that the projections are
pretty robust and that changes in assumptions make relatively small
differences to the overall outcome.</div>

that document, but at the moment my memory is not working as well as it
ought to. Would the Minister refresh my memory and tell me what the
funnel of doubt is in the Government figures for 2050? What is the
range that the Government have for means-testing in 2050, compared with
the PPI range of 30 to
65?</div>

							<a name="0702072000570"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> That is a slightly different approach from the
one that we take. We went through various different components and
different assumptions to see the overall effect that that had on the
proportion in 2050. For example, the White Paper assumptions led to a
27 per cent. forecast under Pensim 2. We varied that when we considered
a scenario dealing with high employment, lower life expectancy and
higher private pension outcomes&#151;a sort of more optimistic
model&#151;and the figure that came out was 25 per cent. Scenario 2
featured lower private pension incomes, which led to a figure of 28 per
cent, so the funnel of doubt relating to those figures ranged from 25
to 28 per cent. The more assumptions one varies, the more the funnel of
doubt will change. Adding together all the lowest scenarios will create
a lower floor, and all the higher ones a higher floor. From memory, the
outcomes that we projected were pretty robust under the scenarios
modelled. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can read the document
happily and come back to it on Report if he so wishes. The key point of
the document was that it demonstrated pretty well that our forecasts
were robust under a range of different
scenarios.</div>
					<a name="0702072000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
about as much as I can say on the different forecasts. We think that
our figures are robust. We have discussed them in detail with the PPI
and we will continue to discuss them, including at the seminar, which I
know that you are looking forward to, Mr. Taylor, as are our
colleagues on the Committee, all of whom are invited. We will have an
opportunity for discussion
there.</div>
					<a name="0702072000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Eastbourne, I think, mentioned the latest PPI briefing, which said
that pension credit levels would remain historically high in 2050. Our
forecasts do not suggest that that would be true, because the levels
would have fallen from 45 to 50 per cent. now to around 30 per
cent. in 2050. We think that they would not be hugely different from
the figures that applied in the early 1990s. Indeed, spending 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 347</div>on all income-related benefits for pensioners would have fallen from
about &#163;1 for every &#163;5 spent on pensioners now to 35p for
every &#163;5 spent on pensioners in 2050. That would be a
significant reduction in the proportion of pensioner benefits spent on
income-related benefits. One would therefore project that, by
historical standards, the level was significantly lower than had
operated at that time. Again, we will have time for discussion at the
seminar.</div>
					<a name="0702072000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
issue is on means-testing and &#147;it pays to save&#148;, carried
over from this morning&#146;s debate. We have already published an
analysis of the expected payback in personal accounts. We will continue
to develop the analysis and give people the opportunity to look at our
projections in detail. I hope that when we publish that information and
go through all the particular cases, the hon. Member for Yeovil will
use them in an appropriate way, because he is very fond of saying
&#147;mis-selling&#148;. I think that he should try to define what
he means, because &#147;mis-selling&#148; is a very specific word.
I hope that I can address his concerns about the overall policy,
because I do not think that his view is that, if there is any
means-testing in the system, automatic enrolment will be mis-selling.
He can correct me if he wants to, but if that is his position I do not
think that he is part of the
consensus.</div>

						</b> Obviously, if the personal accounts board put
that on its publicity, ignoring the regulation in place at the time,
and knowingly said something that turned out not to be true, the hon.
Gentleman would then be able to apply the word. That is very different
from talking thus about the projections we have put forward and the
overall policy. I think this is fair comment, but he sometimes likes to
imply that if there were any means-testing in the system then automatic
enrolment would be means-testing, and if there is anybody who is
means-tested and does not get 100 per cent. of what they put in then
that somehow would be mis-selling. Presumably that would apply to
anybody who was taxed in retirement as well. I notice that he is not
getting up. The point that I am trying to make is that his issue is not
with the policy overall, but about the level of means-testing. I think
that he recognises that we need to strike a balance there, and so does
our
policy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000573"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Does the Minister understand my point that even the
Secretary of State in the House of Commons needs to be corrected about
what the returns are from personal accounts? Potentially, we have quite
a big issue. Had I not corrected what the Secretary of State said, it
would be on the record as an inaccurate statement of the returns from
personal
accounts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000574"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> No, the Secretary of State made the position
clear. He said that the vast majority of people who saved throughout a
full working life would get a very good return from personal accounts.
That is quite right. If the hon. Gentleman wants, we can just stick to
publishing documents. He can then stick to asking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 348</div>questions and we will stick to replying to them on paper. If he wishes
to do that, the debate will not be very
informative.</div>
					<a name="0702072000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us see
whether the hon. Gentleman really believes that
&#147;mis-selling&#148; is the right term to use. I hope that I can
convince him that, overall, the policy is not characterised by
mis-selling and that he will stop calling it that. He must justify why
he is using that word, because it echoes outside here and if it does
not stand up to scrutiny there is a danger that he will discourage from
saving those who should be doing
so.</div>
					<a name="0702072000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to start by
defining what the hon. Gentleman means by &#147;mis-selling&#148;.
For a personal pension, it means selling an individual a pension that
is not the best option for them. To achieve the best possible advice
the sale of personal pensions is highly regulated, which means that the
sales process is detailed, complicated and therefore expensive. That
has two effects. Because the process is complicated, fewer individuals
take out a pension, and because the transaction cost is high, charges
are high and returns are therefore lower. Many commentators have
suggested that it is therefore not economical to sell to low to
moderate earners.</div>
					<a name="0702072000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Dealing with
that problem was one of the Pensions Commission&#146;s main goals. It
wanted to create a system in which take-up was much higher and charges
much lower, and it recommended that we automatically enrol employees
into a personal account for their company pensions. It made it clear
that for automatic enrolment to work individuals must be able to choose
whether to stay opted in, based on generic rather than individual
advice. That is my key point: that was the Pensions Commission&#146;s
recommendation, and if the hon. Gentleman does not agree that it is
appropriate, or if he believes that the overall recommendations amount
to mis-selling, he must say so. I am sure that he looks forward to
defending his position at the seminar that is coming
up.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="0702072000575"></a>Mark
Pritchard:
						</b> I do not want to be too helpful to the hon.
Member for Yeovil, but he was trying to say that perhaps there has been
misapplication of the facts, given that the facts are not yet known.
Therefore they cannot, by definition, be facts; there can only be a
presumption that they might or might not become facts. There is a great
deal of
difference.</div>

							<a name="0702072000576"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I really did not understand what the hon.
Gentleman said. He is obviously cleverer than Adair Turner too, and he
can put that point to him when he comes to our
seminar.</div>
					<a name="0702072000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking
to achieve the implementation of the Pensions Commission&#146;s
overall recommendations. We shall try to do so through this Bill and
the Bill on personal accounts that we hope to introduce next year. We
have made it clear that personal accounts will be regulated as
occupational pensions, and we are considering which organisation will
be responsible for that. As part of the next Bill we will debate the
criteria for the regulation of personal accounts, including automatic
enrolment, and the process by which people can decide what is in their
best
interests.</div>
					<a name="0702072000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
the position of the hon. Member for Yeovil is that automatic enrolment
will only be appropriate if every individual who is automatically
enrolled stays opted in, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 349</div>he is parting company with the consensus. There will always be
individuals who do better at a particular time by not saving, such as
those who decide to pay down their own debt, and those who are
self-employed will have to decide whether to opt in to personal
accounts. That is why personal accounts will be voluntary, not
compulsory. Whether to stay in them will remain the individual&#146;s
decision. On the other hand, if the hon. Gentleman believes, as we do,
that automatic enrolment is the right policy, as the Pensions
Commission recommended, we all need to apply a slightly different test.
Again, we can debate that over the next few months. My starter would be
that automatic enrolment would be justified if it would be in the
interests of a large majority of individuals.</div>
					<a name="0702072000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Pensions Policy Institute,
which the hon. Gentleman likes to cite in support of his arguments,
came up with a pretty similar formulation of the appropriate test. It
said, for
example:</div>
					<a name="0702072000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
personal accounts are not suitable for everybody, then this would not
necessarily mean that individuals should not be
auto-enrolled.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact,
it said:</div>
					<a name="0702072000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is a broad degree of consensus for the principle of
auto-enrolment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
said, and we agree, that if there were people for whom personal
accounts were not suitable, that</div>
					<a name="0702072000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would have important implications
for what information is needed to help people make informed decisions
about whether they should opt out.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is where the debate goes
next&#151;to the subject of the provision of generic advice and how
we can give people who are automatically enrolled the right level of
support. That is exactly what we are doing through our pilot with the
Treasury and through the Thoresen review of how generic advice could be
made to work.</div>
					<a name="0702072000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
point is whether the hon. Gentleman agrees with the PPI or whether he
thinks that automatic enrolment is not justified if anyone is
means-tested. He answered that question earlier when he said that his
concern was about the proportion of people who were means-tested. I
wonder whether that is really what he thinks. For example, in the
mid-1990s, 1.7 million families were on 100 per cent. withdrawal rates.
Today, the figure is 800,000. That is in part because we have
introduced the savings credit. It has a slower taker rate, which means
that fewer people are on 100 per cent. withdrawal rates.
Mathematically, he will understand, if one takes a benefit away more
slowly, more people will be affected by the means test.</div>
					<a name="0702072000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an inevitable balance
between taking money away from people quickly but over a small range of
income distribution and taking it away more slowly but over a slightly
wider range of income distribution. We think that our
policy&#151;combining guarantee credit for the poorest and savings
credit for those above that&#151;is the right balance, and the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which is a
respected independent commentator, came broadly to the same conclusion
when it considered our policy.</div>
					<a name="0702072000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point is whether the
hon. Gentleman thinks that people on savings credit have a good
incentive to save or not&#151;we do. As we said in the document
&#147;Financial incentives to save for retirement&#148;:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 350</div>
					<a name="0702072000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A long-term saver in
personal accounts receiving Savings Credit (but no other benefit) in
retirement, for example, could expect to get back around &#163;2 in
real terms for every &#163;1 they have contributed after taking
account of the benefit system.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">By and large, with all the caveats we
expressed in the document cited by the hon. Gentleman&#151;because,
for example, we do not know what the performance of the stock market
will be over the next 40 years; one always has to caveat such things
because all sorts of saving involve some risks and he would not want to
pretend otherwise&#151;we believe that people on savings credit will
have the returns to save that I have quoted and significantly better
returns to save than under the current system.</div>
					<a name="0702072000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have dealt with
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about savings credit. I do not know
whether he still thinks that people on savings credit would have been
mis-sold pensions. The debate focuses on people on guarantee credit.
Under our projections, about 6 per cent. of people end up on guarantee
credit, where they could theoretically&#151;I will say something
about that later&#151;face 100 per cent. withdrawal rates. It is
interesting that that is roughly the same proportion as the
PPI&#146;s citizens pension model, which is the inspiration for the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s policy. We are dealing with two different
policies&#151;the first the citizens income and the second a
situation where we still have a second tier in the state second pension
that gives people more than that citizens pension. They both end up
with broadly the same proportion of people on guarantee
credit.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0702072000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0702072000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that mean
that automatic enrolment is not justified in either situation because a
proportion of the population are potentially on 100 per cent.
withdrawal rates? I do not think so, essentially for two reasons.
First, people in that group would be unlikely to have accumulated
significant savings, as they would not have been automatically involved
for many years. It is likely that they would be able to take their
pension as a lump sum, under the enticingly entitled &#147;trivial
commutation rules&#148;, of up to &#163;15,000. It is likely that
even people in that group, who might be on 100 per cent. withdrawal
rates in theory, would be able to take a lump sum of up to
&#163;15,000 and receive a benefit from their saving.</div>
					<a name="0702072000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, and more importantly,
the guarantee credit gives people money. The key point is that it is a
safety net for people who, by definition, have had unsuccessful
financial lives. Some 6 per cent. of the overall pensioner population
will be on guarantee credit under our forecast. At the age of
retirement, that is only one in 50, so about 2 per cent. of people will
be on guarantee credit. We are discussing a particular part of the
population: people who have not been able to provide for themselves
because, for example, they were low earners, unemployed, had caring
responsibilities, or would have contributed for less than 25 years out
of the potential total of 50 years.</div>
					<a name="0702072000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guarantee credit recognises
that that group has not been able to provide for their retirement, and
it then lifts their income up to at least &#163;115 a week. That
cannot be described as mis-selling; it will protect people against
those events in their working lives, and it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 351</div>would be exactly the same under the model that the hon. Member for
Yeovil suggests. Given the difference between living on, for example,
&#163;80 a week or &#163;115 a week, most people would choose
&#163;115 a week, even if that meant that they were in receipt of an
income-related benefit.</div>
					<a name="0702072000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have explained why
we believe that the system contains good incentives to save. It is
worth remembering that we are discussing the poorer groups in
retirement. The figures that we and the PPI have published are the
harder cases out of the whole population. Our figures focus only on
single pensioners; people who are in couples during retirement are
unlikely to be on pension credit at all. Half of the people who receive
pension credit in 2050 will be those who receive more money because of
disability or because of caring responsibilities.</div>
					<a name="0702072000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the hon. Gentleman will
again refuse to answer this question, I doubt that he is saying that we
should improve people&#146;s incentives to save by taking that money
away from them if they are disabled or have caring responsibilities. To
do so would be to misunderstand the purpose of pension credit. It
exists to insure people against certain events: either poverty during
their working life, or disability or caring responsibilities later on.
It gives them more money to meet those extra needs, and because of
that, we have been able to lift millions of people out of
poverty.</div>
					<a name="0702072000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those issues
will remain whatever the hon. Gentleman proposes. Even if he could find
the extra 5p on income tax to lift everyone to at least &#163;115 a
week, he would still have to tell the 70 per cent. of people who
receive more than &#163;115 a week in 2050 what he would do to them.
Would he take money away from them, or would he have to find even more
than 5p on income tax?</div>
					<a name="0702072000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, the proposals strike
the right balance. They give people at the start of their working life
a good set of incentives. The first time that someone is automatically
enrolled at 22 years old, we will be able to say to them that if they
work or care for most of their life, their state pension will give them
about &#163;135 a week&#151;well above the level of
guarantee credit. If they save over the long term, they can expect to
receive well over &#163;2 for every &#163;1
invested&#151;&#163;2.50 or indeed more for many, as our document
sets out.</div>
					<a name="0702072000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, on the
other hand, their working life does not work out that way or they have
extra needs in retirement, we will provide extra help. That is the
right approach. Without reform, almost 80 per cent. of pensioners would
have been on pension credit in 2050. Our reforms deal with that,
although we have always intended that pension credit should act as a
safety net for those who have not been able to provide for themselves.
Because of these reforms, that is what it will remain.</div>
					<a name="0702072000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that is the right
approach, and therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will start to be
slightly more sober in his use of language. If he believes that
automatic enrolment with any means-testing is, by definition,
mis-selling, then he should say so&#151;and part with the consensus
on the Pensions Commission&#146;s proposals. If, on the other hand,
he believes that there should be less means-testing, we can discuss
that. He also knows, however, that there are only two ways of reducing
means-testing; either by giving extra money to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 352</div>everyone, or by taking money off the people who receive pension credit.
To have credibility in this debate, the hon. Gentleman needs to tell us
which approach he intends to follow from now
on.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000577"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Mr. Taylor, I know that we have already
had a long debate, but I want to respond to one important challenge
that the Minister has set me. I confirm that I am certainly
sober&#151;particularly at 20 to 6 on a Tuesday afternoon&#151;but
the Minister challenged me to describe what I meant by
&#147;mis-selling&#148;. It is worth responding, as I mean two
things by it. First, a serious misrepresentation of the likely returns
from personal accounts; I mentioned the first statement that the
Secretary of State made on Second Reading, when he said that the vast
majority of people could look forward to the two for one return. I do
not know whether that was a slip or misunderstanding, but if the most
senior person speaking for the Government does not use the right
language, there is a danger of misrepresenting.</div>
					<a name="0702072000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other thing that I mean by
mis-selling is the automatic enrolment of large numbers of people in
accounts from which they might end up experiencing negative
returns&#151;almost the definition used in his report by Lord Turner.
We remain concerned about that danger, and by that I mean people who
put in &#163;1 and get less than &#163;1 back. The
Government have to address some of those dangers in their proposals and
in the generic advice that will be made
available.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000578"></a>James

&#147;large numbers&#148;?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000579"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> It would concern us to have any individuals not
understand the risks; therefore, generic financial advice is important.
I would, however, be concerned about the potential numbers when as many
as 50 per cent. of the people going into personal accounts might be
subject to means-testing. We will get clarification of those figures
later from the Government, but the Government have to address that
mis-selling risk. The Government also face risk in seeking to deal with
that mis-selling risk; having told people the accurate returns that
they may get in those accounts, they may find that the number deciding
to go into them is much lower than they would otherwise have
liked.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000580"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> The Minister&#146;s message on this new clause
seems to be &#147;No More Mr. Nice Guy&#148;. He is
basically threatening to throw the hon. Member for Yeovil out of the
consensus if he keeps using the word &#147;mis-selling&#148;, but
the latter does not seem to be abashed by that and keeps using it.
Presumably, his punishment will be not to be invited to any more
seminars, so I will use the word &#147;mis-selling&#148; as often
as possible in this debate.</div>
					<a name="0702072000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">With respect, the Minister had
the argument completely the wrong way round by banging on about taking
benefits off people with disabilities and other categories, and
defending means-testing for people who clearly need help from the
state&#151;and probably always will need that help&#151;rather than
looking at our argument. Our argument is that the existence of mass 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 353</div>means-testing is likely to undermine the system for personal accounts.
The Minister might have avoided addressing that today, but cannot avoid
doing so in the long run. The argument is not about means-testing as
such, but about its real-world effect on this new system of saving for
retirement, and whether it will work at all. We are concerned that we
might inherit a system that is programmed to fail. With respect, that
is the way to look at it in the context of this debate.</div>
					<a name="0702072000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am genuinely grateful to the
Minister for explaining the different models so carefully. I have no
way of knowing whether what he told me was complete gobbledegook or
not, but I expect that we will hear more at his great seminar. Although
the difference between a Committee and a seminar is that we do not have
the benefit of a PowerPoint presentation, it seems to me that the
biggest single factor in the difference between PPI and the Department
for Work and Pensions is the matter of S2P, the projections of who will
receive it and how much they will get. I have grotesquely summarised
what the Minister was saying. That is very much a function of using
Pensim 2 versus the projections used by the
PPI.</div>
					<a name="0702072000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will return to
the seminar, no doubt, and see whether we can achieve a consensus.
Perhaps we can all be locked in, with the exception of the hon. Member
for Yeovil, until a consensus is hammered out. Can the Minister promise
us that there will be no question of having the Report stage before the
seminar? That should not be difficult with the half-term break coming
up. We need to test the robustness of the two positions, especially as
both parties claim to have a very robust way of achieving their
conclusions, which is always a bit of a worry if you are a layman in
these matters, as I
am.</div>
					<a name="0702072000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not press my
new clause to a vote. The Minister was good enough to point out that
some of the information is already published, perhaps even more
regularly than the new clause demands. I take his point about the
relevance to the Government Actuaries Department; I was merely trying
to inject an element of independence of provenance for these streams of
data.</div>
					<a name="0702072000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was pleased but
puzzled by what the Minister said about regulation&#151;that indeed
he was considering having a properly regulated system for personal
accounts. There is a great fear in the industry that there will not be
a level playing field, that personal accounts will be relatively
unregulated, especially in view of our debate this morning about
competing with existing pension provision, and that it would be unfair
competition for that reason, given what the Minister said about rule 64
and the likelihood that that may be
removed.</div>
					<a name="0702072000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
have always had concerns about the rough justice argument, which
asserts that because a large, relatively unquantified majority will be
better off under auto enrolment into the system, we do not need to
worry too much about what one assumes is the small minority for whom it
will be exactly the wrong thing to do&#151;people who should be
opting out of the personal accounts system.</div>
					<a name="0702072000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me back to the issue
of generic advice, how it is to be delivered, in what form and by whom.
Invariably, Ministers fall back on trivial
commutation
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 354</div>
						but it is not a great solution for people on low
incomes anyway who have been putting money into pensions for some time
to be told, &#147;Well, at the end of the day you can always get your
money back if all else fails.&#148; We need to consider whether there
are other ways in which they could use that money, to better financial
effect, during their working lives, and how they are to be
advised on doing so. Like the Minister, I look forward to what the
Thoresen review has to say; I forget its time scale, but we need an
answer sooner rather than
later.</div>
					<a name="0702072000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

					<a name="0702072000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
familiar argument, but no less important for that reason. New clause 6
deals with the financial assistance scheme. I shall begin with the
specifics of the new clause. It requires the Secretary of State to
commission an independent review of the FAS to consider, among other
things, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its administration.
Let me pause there for a
moment.</div>
					<a name="0702072000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have always
had serious concerns about the wisdom of setting up the FAS as a
completely separate body, doing its own thing in a completely different
part of the country, and we have always taken the view that the only
possible reason for doing that was a political one: to underline the
big disparity between the benefits paid by the FAS and the compensation
paid under the Pension Protection
Fund.</div>
					<a name="0702072000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to sketch in
a bit of history, the FAS was the illegitimate child of the 2004
legislation. It was cobbled together at short notice, and announced on
14 May 2004 at a point when the Government were in real danger of being
defeated in this House by a combination of Opposition parties and
Labour rebels, simply because a large number of people who had lost
their pensions, through no fault of their own, would not fall within
the PPF. In our view, the FAS was always
misconceived.</div>
					<a name="0702072000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
announcement in May 2004 produced a figure of &#163;400 million, but
no one was ever able to justify it. It was always as plain as a
pikestaff that it was wildly inaccurate and inadequate. It now turns
out that some 125,000 people were affected&#151;the estimates were
quite a bit lower at the time&#151;so the Government have had a
rather difficult time trying to squeeze potential claimants into the
&#163;400 million financial envelope that the Chancellor produced at
short notice.</div>
					<a name="0702072000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FAS
did not get off to a happy start. As it happens, when we were debating
the Bill that became the Pensions Act 2004, I tabled an amendment
suggesting that there should be a mini-PPF, administered by the same
people who administered the PPF, to deal with claimants who came up
prior to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 356</div>due date for the PPF. We always accepted the principle put forward by
the Government, although they rowed back from it in the latter stages
of the legislation, that it was a bit like fire insurance&#151;one
cannot insure one&#146;s house against fire after it has burned
down&#151;so there could not be an element of retrospectivity to the
PPF, but it would have made much more sense to use the same expertise
and skill set to administer the separate fund. At the time, we argued
for it to be endowed with unclaimed assets&#151;I shall return to
that in a moment&#151;under the umbrella of the PPF, which was
starting its own life and which in many respects has drawn in a great
deal of expertise and effectively administered itself since it was set
up.</div>
					<a name="0702072000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Subsection
(1)(a) deals with the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the
administration. Subsection (1)(b) deals with the point that I already
made about whether the FAS could be more effective if administered by
the staff of the PPF. I have little doubt that we should scrap the FAS
as a separate entity and bring the whole administration within the PPF
in the way that I described. Indeed, a review was carried out of the
FAS&#151;at the moment the name of the gentlemen who did it escapes
me&#151;which in many ways took the view that the administration
should be shifted into the Pension Service itself.</div>
					<a name="0702072000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)(c) deals with
whether the FAS is &#147;adequately financed&#148;. I shall deal
with that more broadly in a minute. Subsection (1)(d)
reads,</div>
					<a name="0702072000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what other sources
of finance could be made available, including but not limited to
unclaimed assets&#148;.</div>
					<div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)(e) deals
with whether the
FAS</div>
					<a name="0702072000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should be engaged in
the purchase of bulk
annuities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
how is the FAS doing? Only today, we discovered in a parliamentary
answer that it has finally provided assistance to some 871 people. That
is a massive advance on the situation a few months ago, but it is still
not terribly good when we consider the 125,000 people caught in this
nightmare. And that is despite the fact that it has been in operation
for almost 18 months. It is now, of course, closed to new applicants
and seems to be taking on average at least six months to process a
single claim.</div>
					<a name="0702072000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FAS
was set up in York&#151;almost as far from the PPF as it is possible
to get&#151;and it has already cost &#163;7 million to
deliver payments to just 871 people. Those figures came out the day
before there was to be a demonstration outside Parliament on behalf of
the Pensioners Action Group starting its High Court case against the
Government tomorrow over compensation and the ombudsman&#146;s
report. We will come back to that report and the Government&#146;s
reaction to it in more detail when we discuss new clause 7 shortly.
However, it seems clear to us that the FAS got off on the wrong foot
and after a year and a half in operation only a tiny fraction of those
who need help are receiving it. To use a phrase current in the Home
Office, it is simply not fit for purpose&#151;I have described
already what I believe should happen instead.</div>
					<a name="0702072000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">So how should we deal with the
FAS? The parliamentary ombudsman said in her
report:</div>
					<a name="0702072000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
quite clear that the FAS will not constitute an adequate and
appropriate remedy for the injustice claimed by those who have
complained to me&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 357</div>
					<a name="0702072000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard that the Government
have provided extra funding for the FAS. In Department for Work and
Pensions questions yesterday, the Secretary of State was worryingly
vague about the extent of that commitment. Having carried out an
analysis, with expert help, it seems to us that the Government have
given an open-ended commitment to what is essentially a defined-benefit
scheme compensating people under the FAS. It is difficult to see a
limit on the Government&#146;s liability. I hope that the Minister
has had a chance to reflect on that since yesterday because it seems
that the Government, who are claiming a figure of &#163;1.9 billion,
could be liable for quite a lot more, given the level of benefits
established. Presumably, it will be easier to establish the total
liability now that new claims under the FAS are out of time, as I
understand it. If the Minister has more information, I would be
delighted to hear it.</div>
					<a name="0702072000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is very clear. We think
that the FAS has not been a success. If it was designed as a way in
which to get the Government through a rough political patch, and
through a general election campaign, it has been mildly successful, but
it has not solved the long-term problems of so many people with
legitimate needs for financial help following events completely beyond
their control. Would it not make far more sense to fold the FAS
administratively into the PPF, which will hopefully speed up the
process by which people are
compensated?</div>
					<a name="0702072000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
deal with all these points on finance in much more detail when we
discuss new clause 7, if that helps the Minister and you,
Mr. Taylor. Subsection (1)(c) of our new clause 6 relates to
whether the FAS is adequately financed. That is also a key question if
the Government are determined to keep it as a separate entity, subject
to the point that I made about what limits, if any, there are on the
Government&#146;s stated liability.</div>
					<a name="0702072000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We have said
that unclaimed assets are an obvious place to look, given that there is
&#163;3 billion of unclaimed pensions, which might be appropriate for
the purpose I am discussing. For a long time, the Government&#146;s
mantra was that just because assets were unclaimed, it did not mean
that they did not belong to people. That is true in theory, but a year
or two ago the Chancellor did a 180 turn and is now looking at
ways to grab unclaimed assets. I suspect that that is partly to make up
the shortfall in funding for the Olympics. Clearly they are available
and this is an obvious way to use them.</div>
					<a name="0702072000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also a major issue
about the bulk purchase of annuities. I know all the arguments about
annuities and why they should be purchased in an ideal world, if one is
a purist. However, the money available could go a lot further. I am not
just talking about the money that the Government have already committed
from the taxpayer or the unclaimed assets. We should remember that
there are residual assets in these pensions, although they are
admittedly inadequate for the purpose of covering all the
claims.</div>
					<a name="0702072000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider those things taken together. The money could go a lot further
if, instead of buying bulk annuities with all the premium attached to
the cost of that in the marketplace, it was spent simply on paying out
to people on a regular basis the compensation to which they are found
to be entitled. These are important issues, and I want to go into the
financing of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 358</div>the claims in more detail when we consider the ombudsman&#146;s report
and so on.</div>
					<a name="0702072000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is a crying
shame and, as I have said before, a stain on this Government&#146;s
record that some of these unfortunates are having to appear in the High
Court tomorrow to make a case for proper compensation. There is an
extra dimension to this, because I understand that the Government have
been playing hardball, as the Americans would put it, on the legal
costs that would be incurred if claims were to fail. I am sure that
there are precedents in respect of public interest cases, particularly
given that this is essentially a class action, where Governments should
not pursue costs because legitimate issues need to be considered. I do
not want to stray into the realms of sub judice, but the Government
should take a more emollient line. Why should these people be going to
court at all? Why should they not be looking to the FAS to look after
their legitimate interests? This situation is an enormous
shame.</div>
					<a name="0702072000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
comes up in spades in new clause 7, and we have made it many times,
including on Second Reading. It seems to us that the Government have a
major task to perform in clearing the ground for the new system of
personal accounts. That means removing any factors within their control
that are undermining confidence in the pensions system as a whole. I
suspect that nothing has done more to undermine confidence,
particularly among younger workers, about saving for pensions than the
regular appearance of a lot of middle-aged or older men stripping off
for the cameras at Labour party conferences or elsewhere to make their
case about their lost pensions. Such events are extremely bad news for
the whole pensions system and for the Government in terms of trying to
build up confidence in pensions. That is why it is important that we
air these issues as part of the debate on this
Bill.</div>

						</b> I agree with everything that my hon. Friend the
Member for Eastbourne has said. I have an interest, because some of my
constituents were affected by the events involving the Dexion pension
scheme in Hemel Hempstead, which is not far from my constituency, and
one or two were affected by the collapse of the Albert Fisher pension
scheme, although that is somewhat further away from
Bedfordshire.</div>
					<a name="0702072000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply
want to continue on the point of trust which my hon. Friend the Member
for Eastbourne mentioned. I say this as someone who wants personal
accounts to succeed, and who genuinely wants to be part of this
consensus and to have a much better system of state and private pension
provision. There is unfinished business here, and the Government have
an obligation to clear the decks and try to get a slightly more just
settlement for those 125,000 people who feel incredibly hard done by in
terms of the guarantees that they thought they
had.</div>
					<a name="0702072000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is all very
well for people like us to stand up in Committee and elsewhere and make
these points. I want to quote three paragraphs from a lady called Anna
Roberts. She wrote this in 2003 when she was 33 in an excellent
document that I have referred to before 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 359</div>produced by Age Concern and the Fawcett Society. It was principally on
women&#146;s pensions, but the point that she makes here about trust
is so relevant and shows why new clause 6 is important in helping
personal accounts to get off to the best possible start. Anna Roberts
said:</div>
					<a name="0702072000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
don&#146;t have a private pension and have never seriously considered
joining a pension scheme, despite working full time and earning a
decent salary.</div>
					<a name="0702072000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">Like
the majority of people I know, I am incredibly cynical about pensions
and would rather look at other ways to plan for my retirement. I think
that buying a property or investing in a second home is a much safer
option.</div>
					<a name="0702072000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">I do not trust
the pensions system. There are so many stories reported in the press
about people who lose out after making years of contributions. At the

risk.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that this lady&#146;s view has become even more cynical, given the
coverage that those 125,000 people have
received.</div>

taste in the

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It was
initially very minimal compensation. The Government have increased it
somewhat. But I really come back to subsection (1)(d) of new clause 6,
particularly in relation to unclaimed assets. I am surprised that the
Government have not looked more closely at this area, particularly as
they have looked at unclaimed assets, possibly in terms of the social
investment bank which would do good works that we all would welcome in
our constituencies. I think that these people who have lost out have a
prior moral claim. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne said, we
hear rumours that this money may be earmarked for the yawning gap in
the budget for the Olympics in 2012. New clause 6 is an attempt to deal
with the issue of trust so that we can get the system of personal
accounts and this new settlement off to the best possible
start.</div>

it is worth pointing out that we have the pensions regulator and the

about saving in a company pension that the Pension Protection Fund
exists.</div>
					<a name="0702072000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Members for Eastbourne and for South-West Bedfordshire were attacking a
regulatory regime at all, it was the one that was put in place in the
Pensions Act 1995, and the much-commented-on leaflet describing the
1995 Act in the terms that the now shadow Foreign Secretary used when
he was the Minister taking through that Act. We have been defending
that regime in the European Court of Justice and we will also defend it
in judicial review this week. If he thinks that the regime that was put
in place by the 1995 Act is insufficient in light of the 1983
insolvency directive, perhaps he will say so
now.</div>

disappointed with the tone of his remarks. I did not seek to apportion
blame either to his party or to mine. He is right in saying that the

how to provide a more just settlement for these people so that we can
move the issue on. I am not hearing a solution from the

Gentleman&#146;s challenge about how the situation has changed since

PPF and the financial assistance scheme have been introduced. They were
not there before. If we are to discuss the matter, we need to do so on
the basis of whether we think that the regulatory regime is right, and
we have defended it in a number of court actions.</div>
					<a name="0702072000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just as important is whether
parties are proposing to put more money into the scheme. The hon.
Member for Eastbourne said on 27 June that he was not proposing to put
any more taxpayers&#146; money into the financial assistance scheme.
It would be easy if there were a pot of money out there that had not
been allocated and could be spent on this. I shall respond to his
remarks when I address that matter. What is clear, and I hope that he
will make it so to people during the demonstration tomorrow, is that
the Conservative party is not proposing to spend any more

<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 361</div>As he knows, we recently published our review of the winding-up of
schemes in which we made it clear that we thought that people should
wind up their schemes within two years. I hope that that addresses his

						</b> The Minister seems to be a one-club golfer when
it comes to the FAS; all he ever says is that the Tories will not
commit any more taxpayers&#146; money. However, we have put forward a
series of income and asset streams that could be used and tried to
consider sensibly how people could be properly helped. All the
Government ever seem to do is say, &#147;Oh, it will cost some vast
amount. It is a visit to another version of the Lib Dem Santa&#146;s
grotto. It will cost &#163;15 billion, and the world as we know it
will come to an end.&#148; However, they should be considering some
of the options and working them out. They have the resources to do
that; why will they
not?</div>

he is welcome to intervene on me at the
end.</div>
					<a name="0702072000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment calls for a review of the financial assistance scheme.
Members will know that we have been here before. The hon. Gentleman
referred to the Galvin review, which we announced on 6 June and which
reported in July. It was charged with considering what could be done to
provide the best administration and management for the financial
assistance scheme to ensure that people were paid as quickly as
possible. The review also considered how to ensure the most
cost-effective operation of the FAS and a full range of options for its
organisation and location. The review was conducted by DWP officials,
with representation from the PPF, seconded experts from the pensions
regulator and significant input from the pensions industry.</div>
					<a name="0702072000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The review
explicitly considered transferring the administration of the FAS to the
PPF. In that particular case, the regulatory requirements faced by the
PPF in respect of the transfer of FAS would have placed considerable
strains on a small organisation in its first years of operation. Any
PPF option would also require secondary legislation to extend the PPF
remit, which could involve a significantly longer transfer
process.</div>
					<a name="0702072000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
review found that a number of recommendations should be acted on to
improve the administration of the FAS. It recommended that a different
skill set be brought in and that there should be a revised approach to
gathering data, to speed up payments. It considered outsourcing and
decided that it was not a viable option. Instead, it decided to bring
such skills in-house; I shall talk about that a bit
later.</div>
					<a name="0702072000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review
concluded that the length of wind-up and competing trustee priorities
were real constraints on making fast payments, that a detailed work
analysis of the operational unit was required and that the long-term
governance of the FAS was best placed in the Pension Service, which has
the competence to operate the payment processing effectively and
efficiently. Since July, we have worked hard to implement the
review&#146;s findings.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 362</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000609"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Having said all that, and given that the FAS has
had six months to implement the recommendations for improvement in the
service, is the Minister satisfied that as of yesterday only 871
payments have apparently been made, of the much larger number still
being
processed?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000610"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I will come to that in my speech; I shall try to
explain the main hurdle in paying more people. It is worth saying that
there is no way we should be paying 125,000 people because the vast
majority of them have not yet retired. The financial assistance scheme
pays only those who have reached retirement age, survivors and, in some
cases, the terminally
ill.</div>
					<a name="0702072000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review looked
into what the key barrier to making faster payments was. That key
barrier is data collection. We need to get data from schemes about all
individual members and the rights that they have built up so that we
can work out how much to pay them. That barrier would arise in pretty
much any scheme that the hon. Member for Eastbourne wanted to come up
with. Unless he wanted a flat rate to be paid to people regardless of
how much they had contributed, any scheme that he came up with would
have to go through the process of calculating how much individuals were
owed and to what level they should be topped up. In this first stage,
that requires significant work and has led to the six-month delay that
the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That is the up-front process, going
through all the schemes working out people&#146;s entitlement. Once
that has been done, the process should be relatively simple. At that
stage, we shall just be paying people an amount that has been
calculated, which will be a relatively simple task, but in the first
few months, working out people&#146;s individual entitlements is a
genuinely significant
task.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000497"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

					<a name="0702072000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason,
we are currently working with the private sector&#151;Mercer Human
Resource Consulting, which is one of the leading providers of services
to the pensions industry&#151;on our processes and on the data issues
that we have encountered. Mercer is working to transfer its expertise
and to build on the knowledge already acquired by the staff at the FAS
unit.</div>
					<a name="0702072000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also
written to key figures in the pensions industry, urging them to support
the members in the schemes for which they are responsible and to supply
FAS with the data that we need to make payments. We have urged the
pensions industry and its administrators to provide the data that we
need. We are also working with the pensions service to complete the
transfer of the FAS operational unit as quickly as
possible.</div>
					<a name="0702072000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">FAS staff
have already successfully handled the challenges of scheme notification
and qualification&#151;the process of working out which schemes will
be eligible. They have dealt with applications from more than 900
pension schemes and, since we announced the review of the FAS in June,
its staff have overseen a 10-fold increase in the number of payments
being made. I do not believe that it would be an effective use of
taxpayers&#146; money formally to review the operation of the FAS
again. That would prove a distraction to the staff and to scheme
trustees and administrators, who are now working closely together to
get those data. I want to thank the trustees who have been providing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 363</div>information and making requests for initial payments and, indeed, the
FAS staff, who have been working extremely hard and effectively to
increase the number of
payments.</div>
					<a name="0702072000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now, the
amendment also calls for a review of FAS funding. In the White Paper in
May we announced an increase in FAS funding from the &#163;400
million originally allocated to &#163;2.3 billion. In response to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s inquiry, we set out the forecasts on the basis
of which we arrived at the &#163;2.3 billion, based on a review of
the people and schemes. We set that out in some detail to Parliament. I
am happy to discuss that with him again, if he wants. The key point is
that the amount that we will pay to people in a situation is clear; we
have committed &#163;2.3 billion, which, we believe, cover our future
liabilities under the financial assistance scheme. As I said, and as I
think the hon. Gentleman agrees, there is a balance to be struck
between the real need of people in this situation and what the taxpayer
should be expected to fund. We did and do recognise the real losses
that people have had. That is exactly why we have extended the scheme
to those within 15 years of normal retirement
age.</div>
					<a name="0702072000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for Eastbourne pressed me to say whether we had looked at
other sources of funds. We have. His amendment proposes looking at
unclaimed assets, which continue to be seen by the Opposition as a
panacea. The challenge for them is that the Government will be
committing, on behalf of the taxpayer, to guarantee pensions for the
lifetime of the scheme, with survivors&#146; rights. That would be
for at least 50 years. I do not think that it would be responsible to
provide such a guarantee without having identified the resources needed
to underwrite it over the long term or, indeed, to establish the amount
available as unclaimed assets and then represent that amount as an
ongoing income stream.</div>
					<a name="0702072000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Member for Eastbourne cannot be sure that unclaimed assets would
provide an income stream over 50 years. It is also clear that there is
not enough in unclaimed assets to be able to pay pensions in full, even
if he thought that that stream was one that could be reliably depended
on for the next 50 years. That is the problem with relying on unclaimed
assets. It is the same problem as thinking that we could pay from the
national insurance fund surplus or the Department&#146;s contingency
reserve. They are not pots of money that can be used to make that
guarantee over 50 years and it is not fair to pretend to people that
that could be the
case.</div>

unclaimed assets are not a total solution, they are no solution at
all?</div>

								James
Purnell:
						</b> No, that is not my argument. My argument is that
if people are to make a guarantee over 50 years, they need to say how
it will be funded. It is also worth saying that unclaimed assets are
not Government money. As the hon. Gentleman knows, an independent
commission&#151;the Commission on Unclaimed Assets&#151;has been
set up to propose recommendations on the use of unclaimed assets in the
UK. The commission recommended the creation of a new independent
financial institution to drive voluntary and community organisations
seeking to relieve poverty in the UK. The commission&#146;s final
report to be published before the 2007 Budget will detail a series of
technical and regulatory mechanisms 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 364</div>to ensure a thorough auditing of dormant accounts and a rigorous
campaign to unite account holders with their unclaimed assets.
Obviously, if that is successful, there will not be as much money in
that fund.</div>
					<a name="0702072000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission has made clear what the fund should be used for. If the hon.
Gentleman is saying that the money should be taken out of that fund and
that he disagrees with the proposal, that is his right. However, the
point is the same for any use of Government money. For example, if the
Government were to use taxpayers&#146; money to increase the amount
in the FAS, that money would not then be available for an alternative
use. Decisions should be looked at in that
context.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000613"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> The point made by the Minister is, of course,
valid. Some money may be reunited with it owners&#151;that is fine
and we accept that. However, is he really saying that, as the Minister
for Pensions, he is happy for that money to go towards the purposes of
a social investment bank and reducing poverty? That is an objective
that all hon. Members would share, but, as the Minister for Pensions
Reform, does he really think that that should be the first call on that
money?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000614"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> My job as the Minister for Pensions Reform is to
try to get more money for this scheme and that is exactly what we did
in the White Paper; we extended the money available to &#163;2.3
billion. We clearly recognise the loss that people have suffered and we
found extra taxpayers&#146; money to extend the scheme to people
within 15 years of their normal retirement age. I have made clear, as
has my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, our commitment to
helping people who have suffered those losses.</div>
					<a name="0702072000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other source of funding
mentioned by the hon. Gentleman was bulk annuity. He knows that the FAS
tops up an annuity purchased by the scheme&#146;s trustees on the
member&#146;s behalf. In concluding that that represented the best
use of taxpayers&#146; money, we considered whether pooling the
remaining assets was a viable option. The difficulty was that around
110 of the 640 schemes that qualify for the FAS have already completed
winding up and have purchased annuities. For the rest, it is not known
what proportion of assets are still being held, but a significant
proportion will already have been spent on annuities for pensioners,
therefore significantly reducing the bulk purchasing power of the
remainder. As the hon. Gentleman knows, if we do not annuitise, that
changes the risk profile of people in the future and potentially leads
to pensioners&#146; incomes going down while in payment, which,
again, may be something that people are reluctant to expose themselves
to.</div>

						</b> Can the Minister give us some idea of what data
are or could be available on which pension funds still have assets that
have not been devoted to purchasing annuities? That is a crucial issue,
but it seems quite difficult to get a handle on the
figure.</div>

					<a name="0702072000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are implementing the
review&#146;s findings and have considered other sources of finance,
but we think that in making guarantees to people over the next 50
years, we have to know where the money will come from and be able to
identify it reliably. We completely share the Committee&#146;s
sympathy for people who have lost pensions. I have met more than 100
people in that situation and, of course, it is heartbreaking to have
had an expectation that has not materialised. That was exactly why the
Government believed it right to provide extra support through the
financial assistance scheme and to introduce the pensions regulator and
the Pension Protection Fund. However, we must balance that obligation
with our obligation to taxpayers, many of whom do not benefit from
defined benefit pension schemes at all. We have great respect for the
office of the ombudsman and the motives of those who are fighting to
represent people, but both the ombudsman and the Select Committee
recognised in their reports that the Government did not cause the
pension schemes to fail. It would not therefore be right to write a
blank cheque to underwrite the losses. I hope that I have explained why
it was right to extend the FAS, but it would not be fair to the
taxpayer to underwrite schemes in
full.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000617"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for at least parts
of his answer and for taking us through some of the practical
difficulties, but I wonder whether the matter could be re-examined. I
appreciate the Minister&#146;s point about transferring to the PPF
being somewhat troublesome when it had only just started, but now that
it is more established I wonder whether that could be reconsidered. I
was interested to hear about the work being done with Mercer, which
will hopefully bear
fruit.</div>
					<a name="0702072000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
spoiled it all by saying, among other things, that the Government would
not write a blank cheque. Nobody is asking them to do that. We are
saying to them that they should stop telling us what the problems are
and consider more seriously the options that have been put forward.
They have committed &#163;2.3 billion, but it is still
unclear to me whether there is an open-ended commitment beyond that
figure. We agree about the extra burden on the taxpayer, which is
precisely why we keep mentioning other
possibilities.</div>
					<a name="0702072000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
unclaimed assets, we have always said that the obvious safeguards must
be in place, including major attempts to reunite people with their
assets, as happened in Ireland, and an underlying guarantee that late
applicants with a legitimate claim can be compensated. There is a big
difference between the bank accounts in question in this country and,
for instance, those in Ireland, where a lot of them go back a long
way&#151;sometimes hundreds of years. The chances of anyone coming
forward are therefore much slimmer, although it is not impossible. The
Minister could have been a bit more open about how far the process of
identifying unclaimed assets and bank accounts has gone in
organisations such as the British Bankers&#146; Association, and how
far the process of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 366</div>identifying the &#163;3 billion of unclaimed pensions has gone at the
NAPF. It happily confirmed that figure to us
recently.</div>
					<a name="0702072000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose it
comes down to whether the Minister is happier for money to be spent on
shoring up the Olympics than on pensioners who have in many cases lost
almost everything. I shall not press the new clause to a Division, but
I will certainly wish to return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the

					<a name="0702072000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause is
on another big issue, which has been a running sore for some time and a
major distraction from the Government&#146;s attempts to restore
confidence in the pensions system. It would require the Secretary of
State, within three months of the Bill coming into force, to bring
forward proposals to comply fully with the recommendations in the
ombudsman&#146;s sixth report of 2005-06, &#147;Trusting in the
pensions promise: government bodies and the security of final salary
occupational pensions&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">One might think it a bit odd
that it has been necessary to table such a new clause. After all, the
office of the parliamentary ombudsman has existed since the 1960s. It
was introduced by a Labour Government, in the shape of Dick Crossman,
and it has had cross-party support ever since. It is seen as an
important, independent safeguard for the rights of individuals when the
Executive bring about maladministration. In her report in March 2006,
the ombudsman could not have been clearer. She found that the
Government were guilty of maladministration to pension scheme members
who lost their money when their schemes collapsed or were closed by
their employers. She said that official information about security of
final salary occupational schemes</div>
					<a name="0702072000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;was sometimes inaccurate, often
incomplete, largely inconsistent and therefore potentially
misleading&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0702072000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, what
did the Government do? First, they rubbished those findings, and then
they rejected them in total, mainly by claiming that the cost of
providing financial redress, as indicated by the ombudsman, would be
too great.</div>
					<a name="0702072000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prime
Minister came up with a figure of &#163;15 billion&#151;he
has repeated it more than once since then&#151;and said that that was
unaffordable. Since then, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 367</div>the Government have been in denial about the whole matter. The Prime
Minister said
that</div>
					<a name="0702072000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;although of course
we must and do treat seriously the ombudsman's findings, we are being
asked as a consequence of them to give, on behalf of general taxpayers
&#163;15 billion-worth of commitment. We simply cannot do
that.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 15 March 2006;

					<a name="0702072000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first major issue&#151;I
shall come to financial redress in more detail&#151;is that it is not
the job of Ministers and certainly not the job of the Prime Minister,
to decide whether there has been maladministration. That has been
found, and the message to Ministers is to get over it. The ombudsman
made her decision and the whole point of creating the Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration in 1967 was that such decisions were
taken away from the Executive. Challenging the findings of the referee,
which is effectively what the Government have done, is simply
unacceptable and a constitutional outrage, leaving aside the continuing
and abiding unfairness to those who have lost
out.</div>

to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s previous argument, which I followed
closely, like all hon. Members my casework has included a number of
applications to ombudsman on a range of public service issues. The
consistent theme in decisions is that there must be a
link&#151;causality&#151;between maladministration and an injustice
to an individual. It is odd that the ombudsman&#146;s report and the
words that the hon. Gentleman quoted said that the Government&#146;s

was that it was worth making those changes only if the MFR was going to
be there for the long term. However, the Government were already
planning to replace it with a different regime. The hon. Gentleman
needs to be slightly careful about what allegation he is making. The
MFR was not weakened, but restored to its original intended
level.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000630"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> We may be getting into semantics. The effect was
to weaken the protection. I am not making a case here; I am simply
trying to reflect what is in the ombudsman&#146;s long and thorough
report. If the Minister wishes to clarify these issues in writing, I am
happy to read what he has to
say.</div>
					<a name="0702072000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me help the
Minister; this is a perfect moment for him to have intervened. At page
169, paragraph 5.213, the ombudsman
says:</div>
					<a name="0702072000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
October 1998, briefing by officials in DWP&#146;s predecessor
department had recognised that the decision in the 1997 Budget to
abolish the system of tax credits given to pension schemes had
&#145;shaken&#146; pension scheme funding. In November 1999, DSS
officials told a Minister that that decision had &#145;had the effect
of weakening the MFR test as prescribed at that
time&#146;.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
Minister may wish to reconsider what he said in his
intervention.</div>
					<a name="0702072000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return
to quote that I was about to give, which relates to the intervention of
the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West. The ombudsman went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="0702072000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I consider
that it is evident that this decision had the effect of reducing the
income available to all pension schemes every
year.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">She added that that
decision</div>
					<a name="0702072000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;weakened the
protection offered to scheme members by the
MFR.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress
again to the Minister that I am simply trying to summarise, as briefly
as I can, the key findings in the ombudsman&#146;s report. In her
recommendations, she says that</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 370</div>
					<a name="0702072000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;the Government
should consider whether it should make arrangements for the restoration
of the core pension and non-core benefits promised to all those whom I
have identified above...including if necessary by payment from
public funds, to replace the full amount lost by those
individuals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
quite a lot of scope there to decide how one calculates the full amount
lost by those individuals as set out in her
recommendations.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000631"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I shall correct this if I am wrong, but I think
that the point that the ombudsman was making was that the MFR was
weakened by the changes because stock market growth was affected, and
that changes therefore needed to be made. We made those changes. I
think that we implemented the 1998
recommendations.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000632"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> It is perfectly possible, at this stage in our
debates, that the Minister and I are talking at cross-purposes. I
thought that the paragraph that I quoted a moment ago was clear enough
to the extent that it suggested that officials had warned the
Minister&#146;s predecessor and that that advice was not taken.
However, these are important issues and it is important that we are
accurate about them, so I am more than happy to be corrected, just as
the Minister has generously said that he is happy to be, in subsequent
correspondence or, indeed, at the beginning of the next
sitting.</div>
					<a name="0702072000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">As is well
known, the ombudsman went on to recommend that</div>
					<a name="0702072000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government should consider
whether it should provide for the payment of consolatory payments to
those scheme members fully covered by my recommendations - as a
tangible recognition of the outrage, distress, inconvenience and
uncertainty that they have
endured.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not the
strongest recommendation. It says that the Government should consider
doing that, but did they consider it? Not for a moment: they dismissed
the report out of hand. They rubbished it, tried to undermine the
ombudsman, as they have since done, and would have nothing to do with
considering her
recommendations.</div>
					<a name="0702072000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
next paragraph, the ombudsman says
that</div>
					<a name="0702072000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government
should consider whether it should apologise to scheme trustees for the
effects on them of the maladministration I have identified,
particularly for the distress that they have suffered due to the events
relevant to this investigation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no sign of an apology,
Mr. Taylor. Apologies, as my dear sainted mother used to
say, do not cost anything, but the Government could not bring
themselves even to apologise. The ombudsman went on to make other
related recommendations.</div>
					<a name="0702072000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the approach taken in
the ombudsman&#146;s report. It is still an impressive report that
has been dismissed out of hand by the Government. What happened next?
Once the five recommendations had been rejected altogether and the cost
of meeting them had been substantially exaggerated, the Select
Committee on Public Administration, to its eternal glory, decided to
take on the matter, too. It carried out its own investigation and
produced a report in due course, with the rather worrying title of
&#147;The Ombudsman in Question: the Ombudsman&#146;s report on
pensions and its constitutional
implications&#148;.</div>

					<a name="0702072000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let me give
some of the Committee&#146;s choicer comments on the
Government&#146;s conduct. On page 11, paragraph 21
states:</div>
					<a name="0702072000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
made our own investigations. We believe the Government is being, at
best, nave, and, at worst,
misleading.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
also states on page
32:</div>
					<a name="0702072000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We share
the Ombudsman&#146;s concern that the Government has been far too
ready to dismiss her findings of maladministration. Our investigations
have shown that these findings were sound. It would be extremely
damaging&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">extremely
damaging&#151;</div>
					<a name="0702072000485"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
Government became accustomed simply to reject findings of
maladministration, especially if an investigation by this Committee
proved there was indeed a case to answer. It would raise fundamental
constitutional issues about the position of the Ombudsman and the
relationship between Parliament and the Executive...We trust that
this Report will act as a warning to the
Government.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well, not a
bit of it. We had a debate, quite properly, on the Committee&#146;s
report and Ministers continued to take the attitude that they have
taken all along&#151;they are unwilling even to consider following
the recommendations of the ombudsman.</div>
					<a name="0702072000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">A quotation that is always
particularly poignant on such occasions comes from the then Secretary
of State for Social Security, speaking in a different context, in 2000.
He said:</div>
					<a name="0702072000486"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
giving of wrong information by a Department is inexcusable. There is a
clear responsibility to ensure that the information that Departments
provide is accurate and complete. In this case, it was not...As a
matter of principle, we believe that when someone loses out because
they were given the wrong information by a Department, they are
entitled to redress.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 15 March
2000; Vol. 346, c. 307-308.]</div>
					<a name="0702072000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where are we now with that
unhappy band of people, already facing penury, who have been unable to
persuade the Government to accept the findings of the parliamentary
ombudsman? We have heard that they are going to the High Court tomorrow
for the beginning of a court case, where the Government apparently have
every intention of recovering their pound of flesh in recoverable costs
should those people happen to lose. Only the other day, we had the
European Court of Justice case brought by former employees of Allied
Steel and Wire&#151;I am pleased to say that that case was funded by
at least one major trade union&#151;</div>

							<a name="0702072000633"></a>James

						</b> Just to be clear, the point is that the
Department does not waive its costs in advance. If we established a
practice of doing that, it would apply to most people who ever sue the
Department. Principles are established for public interest cases
according to the Corner House principles, and it is common ground that
the case does not meet those principles. We will of course consider the
issue of costs at the end of the proceedings, which is our normal
practice in all sorts of similar cases.</div>

issue of public interest cases and the recoverability of costs,
although I would have thought that if ever there was a case with a
clear public interest it would be this one. I do not want to read too
much into it for the sake of the people on whose behalf I am
essentially speaking, but I hope that what the Minister said will leave
the door slightly ajar on the vexed issue of
costs.</div>

								Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> That is clearly where they went wrong. I am
grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. In fairness, this is
not just a Conservative-Labour issue in the House; many Labour Members
are at least queasy&#151;I put it no higher than that&#151;about
the Government&#146;s attitude to the ombudsman&#146;s report.
Tomorrow it might not be pensions; it might be one of their
constituents and another issue of maladministration or another
Government Department refusing to accept the findings of the ombudsman.
That is the
worry.</div>
					<a name="0702072000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Let
us take the debate away from pensions for a second. When all other
avenues have failed, it is the right and duty of every right hon. and
hon. Member to refer cases on behalf of their constituents to the
ombudsman and to rely on her independence and the persuasiveness of her
findings. The ombudsman has few, if any, real powers, but if the
Government are going to get into the habit of dismissing her findings
out of hand, what sort of injustices could go on not being dealt with
by the system that has been in place for 40 years?</div>
					<a name="0702072000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was talking about the European
Court of Justice case brought by former employees of Allied Steel and
Wire. As a former litigator, I am not unused to the syndrome of both
sides claiming victory, which certainly happened in that case.
Mr. Derek Simpson, general secretary of the Amicus union,
claimed that the ruling was a victory. He
said:</div>
					<a name="0702072000487"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
judgment vindicates our decision to take this case all the way to the
ECJ.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0702072000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that
the case will now be referred back to the High Court. The Government
suggested that it was a victory for the Government, but that is beside
the point. Why should groups of people who are already suffering
hardship be forced to trail over to the European Court of Justice or up
the road to the High Court in London to try to get what, according to
the ombudsman, is their due in any
event?</div>
					<a name="0702072000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to return
to a central point that was at issue in the last debate: confidence in
the pensions system. If the Government are going to behave so shabbily
they will have only themselves to blame if the system of personal
accounts in this and the next Bill does not succeed. There are a lot of
angry people out there who have suffered very badly as a result of the
maladministration. What should the Government
do?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0702072000637"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Is not
the real anger of people out there who have lost their pensions
directed against the employers who put them in the position of losing
their occupational pensions in the first
place?</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000638"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I do not agree with that as a blanket statement
from the hon. Lady. There are cases in which employers have been rash,
to put it no higher, in the way they have conducted themselves, but
some of the senior management of companies such as Turner and
Newell&#151;I met people from that company the other day&#151;are
in exactly the same boat as other employees. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 373</div>
						In fact, they are in a worse boat because they will
be unduly penalised even though they may come under the PPF because of
the cap on compensation. The hon. Lady is partly right; my experience
is that one has to look at the matter on a case-by-case basis. I do not
totally disagree with her.</div>
					<a name="0702072000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">What should the Government be
doing? As I said on 7 December when we debated the issue, they should
stop mucking about and begin by accepting that there has been
maladministration, instead of second-guessing the ombudsman. That is
clear.</div>
					<a name="0702072000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, they
should apologise. As I said then, if it helps them to steal themselves
to do that, we as Conservatives will accept our modest share of the
blame arising from our stewardship from 1996 to 1997, as set out in the
ombudsman&#146;s
report.</div>
					<a name="0702072000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, the
Government should stop floating ridiculously inflated figures like
&#163;15 billion as the cost of tackling the issue. Again, echoing
the last debate, they should start doing some serious work to calculate
how they can best use the available assets and other resources to help
those people. We dealt with purchasing bulk annuities. The Minister was
good enough to give us the number of schemes, but it would also be
worth knowing the actual amounts available from those that have not
finished winding up. Perhaps he will write to me if the figure is not
readily available. It would be
relevant.</div>
					<a name="0702072000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the
purchasing of bulk annuities, the pooling of assets remaining in any of
the failed funds, giving proper credit for benefit payments
saved&#151;we often lose sight of that&#151;and of any income from
tax. Deemed buyback might not help everybody, but for some people it
could be a major
solution.</div>
					<a name="0702072000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
have the aspiration of giving those people something like compensation
at about the level available under the PPF, if at all possible. We
talked about unclaimed assets&#151;I shall not go over that ground
again. The Government should stop sticking their head in the sand, and
start using the resources that are available to them&#151;not to
Opposition parties&#151;to start coming up with a sensible solution
to the problem.</div>
					<a name="0702072000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to the central issue. No, there are two central issues.
Actually, there are three. I am sorry, I am beginning to sound like
Monty Python. The first, of course, is fairness&#151;I would have
thought that that went without saying&#151;and I have tried to deal
with that. There is the constitutional issue, which will not go away,
whatever we decide about pensions and this specific issue. Finally,
there is the issue that is fundamental to this and any future
legislation: confidence. How can we rebuild confidence in the pensions
system as a whole? It is no good telling people, &#147;Of course,
that is the old system, but this is the new system of personal
accounts.&#148; The man in the saloon bar is not interested in any of
that. All that he will see again and again, including tomorrow, is a
lot of disgruntled people on the television who have lost their
pensions, and a Government who apparently are impervious to doing
anything about
it.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000639"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> We have debated this issue on several other
occasions. The hon. Gentleman set out the case for the prosecution, as
it were, extremely effectively, so I shall not deal with the issues
that he aired in his contribution.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 374</div>
					<a name="0702072000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a sense of anger and
injustice that the ombudsman&#146;s report has been ignored. That was
behind the cross-party consensus in the Public Administration Committee
report that the hon. Gentleman discussed. He did not mention the
early-day motion that came out of that report. It has now been signed
by more than 250 Members of Parliament, including 119 Members from the
Government Benches. And, within the past week, there has been a ruling
from the European Court of
Justice.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0702072000500"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div>
					<a name="0702072000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
points made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. In addition, I wish to
make just two appeals to the Minister. The first is the one that I made
to the Secretary of State yesterday about what will happen if the
judicial review in the next couple of months goes against the
Government. May we have a clear undertaking that if the judicial review
concludes that the Government have acted unlawfully in ignoring the
ombudsman&#146;s findings, the Government will finally accept that
they have lost the argument and that it is time to come forward with a
proper compensation package? Will the Minister assure us that we will
not then go even further through the processes of appeal, in which the
Government simply try to delay and find every opportunity to avoid
paying the compensation that most believe is
justified?</div>
					<a name="0702072000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
should like to return to the issue raised by the hon. Member for
Eastbourne about legal costs. I understand all the stuff about
precedents, but we are talking about an extraordinary case. There has
been an incredibly strong report from the ombudsman, making
recommendations that compensation should be paid and that there has
been maladministration. There has also been the recent case at the
European Court of Justice. There is clearly a strong case to answer.
Who are the people pursuing it? They have lost their pensions and will
fear bankruptcy if they end up having to pay the Government&#146;s
costs as well. On top of all their other problems, they run the risk of
losing their properties. In some cases, they have even at times
considered whether to continue to pursue the case because of their fear
that the Government will come back to them for their costs
afterwards.</div>
					<a name="0702072000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely in
circumstances as exceptional as those, in which there is such a strong
and legitimate case to challenge the issue in the courts, it is
genuinely grossly unreasonable, unfair and bullying of the Government
to continue to hold out the possibility that they might pursue their
own costs against those individuals. If the only thing that we get out
of the Minister today and the demonstration tomorrow is an indication
that the Government will withdraw that threat, that would be welcome
indeed.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000640"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> I made the position on that last point clear in
my intervention on the hon. Member for Eastbourne. There are well
established legal precedents and if we created a new precedent, it
could well apply to a very large proportion of the cases taken out
against my Department and others. I said clearly that we would consider
the position at the end of the case, and that is exactly what we do in
lots of similar cases in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 375</div>which people have similar issues about the means available to them. Our
point has always been that we will act in accordance with the
precedents that apply across the
Government.</div>
					<a name="0702072000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
want to try to answer as many points as possible. The hon. Member for
Eastbourne made a point about the minimum funding requirement. The
Pensions Act 1995 set down the minimum funding requirement and
a range of ways in which that would be calculated. When those
assumptions changed, it had to be recalibrated back to its original
intended level. In 1998, the actuarial profession recommended changes
that brought the MFR down to its original level; I think that the hon.
Gentleman was referring to that decision. Those changes were agreed by
the Government in June 1998. The ombudsman found that no
maladministration was involved in the particular decision to which the
hon. Gentleman referred. I hope that that clarifies his
point.</div>
					<a name="0702072000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both Opposition
spokesmen touched on the case at the European Court of Justice. To
recap, the Court gave its ruling on 25 January. We are studying the
judgment carefully and will, of course, abide by our legal obligations
under it. There is a limit to what I can say about the case because it
is returning to the UK High Court so that rulings can be made in the
light of what the ECJ has said.</div>
					<a name="0702072000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I can make a couple of
points about the judgment. First, the ECJ considered whether UK
legislation in place before the Pensions Act 2004 sufficiently
implemented article 8 of the 1980 European insolvency directive.
Successive Governments had always taken the view that the directive
does not oblige member states to ensure that pension promises are
guaranteed in full when a company becomes insolvent, or require the
taxpayer to underwrite them, and the Court has clearly supported that
view.</div>
					<a name="0702072000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question
of damages, the Court appears to have given a clear steer that damages
may not be payable, but that is a matter for the High Court to decide
and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further on that
aspect of the case. It is worth noting that what the European Court of
Justice has said is similar to the point that we have always made on
this matter. The SERPS scheme referred to in a quote from a previous
Secretary of State cited by the hon. Member for Eastbourne is a scheme
run by the Government, who are responsible for its administration and
the information about it. There is a difference between that, where the
Government are clearly responsible, and private schemes, which are
provided by employers and governed by trustees. That is a significant
difference.</div>
					<a name="0702072000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
genuinely recognise the bitter blow that losing a pension is to anyone
in that situation, which is exactly why we have put in place the
financial assistance scheme. The only point that we have made
throughout the process is that we need to strike a balance between the
losses that people have suffered and the amount that the taxpayer
should be expected to pay.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000641"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> The Minister would accept that on a financial
assistance scheme there are some individuals who will get no
compensation at all. Following the ECJ judgment, can that be compatible
with European law?</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 376</div>
					<a name="0702072000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000642"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> There is a limit on what I can say while the case
is going through the court. Of course, we shall look at what the High
Court says and act in the light of it, but the hon. Gentleman will
understand that, given that there is a court case going on relating to
this matter, it is hard for me to comment without straying into legal
territory.</div>
					<a name="0702072000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I tried
to say in my opening remarks, it is worth noting that the Court
reviewed the previous regime and the previous FAS scheme. The Court did
not take a view on the FAS scheme as extended, to &#163;2.3 billion.
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is a lawyer&#151;I am
certainly not one&#151;and we should not pre-judge what the High
Court
decides.</div>

						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Taylor. I
wonder whether I might draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the
assurance that he gave the Committee, in column 28 of the
<i class="I">Official Report </i>of the Committee&#146;s proceedings on 23
January, that he would ask his officials to prepare a note on potential
costings for new clause 12, which we shall come to on Thursday morning.
I have not yet had that note, and I think it reasonable to expect it by
close of play tomorrow.</div>

							<a name="0702072000646"></a>Mr.
Laws:
						</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Taylor. I am grateful to the Minister for his response, and I confirm
that I am not a lawyer, but one does not have to be a lawyer to
understand that if individuals were getting zero compensation, under
the old or new scheme, they cannot possibly be in an environment where
there is pension protection compatible with Community law, as the ECJ
judgment made clear.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000647"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> The Pension Protection Fund does give people that
coverage and the issues of FAS and what happened in the past are
exactly what will be considered by the High Court. The hon. Gentleman
must know that I cannot comment on that in this setting, given that the
matter is going back to the High Court. Neither he nor I are lawyers
and it would, therefore, be inappropriate to discuss it. Even if we
were, it would still not be appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0702072000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say, we shall give careful
consideration to the possible implications of the European
Court&#146;s ruling for the financial assistance scheme and the
Pension Protection Fund, and we will need to take into account the fact
that those matters have not yet been decided by the High Court in this
country. In response to the point about the judicial review, we shall
of course abide by any legal requirements that are put on us by that
case. It would be extraordinary if the Government did not do so. I hope
that that is the assurance that the hon. Gentleman was looking for, and
it is the same as the assurance that the Secretary of State gave him
yesterday.</div>

								Mr.

he confirm whether the Government have a right of appeal if the

settle and accept the decision of the judicial

						</b> I think that there are appeal rights, but I
cannot give the hon. Gentleman a hypothetical answer about the outcome
of the case. We will abide by our obligations; that is the most that I
can say to
him.</div>
					<a name="0702072000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s reason for tabling the
amendment. In June last year, we placed before Parliament a detailed
response to the ombudsman&#146;s report. In November, we published
our response to the report of the Public Administration Committee. The
key issue is compliance with the ombudsman&#146;s recommendations,
which I shall
discuss.</div>
					<a name="0702072000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, the ombudsman said that she did
not intend to require the Government to replace all lost pensions, but
that the Government should consider whether to make
arrangements to restore those pensions. That is precisely what we have
done. As we have already reported to Parliament, the Government
carefully considered the ombudsman&#146;s report. Although we did not
accept the findings, we extended the financial assistance scheme by
more than &#163;2 billion.</div>
					<a name="0702072000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention with this amendment is to require the
Government to replace the lost benefits in full. We said in the
previous debate&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Well, if
that is not what he intends, I have genuinely misunderstood him and I
am happy to stand corrected.</div>
					<a name="0702072000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the debates to which the hon.
Gentleman referred, we explained in considerable detail why we do not
believe that replacing those pension losses in full is justifiable. I
do not propose to go through those points in detail, but it is worth
going over the principal ones. I think that all members of the
Committee would understand someone feeling frustration and anger at the
provision that they had made having been lost. The taxpayer would be
responsible for replacing the losses only if it were clear that the
Government were responsible for them, however. I do not think that that
is the case; the pension schemes were provided not by the state, but by
employers. The trustees were not appointed by the Government; the
contributions and the benefits of the schemes were not the
Government&#146;s contributions and benefits. It was the
responsibility of the trustees, the employers and their financial
advisers to ensure that the pensions were properly funded. The vast
majority of the schemes concerned did not meet the minimum funding
requirement that was stipulated by the Pensions Act 1995.</div>
					<a name="0702072000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The ombudsman
acknowledged that the losses were caused by a number of factors. Of
those, the most immediate in most cases was employer bankruptcy, which
triggered the scheme wind-up. Due to the sustained downturn in world
stock markets, the wind-up occurred at a time when the scheme assets
were less valuable. The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire is
shaking his head. Does he wish to
intervene?</div>

							<a name="0702072000650"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> Subject to being in order, Mr. Taylor,
the Minister talks about the decline in world stock markets, but there
is the issue of the effect on stock markets of the Chancellor&#146;s
raid on the dividend tax credit.</div>

Purnell:
						</b> I will follow your ruling, Mr. Taylor.
There were other factors, such as the investment strategies of the
individual schemes, the increase in longevity and the cost of the
annuities. The Committee will recognise that both the ombudsman and the
Public Administration Committee made it clear that they did not think
that the Government had caused the schemes to fail. The issue was
therefore what assistance was justified.</div>
					<a name="0702072000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her report, the ombudsman
appears to have gone beyond her normal approach to replacing losses.
Her normal response was to put a person in the situation in which they
would have been if the alleged maladministration had not occurred. It
is unrealistic to say that all 125,00 people covered by the
ombudsman&#146;s report would have been able to protect each and
every aspect of their promised pension if only leaflets had been
differently worded. The actions available to individuals were limited
and, in some cases, would have exposed them to greater risk. In
practice, the only option available to most members would have been to
take a transfer value of their accrued rights and put that cash into a
personal pension. If the scheme were already in financial difficulties,
that might well have reduced the value of the transfer on offer.
Secondly, transferring to a personal pension would have meant that the
individual had to pay management costs and would probably have lost the
employer&#146;s contribution to his pension. Finally, the fund would
have been exposed to the stock market at a time when there was a
downturn in the stock market.</div>
					<a name="0702072000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fundamental point remains
the one that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough
made. The schemes were under-funded, and promises had been made to
individuals that were not met by the contribution levels that had been
required by the schemes. Nothing that was said in leaflets changed
that. Indeed, the vast majority of people who are affected joined
before any leaflet was published or, indeed, the 1995 Act came into
effect.</div>
					<a name="0702072000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept that
we have a responsibility to assist people. That is why we introduced
the FAS. However, we do not think that we should underwrite those
obligations in full. That would effectively be to underwrite the
promises that were previously made by employers but which were not
sufficiently funded. Apart from the issue of principle, it would also
require a significant commitment of taxpayers&#146; money over a long
time&#151;some &#163;15 billion over 60 years. That is the same
figure as the &#163;2.9 billion to &#163;3.7 billion in net present
value; those are just different ways of presenting the same figure, one
taking into account a discount rate and the other presenting it in cash
terms over a number of years, which is exactly how the Government
account for money at Budget time or in the comprehensive spending
review. We gave both those figures in our response to the
ombudsman.</div>
					<a name="0702072000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give an
idea of how much money that is, it is the same as employing an extra
6,000 teachers, 8,000 nurses or 3,000 doctors over those 60 years; it
is a very significant sum. Even going to the level of PPF 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 379</div>benefits, which the hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned, would involve
a significant increase in the amount committed.</div>
					<a name="0702072000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have explained why
the Government felt it right to extend the FAS, and why we do not think
that it would be right to underwrite the schemes in full. They were
private schemes provided by employers and governed by trustees. Had we
not published any of those leaflets, people would not have benefited
from the pensions that they were hoping for because the fundamental
problem was that their schemes were not being funded properly to
achieve that. I hope that that gives the Committee the information that
it needs, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000653"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I do not really wish to go back over all the
points that I made earlier about how the package could be calculated or
paid for, but it is deeply depressing that the Minister is consistently
parroting the Government line that it is all far too difficult, so we
are not even going to go there. It is worth reminding him that new
clause 7 simply requires the Secretary of State to tell us, within
three months of the coming into force of the Act, how he proposes to
comply with the recommendations. That gives him a certain amount of
flexibility, but apparently even that is not acceptable.</div>
					<a name="0702072000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am afraid
that the Minister is again trying to second-guess the ombudsman. It is
not his job to say whether there has been maladministration and to
query the methodology of the ombudsman. That way, disaster lies. If any
of us has a constituent who has had some massive unfairness wreaked
upon him and refers the case to the ombudsman, I wish him luck if he is
up against one of the Departments of the current Government. The
Minister did not really touch on the constitutional issue, so let me
give him a chance to do
that.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000654"></a>James
Purnell:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. I do want to return
to that, and to make it clear that this is the first time that my
Department, or any of its predecessors, has ever rejected an
ombudsman&#146;s case. We have made it clear that we have great
respect for her office, and there is no question of it becoming a
habit. They are exceptional circumstances.</div>
					
					<a name="0702072000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0702072000655"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> I presume the reason why the circumstances are
exceptional is because a lot of money is involved. I cannot see any
other justification. Anyway, I do not want to labour the
point.</div>
					<a name="0702072000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, however,
it is interesting that the Minister accepted that he would have to
comply&#151;no doubt, with no great enthusiasm&#151;with the
findings of the High Court, or of the Court of Appeal or of the House
of Lords in due course, if the case were to go that far. It was very
big of him to do so. The only reason why he provides that assurance,
presumably, is because he has no choice. It is worth reminding the
Committee that when these Houses of Parliament set up the ombudsman in
the first place, it was on the basis that he or she would not have the
powers of a High Court judge. There was in those innocent days of the
1960s a kind of trust that Governments would comply with the
recommendations. Perhaps we need to revisit the issue more
generally.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 380</div>
					<a name="0702072000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue before us will not go
away, however, nor will the victims. I shall not press the new clause
to a vote, because it will simply be voted down. However, I shall
return to it on Report. The hon. Member for Yeovil reminded us that
there is a substantial number of signatories to the various early-day
motions on the subject, including a large number of Labour Members. I
suspect that on a vote, we may fare better on Report than in Committee,
not only because of the pensions issue, but because of the much broader
constitutional issue. Despite the Minister&#146;s assurance that it
will not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 381</div>become a habit, the Government&#146;s attitude to the ombudsman is a
worrying trend, which the Public Administration Committee clearly
identified in its report.</div>
