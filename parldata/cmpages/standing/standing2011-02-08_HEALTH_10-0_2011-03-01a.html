                           </strong> As you will remember, Mr Hood, before we adjourned
for lunch, I was starting to discuss amendment 55, which
would require the Secretary of State to secure the agreement of the
chair of the board before suspending a non-executive member. The chair
is also capable of suspension themselves under
paragraph (4)(3) of new schedule A1 to the National Health
Service Act 2006, so in practice the amendment would make its operation
difficult, if not impossible. It is accepted practice, however, that
references to the appointments committee or to the Department of Health
to suspend a non-executive director are normally made through the
chair. In situations in which the reference is not made through the
chair, the chair may be contacted to discuss the matter and to give
their view on the referral. Ultimately, however, the decision must rest
with the Secretary of State as the person responsible for the
appointment of
non-executives.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
56 would fix the term of appointment for non-executive members at four
years, rather than up to four years. A four-year appointment is usually
made, but such flexibility means that it can be tailored to suit the
particular circumstances of the individual or body 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 374<a class="bkMark" name="Column374">&#160;</a>
                           </div>concerned. In addition, the code of practice set by the commissioner for
public appointments states that a non-executive’s total period
in office must not exceed 10 years. It is important that appointment
terms are flexible so that that requirement can be
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
57 would remove the board’s duty to pay compensation to a person
who ceases to be a non-executive member if the Secretary of State
considers there to be exceptional circumstances. We do not intend to
use that power to provide golden handshakes upon resignation. There may
be exceptional circumstances  in which a non-executive is no
longer able to continue in office through no fault on their part and in
which it may be appropriate to pay compensation, but they will be rare,
so this is an exceptional power. I must therefore resist the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
81 would ensure that there was parliamentary scrutiny of the
remuneration, pensions, allowances or other gratuities payable to
non-executive members. As far as I am aware, this would be the first
time that Parliament had a direct role in such matters. The Bill
provides, quite rightly, for the Secretary of State to determine such
matters to ensure consistency with other Department of Health
arm’s length bodies, such as Monitor and the Care Quality
Commission, and to avoid any tendency for unjustifiable packages to be
offered by the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
packages that the Secretary of State may determine are, in practice,
subject to wider cross-governmental approval through the public sector
pay committee. That process was put in place for all proposals on
public sector pay by the previous Administration, who considered it to
be an adequate and proportionate mechanism for determining public
sector pay. We agree with that view, so we do not think that there is a
need for additional parliamentary scrutiny of the pay of the
board’s non-executives. I hope that Labour Members will also
agree that the mechanisms that their Government put in place are still
relevant
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Without
amendment 85, the Bill suggests that the board can appoint anyone that
it likes to do anything that it wants. One could say that that makes it
quite the quango but without any of the necessary checks. Amendment 85
would provide oversight on who the appointed people may be or what
function or role they may perform. Without the amendment, there could
be a huge lack of clarity in the checks and balances on whom the board
appoints.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
a sub-committee dealing with a specialised field appointed someone from
the private sector, which is quite conceivable given the limited field
of people in certain specialist areas, or an academic who was funded by
the private sector, who would provide the necessary check and
accountability structure for that appointment? Of course, many members
of the private sector are sought to advise working groups, but they are
accountable and held in check at present. If there is no check in
place, it is quite conceivable that the distinction between
commissioning and provision could become blurred on such specialised
sub-committees. Amendment 85 would provide such a check. It would not
discriminate against any sector—indeed, advice would still be
sought from all sectors—but it would provide clarity on the
distinction between commissioning and provision and, importantly, a
safety of structure for anyone taking part in such
sub-committees.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
87 could apply not only to members of the board, but to consultants and
private sector accountancy firms that will provide business support to
all tiers of the structure, including the board, consortia, Monitor,
the Department of Health and commissioned services. The amendment would
be particularly important if subcontracting took place because it would
provide for full transparency from the start to the end of that
process. A declaration of interests for any committee or sub-committee
member, or anyone whom they may employ, would be a basic and necessary
element required by not only parliamentarians, but our constituents.
Amendment 87, like amendment 85, would bring clarity to the blurring
lines between commissioning and provision. Indeed, the Minister, back
in his days as a senior member of the Health Committee in 2005, voted
for a register of interests for all prescribing doctors. Does he agree
with such an argument in principle now?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000046">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Nothing has yet been said about
amendment 58 which, if I understand it correctly, sits rather
uncomfortably with the other amendments, which relate to transparency,
declarations of interests and so on. The purpose of amendment 85
appears to be to separate providers and commissioners, while amendment
87 would insist on very clear rules on declarations of interest and
amendment 86 would insist on there being open meetings in which things
could be as transparent as possible. Coupled with those is
amendment 84, which has been withdrawn, which would apply
the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to the proceedings of the
commissioning board. I should like to say a little about each of those
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
draw attention to amendment 58 because, like other members of the
Committee, I attended an event last night at which the topic was
medical research. NHS research has an enormously important pedigree and
many people at the event had been involved in it for a long time. They
are extremely worried, so they have lobbied the Department of Health
about a number of issues connected with what might transpire under the
Bill, as well as the regulatory burden on them, some of which comes for
Europe and some of which is in-house. They are worried that GPs may not
recognise the importance of medical research in their plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That has huge
clinical repercussions, and given the importance of medical research to
this country and the pharmaceutical industry, the researchers were keen
to labour the point that it has huge economic importance. When a
Minister at the event was roundly accosted on the subject, the
researchers were given some comfort that clinical research will not be
forgotten, as the amendment would ensure. If it is not the amendment
that will give them comfort, however, it is incumbent on the Department
of Health to give them comfort in some other form. It is worth drawing
attention to that aspect of the NHS because it might be overlooked
during the scrutiny of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
85 and 87 are slightly contradictory. Amendment 85 would remove
conflicts of interests simply by removing providers from
commissioning—that is one solution. Amendment 87, perhaps owing
to an acceptance that that will not happen, would ensure that conflicts
were dealt with in a thoroughly ethical and transparent way. I have
more sympathy with amendment 87, because it is really hard
to have an absolute commissioner-provider split. The danger is that
people end up being involved in the commissioning of services with
which they have no familiarity because they have never provided 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 377<a class="bkMark" name="Column377">&#160;</a>
                           </div>them themselves. That happens time and time again within the medical
field when the commissioner-provider split is too rigidly enforced. In
any case, GP commissioning to some extent blows a hole in the
commissioner-provider split and we are apparently prepared to live with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 86
addresses open meetings, which is one of the ways in which conflicts of
interests can be best dealt with. While one can set up a procedure, one
really wants to know that that procedure is followed and that it is
apparent to everyone who takes an interest in the matter. I do not
think that the Minister would have any difficulty suggesting that the
NHS commissioning board could be subject to the same requirements as
those in the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960, which
applies to local authorities and the like. After all, that is a tried
and trusted remedy and one with which the Government might, without too
much persuasion, be quite
comfortable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Going
back to the topic of research, I forgot to make a point that needs to
be stressed: many of the important research projects in the NHS in
recent years have been progressed in, through or via the strategic
health authorities. They have played an important role in pulling
together threads of research which is why, even though I do not think
it is likely that amendment 58 will be agreed to, it is worth airing
the topic in

amendments in the group relate to the separate issues of research and
transparency, which are both legitimate areas to explore in Committee.
I wish to reassure the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East
Cleveland and respond to some of the comments made by my hon. Friend
the Member for
Southport.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I thank my
hon. Friend for his remarks about amendment 58. The Government want to
preserve and strengthen research in the NHS, and the Bill reflects that
by, for the first time, placing powers and duties in relation to
promoting and supporting the conduct of research on the commissioning
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030329000001">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
new section 13I of the National Health Service Act 2006, as inserted by
clause 19 of the Bill, the NHS commissioning board will be under an
explicit duty when exercising its functions to have regard to the need
to promote research on matters relevant to the health service and the
use of research evidence. Nothing in the Bill changes the NHS
constitution’s commitment to the need to promote research. Of
course, all bodies that are established, such as NHS commissioning
consortia and others, will have to pay regard to the NHS
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It will be
for the NHS commissioning board to determine how it ensures that it
complies with those duties, and what structures and approaches it
adopts. An attempt to set out in the Bill exactly how the board should
structure itself to fulfil its functions would risk falling back into
the trap of trying to over-design from the centre, which is something
that the Government are trying to avoid. Why specify that the board
must have a committee to discharge those functions and not the other
functions it will have under the Bill? Our view is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 378<a class="bkMark" name="Column378">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that we have provided considerable detail in the Bill about
responsibilities and accountabilities, but we should not be specifying
how those are then discharged. The best way to secure the future for
health research is by removing barriers to take-up and by creating the
right incentives for the NHS to engage. Such changes will make a
difference, rather than committees or individuals on the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
the concerns underlying amendments 85 and 87 that were raised by the
hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland. There is a
valid concern that there should be transparency in all the workings of
the NHS commissioning board, particularly in relation to its dealings
with other bodies that may have a vested interest in its
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also agree with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport. I do not think it would be appropriate or conducive to the
effective fulfilment of the board's functions to prescribe who should
or should not be allowed to sit on a committee of the board, or to
exclude providers of services or those representing them, as proposed
by amendment 85. My hon. Friend set out a well-made point about the
possible perverse consequences of not involving providers in discussing
how services might be commissioned. That is not to say that there
should not be strong governance arrangements around interactions
between providers and commissioners to ensure that they are subject to
proper probity and to provide transparency around other potential
conflicts of interest within the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of things should help to provide comfort to the Committee as
well as security when the Bill is enacted. Paragraph 12 of new schedule
A1 to the 2006 Act will allow the board to regulate its own procedure.
It is intended that that will enable the board to determine its own
internal governance procedures to address issues such as managing
conflicts of interest, for example by preventing executive members from
being involved in determining their own pay or ensuring that providers
who may be involved in a particular committee are not involved in
decision-making processes around commissioning decisions. We have to
expect a level of maturity in which the importance of co-operation and
collaboration among bodies involved in the health service is balanced
with clarity about the rules that will
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked about provider involvement. The prohibitions in
the Bill provide an added protection against anti-competitive conduct,
while we intend to make regulations under clause 63 to ensure that
proper procurement practices are followed and to protect choice and
competition. Those regulations could include specific procedural
requirements to ensure that commissioners carry out fair and
transparent practices, and they might in particular make requirements
concerning managing conflicts between the interests involved in
commissioning services and those involved in providing
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Reference
has been made to the distinction between commissioning and provision.
It is important to put on the record that the distinction is provided
mainly by the approach in the Bill of creating clarity about the roles
of different bodies in the system. That is why the board will have
responsibility for commissioning services only, rather than also for
supporting provider trusts, as is currently the case with
SHAs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On another
aspect of the hon. Gentleman’s amendment, board members of
non-departmental public bodies are expected to follow a code of
practice based on the Cabinet Office’s model guidance, covering
their role and responsibilities, conduct issues and addressing
conflicts of interest. Non-executives must also adhere to their terms
and conditions of appointment, and as part of that they are expected to
demonstrate high standards of corporate and personal conduct and should
follow the seven principles of public life, the so-called Nolan
principles.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
principles are not statutory, but that does not mean that they have no
force. Most public bodies have incorporated them into codes of practice
and other internal standards that can then be taken into account, for
example, in cases before the relevant ombudsman. We would expect the
NHS commissioning board to do the same. Indeed, many of these
principles are reflected in the current guidance for the NHS,
“The Healthy NHS Board: Principles for Good Governance”,
which sets out guiding principles for board members to understand their
collective role, their governance role, activities and approaches to
improved board effectiveness and the contribution expected of them as
individual members of the board. We remain committed to the principles
that were set out in that
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
transparency, which was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport in respect of the way in which the board discharges its
functions, my hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw attention to the
easy way in which we could make sure that the NHS commissioning board
meets in public and fully discharges those responsibilities. We will
table a Government amendment to include the NHS commissioning board as
a body to which the duty in section 1 of the Public Bodies (Admission
to Meetings) Act 1960 applies.  This would require the board to
hold meetings in public, subject to certain exceptions and
administrative requirements of the sort that, as a former councillor,
he will know apply in local authorities as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
that Act, the board may only exclude the public from a meeting, or part
of a meeting, if publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest
by reason of the confidential nature of the business to be transacted,
or for other special reasons. Provisions in the Act would also require
agendas and papers for meetings to be made publicly available. Although
I agree with the principles behind the amendments, for the reasons I
have explained, and given the fact that other parts of the Bill deal
with many of the issues, and that there is a specific undertaking to
table a Government amendment, I hope that the hon. Member for
Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland will withdraw the amendments. If
he chooses not to, however, I will encourage my colleagues not to
support
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I shall again
be brief. The amendment goes to the heart of the issue for me as a new
parliamentarian. I came to the House to be able to ask direct questions
to the Minister and his colleagues about what he is doing and how he is
executing his position. All MPs here would like to
know whether there is a mechanism under these measures for asking
questions of the Secretary of State, and that they will not be
constrained by business red tape, commercial confidentiality or
departmental obfuscation, indicating that when services are tendered,
departmental remit
ends.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000071">&#160;</a>

amendment will prevent Parliament from looking like a cumbersome farce,
in many cases lagging slowly behind journalistic freedom of information
requests upon certain bodies, both within and outside the Department of
Health. Similarly, responses referring to an annual report that could
be 11 months out of date in certain circumstances will not suffice. The
amendment would require up-to-date responses from the Secretary of
State, as and when required by Parliament and parliamentarians, about
the day-to-day issues that our constituents
raise.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 90 would make explicit, as the hon.
Gentleman said, that when a Member of Parliament asks the Secretary of
State a written parliamentary question, about, for example, how the NHS
commissioning board carries out its functions, the Secretary of State
would be provided with a power to require that information from the
board. I entirely agree that it is necessary for Members to be able to
hold the Executive to account, and to be able to ask questions that are
of interest to their constituents, as the hon. Gentleman
described.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we have set out, we are trying to provide additional opportunities for
Parliament to scrutinise the way that both the Secretary of State and
the NHS discharge their responsibilities in the new architecture. I
would like, therefore, to reassure the hon. Gentleman that his
amendment is unnecessary, because paragraph 14 of new schedule A1 to
the 2006 Act requires the board to provide the Secretary of State with
such information as he considers necessary for his functions. That, of
course, includes the Secretary of State’s role in being
accountable to and answering questions in Parliament. Many of the
Secretary of State’s existing powers will be directly conferred
on a number of bodies in the new architecture, which include, for
example, the NHS commissioning board, the economic regulator and the
CQC. Their roles and responsibilities, including those of the Secretary
of State, are clearly defined in the Bill. Inevitably, that will lead
to an altered role for Government, which will include less interference
on a day-to-day basis from Ministers in operational decisions relating
to the NHS. Ministers, however, will continue to be accountable to
Parliament through parliamentary questions, Adjournment debates, or
Select Committee hearings. The Bill in no way changes that
position.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000074">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
relates to paragraph 17 of new schedule A1 to the 2006 Act, but I want
to refer to the previous paragraph briefly, as it will help to explain
why the amendment has been tabled. Paragraph 16 relates to  the
board’s annual
accounts:<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Board must prepare consolidated annual accounts in respect of each
financial
year.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000604">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
would cover the board’s own annual accounts and those of each
commissioning consortium. The board must then send copies to the
Secretary of State and the Auditor General, as well as laying them
before Parliament, which I think is absolutely right.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The interim
accounts still have to be examined by  the Auditor General, but
they must only be sent to the Secretary of State if the Secretary of
State directs  the Auditor General to do so. I am not sure how
that works. If the Secretary of State has not seen the interim
accounts, how can he decide whether the Auditor General should send
them to him? Furthermore, the accounts only have to be laid before
Parliament if that is directed by the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The point is
important, because it is about parliamentary overview and scrutiny of
NHS finances, both of the board and the commissioning consortiums.
Under the previous Government, there was the chief executive’s
annual report, which included information on the finances, as well as
quality of care and whether various targets were being met. Although
that was done regularly, the previous Government also moved towards
providing quarterly reports. That is important, because if we wait
until the end of the year before we know whether there are any
financial problems, either with the board as a whole or with individual
consortiums, it will be too late. We need an early warning sign that
shows us whether individual consortiums, which are spending money on
behalf of our constituents, are getting into trouble. That is
especially true, as there is no current requirement for GP consortiums
to publish their board agendas or minutes of meetings at which they
might be discussing financial worries. We are talking about £80
billion of taxpayers’ money and it is absolutely right that
information about that money is made public. We will discuss this
later, but my preference is that the monthly agenda and board minutes
of consortiums should be published, so that people can see them.
Consortiums should be required to do that, rather than just choosing to
do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
there are to be interim accounts for a national board and for
individual consortiums, those accounts should be laid before Parliament

                           </strong> This is another debate about transparency and it
is important to state very clearly that the intention throughout the
Bill is to ensure that the system is as transparent as possible to MPs
and local communities. That commitment is reflected in the schedule. It
is very important that the Secretary of State consults and publishes,
for example on the mandate for the NHS commissioning board, clearly
setting out the Government’s expectations.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also want
to ensure that there is clarity about accountability for decisions.
Although the NHS commissioning board will have independence over the
allocation of resources, it will be accountable to the Secretary of
State for its financial management and  for the value for money
that it is achieving with NHS funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph 17
of new schedule A1 to the 2006 Act, which the amendment addresses,
gives new powers to the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
Treasury, to require the NHS commissioning board to produce interim
accounts for a specified period in addition to annual accounts. The NHS
commissioning board will sit within the Department of Health’s
resource accounting boundary and therefore it is essential that the
Secretary of State, in discharging his accountability to Parliament, is
able to monitor the financial position of organisations within the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a new
power, which is being introduced across the system with the agreement
of the Treasury, to ensure that there are opportunities to monitor the
financial position of all NHS bodies. The intention is to improve and
extend accountability and parliamentary scrutiny, so the decision as to
whether the board’s in-year accounts should be audited would be
at the discretion of the Secretary of State, in recognition of the time
and costs involved. In the event that the in-year accounts are audited,
it may not be necessary for the Comptroller and Auditor General to send
a copy of the report on the accounts to the Secretary of State or to
lay copies of the accounts and the report before Parliament in every
case. So the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to have the power
to direct that that should happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
absolutely not the intention of the Bill to avoid public scrutiny. The
intention is that that information would be in the public domain. There
is no intention to avoid public scrutiny through this arrangement.
Indeed, it is a novel arrangement to ensure that there is more
information available in-year about the way in which NHS organisations
and bodies are operating. So it is not the case that we are attempting
in any way to reduce the scope for parliamentary
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000090">&#160;</a>

Leicester West will be sufficiently reassured not to press the
amendment to the vote. If she does press it, I would encourage my
colleagues not to support

                           </strong> I hope the Minister acknowledges that I am not
arguing that the schedule represents a step back. That is not the point
that I was making. My point is that it is important to publish or lay
before Parliament interim accounts of a board and consortia that are
responsible for £80 billion of taxpayers’ money. The
Minister explained that he will not accept the amendment because of
time and costs, but I think they would be well spent on providing that
information to Parliament. MPs would wish to see whether their
consortia are financially stable or whether there are problems,
particularly if the consortia are not required to publish their board
minutes as, I think, primary care trusts currently are. That is the
contrast with what PCTs currently have to do—publish that
information. I do not believe that GP consortia will be required to do
so, which is why it would be even more important that interim accounts
are
published.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000094">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I reiterate to the hon. Lady that all we are
trying to avoid, in gathering the information as part of the interim
accounts process, are the costs of audit and other associated costs
incurred in the system twice a year. It is not that the information
will not be available for parliamentary or public

                           </strong> However, that is not what will be avoided here,
as the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to conduct scrutiny of
those accounts anyway. That is what the schedule says. The point is
that once that has happened—the money has been spent and the
audit has been done—the interim accounts should be published. I
will seek to press the amendment to a vote, as I think it is vital that
we have such scrutiny of public money, and I urge hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee to support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000096">&#160;</a>

as one of the principal functions of the statutory bodies. I am sure
that the Minister will point out that that duty is part of the range of
duties set out in new section 14N in clause 22. However, we would like
to see the Government’s priority of reducing inequalities at the
forefront of the Bill and applied specifically to the

reasonable. The Bill could do a lot more to encourage a co-operative

are being phased out, but they currently cover larger geographical and
more diverse areas than their successors, the smaller GP consortia, so
there is a danger and risk that health inequalities will become more
ingrained. We believe that the Bill changes some of the fundamentals of
the national health service. It is possible to foresee the varying
nature of privately led consortia—not just variation between the
north-east and the south-east, but variation within consortia and
across neighbouring consortia. An uncoordinated health system risks
entrenching inequality in relation to access to health services and
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000128">&#160;</a>

is that the nub—the core—of the debate is about driving
down inequalities in the NHS and I think that I can say without fear of
contradiction that all right hon. and hon. Members in this room are
united in seeking to achieve that. I fully accept, as my hon. Friends
do, that this is a very important subject. I wholeheartedly agreed with

he sought to anticipate part of my speech and I take my hat off to him.
He is absolutely right: I will quote clause 22 to him, because that is
crucial to the argument and how we accomplish the aim of driving down
inequalities, particularly in relation to consortia. We already place
duties on GP consortia in relation to the need to reduce inequalities.
As the hon. Gentleman rightly identified, that is in clause 22, which
inserts proposed new section 14N into the National Health Service Act
2006 and reflects equivalent duties given to the Secretary of State and
the commissioning
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
note that Opposition Members do not seek in this case to name
individual aspects of inequality or to impose impossible duties. In one
way we have made a step forward in our arguments, because they have not
sought to reiterate what they did with their amendments to clause 3,
which were rightly defeated for the reasons given at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000139">&#160;</a>

that what I have just said will persuade the hon. Member for Easington

inequalities, and the desire and drive to reduce and minimise

Amendment 20 simply strengthens the requirement on the Secretary of

make a small but significant change and therefore I urge the Minister

                           </strong> The amendment would have the perhaps unintended
consequence of weakening and confusing the role of the Secretary of
State with regard to the duties to protect public health that the Bill
places on him. Several of our exchanges in Committee have suggested
that Opposition Members wish the Secretary of State to be even more
accountable to Parliament for the discharge of a wide range of
responsibilities. The amendment, however, would create confusion about
what is or is not an appropriate step for a Secretary of State to take.
New section 2A gives the responsibility for that decision clearly to
the Secretary of State, who will therefore clearly be accountable to
Parliament for the exercise of his responsibilities under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000149">&#160;</a>

                           </div>appropriate and who would therefore be accountable for such decisions.
As the new section stands, the accountability is unambiguously the
Secretary of State’s. Were amendment 20 to be agreed,
we would have less clarity, while the clarity that currently exists
would be removed. Of course, the Secretary of State will take expert,
evidence-based advice before making those decisions and must make a
proper assessment that takes all the relevant factors into account.
That is precisely why the Bill paves the way for the creation of Public
Health England within the Department and as part of its functions. In
the light of my comments, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment. If she does not, I shall urge my colleagues to vote against

amendment might work in practice? If the new section was amended, it
would mean that if the Secretary of State was exercising his or her
discretion but doing so in a way that is wrong, negligent and lazy, and
that did not really understand the true nature of public health, he or
she may be accountable to Parliament. In practice, however, what would
that mean if we wanted to ensure that the Secretary of State did not
behave in such a way? We could judicially review their decisions much
more easily if the measure was a little clearer and had an objective
test, as opposed to a subjective test, because a defence within a court
of law against a lazy Secretary of State who is not doing his job
properly, when people are dying, would be to challenge him in court by
saying that he is not doing his job properly. That is why we need a
tougher law—we are talking about law here—that makes
things clear in a way that any Englishman can
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The new clause draws attention to the
existence of Public Health England and its functions. Its purpose is to
allow us to discuss the changes to responsibilities for public health.
We are scrutinising this massive Bill, but it does not include what
everyone agrees is probably the most crucial area of
health—public 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 389<a class="bkMark" name="Column389">&#160;</a>
                           </div>health. That is where health starts, yet we have overlapping time scales
of key elements of the Government’s policy on health and their
reform agenda. That means that some issues remain unresolved in the
Bill, and most importantly in public health. The Bill does not mention
the responsibilities of Public Health England, and how it will
co-operate with the national commissioning boards or GP consortia, or
how it fits in with the health and wellbeing boards. That is half of
the jigsaw, and seems to be
missing.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are many criticisms of the Government, and how they are pushing this
legislation through in a forced and hurried way, and this is another
reason why they should stop, take stock a little, and consider health
as a whole. Because they are pushing this risky legislation through so
quickly, they are doing so without properly putting together how public
health fits in with the new structures that they
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not know whether the Minister has read <em>The Lancet</em> today, but
concern is expressed by health academics that putting Public Health
England within the Department for Health risks losing public trust. We
have seen under Governments of different colours several difficulties
in relation to public health in a political connection—for
example, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis and Ministers
feeding their daughters burgers, and when Labour was in Government the
measles mumps and rubella vaccine crisis, and whether children should
be given it. That illustrates how political involvement may sometimes
undermine public
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
important debate should happen, but it cannot be rushed through at the
moment, in the middle of the Bill. The Government are consulting on
public health and the appropriate approach but—I repeat my
earlier point—they are consulting on that while still pushing
through the Bill, and it is as though they are fighting on our behalf
for health with only one hand instead of both. In the original White
Paper, the subsequent legislative framework and the next steps
document, the Government indicated that the Bill would establish the
basic legal architecture for Public Health England, so we want to know
why that is not being done, given that it was promised in the White
Paper, the legislative framework and the next steps
document.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As this is a clause stand part debate, I shall
start by saying a little about the clause. It gives the Secretary of
State a new general duty to protect the health of people in England. It
lists some examples of steps to protect health that the Secretary of
State might take, and ensures that he liaises with the Health and
Safety Executive on radiation
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause is fundamental to the strategy for public health signalled last
year in the coalition programme for government and set out in greater
detail in the White Paper “Equity and excellence: liberating the
NHS”. The strategy has been broadly welcomed across the
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
duty underpins a major component of the new public health
service—Public Health England, to which the hon. Lady
referred—by making the Secretary of State directly accountable
for protecting the health of the people of England. Taken alongside
other provisions in the Bill, it will unify vital functions currently
undertaken 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 390<a class="bkMark" name="Column390">&#160;</a>
                           </div>by different organisations, maximising the flexibility and transparency
of services while putting clear responsibility for the protection of
the nation’s public health at the heart of national Government,
where it belongs. It reflects the fact that for the first time, there
is a cross-Government Cabinet Committee to deal with public health
matters, which brings public health to the centre
of Government policy making.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In our view,
new clause 1 is superfluous and would create an entirely unnecessary
degree of bureaucracy within a system that the Bill seeks to simplify
and streamline. Clauses 7 and 8 give the Secretary of State new duties
and powers to protect and improve the health of the people of
England.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> So although the Government are currently
consulting on their strategy on public health, they have already
decided that there will not be a body independent of the Department of

                           </strong> The consultation does not pose the in-principle
question of whether the organisation should be the subject of primary
legislation. We made it clear earlier, during the publication of the
White Paper and the Command Paper, that we see Public Health England as
a central part of the function of the Department of Health and a
rebalancing of the Department’s responsibilities to focus much
more clearly on the public health aspects of the Secretary of
State’s responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000188">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That is why
we think that new clause 1 does not assist, because the Bill does not
create a new legal entity called Public Health England. It is not our
intention that it should. Instead, Public Health England will become
part of the Department of Health, as I said, which will put it right at
the heart of the Government, where it should be. From the outset, its
functions will include those that the Bill confers on the Secretary of
State. The Secretary of State will be directly accountable for those
duties and will establish Public Health England within the Department
to discharge them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000189">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am genuinely confused about the
Minister’s approach. In the legislative framework and the next
steps document, did not the Government indicate that the Bill would
establish the basic legal architecture for Public Health
England?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000190">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Bill does. These two clauses place clear and
specific duties on the Secretary of State. Indeed, clause 8 places
specific duties on local authorities. That is how the architecture for
delivering public health will be taken forward. The Department of
Health will organise itself with a new responsibility, Public Health
England, to discharge those functions on behalf of the Secretary of
State, but the Secretary of State has  the duty and will be
responsible for it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As such,
Public Health England will be directly accountable to the Secretary of
State. That is deliberate, as we want the new system to be more
flexible, adaptable and responsive. The hon. Lady’s new clause
would, for example, require the Secretary of State to use secondary
legislation every time he wanted Public Health England to undertake a
new function or end an existing one. Public Health England within the
Department will be expected to provide impartial, objective, expert
advice of the sort to which she referred, and to be an exemplary
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000192">&#160;</a>

clause does not offer any extra degree of independence in practice, if
that is what the hon. Lady was seeking. The future of Public Health
England is secure; the new clause would simply wrap it in layers of red
tape. I therefore urge the hon. Lady not to press new clause 1, but to
consider the results of the consultation, as the Government will do,
because we are committed to ensuring a much clearer focus on public
health than in the past.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000193">&#160;</a>

change words, but essentially beef up the power vested in the clause by

responsibility is what and ensure no offloading of responsibility. For
example, there is concern that the Secretary of State might offload
responsibility to local authorities when, in fact, the responsibility
should be a

                           </strong> I am sure that we have common cause in the desire
to improve the health of the nation. Where we part company is on
whether the amendments would have their intended effect of beefing up
the clause or the unintended effect of diluting it. The amendments
would confuse the roles of both the Secretary of State and local
authorities. They repeat the error of amendment 20 by
creating an unnecessary uncertainty over what is or is not the
appropriate step for local authorities to take when acting to improve
the health of their
populations.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
8 is clear. The decision should be the local authority’s. It
knows its people; it is directly accountable to them, and will have the
benefit of a director of public health offering appropriate advice.
Like amendment 20, amendment 24 would take away that clarity, making
the decision about what is appropriate that of no one in particular. In
that sense, it would confuse accountability and make it less clear who
was responsible. Local authorities will consider expert evidence-based
advice before making such decisions and they must make a proper
assessment, taking into account all the relevant factors. That is
precisely why the Bill requires local authorities to appoint directors
of public
health.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
22 and 25 would be especially confusing. The power conferred by the
clause on the Secretary of State can be used to support local
authorities throughout England as a whole or in one particular
location. We expect that the latter situation would be unusual, but the
amendment would give the Secretary of State the same duty as local
authorities, undermining at a stroke the key principle of putting local
authorities in the lead in improving public
health.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
for amendment 23, the Secretary of State’s powers under clause 8
could be exercised locally as well as nationally, but when the
Secretary of State needs to intervene nationally it follows that he
would believe that that is appropriate action to take. Again, a blanket
requirement to consult local authorities would be cumbersome and
significantly slow down an urgent response.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There seems
to be inconsistency in the amendments. They show a lack of faith in
both the Secretary of State and local authorities to use their judgment
to determine the appropriate steps to take, yet elsewhere it seems that
there is a resistance to the creation, for example, of the NHS
commissioning board and a policy of freeing the NHS from central
control by Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000210">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 67, in
clause 8, page 5, line 9, at
end insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>‘(2A) The
Secretary of State must identify funding to be passed to local
authorities for the purposes of taking steps under subsection
(1).(2B) Such funding passed
to local authorities may only be spent on activities consistent with
subsection
(1).’.<p class="tabbed">I
call this the ring-fencing amendment. Although a responsibility or duty
is being placed on local authorities in relation to public health, the
concern is that they may be being set up to fail. It is unclear what
duties they will have, what public health is, how much money they will
have and what powers they will have. Although good will and good
intentions lie behind the clause, the powers are not sufficiently clear
and that is what we wish to examine through the amendment. If local
authorities are to be given control over improving public health in
their areas, they must be properly resourced and there must be an
indication as to what they should be spending their money on.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A figure of
£4 billion for the entire public health budget has been cited,
but there is no indication about how that will be split between Public
Health England and local government. We have heard today that Public
Health England is possibly going to be part of the Department of
Health, and it may be unclear how the split will happen. Local
government could end up with maximum responsibility for public health
outcomes, but with less than half the budget. Local authorities need to
know what their responsibilities and budgets are likely to be, and I
would be grateful for some indication about the Government’s
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is designed to confirm what Ministers have been saying because the Bill
does not state that the budget will be ring-fenced. The success of the
plans outlined in the public health White Paper, “Healthy lives,
healthy people”, depends on public health budgets being fully
protected to prevent crucial health-related functions from being
squeezed by other demands.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Devastating
cuts have been made to local authorities. Clearly, local authorities
are going to need to make very difficult decisions, and they would not
be human if they did not look to public health budgets to see whether
some holes in their other budgets could be plugged as a result of the
new funding that may be coming to them.

                           </div>If the Minister confirms that the budget will be ring-fenced, it is
important for us to understand what functions will come within
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, can the Minister define what public health is and what it
would be appropriate or inappropriate to spend the money on? One
example that is constantly debated is whether, during a cold snap, when
the roads and pavements are icy, it would be appropriate to use the
public health budget for gritting. Surely, if the pavements are
gritted, the elderly will not fall over and break various
limbs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Could public
health budgets be moved towards budgets that may be losing some of
their funding as a result of Government cuts? That example may sound
facetious, but it is genuinely being debated by people in local
government, because there is so little guidance on what
responsibilities they will have, what public health means, and what
powers they will
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000244">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is moving a very helpful probing
amendment, which I hope will stimulate some debate. The understanding
of public health within the health service is slightly different from
that in the local authority context. For example, the larger part of
the public health budget now goes on vaccination and so on, and local
government officers will not be involved with that in any way. It would
be interesting to know, when that budget is taken out, what budgets and
what functions will
transfer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000245">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> There is also an argument that the public
health budget could be used for new roofs so that people do not have to
live in damp local authority flats, with the resultant bad health
outcomes. We need some guidance, and we need to know who will give it
and how it will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
factor that is causing some concern and confusion among people in local
government is the proposal for the health premium, which raises a
number of questions. Does the Minister intend to pursue the policy set
out in “Healthy lives, healthy people”—to remove
the extra funding from deprived areas if they do not progress fast
enough to improve public health? I refer in particular to paragraphs
4.32 to 4.34, which say:<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“To
incentivise action to reduce health inequalities we will introduce a
new health premium, which will apply to the part of the local public
health budget which is for health improvement… local authorities
will receive an incentive payment, or premium, for these services that
depends on the progress made in improving the health of the local
population…The health premium will be funded from within the
overall public health budget. Potentially, an area that makes no
progress might receive no growth in funding for these services. We
intend the support for progress in reducing health inequalities to be
clear and
significant.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000618">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is another element that is clearly causing great concern in the local
authority community, and I wonder whether the Minister can cast a
little light on it so that we can better understand what the funding
means and how it will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000248">&#160;</a>

(1) of new section 2B is a massive move for public health—I do
not disagree with it—and it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Each

                        <p>We
have never been very good at population health in this country. In my
experience, measuring population health is normally done by counting
the numbers of people who become a patient in the national health
service as opposed to looking at the population and being able to see
what should be happening. The intent of new section 2B(1) is to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend asked whether local authorities could spend money on
improving a damp council flat. The explanatory notes—page 17,
paragraph 115—go into some detail about the definitions in the
Bill. They say that duties on local authorities should
include<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“giving
information to the public about healthy eating and exercise, providing
facilities for the prevention or treatment of illness such as smoking
cessation clinics, providing financial incentives to encourage
individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000621">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>One example is to give
people a financial incentive to stop smoking during pregnancy, because
we know that that affects the foetus and then the child for many years.
Housing is also mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is crucial
that new section 2B(1) is stuck to and that we measure how health is
improving in the population. As I have said, we have never been good at
doing that. Will the Minister tell us what will be put in place to
ensure that local authorities are not only delivering things that they
believe will better the health of the population that they represent
but will measure this so that there is some consistency? If one local
authority is doing something that is working in its population, we
could then follow that best practice in neighbouring authorities or
those further afield. I am deeply interested to have that on the record
now. How does the Minister feel that this Bill will interact with our
population to improve the health of the public as opposed to just
looking at
individuals?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000257">&#160;</a>

fact that this change is welcomed by many organisations and people

will respond to the consultation once it closes. We see it as a tool
for driving not only a public health agenda but, by looking at it
across the health and social care outcomes frameworks that are also
being published, for having a more integrated, collaborative and
co-operative approach to how services are
commissioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000261">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have several responses to make to conclude the debate, but I will start
with amendment 67, which was moved by the hon. Member for Islington
South and Finsbury. She will not be surprised if I say that the
amendment is not necessary. Clause 8 will make no provision for the
funding of local authority public health services, since it will be
administered under section 31 of the Local Government Act
2003. That section allows Ministers to make grants to local
authorities, to attach conditions to the use of grants and to specify
circumstances in which the grants would have to be repaid. That is
consistent with how other local authority grants have been administered
until now, and we see no reason to depart from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are committed to using those provisions to make ring-fenced grants for
public health purposes to each type of local authority defined in
clause 8. We are currently consulting on how best to make that funding
system work and on the conditions that we should attach to grants. That
consultation, which is due to end on 31 March, covers questions such as
which services the ring-fenced grant should fund, and how money might
be allocated to local authorities. Importantly, it covers the questions
asked by the hon. Lady about the design of the new health premium. We
do not have a closed mind. We are waiting for the results of the
consultation before finalising the design of the health premium, which
will reward success in improving outcomes and encourage local
actions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000263">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked for clarification about the definition of public health. It is
worth noting that past legislation on public health and the
responsibilities of the NHS for public health have never given a clear
definition. The Bill goes further than any previous Government have
tried to do in setting out what public health is all about. That is why
clause 8 will insert new section 2B in the National Health Service Act
2006, setting out several steps that local authorities and the
Secretary of State may take in certain circumstances. That provision
does not attempt to capture the whole rich variety of possibility that
should be available to local authorities in discharging the public
health duty. It does not attempt to constrain local authorities, but
none the less it gives a sense of what we are trying to capture in the
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000264">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady has read from the explanatory
notes, which are a key part of the interpretation of the intention of
Parliament when it legislates. She has helpfully put on record part of
the policy intention behind the clause, which should be used to
interpret it in the future; that is the purpose of explanatory
notes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the powers in the Bill, which has been broadly
drafted to allow flexibility at a local level. Specific functions are
covered in later clauses. Without flexibility, we risk the creation of
unhelpful distinctions, and local authorities should keep their
existing health protection duties. As I have already said, previous
legislation was less clear. She also asked for a definition,
specifically in relation to the gritting of roads. The primary function
must be to improve public health. Road gritting may have a public
health benefit, but that is not its primary purpose. It should be
carried out under other local authority powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I stress that
we are consulting at the moment on the scope and the commissioning
routes for public health. The consultation has listed examples of
public health functions and has asked whether they are appropriate. It
would be wrong at this point in the legislative process for us
unnecessarily to fetter local authorities in exercising the discretion
that they will have in discharging their duty as the Bill will provide
for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000269">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the dividing line between the NHS and public health, no arbitrary
divide is provided on purpose. Clauses 7 and 8 set out steps that the
Secretary of State or local authorities may take, and they are examples
that are offered to give a sense of the flexibility and the
possibilities. The mandate, which we will come to later, to the NHS
that the Secretary of State will set to the NHS commissioning board
will set out the public health priorities for the NHS. Again, we are
clear that although the NHS cannot necessarily deliver a public health
agenda on its own, it clearly has a contribution to make and we want to
ensure that it does so.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000270">&#160;</a>

asked about the health premium, and the answer is no. We are consulting
now on how the funding regime will work, but the distribution of the
grant and how it will work is still a matter for decisions that have
not yet been made. The health premium will provide additional
incentives and resources to those local authorities that show that they
can make the most progress for their residents.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000271">&#160;</a>

on one final point, PCTs have a general function, which is touched on
in the point about how PCTs have discharged public health

its colleagues in local government. The approach that we envisage for
taking public health forward will certainly involve that sort of
collaborative approach. As the right hon. Gentleman has said, it is
desirable that we pick up and disseminate good practice quickly and
Public Health England will certainly play a part in doing

                           </strong> Following on from what the Minister has said, I was
relieved to find that a great deal of consultation and consideration is
involved in this. Clearly, differentiating public health is a very
difficult area that has many manifest aspects to it. There appears to
be scope for the Government to be more definite in some respects, maybe
not in the context of this legislation but at a subsequent point,
because two issues are raised here. First, as the hon. Member for
Islington South and Finsbury has teased at, there is the question of
whether in fact at certain points some of the money that is spent in
public health could be regarded as ultra vires. In other words, if the
local authority spends money some people may question whether it is on
public health, or if money is taken from the public health budget
people may argue whether it should be or whether it can be. Secondly,
where does responsibility lie for specific things? Thanks to the right
hon. Member for Rother Valley, my attention was drawn to the
explanatory note. It contains a statement to the effect that one thing
that is encompassed in public health
is:<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

some non-slip slippers. That seemed rather bizarre, and was reported in
the papers, but it reduced the incidence of broken neck of femur by I
do not know how many percent. There is value in such an approach in
terms of the outputs that can be delivered by such an expenditure of

asking whose responsibility it is to establish them, disseminate them

prevention or treatment of illness is, for example, a well woman clinic
in a deprived area. However, there might be a debate locally about who
should provide it—should it be the health authorities or should
it be the local authority? The Government might be happy for them to
sort that out among themselves on a local basis—the funding is
another matter—but, at some point, there will be an issue across
the country regarding who legitimately should finance an active
programme or whether it should be
co-financed?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000280">&#160;</a>

saying and reiterate the point that certain services might fall under
either heading—under public health or under the provision of
normal health services through consortia. I shall give one example.

cancer would fall under public health or would they be the
responsibility of commissioning

instinctive reaction is that it would fall under the health body. We
have no clear way of answering that. I accept the fact that we cannot
reach a definitive answer until the consultation process is
finished—it would be premature to do so—but, at some
point, there needs to be some fairly clear adjudication and a form of
adjudication that will work in practice. We have not got there

                           </strong> This has been a very interesting and important
debate, which shows how much work needs to be done on the issue. Local
authorities are losing huge amounts of money. In the next three years,
our local area will lose £338 million. Frankly, if the person in
charge of housing hears that the public health budget might be
available to be used to do up roofs for social housing in Islington, I
would be concerned that he will make a strong bid for some of the
public health budget in order to be able to pay for that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000283">&#160;</a>

difficulty is that this new ring-fenced budget has been introduced at a
time when local authorities are starved of cash. There will be a
temptation for those budgets to be raided, so it is very important that
this problem is addressed and it is made clear what these funds are to
be used for. My great concern is that we may end up without the money
being used in the way that is envisaged at the moment. It is easy for
us in the slightly arid environment of the Committee in Westminster to
think that everything will be fine, but it might not be. In any event,
the debate has also thrown up the fact that it is very difficult to
define public health. Local authorities will not only be starved of
cash, but will be trying to

                           </strong> Amendment 129 is a probing amendment that has
been promoted by Cancer Research UK, which is rightly concerned about
the effect of the reforms on cancer care. It argues that the amendment
would add the function of providing early cancer diagnosis services to
the list of functions of local authorities and the Secretary of State.
The reason for the amendment is that commissioning for cancer is
complex. There are more than 200 kinds of the disease, and the average
GP would see only eight or nine new cases of cancer each year. To
commission effectively, commissioners require information about the
appropriate levels at which to commission certain services, what an
excellent service looks like, and the current quality of different
services. GP-led commissioning could lead to some loss of the expertise
that has been developed to support commissioners, and Cancer Research
UK would like reassurance that the support of cancer experts will be
sought by commissioners during the transition to new commissioning
arrangements and
beyond.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000293">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
131 would insert “employment” after
“their”, and the reason is self-evident. As it stands,
the clause correctly notes that people’s housing and general
environment are major causes of ill health but it ignores their
employment, which can have a considerable impact, in particular the
safety of the working environment, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle
within the workplace—for example, the provision of
facilities—or directly in terms and conditions such as flexible
working time, time off for health checks and ensuring that pay is
sufficient to sustain reasonable
health.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000296">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
many people, their workplace and work are as important in determining
their overall health as their home or general environment, and that
should be recognised so that councils have a clear steer to have regard
to it. Examples might include the Prime Minister’s suggestion
that businesses provide facilities allowing their employees to cycle
rather than drive to work, and the campaign which I believe a member of
this Committee has supported for workers to be allowed time off for
cancer screening. Other examples involve health and safety, decent
wages and good industrial relations generally. Councils can take many
steps to promote good practice in all of those fields, so the amendment
seeks to add employment to the list, which is entirely
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000297">&#160;</a>

the list (a) to (g) in subsection (3), which lists some of the steps to
improve public health that the Secretary of State and local authorities
could take. The amendment would explicitly add research to the list.
The Breast Cancer Campaign raised this point with me, and I would be
grateful if the Minister could clarify whether research is covered by
the current wording of the subsection, and whether it should be
included in the Bill. The explanatory notes state in paragraph 115 on
page

However, again, the amendments in this group are superfluous. They are
either unnecessary, or unnecessarily restrict or possibly risk stifling

public health might be executed, but without defining it in an
artificially restrictive way. The fact that a particular step is

December on the funding and commissioning routes for public health made

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 131
would lengthen the list of examples further, to include risks to
health arising from employment—for example,
risks that local authorities can minimise. Again, the amendment is
superfluous. Clause 8 already allows local authorities to take
appropriate steps to address health risks arising from people’s
employment, if they decide that is appropriate. I observe that, by and
large, employment is good for health, and we expect employers, too, to
exercise their legal duty to reduce risks to their employees’
health.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
130 is different from amendments 29, 129 and 131 in that it would
change the effect of the Bill. Unfortunately, in our view, it would do
so in a damaging way. It removes the provision of financial incentives
from the list of example steps. Given the financial nature of such
steps, the effect would be to prevent local authorities from providing
incentives under the health improvement duty set out in the clause. We
are not saying that local authorities should make such provision, we
are saying that they ought to have the possibility available to them in
discharging the duty. I would like to explain that aspect of the clause
more fully because I understand that the area might be of
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reference to financial incentives goes beyond cash. To quote an example
from the “Healthy lives, healthy people” White Paper, the
Step2Get scheme awards children who walk to school instead of catching
the bus with vouchers for shops, cinemas and online games. In London,
it was found that for each £1 the scheme cost, £24 was
saved for local authorities and Transport for London in reduced costs
in managing overcrowding at bus stops and on buses. We are not
evangelical about that sort of incentive schemes as the evidence for
the effectiveness is often not strong. That is not, however, a reason
for the law to rule out their use altogether, as evidence may emerge
later to make them a stronger
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000314">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
directors of public health may consider evidence together with the
needs of their population. If they decide that it is appropriate to
provide a financial incentive, Parliament should not take that option
away. Paragraph 3(d) will allow that flexibility and evidence-based
innovation, so it should not be removed. I would argue that the more
examples included in the list in clause 8, the more likely it is that
it would be wrongly perceived as a prescriptive list. Although
amendment 130 would not add to the list, it would make the list more
restrictive, which is not what we or local authorities want from the
Bill. The clause will create a duty to take appropriate steps and
ultimately, it is for local authorities to decide what is appropriate
on the basis of reasonable advice and taking into account their
population’s needs. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Lady, who is
probing in the areas, will withdraw her amendments. Otherwise, I will
ask my colleagues to oppose
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000315">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I
am sure that the Minister will agree that one of the benefits of giving
local authorities responsibilities for public health is about the
important crossover with many other local authority activities that
have a direct influence on public health outcomes, including planning,
housing regulation and environmental health. Where two authorities may
be working in the same area, it is important that they work together,
and the amendments seek to underline that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000321">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 28
would designate a district council as a local authority even where
there is a council county in an area. It simply recognises the
importance of all the different types of local authorities and the
reason why they should all have a role and should be working together

health.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000322">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendments would create an unsustainable
overlap between the public health duties of county councils and
district councils and cause further confusion. Clause 8 defines the
local authorities that it and subsequent clauses will apply to. The
definition is designed to cover upper-tier and unitary authorities.
Thus it includes county councils but not any district councils in an
area with a county council. The effect will be that where there are two
tiers of local government, it is the county council, not the district
council, that will have the duty to improve health and appoint a
director of public health under clause 26. The county council will be
the body that will receive the grant that we were discussing just now
to finance new public health
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
28 would change that so that both county and district councils would
have the health improvement duties conferred on them. Therefore both
would have to appoint a director of public health, and it follows that
the grant would need to be divided between them. Yet the amendments
offer no suggestion as to how the duties of the county and the district
councils would be distinguished, or how the grant might be
divided.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000324">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 27
would require county councils to consult their districts councils, but
not the other way around. It would be inappropriate anyway for central
Government to use legislation to determine how independent local
authorities should collaborate and co-operate with each other. We, of
course, expect county and district councils to co-operate—that
is absolutely key. District councils, as the hon. Lady has said, have
local insight and expertise, with responsibility for certain services
that undoubtedly touch upon public health, and in many cases they have
a key role in services that have an impact on health and well-being,
with housing and environmental health being just two
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000325">&#160;</a>

well-being boards, which we will come to later in the Bill but which
are relevant to the amendments, will play a big part in local health
improvement activity, because they will bring all the relevant parties
into a collaborative relationship, to commission not just health, but
public health and social care. District councils can be involved via
that route, regardless of whether there is the statutory duty that the
amendment seeks. The clause provides a clear and
workable framework for local government, and the amendments would
confuse that and not help local government to discharge its
responsibility. The amendments should, therefore, be withdrawn, and if
they are not, I ask my colleagues to oppose

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me just
directly address the amendment. There has been an absence of a general
duty in the past and changes are being made to the architecture, with
the Secretary of State and local authorities having clear duties in the
Bill. I do not find anything convincing in the notion that that should
suddenly trigger the need to have a clear duty to consult with the very
expertise that will be essential in the discharge of those
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000335">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would weigh down the public health system with another unnecessary
legislative requirement to consult itself when we would reasonably
expect common sense to prevail. The amendment requires both local
authorities and the Secretary of State to consult the chief medical
officer, who is a member of the Secretary of State’s Department,
and who directs public health. The hon. Lady set out, quite rightly,
the expertise that public health professionals bring. The Secretary of
State does, of course, take advice from the chief medical officer and
has regard to that advice on a regular and informal basis. To require
him in law to consult a senior member of his own Department is, at
best, superfluous. It is unclear to me the circumstances in which the
amendment would require local authorities to consult with the chief
medical officer, or indeed why. It is also not always appropriate for
the Secretary of State to consult with local directors of public health
before acting to improve public health. We expect appropriate
consultation to occur naturally and the Bill, as drafted, allows for
that. Amendment 23 risks making the whole system unwieldy and slow, and
is therefore unnecessary and unhelpful. I hope the hon. Lady will
consider withdrawing it. If not, I urge my hon. Friends to

                           </strong> Clause 9 focuses on the duty placed on
consortia in commissioning certain health services, in particular it
sets out which persons consortia have responsibilities to provide
services for. Our amendments seek to establish that commissioning
consortia have a duty placed upon them to take account of the wider
population for the services they provide. We have an obligation to all
sections of society. I am not just talking about homeless people,
people with drug and alcohol-related problems, or indeed the travelling
communities. They are important groups for whom we need to provide
services, but there are also a number of other groups, such as people
who work away. For example, contract workers, who might even be working
away in Libya, cannot access their services and do not have any need
to. They will, however, need to access those services when they return
home and they may not be registered.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NHS has
always carried with it an expectation that people can access health
services, which are considered to be universally available, wherever
they reside and wherever they visit within the UK. Students are often
encouraged to sign up with their local GP practice when they are away
at university. However, I know from my own children’s experience
that that often does not happen. That does not mean that students
should be denied access to the health services that the Bill asks
consortia to commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The wider
question, however, is how people who live and perhaps work in more than
one location will fit into the wider system envisaged in the Bill. Just
as students might fall into the remit of different practices at their
parental home, at their home in term time and on campus, many other
people will too.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000345">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Those are excellent examples, and I thank my
hon. Friend for them. Another example is Members of Parliament. The
situation will apply to hundreds of thousands of people across the
country. In the Opposition’s view, it is essential that the
Government should clarify how they intend to implement regulations
under proposed new subsection (1B) dealing with anyone not registered
with a GP practice. The measures could involve a particularly important
group of people who are more likely to need targeted assistance to
ensure that health inequalities are tackled. I have mentioned the
homeless and people who might not be on a register due to alcohol
dependency or drug abuse. There is a huge danger that such people could
be marginalised or
ignored.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000347">&#160;</a>

remind the Committee of some of the evidence that we received, I am
fond of quoting Dr Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General
Practitioners. Her concern about widening health inequalities was that
GPs’ duties would relate only to their registered practice-based
populations. She expressed concerns that that would omit a large
proportion of the population.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000348">&#160;</a>

Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the concerns that he is raising
differ from the situation now? People are
registered with their GP and must attend accident or emergency in any
other part of the country. A student registered at home, for example,
must attend  A and E in term time, because they cannot register
with two

                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand from the Bill—I am happy to be corrected if I have
misunderstood—that whereas local health and well-being boards
will have responsibility for whole populations, consortia will focus
only on their practice-based populations. It would be sensible and
reasonable to accept amendment 68, as it would establish in the Bill
that commissioning consortia are responsible for people who reside in
the area covered by the consortia or who are visiting that area.
Amendment 69 would link those people, who are covered by the health and
well-being boards’ strategy, with the people to whom the
consortia should take responsibility for service
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
seems to me that amendment 68 should not be contentious, and I cannot
understand why the Government would resist it. Subsection (1B) on page
6 states that, “regulations may” outline which services
or facilities a consortium has a responsibility to provide to those
people with

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister clarify the meaning of prescribed connection with the
consortium’s area? The amendments seek to give a general
responsibility to a GP consortium to commission services for those
people residing in or visiting the area it covers. Requiring a
consortium to have responsibility for those people covered by the
health and well-being board strategy would provide another important
link.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000355">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I refer again
to evidence, though not that given directly to the Committee. The
director of public health in the constituency of my hon. Friend the
Member for Islington South and Finsbury, Sarah Price, is quoted on the
Department of Health’s website as saying the new health and
well-being boards
will<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000356">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>There

                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
the Bill does not provide that link. In other areas of the Bill we have
argued for a more co-ordinated and co-operative approach. I can see
there is an expectation for local authorities and commissioning
consortia to work together. It would seem sensible for

                        <p class="tabbed">In February
last year the independent report to the then Health Secretary, entitled
“Enabling effective delivery of health and well-being”,
concluded that to achieve better outcomes<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000359">&#160;</a>

                        <p>were
essential. As GP consortia are to replace the PCTs, it seems sensible
that a stronger link between the new health and well-being boards and
the commissioning consortia should form part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
important to consider the practicalities that were referred to by the
hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich. How in practice
would it work? Who would be included and excluded from commissioned
services? Would it even be possible to create the system, bearing in
mind what happens at the moment, where commissioned services will be
used only by a prescribed group of registered patients, and considering
the extent of services being commissioned? We know that 80% of services
are going to be commissioned by GP consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The principle
that we apply of free universal care raises a number of questions about
a credibility gap, which I hope the Minister can answer. For example,
there is the matter raised by the Minister of State, Department of
Health, his right hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford about
commissioning consortia having a duty to commission A and E and
ambulance services. As we know, at the moment, anyone can be admitted
to an A and E hospital or call an ambulance. How would one restrict the
availability of such a service in practice to only registered persons?

What is the prescribed group? Additionally, Parliament is legislating
for the future of the national health service, and every member of the

the hon. Gentleman. GPs have lists, not areas. PCTs are based on areas.
Although it is possible artificially to allocate to GPs an area and
call that a consortium area, it is still possible to be in a consortium
area and have a GP who lies outside it. Practices expect to be funded
according to the number of patients they serve and they expect to be
allowed to expand. Successful ones do and, as they expand, the
boundaries of people included in their lists also
expand.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000368">&#160;</a>

have a range of possibilities that need a clear solution, because they
have funding implications for the bodies that fund practices, which
will be the GP consortia. Could an individual be the funding
responsibility of a consortium in a particular area, which, because of
the changes and the way in which people move around between
GPs—from the less successful to the more successful—could
be an area mainly served by GPs in another consortium? Will the areas
be subject to redefinition? If so, at what point? Clearly, such issues
are technical; none the less they will crop up fairly early on in the
new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000369">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">An
area could end up being served by two GP practices in different
consortia; it will be in one consortium area but not the other. There
could be a situation in which 50% of patients in a particular
geographical area were served by one practice that happened to be in
the consortium and also by another practice that happened to be outside
the consortium. The truth is that there will never be an exact fit
unless we alter the rules of the game between GP lists and consortia
areas. That creates some complications. The hon. Gentleman asked what
would happen if a person had an accident in one consortium area, but
happened to be the patient in a different area. What happens now is
that the PCT area in which the person had the accident picks up the
bill. Obviously, the ambulance service can be tweaked to do things
differently, but it has severe cost
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000370">&#160;</a>

made. My argument was not so much in respect of someone who is
registered with a particular GP consortium or, at the moment, GP
practice, living in Kent and having an accident in London. I fully
appreciate that the bill would go now to the person’s own PCT,
and to the GP consortium under the new arrangements, but what happens
if the person is a student, a serviceman or someone working away,
rather than one of the prescribed groups, and, for some reason, is not
registered with any of the

                           </strong> At present, if any of us falls over or gets run over
outside here, the burden falls on Westminster PCT. There are
unfortunate PCTs that overlap dangerous bits of motorway and take up
more than their fair share of cost. It must be acknowledged that there
are a lot of problems. The problems are probably worst in areas such as
London, where there are a lot of choices available to people. There
could be a consortium area peppered with people who are served by GPs
from other consortia, who in turn may make regular use of ambulances in

also have to be a substantial change in ambulance service IT. As I
understand it, the very expensive and somewhat successful IT that the
ambulance service uses at the moment is based around postcodes, and all
the software will need to be rewritten if we are going to do things
differently. So, in a sense we are doomed to go down that particular
path so that we do not inconvenience the ambulance service too much. If
we have moved towards a situation where we have an area for a GP but we
also have a list that might go beyond that area, potentially we will
have a set of boundary disputes and funding disputes that can be
resolved only by having a clear set of principles. At the moment, I do
not know what that set of principles would look

                           </strong> We have had a very interesting debate. First, I
want to address amendments 68 and 69, before I speak to Government
amendment 4.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000374">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 68
seeks to expand the current definition in the Bill of those persons for
whom a commissioning consortium will have responsibility, to include
those who live in the area of a consortium or those who are visiting
the area. Amendment 69 seeks to specify in the proposed regulations
that the persons for whom the consortium will have responsibility could
include<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000375">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>These
amendments are unnecessary. Under new subsection 1A to
section 3 of the National Health Service Act 2006, consortia will be
responsible<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000376">&#160;</a>

is the registered population. Under new subsection 1B, regulations may
already allow for a consortium to be assigned

                        <p>That
could include people who live within the consortium’s area and
who are not registered with any GP’s practice, or people who are
present within the area and need emergency care. We have provided for
that in regulations rather than in the Bill itself to set out clearly
the details specifying which consortium will be responsible for
providing services for which groups of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000378">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, as part of our system-wide approach, our proposals will
create a commissioning landscape where the activities of health, social
care and public health commissioners will be aligned to meet identified
population needs through the development of joint health and well-being
strategies. The Bill will give local government a new role in promoting
integrated working between health and social care commissioners, and
both the NHS commissioning board and GP consortia will have duties to
support that activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000379">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Logically, we
have provided for that in the Bill. Clauses 176 and 177
amend the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.
Clause 176 amends section 116, so that the responsible local authority

177 introduces new sections 116A and 116B into the Act. New section
116A provides that the responsible local authority and each of its
partner commissioning consortia must prepare a
strategy—the joint health and well-being strategy—for
meeting the needs identified in the joint strategy needs assessment.
Under section 116B, consortia must have regard to the joint strategic
needs assessment and the joint health and well-being strategy when
carrying out relevant functions. Functions are relevant if they could

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Easington raised a number of points that I would like
to deal with in a piecemeal fashion. He raised the question of
management costs, and whether the registered or unregistered population
would be the basis for assessing those costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I can tell
the hon. Gentleman that both the registered and unregistered
populations will be taken into account when settling locations. He
asked why we cannot accept amendment 69, given that consortia have
responsibility for a given area. As I told the hon. Gentleman
earlier—I will now put it in slightly blunter
terms—although he believes that it would work, I do not believe
that it is the most satisfactory way to proceed. The health and
well-being strategy area could cover more than one consortium. The
amendment assumes coterminosity of boundaries with local authorities,
but that may not be the case due to the flexibility that we are
allowing consortia in terms of size and member practices.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000383">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked about students, and I can reassure him on that point
because I do not think that there is the potential problem that he
suggests. This is a classic example of where the regulation-making
power is needed. Students who have temporary residence are a good
example of people with a prescribed connection to the area, who will be
dealt with through the regulations. I hope that that has dealt with the
hon. Gentleman’s concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000384">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I move on to
Government amendment 4. As currently drafted, the regulation power
introduced by proposed new section 1B allows a consortium to be
assigned responsibility for persons who have a specified connection
with the area of the consortium. The intention is that such connections
could include people who live within the area and are not registered
with any GP practice, as well as people present in the area who need
emergency care. However, it has become clear that that would not
provide for a situation where a person has registered with a GP
practice but has never lived within the area of the consortium of which
that practice is a member. Without amendment, that would prevent the
proper operation of the current policy for NHS continuing health care
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000385">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">NHS
continuing health care is a package of health and personal care,
inclusive of accommodation costs, that is arranged and funded solely by
the NHS for people who have been assessed as having a primary health
need. It can be provided in a range of settings such as care homes,
patients’ homes or hospitals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000386">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Continuing
care is a complex and highly sensitive area that can affect people at a
very vulnerable stage in their lives. It requires commissioning
responsibility to rest with the original consortium—for example,
in situations where the patient has moved home and since registered at
a different practice within another consortium. That will provide
continuity of care arrangements, which is in the interest of the
patient.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000387">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The solution
is to widen the scope of the regulation to allow consortia
commissioning responsibilities to be determined either by reference to
area or to practice registration, both current or previous. I hope that
Government amendment 4 will be accepted by the Committee and, for
reasons that I outlined in earlier remarks, that amendments 68 and 69
will be rejected.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000388">&#160;</a>

principle, but I would like to respond to some of the issues raised by
the Minister about coterminosity with the GP consortia practices. If GP
consortia are not coterminous with local authority areas, that throws
up a whole set of other
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000389">&#160;</a>

is particularly true in relation to the chestnut, raised on several

resolving one set of issues, it throws up a whole set of other problems

                           </strong> Amendment 70 would strengthen the duties placed
on a commissioning consortium in regard to those to whom it provides
services. In the debate on the previous amendment, we discussed at
length who a consortium should provide services to. I want to turn to
the duties placed on it when it provides those services. In particular,
we want to strengthen the role of the health and well-being boards, the
strategic needs assessment, the joint health and well-being strategy
and the role of the NHS
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000417">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Further
on in the Bill, as the Minister mentioned in the previous debate,
clauses 176 to 183 set out the new arrangements for conducting joint
strategic needs assessments and establishing health and well-being
boards, which will also able to develop strategies, as laid out in the
Bill. The production of JSNAs is a statutory duty performed by the PCTs
and local authorities together. Under the new arrangements, the
PCT’s responsibility will transfer to the new GP consortia
structures, which will work with local authorities to develop the
JSNA.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000418">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
heard from the Minister earlier that a duty will be placed on local
authorities and commissioning consortia to produce a joint health and
well-being strategy to meet the needs identified in the JSNA. However,
those strategies should contain what I would hope to be a comprehensive
set of duties that will support some of the sort of co-ordination
between preventive measures taken by the local authority, which we
discussed earlier, and the commissioning practices of the
consortium.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000419">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
we were assured that there would be a statutory duty to have regard to
the JSNA and that the local authority and commissioning consortia would
have a duty to consider—just to consider—how best to use
their budgets co-operatively, we would like that responsibility to be
strengthened. In particular, as  part of deciding which
services commissioning consortia provide, to whom they provide them
and, where amendment 72 applies, which preventative,
diagnostic or treatment services they provide, it is important that
they be duty-bound to follow the agreed strategies. The House of
Commons research paper on the Bill states:<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000420">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Clause
179 imposes a duty on the HWB to encourage integrated working between
commissioners…, public health and social care. Clause 180
requires HWBs to lead on the joint strategic needs
assessment…and joint health and wellbeing
strategy”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000643">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I would like to know where the stick is for the boards to bring a
consortium into line if it fails to adhere to the agreed strategy.
Perhaps the Minister could aid me, because I fail to understand why
there is such a lack of responsibility in respect of the protagonists
in the health service—the people who hold the
budgets

talked about accountability functions and, specifically, the benefits
of how the health and well-being boards would hold foundation trusts to
account. The Bill needs to strengthen the accountability of
commissioners in the same fashion. Sir David went on to argue that the
involvement of representatives from public health, GP consortia and the
commissioning board

                        <p>If that
is the Government’s intention, all we are asking for is greater
accountability to be placed on commissioners with regard to the

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to ask the Minister about the role of the NHS constitution
under the arrangements in the Bill. An article in “Health
Insurance &amp; Protection Magazine” on 18 February reported
that Sir David Nicholson had written to the NHS regarding
misunderstandings about the Government’s intentions on waiting
times. It says that the NHS will maintain the maximum waiting
times— 18 weeks—and uphold patients’
rights, as set out in the NHS constitution. Will the Minister confirm
that the position expressed by the chief executive is the case and
whether the Secretary of State supports him? I ask that because in

12%. As the 18-week target remains a patient right under the NHS

the Minister explain why that legislation is being ignored by his

first about the lack of clarity on where responsibility for
commissioning all types of dental services will
rest.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000467">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are three types of dental services. First, there are general dental
services, which include family dentists—I hope all members of
the Committee are registered with one. Secondly, there are salaried
dental services, also known as community dentistry for vulnerable
groups. Thirdly, we have hospital dental services for people with
specialised needs, sometimes relating to—I do not know the exact
terminology—throat and mouth diseases and cancers affecting the
head; those are linked to hospital services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000468">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Earl Howe
recently confirmed in the other place that the NHS commissioning board
will commission secondary dental care in England to ensure
“consistency of approach”, because there was concern
about who would do that. However, doubt remains about where
responsibility for commissioning community dentistry lies. That
question has been raised with many hon. Members by the British Dental
Association.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000469">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Salaried
dentists provide a wide range of services for vulnerable or otherwise
disadvantaged groups, who may find it difficult to attend family dental
practices. For example, salaried dentists provide dental care for the
homeless and for people in prison and in care homes. They also have a
role to play in non-treatment, if that is an accurate phrase—in
other words, oral health promotion and outreach teaching. The BDA has
said that, because of the dynamic and complementary nature of the
relationship between salaried and general dental practice, it is
essential that those services are commissioned by the same
commissioner, to ensure that there is no duplication of service and,
more important, no gaps in provision. Will the Minister clarify whether
the national NHS commissioning board will commission community dental
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000470">&#160;</a>

concern is whether the national board will have the local expertise,
knowledge and understanding that vital to meeting local needs. We have
yet to hear how the regional and local structures of the board will be

should like to put to the

                        <p class="tabbed">First,
how will the Government ensure that the national board has the local
knowledge and understanding needed genuinely to meet people’s
needs? In New Parks, a very deprived area in my constituency, one of
the local dentists has been working with the PCT with a view to
expanding his services. How will that happen if dentistry is
commissioned at that national level?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000474">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
will local dental committees be involved in the commissioning process
and if so, how? Currently local dental committees liaise with PCTs.
Will local authorities be required to consult with local dental
committees as part of the health and well-being strategies? Public oral
health is an important indicator of wider health outcomes and linked to
some of the underlying determinants of health. Thirdly, what will be
the role of

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
108 would add a reference to armed forces veterans. The clause says
that the commissioning board will commission health care for the armed
forces. This is a probing amendment to see whether it will also cover
care for veterans. My understanding of the Bill is that health care for
members of the armed forces will be commissioned by the board, but when
they leave the forces their health care will be commissioned by
commissioning consortia. How will the Minister guarantee a smooth
transition from the national commissioning board having a role to when
people leave the armed forces and may need continuing care, including
for mental as well as physical health issues? How do we ensure that
there is no change in the consistency or quality of care?<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000476">&#160;</a>

that I do not need to tell the Committee that there are 5 million
veterans in England. For the vast majority, their time in the service
will have been a positive experience, but many leave with physical and
mental health conditions for which effective commissioning is needed.
With the ongoing deployment of UK forces, it is more important than
ever that the NHS works closely with the military services to ensure
that the health needs of those in the armed forces, veterans and their
families are properly

outlines all the specialised services that the centre currently
commissions. Specialised services are defined in law as those services
with a planning population of less than 1 million, and typically a
specialised service is one that is provided by fewer than 50 hospitals
nationally. The specialised services national definitions set lists 38
different types of service, including cancer services, blood and marrow
services, spinal services, cystic fibrosis services, renal services,
services for those with liver and pancreas problems, and medical
genetic services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000479">&#160;</a>

the history of NHS dental services in the past 10 years, are you sure

was on the Select Committee on Health in the previous
Parliament—I do not think that the Minister was on it at that
time. The reason why I posed that question was that that Committee
carried out an inquiry into NHS dentistry and found that it had been
going out of fashion in many regions of England, primarily because
money—private insurance—had come on to the scene. Some
dentists were wrongly—we took evidence on this—saying to
people, “You take out private insurance to cover your health
needs and I will treat your children on the national health
service.” That is well known—it was evidence taken in
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000482">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Health
Committee had a running battle with the Government—my
Government, I have to say—who were in denial about the state
that NHS dentistry had got into. Eventually, when we brought Ministers
back into Westminster Hall for a debate, their immediate response to
that report on NHS dentistry was that the situation was wrong. They set
up a committee to look at the situation and they started to bring NHS
dentistry back into those parts of the UK from which it had gone for
the reasons that I have described.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000483">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is the
truth about what happened to NHS dentistry. I can understand it to some
extent. I rarely go to the dentist without paying money. I do not
always have a clinical need; the treatment is sometimes cosmetic, and
the cost of that should not be met by the NHS, but clinical need costs
should be. Some people are not able to pay as I and many others do, but
they need NHS dental, clinical services. My great fear is that in the
Bill we are taking a step that will knock back NHS dentistry, which is
not in a brilliant position now, although it is better than it
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000484">&#160;</a>

see my dentist for a check-up on Saturday morning. When I asked her
what she thought about the new commissioning of services, she laughed.
She is a very serious dentist—she came and gave evidence to that
Health Committee inquiry. Now, I have a lot of time for Sir David
Nicholson—there is probably nobody in the UK who is more
knowledgeable about our health service and all its
intricacies—but when I asked him whether he was sure that this
was the proper way to do it, he replied:<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000485">&#160;</a>

what has been set out in the legislation. That connection between local
and national is going to be critical to its success. There are
different ways to define national and local. There will be a national
contract of sorts, I guess, quite different from the one we have at the
moment. There will be a local interpretation of that in individual
circumstances. How is that to be done? It could be through PCTs,
through the national commissioning body, through a whole set of things,

dentistry. Most people access NHS dentistry directly through their
registered dentist rather than through a

                           </div>GP, which is why the majority of referrals to specialist dental services
come from primary care dentists and not GPs. There is no record of
knowledge or custom among GPs with regard to commissioning dental care,
so it would not be an obvious place in which to put the commissioning
of dental services. I favour it being done through the national
commissioning board.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000493">&#160;</a>

which local needs can be addressed is through the local dental boards;
the health and well-being boards that will be in
all local communities; local government, because
local authorities will have a responsibility as part of the input on
meeting the health needs of the local community; the joint strategic
needs assessments; and in certain circumstances the local healthwatch.

clarification. It is quite clear that there will be a link in each
community between national commissioning and delivery on the ground.
Why can local dental committees not work with the local consortia group
to ensure that this is done in a proper manner? If he talks to dentists
at this time in the financial year, he will find that some of them are
doing little work because they have earned the right amount for their
contract for this financial year; others, on the other hand, will be
doing two or three days a week more, or doing more work on days that
they do not normally work, so that they can earn the money that is
allotted to the dental practice. Dentists work to very sophisticated
contracts and I cannot see how the system will work on the proposed
arm’s length basis. If local dental committees are to look after
the interests of local NHS dentistry, why are they not working with
commissioners who are there locally as

has said, but I fear that we are now beginning to go round in circles.
I fundamentally disagree with him on this specific point. As I said
earlier—I still stick by this—the experience and the
involvement of general medical practitioners in the commissioning of
dental care has been almost non-existent, so they are not the right
people to progress
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000496">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s frustration with the inadequacies of NHS dentistry.
However, he fails to identify an appropriate solution. The Minister
rightly points out that the access to dentistry is very different from
access to GPs and medicine. The two are distinct and rarely
interrelate. This Bill correctly differentiates those
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000497">&#160;</a>

Naturally, I agree with the tenor of his intervention, but what
heartens me is that he speaks with the experience of having been a
medical practitioner, so he knows a considerable amount about how
commissioning has happened in the past and about providing the finest
health care for patients. I am extremely grateful for his

do not want to detain the Committee, so I will move on to amendment
108, which is extremely important because it deals with
veterans’ health care. I agree with the hon. Member for
Leicester West that it is extremely 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 424<a class="bkMark" name="Column424">&#160;</a>
                           </div>important to ensure that the health of all veterans is properly dealt
with by the NHS when they are discharged from the armed forces. The
health of those who have served our country is paramount. We have a
duty of care to those who have been injured as a result of their
service to ensure that their health needs are properly met when they
return to civilian
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000499">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
vast majority of veterans leave the armed forces fit and well,
fortunately, having benefited from their time in the services. There
are approximately 4 million veterans in England, ranging in age from
those who served in the second world war or completed national service
to those who are currently on the front line in Afghanistan. On
discharge, they become members of their local communities and will be
able to access their local NHS services on the same basis as other
members of the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000500">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
11 allows for regulations to require the NHS commissioning board to
commission services for members of the armed forces or their families.
That is because members of the armed forces are able to access NHS
secondary care services directly on referral from Defence Medical
Services, which makes demand unpredictable. Demand from members of the
armed forces for those services may also vary according to tours of
duty, for example, and have the potential to impact significantly on
consortia budgets and commissioning strategies. We therefore think it
more appropriate for the NHS commissioning board to have responsibility
for arranging those services, working closely with relevant local
consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000501">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the health needs of the vast majority of veterans are very much the
same as those of the wider population and are best met and commissioned
on a local basis. For those who are seriously injured or who need
access to mental health services—the hon. Lady mentioned that
very important issue, and I suspect that there will be increasing
demand on the NHS—we already have measures in place to ensure
that those needs are also met locally, and we are in the process of
building on them. We therefore believe the commissioning consortia,
rather than the NHS commissioning board, should be the commissioners of
services for veterans of the armed forces, as for other members of the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000502">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important to recognise that although the health care needs of veterans
are similar to those of the majority of the population, veterans may
face disadvantages when accessing services because of geographical
mobility and being accommodated in poor housing within disadvantaged
and often rural areas. We must ensure that we do all we can to redress
the balance, so we are working on measures to help health professionals
to understand the needs of veterans. To that end, we have also
established armed forces networks running each SHA area to work on
local troubleshooting, policy development and implementation. Specific
mention of the importance of the NHS making provision for those is made
in the operating framework for
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000503">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
109 would remove the power for the Secretary of State to require the
board to commission such other services as may be prescribed under new
section 3B (1)(d) of the 2006 Act, and would instead require the
commissioning board to commission only those services covered by the
specialised services national definitions set. That is unnecessarily
restrictive. The clause currently allows for regulations to prescribe
that other services or facilities should be commissioned by 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 425<a class="bkMark" name="Column425">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the NHS commissioning board if the Secretary of State considers it
appropriate for the board, rather than consortia, to commission those,
having regard to a number of factors listed in new section 3B(3). The
intention is that that would include, for example, specialised services
for patients with rare conditions, where regional or national
commissioning arrangements currently apply because of such
services’ low volume and high cost, and which are currently
either commissioned nationally by NHS London, or regionally by PCTs
through collaborative commissioning
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000504">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
deciding what services would be appropriate to include in regulations
under new section 3B(1)(d), the Secretary of State would be required to
take into account certain factors such as the number of people needing
the services; the cost of providing them; the number of providers able
to offer services; and the financial impact on consortia of having to
commission those services. The specialised services definitions set
would be our starting point in determining what would be appropriate to
include under these regulations. However, it is important that the Bill
allows flexibility when determining which services are best
commissioned by the NHS commissioning board or by the consortia. Tying
the content of the regulations to those services covered by the current
version of the specialised services national definition set would
reduce that flexibility. It is for those reasons that, if the hon. Lady
decides to press the amendments to a vote, I ask my hon. Friends to
join me in opposing
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000505">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Hood, and I am grateful to the
Minister for his response. I will go in reverse order to liven things
up. First, in amendment 109, I am very grateful that the Minister has
said that the specialised services national definitions set will be the
starting point. That will be very reassuring to all the patients and
patient groups covered by those conditions. However, I am concerned
that clause 11 leaves it very open to the Secretary of State to
determine what is a national service and what is local. I will discuss
that under the next group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000506">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I am grateful for the Minister’s explanation regarding support,
services and commissioning for veterans. He is obviously right to say
that, for many veterans, their health needs become the needs of the
rest of the population, but it is important that we recognise and
acknowledge that truism, which is the reason I tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000507">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
and the most important, we talked about dentistry. I do not think that
the Minister has adequately explained how a national commissioning
board will have the understanding, skills, experience or expertise to
commission local dental services. Such a board might be equipped for
hospital services, but not for general dental practice or salaried
dentists. I do not understand the explanation that the Minister has
given, nor do I think the chief executive of the NHS understands it. It
has not been thought through yet, and on that basis I would like to
press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000508">&#160;</a>

of amendments. We are trying to clarify the basis on which the
Secretary of State can require the national commissioning board to
commission certain types of services. The aim of the amendments is to
get the Government to consider whether it is more appropriate for a
service to be commissioned nationally or locally as the primary issue
before they go on to consider which body should commission it. The
Government are sometimes in danger of fitting the service around their
proposals for commissioning rather than the health
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000536">&#160;</a>

proposal because they felt that the national board was better placed to

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not at this stage commenting on the decision itself; I am raising
the issue of the process by which the decision was made. Many of the
professional bodies and bodies representing mothers, particularly with
very sick young children, are concerned that the decision was changed
because of pressure from lobbying groups, particularly the GPs, and not
on the basis of people’s health needs or the quality of care. I
therefore ask the Minister to explain, using the example of maternity
services, the basis on which the decision was taken. What was the
evidence about people’s health needs, or where services were
delivered and provided, whether locally, regionally or nationally? How
will the Secretary of State decide which services are commissioned
locally or nationally, and how will he guarantee that that is based on
need, and not on the existing structures? Many people feel that it is
the structures that are driving the decision, not the health
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000543">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In discussing the amendments, the hon. Lady devoted
most of her comments to picking an example and dwelling on it, and she
is, of course, more than entitled to do that to illustrate her
arguments. My approach will be more classical, and I will deal with
what the amendments propose and why I certainly do not share Labour
Members’ enthusiasm for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000544">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As a
background to the amendments, the clause allows the Secretary of State
to require the NHS commissioning board to commission certain services.
Amendment 75 proposes that a service or facility should be prescribed
under proposed new section 3B(1)(d) to

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 76
proposes that an additional factor that the Secretary of State should
take into account, when requiring the board to commission such services
or facilities, should be<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000546">&#160;</a>

national providers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000666">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I appreciate that the
intention of the amendments is to reduce the scope for certain local
services to be commissioned by the board, which would instead ensure
that the services are the responsibility of commissioning
consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000547">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think we
all agree that it is sensible for the commissioning board to lead in
commissioning those services for patients with rare conditions that are
high-cost and where clinical expertise needs to be concentrated,
requiring the services to be commissioned and organised separately. We
have just discussed the fact that the specialised services national
definitions set will be our starting point in determining the services.
It is, however, not as simple as saying that the services we are
discussing would only be those that are provided regionally or
nationally. We would then have to try to define exactly what such terms
mean.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000548">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In practice,
the services currently covered by the national definitions set have
varied degrees of prevalence, and are therefore planned across
population sizes ranging from 500,000 patients to 10 million. That is
why we have included a number of factors that the Secretary of State
must take into account in proposed new subsection (3). They include:
the number of people requiring the service; the number of providers
available to provide it; the costs involved in providing the services;
and the implications for consortia of having to try and commission the
services. Those points are largely based on the factors that are
considered when determining what is appropriate for inclusion in the
current specialised services definition set. They therefore represent a
reasonable and consistent approach to deciding such matters in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000549">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is not
to say that GP consortia would have no role to play in relation to the
services. The commissioning board would, in practice, need to work
closely with consortia in identifying the levels of need for such
services around the country, developing care pathways for patients who
need to access a number of different services and agreeing contracts
with providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000550">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The board
would also have powers to delegate aspects of the commissioning process
to consortia, if that were the most effective solution. I believe,
therefore, that the Bill already provides an effective means of
determining the most appropriate level at which commissioning
arrangements for such vital services should take place and it provides
potential for a more effective and efficient approach in the future.
For those reasons, I ask the hon. Member for Leicester West to reflect
and consider withdrawing her amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000551">&#160;</a>

reminding the Minister that the NHS Alliance meeting held after the
White Paper was published produced a paper showing that two thirds of
its GPs were outraged that that commissioning would not be done by
consortia, for a good reason. They felt, among other
things—obviously, maternity and primary care are
important—that maternity care provided a link with primary care
for many people who do not normally go to their GP. They thought that
that was vital.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000553">&#160;</a>

valid point to the Committee’s attention. The White Paper

them. Where a viable improvement on our proposals comes up, we are

only putting patients at the centre of health care but raising

promoting quality improvement and extending choice for pregnant women,
which reinforces the need for close collaboration between the NHS
commissioning board and consortia. That approach is most likely to
deliver improvement and a joined-up approach to local services for
women and newborn children. I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured on

will not ask him to specify an occasion when I have said anything
fantastical, or at least not in this room. The Government say that they
have listened to people’s concerns about this and have changed
the legislation. In many other areas of the Bill, people have voiced
concerns that the Government have not listened to. Regarding the
amendments, people may feel that the Secretary of State can be lobbied
to change his mind if a clear list of criteria and principles is not
given. As the Bill stands, it will be up to the Secretary of State to
issue regulations that are not discussed by Parliament, on which he
does not have to consult. The intention behind the amendments was to
clarify the process of deciding which services are commissioned
nationally based on need, not based on the structures. I am sure that
we will return to the question on Report, so I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000562">&#160;</a>

                        </p>‘(c) consult with
commissioning consortia and Health and Wellbeing
Boards.’.<p>The
amendment seeks to require that when the Secretary of State is deciding
whether a national board should commission a service or whether that
should be done locally, he or she should talk to local consortia and
local health and well-being boards. I do not understand how a Secretary
of State can decide whether a service is to be commissioned locally or
nationally without consulting the very people who would be part of
commissioning that service locally. It does not make sense. The
amendment would help the Secretary of State in his or her decision
about where services should be
commissioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000566">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be very quick. I appreciate that the
intention of the amendment is to ensure local engagement over services
that should be commissioned by the board, but the types of services
that the commissioning board may be required to commission under clause
11 have been included because there are good reasons why they are more
appropriately commissioned by the national commissioning board at a
national level. We have discussed some of those reasons in relation to
previous amendments, so I will not go over ground that we have
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000567">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NHS
commissioning board commissioning those services instead will allow GP
consortia to focus on the services that they can directly influence,
which their patients access daily. As I have already said, however,
that is not to say that GP consortia would have no role to play in
relation to those services. The commissioning board would, in practice,
need to work closely with 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 431<a class="bkMark" name="Column431">&#160;</a>
                           </div>consortia in identifying levels of need for these services around the
country, developing care pathways for patients who need to access a
number of different services and agreeing contracts with providers. The
board would also have powers to delegate aspects of the commissioning
process to consortia if that were the most effective
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000568">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State would be required to seek appropriate advice before making
regulations under the clause, and we are currently considering how that
could best be achieved. The Secretary of State would also be required
to consult the board. The board itself would be required, under clause
19, to take steps to secure appropriate professional advice in
discharging its functions, which would include its approach to
commissioning these services. It will, therefore, be well placed to
advise the Secretary of State on what the regulations should cover.
Those powers will provide an essential means of ensuring the most
appropriate level at which commissioning arrangements for vital
services should take place, and will provide potential for a more
effective and efficient approach in future.<a class="bkMark" name="11030262000569">&#160;</a>

be able to decide through regulations, without consulting Parliament,
whether the national board should have responsibility for commissioning
something without his having some consultation with GP commissioning
consortia or the local health and well-being boards, which would either
be key to delivering that locally or may have concerns about its being
delivered nationally. For that reason, I will press the amendment to a
