<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): On a point of order, Mr. Hood. The Committee will notice the absence of the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker), who is attending the birth of his child. I am sure that the Committee sends him our best wishes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee wishes the hon. Gentleman and his wife all the best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): Further to that point of order, Mr. Hood. I thank you and the Committee for those best wishes, which I will pass on to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes. Although I am standing in for him this morning, I must leave early because I have to attend a meeting at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions that relates to a road scheme in my constituency, so I apologise to the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 127</center></H4>
<H4><center>Gas licence conditions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 795, in page 145, line 6, leave out `25' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`26'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 798 and 804.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> These amendments, like others to clauses l27 and 128, are technical. Clause 127 will principally amend section 26 of the Gas Act 1986 and insert a new section 26A. Clause 128 will principally amend section 14 of the Electricity Act 1989 and insert a new section 14A. The purpose in each case is to provide a new power for the Competition Commission to veto licence modifications proposed by the regulator following a licence modification report by the commission that has found effects adverse to the public interest.
<P>
Following such a report, the authority must tell the Competition Commission what licence modifications it intends to make. The commission may in turn veto those changes within four weeks if it does not consider them requisite to remedy the adverse effects specified in its report, or to prevent them from occurring. It will do so by issuing a direction telling the authority not to make some or all of its proposed modifications. If it vetoes the authority's proposals, the commission will step in and make the licence modification that it considers requisite. Amendments Nos. 795, 798 and 804 will correct references to sections of the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 respectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The amendments are part of a set of amendments to clause 127. I should like the Minister to explain amendment No. 798, which will replace ``25'' in the first line of subsection (3) with ``26'', so that it will state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After section 26 of that Act,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it then refers to new section 25A.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman repeat that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes. Amendment No. 798 will change the first line of subsection (3), from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After section 25 of that Act there is inserted—25A, to
<P>
After section 26 of that Act there is inserted—25A.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems odd.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those comments. If similar references in clauses 126 and 127 need amendment, they will be treated as typographical errors when the Bill is reprinted.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 796, in page 145, line 8, leave out from beginning to `a' in line 14 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` ``(4A) After considering any representations or objections made in response to proposals set out in a notice under subsection (3), the Authority shall give notice to the Competition Commission—
<P>
(a) setting out the modifications it proposes to make to remedy or prevent the adverse effects specified in the report; and
<P>
(b) stating the reasons for making the modifications.
<P>
(4B) The Authority shall include with the notice under subsection (4A)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 797, 805 and 806.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As I have said, under the new provisions that will be inserted into the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 in clauses 127 and 128 respectively, following an adverse licence modification report by the Competition Commission, the authority must tell the commission what licence modifications it intends to make to remedy the adverse effects specified, or to prevent them from occurring. Amendments Nos. 796 and 805 will remove the impression given in the clauses that the authority will have the discretion to decide whether to make such modifications. It is not allowed such discretion under the existing provisions of the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989.
<P>
The new provisions will include a fixed period in which the Competition Commission may issue a direction to veto the authority's proposed modifications. That period will end four weeks after the date on which the authority issues a notice telling the commission what licence modifications it proposes to make. Amendments Nos. 797 and 806 will correct the reference to a notice in new sections 26(4C) of the Gas Act 1986 and 14(4C) of the Electricity Act 1989 to that effect.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 800, 801 and 807 to 809.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 799 and 807 will make it clear that the Competition Commission may exercise its veto only in respect of those licence modifications proposed by the regulator that appear to the commission not to be requisite for the purposes of remedying the adverse effects specified in its report or preventing them from happening. Similarly, amendments Nos. 800 and 808 will remove the impression given in clauses 127 and 128 that, when the Competition Commission has exercised its veto, it may choose whether to make a licence modification itself. In fact, it must make such modifications as it considers requisite. Amendments Nos. 801 and 809 will address the same point.

Amendments Nos. 803 and 811 will ensure that the provisions inserted under clauses 127 and 128 respectively will apply only to licence modifications following a Competition Commission report made after those provisions come into force, rather than after the Bill receives Royal Assent, as currently drafted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 831, in page 151, line 9, leave out `and the Telecommunication Authority.'
<P>
I tabled the amendment in a spirit of helpfulness rather than for any other reason, as is the case with our amendments. It would delete from the clause the reference to the Telecommunications Authority. I had thought that all such references had been removed from the Bill, but perhaps I missed an earlier amendment that removed it from its financial provisions. It is important that telecommunications matters are removed from what is a key clause. If I am right, however, will the Government accept the amendment? I accept that more amendments will be tabled on Report and during the Bill's passage through another place, which is indicative of the Bill being out of control and is evidence of the fact that it should have been withdrawn. However, it would be helpful if the reference could be removed from the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendment would delete the reference to the Telecommunications Authority from the financial provisions of the Bill, presumably on the basis that it will not incur expenditure because the telecommunications aspect has been removed from the Bill. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) is right in principle, but procedurally he is jumping the gun. Certain telecommunications clauses already stand part of the Bill and the relevant financial provision should remain at this stage. The provision will be amended to remove such a reference on Report, at which time the telecommunications clauses will also be removed. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Mr. Hood, can you clarify the position? I do not understand why the Committee cannot vote to remove the reference from the clause. Had it been procedurally inadequate, I presume that you would not have selected my amendment for debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can clarify the position. The amendment would not have been on the amendment paper if it were not in order to table it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Thank you, Mr. Hood. In that case, the Minister's arguments are baffling. I do not understand why the Bill should leave the Committee with a provision that authorises expenditure by the Telecommunications Authority.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The short answer is that that will not happen. I am advised that it is preferable for the Bill to emerge from the Committee as a coherent whole. As the clauses establishing the Telecommunications Authority already stand part of the Bill, it is appropriate to retain the relevant financial provisions until the Bill is discussed on Report, when all the remaining telecommunications provisions will be removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is absolute nonsense. The Bill is as far from being a coherent whole as any Bill that has been enacted. What has taken place is unprecedented. There has been a mass removal of provisions from the Bill. It is a shambles. Further amendments are required to address drafting and typographical errors, so it is utter nonsense to say that the Bill is a coherent whole pending Report stage. We must therefore press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, provided that such expenditure does not exceed the combined expenditure of the offices of the Director General of Gas Supply and the Director General of Electricity Supply in 1999–2000 and as adjusted for inflation in subsequent years.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would limit expenditure on the authority. It relates to the key question of the financial measures arising out of the Bill. We have already had long debates on the matter, and I shall not detain the Committee by repeating those arguments. We have heard about the profligacy of Ofgem with regard to its offices in London and staff numbers—the office houses 450 people, but there are only 350 staff, which suggests that staff numbers will expand. We tabled amendments that would have required Treasury approval for the appointment of more staff, and in relation to the limiting of pay rises, all of which were resisted by the Government. We also suggested amendments that would ensure that the authority and the council analysed forward work programmes by project. Again, the Government responded that that would be a terrible burden on the council and authority, notwithstanding that such procedures are standard in private sector companies. Most state-run organisations have a tendency to expand, and the Government have given no indication that Ofgem and the consumer council will be different.
<P>
The amendment is eminently sensible, and provides for inflationary increases in expenditure in the years ahead. I hope that the Government can confirm that they do not anticipate that expenditure will exceed the rate of inflation. If they can, they have no reason not to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, the amendment revisits ground that we have covered on a number of occasions, especially on clause 7, which dealt with payments by licence holders.
<P>
The issue, then as now, is whether the normal disciplines of public expenditure represent a sufficient discipline on expenditure by the authority, or whether there is a need to go further and cap expenditure using a fixed formula. I do not know whether that is what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I assume that it is. We continue to take the view that normal public expenditure disciplines are sufficient and, indeed, preferable.
<P>
In spite of what the hon. Gentleman might say, this is not a soft option. The budget-setting process is primarily a matter between the authority and the Treasury. I do not know whether he agrees—I would like to hear from him if he does not—but the Treasury is not, in my experience, a soft touch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On so many instances throughout this Bill, the Government, and the Minister in particular, have resisted our attempts to add further approvals from the Treasury. That would have assuaged our concerns about how profitable it was.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Treasury, which has a particular view on this, seems to be very satisfied with the safeguards that are in place. I am not one to buck against my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, especially with a spending review coming up. I am willing to take his word rather than the hon. Gentleman's. Let me explain.
<P>
We have in train additional elements for tightening the financial control regime within which the authority will work. The authority will be required to consult on its forward work programme and budget. That requirement was welcomed by industry. The procedure will become a valuable tool in encouraging suggestions for efficiency improvements and in ensuring that licence holders feel they have a lever for influencing the budget-setting process. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury intends to subject the authority and the other utility regulators to a periodic review of their efficiency, with the first starting later this year. The reviews will benchmark the regulators against each other and against similar organisations in the United Kingdom and abroad. This represents a coherent and robust programme for improving and testing the efficiency of the regulatory offices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am afraid that the Minister is out of touch with public opinion on this issue. Most people would not regard the normal public expenditure disciplines, as he put it, sufficient to control Government expenditure. Most people have the correct view that Government expenditure is regarded as other people's money, something to be spent willy-nilly without any concern because it is not their own money. We cannot go too far in keeping control of public expenditure.
<P>
Periodic reviews of efficiency are very good, and if they lead to reductions in expenditure they are welcome, but there should be no suggestion in the Bill that expenditure will be allowed to increase beyond the rate of inflation. The periodic review of efficiency should not recommend expenditure beyond that rate. If it does, there is something wrong with the authority that we are setting up.
<P>
There is nothing wrong at all in having a cap. I would not want the authority's expenditure to rise by the rate of inflation every year. It should deliver efficiencies. The amendment should not be necessary, but concerns me that the Government resist it as somehow a constraint on the flexibility of the authority. That suggests that they expect expenditure by these bodies to exceed the rate of inflation.
<P>
I know that this is just one body among many in a huge Government machine, but if we apply this discipline to every state sector we will find huge savings in our public expenditure bill: not savings of expenditure that delivers extra services and benefits to people, but savings of waste. We should have such provision in most of our Bills when setting up these authorities. Now is the time to do that, when we set up the authority, ab initio. It is a pity that the Government are resisting this proposal. I would like to press the matter to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will briefly reiterate our concern about expenditure under the Bill. It is not only the Consolidated Fund that will lose out through excessive expenditure by the authorities, but the consumer. Throughout our opposition to the Bill, our concern has been for the consumer. The Bill was, ostensibly, designed to benefit the consumer, but in fact it will be enormously damaging. Apart from the fuel efficiency levy, which will be tripled from £1.20 to £3.60, enormous extra burdens will be placed on companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): I must pull my hon. Friend up for continuing to use the single utility figure, because at least two utilities will charge that amount to each consumer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is an excellent point, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pulling me up. He is absolutely right. The average consumer with gas and electricity in the home will have to pay £7.20.
<P>
In addition to the extra payments, the utilities will incur a huge cost in complying with all the directives from the Secretary of State and the authority. Furthermore, the Bill creates enormous regulatory risk, which translates into a requirement for a higher return on capital for the companies and their investors—a requirement that will be passed on to the consumer. The companies are capital intensive and will incur higher interest charges. Licence holders will have to bear extra costs as a result of the re-charging of the expenditure authorised by the clause. They will pass that cost on to the consumer, because there is nowhere else for it to go. There is a myth among people with left-wing views that the big capitalists can absorb anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pope:</B> Where are they?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We saw one or two out and about last night.
<P>
There is no great capitalist pot in which the money can be absorbed. In all industries, and especially in the utilities, the costs are passed on to the consumer. To make a last-ditch attempt to protect consumers from higher bills, or bills that will not decrease as much as they should have, I urge members of the Committee to vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Having heard the true voice of the bourgeoisie, I must say that the clause should stand part of the Bill. It is a conventional provision, required to meet the House's financial procedures to show that increases in public moneys will be expended under the Bill. The clause matches the money resolution agreed following Second Reading, as it is required to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I understand the Minister's point, but none the less, we must express the view—which I hope to be the view of the House and the Committee—that we are concerned about the authority's expenditure and its effect on consumer bills. I urge the Committee to oppose the clause.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 816 and 817.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> These amendments make technical changes consequential on clause 64. That clause ended the geographic exclusivity of gas transportation licences. When we discussed it, I said that the word ``public'' in the name ``public gas transporter'' was a hangover from the times when there was only one company in the market. We believe it to be more consistent with the new competitive environment that gas transporters should be called just that. The clause made the change of terminology in section 7 of the Gas Act 1986, which is the section that contains the definition of gas transporter. Clearly, however, we need to go through the rest of the Act and deal with other references. That is what amendment No. 815 achieves.
<P>
There were certain other uses of the term that were not dealt with in clause 64. Amendment No. 817 ensures that if any agreements relating to public gas transporters benefit from exclusions under section 62 of the 1986 Act immediately before the term is changed to ``gas transporter'', those agreements should continue to benefit, notwithstanding the change in terminology.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 821 and 822.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments update references to the regulator's general duties where such references appear in the existing Gas and Electricity Acts. For example, section 24(6) of the Gas Act 1986 provides that the Competition Commission, in conducting a licence modification reference, is to have regard to the regulator's general duties. Those duties are defined for that purpose by reference to the sections of the 1986 Act in which they are contained. Those section numbers, and those sections setting out the general duties in relation to electricity, have changed as a result of the provisions of the Bill. In particular, the authority will be under a new obligation to have regard to statutory guidance on social and environmental matters, and to advice on safety matters offered by the Health and Safety Commission and, in the case of electricity, the Engineering Inspectorate.
<P>
The amendments ensure that in cases in which there is an existing reference to the regulator's general duties, those references are changed to reflect the changes to the general duties made by the Bill

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new clause 10—Duty to facilitate competition.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Although amendment No. 819 comes first in the group, it is essentially a paving amendment. Perhaps it will be of more use to the Committee if I deal first with new clause 10, which places a duty on gas transporters to facilitate competition in gas supply. A parallel duty already applies to electricity transmitters, in section 9 of the Electricity Act 1989. Clause 41 extends that duty to distributors. However, section 9 of the Gas Act 1986 imposes a rather weaker duty on gas transporters. All that they are required to do is comply, so far as is economically possible, with any reasonable request to connect premises to their system, and avoid undue preference in the connection of premises or in the terms on which they transport gas through the system.
<P>
The Committee will recall that we discussed in previous sittings the proposals to end the geographical exclusivity of gas transportation licences. If that change is to bring about all the competitive developments that we want, to the ultimate benefit of consumers, we must also strengthen the duty on gas transporters to facilitate competition and provide fair access to their networks.
<P>
Subsection (1) simply sets the scene for what follows. Subsection (2) will ensure that the duty on a transporter to provide a connection to his system—where it is economical to do so—applies equally when the request comes from another transporter as it does when it comes from the occupier of premises.
<P>
Subsection (4) will ensure that a transporter does not show undue preference or discrimination in connecting other transportation systems to its own. Those provisions will make sure that the proposals that we have already adopted to ensure the end of geographical exclusivity cannot be undermined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We have no problem with the desire to increase competition in gas transportation. It is part of our philosophy, which we share with the Government on the issue.
<P>
What consultation have the Government had on the clause? What concerns, if any, has industry expressed? Will the Minister confirm that the clause fulfils the commitment mentioned in the explanatory notes to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>measures to increase competition on gas transportation,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or do the Government intend to table further amendments, including other new clauses?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is a good point. We consulted widely, and I am not aware of any companies having expressed reservations about the proposals. The new clause will introduce a duty to facilitate competition in the supply of gas. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman supports the Government on that issue, and I know that he is sincere.
<P>
I will complete the picture. Subsection (5) makes it clear that the new duty to connect other transporters on non-discriminatory terms applies to exempt as well as licensed transporters.
<P>
The amendment and the new clause will make a useful contribution to the further development of competition in gas supply, and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will further new clauses be tabled to fulfil the promise in the explanatory notes that there will be new measures to increase competition in gas transportation, or does new clause 10 represent the full extent of those measures?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I apologise, because I forgot to answer that question. We will certainly table further new clauses possibly today. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know that they will be essentially technical.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 820, in page 162, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) ``33BB'' is omitted;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 656 and 659.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> New section 33BC is not listed as a relevant requirement. Until an order requiring gas suppliers and transporters to meet energy efficiency targets has been made, the requirement to meet those targets cannot be made enforceable. However, the Bill specifies that such an order may be made enforceable if it is a relevant requirement.
<P>
Amendment No. 820 removes section 33BB of the Gas Act 1986 as amended from the list of relevant requirements. Section 33BB relates to energy efficiency standards of performance. It is being repealed and replaced by new section 33BC. Most of amendment No. 656 deletes the restriction of standards of performance powers to domestic customers only. As was discussed earlier in the Committee, the standards of performance provisions should, in principle, cover all customers and potential customers, with the regulatory authority deciding precisely the level of consumption at which customers no longer need such protection. We would expect broadly the same class of customers to be covered as at present, but it would be inflexible to fix it in statute. Subsection (a)(2) deletes requirements concerning consultation and research from the provision to avoid duplication of new section 33BAA inserted by clause 72, in which procedural details, including consultation and research, can now be found.
<P>
Amendment No. 659 is a necessary consequential amendment. It allows affirmative resolution procedures to apply to the powers in the Gas Act 1986 under new section 6B introduced by clause 68, which deals with powers to alter activities requiring a licence, and under new section 33BC introduced by clause 79 as amended, which deals with energy efficiency obligations.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 655, in page 162, line 13, leave out second `33E'.
<P>
The Chairman: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 658, 662 and 665 to 667.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 658 and 662 delete those sections of the Gas Act 1986 and Electricity Act 1989 that required licensees to operate approved complaints handling procedures. That is not because companies should not have such procedures—they should—but because those sections did not give the regulator any discretion to require companies to set up those procedures; a blanket obligation was imposed. To increase flexibility, it is more appropriate to impose such obligations by means of licence conditions. Requirements to maintain approved complaints procedures have been included in the draft standard licence conditions published by Ofgem. Amendments Nos. 655 to 667 are consequential.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`made by statutory instrument'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment ensures that the provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 will apply to an order made under the clause. That Act provides for numbering, printing, publication and citation of statutory instruments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B> Mr. Gibb:</B> I tabled an amendment to change the name of the Bill to the Gas and Electricity Bill, because it is no longer a Utilities Bill. It is barely plural. Although that would have been appropriate, I understand that it was out of order, because the short title must be consistent with the long title. Another possibility would have been to change the name to the Futilities Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) suggested. In view of events during the Bill's passage through Parliament, would the Government consider changing the title?
<P>
Subsection (2) concerns commencement. When the Government published the Bill, they expressed the view that all the utilities should be regulated in the same fashion. Therefore, it would make sense for the regulatory measures for all four utilities to come into force on the same day. Clearly, clause 56 needs to come into force as soon as possible to implement the new electricity trading arrangements in the autumn. Apart from that, however, the Government could consider changing the appointed date to make it consistent with the new Bill that will no doubt be introduced following the White Paper to be published later this year.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Although I cannot tell him why right now, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be very pleased next week.
<P>
The titles of Bills are important, as they are with songs. They can have huge financial implications. For example, I am told that on last night's ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'', a contestant was asked to complete the title of a song. The part of the title supplied was ``Don't Cry For Me'', and the options were,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a) Barcelona;
<P>
b) Argentina;
<P>
c) San Francisco; or
<P>
d) Bognor Regis.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have taken the concerns of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton seriously, and we will deal with the issue next week.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 134, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Pope.]
<P>
Bill to be further considered on Tuesday 11 April at half-past Ten o'clock.— [Mr. Pope.]
