						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000274"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Good morning Mr. Benton, it is good to
see you back in the Chair. May I wish a good morning to all members of
the Committee.</div>
					<a name="08011765000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that this is not a clause stand part debate, but I shall
briefly set out the background. Clause 35 is needed as a result of the
split of the |Housing Corporation&#146;s regulatory and investment
functions. Therefore it requires that this new investment body, the
Homes and Communities Agency, takes steps to ensure that low-cost
rental accommodation provided as a result of its activities is
adequately regulated.</div>
					<a name="08011765000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we would normally expect
the agency to provide low-cost rental accommodation indirectly&#151;a
debate that we have had already during the course of the
Committee&#146;s deliberations&#151;in the ways described in clause
35(3), (5) and (7) the agency will be able to provide low-cost rental
accommodation directly. Amendment No. 109 relates to this direct
provision by the agency. It makes it clear that, when the acquisition,
construction or conversion activity by the HCA is intended to result in
low-cost rental accommodation, the agency must ensure that a relevant
provider of low-cost rental accommodation is the landlord when it is
made available for rent.</div>
					<a name="08011765000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011765000275"></a>
							<b class="B">Lembit
&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): Does that mean that
the Government intend the HCA not to end up operating as a landlord to
tenants at any
time?</div>
					<a name="08011765000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000276"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> It is in the scope of the agency&#146;s powers
to act as a landlord, but I had an earlier debate with the right hon.
Member for North-West Hampshire about this matter. The anticipated main
focus of the agency&#146;s activities would be to assist work in
partnership with others&#151;registered providers, councils, or
whatever&#151;in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>that respect, rather than actually being a direct landlord itself. But
the scope and flexibility is there for the agency to do that.</div>
					<a name="08011765000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Homes and
Communities Agency can dispose of housing or land to a person, provide
infrastructure to a person&#151;which we debated in clause
7&#151;or give financial assistance to a person, on condition that
the person &#147;provides low-cost rental accommodation&#148;.
Where the agency does this, it must ensure that, where the
accommodation is made available for rent, the landlord is a relevant
provider&#151;as defined in subsection (9).</div>
					<a name="08011765000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
110 defines and clarifies the phrase &#147;provides low-cost rental
accommodation&#148;, for the purposes of this clause. It means to
construct, acquire or convert accommodation for use as low-cost rental
accommodation, or ensure such acquisition, conversion or construction
by another. Amendment No. 110 will effectively define &#147;provides
low-cost rental accommodation&#148; when this is not done directly by
the HCA. We thought it important to clarify what is meant when someone
other than the HCA is commissioned to provide the accommodation. This
is especially the case where the term &#147;provider&#148; bears a
different meaning in part
2.</div>
					<a name="08011765000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
35 requires the Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that the
landlord of low-cost rental accommodation provided as a result of its
activities is a relevant provider as defined in subsection (9).
Amendment No. 111 amends the definition of &#145;relevant
provider&#146; to include arm&#146;s length management
organisations or other entities controlled by a local authority, as
well as a local authority or a registered provider. At present, ALMOs
have managed only housing owned by the local authority. ALMOs&#151;I
have spoken to them and think that they are an exciting
model&#151;are increasingly interested in owning stock themselves.
The agency could provide financial assistance, infrastructure or land
to an ALMO for it to provide low-cost rental accommodation. This
amendment would allow the ALMO to be the owner when the agency-funded
accommodation is made available for rent.</div>
					<a name="08011765000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other amendments in this
group are not strictly speaking related to this clause. Government
amendments Nos. 112 to 114 relate to clause 36, which gives the Homes
and Communities Agency powers to require the repayment or recycling of
social housing assistance. These powers broadly re-enact the Housing
Corporation&#146;s powers in relation to recovery and recycling of
social housing grant. As the agency has a general financial assistance
power rather than specific grant powers limited to social housing, we
need to define when the grant-recovery and recycling powers are
available to the agency. We do not want these powers to be available in
relation to financial assistance given by the agency for other
purposes. For financial assistance given for purposes not related to
social housing, we think that ordinary grant conditions suffice.
However, the flexibility given by clause 36 is needed for social
housing assistance.</div>
					<a name="08011765000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 36(8) defines social
housing assistance
as</div>
					<a name="08011765000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;financial assistance
given under section 22 on condition that the recipient provides social
housing (whether by itself or as part of a wider
project).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011765000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 112 defines &#147;provides social housing&#148;. The
definition of &#147;provides&#148; is wider in this clause than in
clause 35 because we think it appropriate for the agency to have the
grant-recovery 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>and recycling powers for grants given for a wider range of activities,
including improving or maintaining social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08011765000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011765000277"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I do not
want to anticipate the debate on the subsequent set of amendments, but
it does seem peculiar that there is this proper definition of social
housing in relation to clause 36, but that does not apply in relation
to clause 35. That seems to be working entirely against the principle
of achieving mixed-tenure developments and greater flexibility in
tenure and not dividing the home-ownership sector from the rented
sector. I cannot understand why the formulation has applied in clause
35, which is more
restrictive.</div>
					<a name="08011765000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000278"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I understand my rt. hon. Friend&#146;s point,
and I do not want to pre-empt the debate that we are to have in a
moment. The way I see the shaping of his amendments is that we need to
be careful to have the most appropriate level of regulation. I think
that that is the theme that will emerge from his
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011765000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 113 adds to the index of defined provisions for the
purposes of part 1&#151;in clause 60 a cross-reference to the
definition of &#147;provides social housing&#148; in clause 36(8).
Government amendment No. 114 clarifies the definition of arm&#146;s
length management organisations by reference to the local government
legislation which defines when bodies are controlled by local
authorities. ALMOs cannot, for the time being, register with the
regulator as a provider of social housing, although, as the Committee
will be aware, the Government intend to bring local authorities within
the scope of the regulator within two years. For the time being, to
avoid confusion and duplication, we have specifically excluded both
local authorities and ALMOs from registration. As clause 35 makes
clear, however, this does not prevent them from receiving financial
assistance for social housing.</div>
					<a name="08011765000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have clarified
the position with regard to the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011765000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011765000279"></a>
							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I want to press
the Government on amendment No. 109 because I am not sure that the
Government fully understand the depth of concern within the housing
association movement about the duties set out in clause 35 and in
particular those set out in subsection (1), which Government amendment
No. 109 effectively rewrites. This debate is to some extent the other
side of the coin of the debates on clause 8 and clause 5. Those clauses
dealt with the powers of the HCA, and the debate this morning is on the
duties.</div>
					<a name="08011765000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defence
that the Minister deployed when he defended the powers of the HCA is
not available to the same extent when we deal with the duties because
one can deploy the argument that certain powers are needed if X
happens. That defence is not available when one addresses what are the
duties and the functions, or indeed the business of the HCA as set out
in chapter 4. The Minister did not convince me last week that the HCA
would not have a much more interventionist role than the Housing
Corporation has had to date. Let me remind him of what he
said:</div>
					<a name="08011765000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
anticipate that that will not be the primary way in which it will
support housing growth.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report,
Housing and Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>10 January 2008; c.
207.]</div>
					<a name="08011765000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">He said
that in the context of what the HCA would do, but it did not give the
housing association movement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>the reassurance that it was hoping for. He then had another go at column
216, but that did not take the trick either. He made it clear that the
option of development was there, if the agency so wished,
adding:</div>
					<a name="08011765000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However, where the
circumstances demand, the agency will be able to take a direct role if
it so wishes.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Housing and
Regeneration Public Bill Committee, </i>10 January 2008; c.
216.]</div>
					<a name="08011765000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we turn to
chapter 4, which deals with the HCA&#146;s functions in relation to
social housing, however, we find that the first such function, which is
set out in clause 35(1), relates to the circumstances in which the HCA
itself</div>
					<a name="08011765000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acquires or
constructs low cost rental
accommodation&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08011765000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
provision that the Government now propose to replace through amendment
No. 109.</div>
					<a name="08011765000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
may revert to what I call his model defence, which is that the clause
is modelled on previous legislation. Were he unkind&#151;he is
not&#151;he would refer to the Housing Associations Act 1985, which
sets out the functions of the relevant authority, which, in that case,
is the Housing Corporation. Section 75(e) of the Act refers to the
relevant authority undertaking &#147;to such extent as&#148; it
&#147;considers necessary, the provision&#148; construction,
acquisition and conversion of dwellings. If the Minister were really
unkind, he would ask who put that measure on the statute book, but he
is not and he would not dream of doing so. However, the relevant
point&#151;perhaps he can address this&#151;is whether the Housing
Corporation has ever used the powers in section 75 of the 1985 Act,
which are replicated in clause 35 of the Bill. My understanding is that
it has never done so.</div>
					<a name="08011765000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000280"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I share the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view that it is quite unlikely that the powers would
be used in the framework of the existing Housing Corporation. However,
the Bill creates a framework in which the corporation is merged with
English Partnerships, which has land acquisition and development roles.
The likelihood of the circumstances that the right hon. Gentleman
describes applying will therefore be greater. Is that not a relevant
consideration?</div>
					<a name="08011765000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000281"></a>Sir
George Young:
						</b> I would stand that
argument on its head and say that while English Partnerships may have
needed those powers, the new body does not because it incorporates that
part of the Housing Corporation that had a direct relationship with
housing associations, which obviates the need for English Partnerships
to be able to provide housing directly. If the Housing Corporation
never used those powers, the Minister must make the case as to why the
HCA, the new body&#151;as the right hon. Gentleman said, it is a
different body&#151;also needs them.</div>
					<a name="08011765000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">If clause 35 goes through
unamended, there is a real risk that it will change the existing
relationship between the Housing Corporation and the housing
associations. The Housing Corporation is not a competitor to the
housing associations; it is an enabler, provider and funder. Under
clause 35, however, it will become a competitor. To put it differently,
it is rather like one&#146;s father suddenly dating one&#146;s
girlfriend&#151;it totally changes the nature of the relationship and
someone who was a benevolent provider of funds is then seen as a direct
competitor.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>
					<a name="08011765000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The HCA will
have a whole range of information available to it, so it will be in a
privileged competitive position; it will know what the housing
associations plan to spend on buying and developing a site. With that
privileged information, it will be able to undertake the duties in
subsection (1), as amended, to do it all itself. When the Minister
replies, I want him to recognise that there is concern in the housing
association movement about these powers and about the possibility that
the HCA will become a competitor. Will he go further than he did in his
earlier contributions to reassure the movement that the powers, if
used, will be used sparingly and only if there is no alternative means
of developing and providing social housing? Will he assure us that the
powers in the clause relate not to the broader powers of English
Partnerships but solely to social housing? That responds in part to the
point made by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich.</div>
				
					<a name="08011765000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister, first, recognise the concern and secondly, go far further
in assuring me and the housing association movement that the good
relationship between the corporation and the movement will not be
changed by the HCA&#146;s enthusiastic use of the powers in amendment
No.

							<a name="08011765000282"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I enjoyed the questioning from
the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire. I would like to probe
him further on the point about his father and girlfriend situation, but
now is not the time&#151;perhaps when the Committee is over and we
are having a drink in the bar. I am clear about what the agency will
do, and I hope that I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman. I am not
certain I will be able to do so, because this is essentially a rehash
of a debate we had on an earlier clause&#151;clause 7, I think. The
direct question from the right hon. Gentleman was about whether the
agency would be building homes itself and, in effect, acting as a
competitor to the housing association sector. The right hon. Gentleman
should look at where we have come from. It is not my understanding that
the Housing Corporation or English Partnerships have been involved in
directly building homes in the recent past. I am not certain whether it
happened a long time ago or if it happened at all.</div>
					<a name="08011765000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate what I said to the
right hon. Gentleman in the debate on the earlier clause; the powers
are there for the agency to use, if they so wish. We see the
agency&#146;s role as facilitating, enabling and providing the skills
necessary to help the RSLs, councils and other providers to step up to
the plate and build houses. In our previous sitting we were discussing
a culture change in the agency. It is important that we increase and
accelerate the number of houses built, but even taking into account
that culture change, I do not genuinely think that the agency will use
its powers to provide housing directly, other than sparingly&#151;to
use the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s words. More, it will act in
partnership as a facilitator or an enabler for RSLs and others to do
that job.</div>
					<a name="08011765000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes
back to a similar point about becoming the local planning authority and
opportunity costs to the agency and what it could do with its
resources, both staffing and financial. It can achieve an awful lot
more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>by working in partnership and acting as a facilitator and enabling
rather than directly providing. The power is there; we require the
flexibility in the Bill, but I do not think that the power will be used
frequently.</div>
					<a name="08011765000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the right hon.
Gentleman appreciates that clause 35 is a good thing. It ensures that
low-cost rental accommodation is provided through registered providers
and, therefore, can be regulated. As we come on to a subsequent part of
the Bill, we see that we will be able to raise standards through the

examples of the way in which he foresees that the HCA might develop
itself? I understand that there might be emergency situations in which
it might need to develop, for example, if an RSL was failing. Can he
give us specific examples and clarify whether the HCA will retain
funding for itself rather than dispersing it for precisely this
objective?</div>

						</b> It is difficult to envisage
circumstances in which the agency will directly provide housing. I
anticipate that it would be to provide confidence to the wider market.
For example, it might enable a few units to be built to show what a
development could look like, which might encourage other providers to
come in. I imagine that it might do things at the start of a process to
inspire confidence in the market. It might take action to get
developments that are difficult to establish off the
ground&#151;quite literally. It is in those circumstances that I
imagine the agency using a range of powers, of which the power directly
to provide housing could be one. I hope that I have reassured my hon.
Friend on that. I am happy for her to intervene, if she needs further
clarification.</div>

there were problems with the Canary Wharf development. It went into
liquidation and then was restarted. If a similar development got into
financial difficulty, would the agency have the power to take it over,

the development? Would it be able to go broader than the housing remit,

past week because the Minister has retreated from the earlier trench,
which was that providing housing would not be the agency&#146;s
primary objective and that it would be able to take a direct role if it
so wished. He has retreated from that to what he said just now, which
was, &#147;I think these powers will be sparingly used&#148;. Then
he went into a different trench, when he said that it was
&#147;difficult to envisage the circumstances in
which&#151;&#148; they would be used. So a lot of progress has been
made.</div>
					<a name="08011765000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
objection to the rest of the powers which enable the HCA to fund other
organisations and I hope those will be used and produce the same sort
of output that was being produced some 10 or 12 years ago. I think that
the National Housing Federation will want to reflect on the exact words
that the Minister used in his response to see if it gives them the
assurance they are looking for that the HCA will not use its powers to
emerge as a direct competitor to housing associations. On that basis, I
would not dream of seeking a Division on the Government

We have always said that we expect that the primary function will be to
enable others to step up to the plate in order to improve the supply of

sparingly, so I do not think I have been inconsistent. We would expect

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000295"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> As we have already established, the clause to
which these amendments relate is likely to have a limited application.
The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire conceded that the
Government in which he served as a Minister put this provision in the
Housing Associations Act 1985, so they envisaged circumstances in which
it might apply, and that remains the
case.</div>
					<a name="08011765000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is likely, as the powers of the Housing Corporation are being combined
with those of English Partnerships, that there will be circumstances in
which the agency, as part of its role in development and supporting
regeneration, may wish to be a partner in a development, possibly with
a private developer. It could perform this function before transferring
the property across to an appropriate housing association or other body
to manage. There may be more circumstances in which this would apply,
but as my hon. Friend the Minister has made clear, these will probably
be relatively limited in
number.</div>
					<a name="08011765000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
why the clause has been written in a way that limits the provisions to
cases in which low-cost rental accommodation is involved. In practice,
the rest of the Bill is based on a formulation of social housing which
embraces both low-cost rental housing and low-cost home
ownership.</div>
					<a name="08011765000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 67
defines social housing
as</div>
					<a name="08011765000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) low
cost rental accommodation (defined by section 68),
and</div>
					<a name="08011765000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) low cost home
ownership accommodation (defined by section
69).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011765000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd that
in clause 35, which is headed &#147;Duties in relation to social
housing&#148;, not low-cost rental housing, the definitions are all
limited to low-cost rental. There must be some purpose behind this. It
is all the more odd to me because it runs completely counter to our
understanding of the importance of mixed-tenure developments, in which
one does not have rigid divisions between certain types of
tenure&#151;rented in one place and owner-occupied in
another.</div>
					<a name="08011765000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand
that there is a need for greater flexibility, for people to be able to
move between the rented sector and the ownership sector, possibly by
means of low-cost options on the way. That is very much part of the
current thinking. The Government are also strong in their advocacy of
mixed communities. That does not seem to fit comfortably at all with a
provision under the heading &#147;Social housing&#148;, which is
clearly limited to only one part of that social housing.</div>
					<a name="08011765000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also know
from experience that integrated management of new developments, where
there is mixed tenure, is often critical to the success of those
developments. If there is fragmented management, with different bodies
managing different parts of the housing in an estate, there is a
greater likelihood either for confusion or for lack of clarity and a
failure to deal with problems as and when they arise. All good thinking
at the moment is very supportive of integrated management. That all
argues rather forcefully in favour of an approach that does not
separate out provisions in relation to low-cost rental accommodation
from provisions for low-cost home ownership.</div>
					<a name="08011765000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">A clinching argument can be
found in clause 70, which is entitled &#147;Shared ownership low cost
rental&#148;, and is very germane indeed. The clause
states:</div>
					<a name="08011765000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Accommodation which is
both low cost rental accommodation and low cost shared ownership
accommodation is to be treated as the latter and not as the
former.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>
					<a name="08011765000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, if one has a combination of
low-cost rental and low-cost ownership, it is to be defined as low-cost
ownership, not low-cost rental. Why on earth are the Government seeking
in this clause to apply these provisions only to low-cost rental rather
than to the whole social housing field? That seems to be a pretty
convincing case.</div>
					<a name="08011765000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one looks
at this slightly further and thinks about the limited circumstances in
which these provisions might apply, I can see all sorts of scope for
perverse incentives if the formulation currently in the Bill is not
amended. That is why I have tabled these amendments. Let us take, for
example, a circumstance in which the agency, in partnership with a
private developer, is undertaking a regeneration project to achieve the
regeneration of an area in need of investment. That private developer
says, &#147;I don&#146;t want any low-cost rental housing on this
development. I want it to be a nice, upmarket development, with housing
for sale and low-cost home ownership, but I do not want social rented
housing.&#148; Under the current provisions, that developer would
have a rather persuasive case. It could say to the agency,
&#147;Let&#146;s keep this development such as to exclude social
rented housing. That way we won&#146;t have to engage a provider of
social housing in the management of it. As the developer, I can
continue to manage the whole thing and you will have no responsibility
to hand over to another body.&#148; That would be a perverse
incentive against the provision of social rented housing, which is
exactly the contrary of what we are trying to achieve in encouraging
developers to undertake mixed developments with social rented housing
as well as low-cost home ownership.</div>
					<a name="08011765000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other potential
problems. The Minister implied, in his response to my intervention on
the previous group of amendments that the reason for this formulation
was to do with the burden of
regulation.</div>
				
					<a name="08011765000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have to tell him that there is real concern in the housing association
movement that the Bill does not achieve a level playing field regarding
the regulatory arrangements applying to the housing association sector
as against the private sector. If the provision continues to apply as
way formulated in clause 35, the fears that private sector providers
will be subject to a less onerous and less demanding regulatory regime
than housing associations will be given added force.</div>
					<a name="08011765000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sincerely hope that the
Minister will reconsider the matter and accept that there is an
overwhelmingly strong case to apply the provisions of clause 35 to all
social housing as implied by the clause heading. I hope, in the
interests of diversity and flexibility of tenure, and the need for
good, integrated management and a level playing field between tenures,
that he is willing to accept the
amendments.</div>

						</b> The purpose of the
Committee stage of a Bill is to seek to improve it. Sometimes we have
political arguments that come down to philosophical differences of view
or, indeed, party political differences of view. This is not one of
those occasions, as we are talking about something that is of great
logical importance if we are to maintain the consistency of the clause
in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>context of the Bill as a whole. I need not repeat the argument made by
the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, but it is
unequivocally clear from what he has outlined that low-cost rented
accommodation is a subset of social housing. As he pointed out, clauses
68, 69 and 70 underline that point and go to some
lengths&#151;especially clause 69&#151;to explain that all three
constitute the sum of what social housing
means.</div>
					<a name="08011765000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not a
semantic point. I hope that the Minister accepts that the amendment is
a genuine improvement to the Bill, as its argument is compelling. I see
no reason why he should not accept it. The only circumstance in which
the Government should refuse to accept it is if they explicitly want to
exclude owner-occupied social housing from the purposes of the clause.
I am sure that the Minister does not intend to do so. I suspect that
this is simply a drafting omission. I hope that he will accept what is
inherently a simple and straightforward improvement to the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000297"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire have made a good case
with their usual forthrightness and eloquence. The amendments are
designed to replace the term &#147;low cost rental
accommodation&#148; with the term &#147;social housing&#148;.
Amendment No. 59 defines social housing in the same way as clause 67,
as my right hon. Friend
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="08011765000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35,
about which we have already had a bit of a debate, ensures that
low-cost rental housing, whether provided directly or funded by the
Homes and Communities Agency, remains in the social housing sector and
has a landlord who is regulated. As I said earlier, that is necessary
because of the regulatory and investment split that the Bill provides
with regard to the agency and the regulator. If the landlord is a
registered provider, tenants are protected by the Oftenant regulatory
regime. Local authorities and arm&#146;s length management
organisations are regulated through statute and the local government
performance regime involving the Audit
Commission.</div>
					<a name="08011765000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to what my right hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman said.
However, the amendments would require the HCA to ensure that homes for
low-cost home ownership as well as for low-cost rental are owned by a
registered provider, local authority or ALMO. That is not necessary. I
return to the point that I trailed in relation to earlier amendments
about the regulatory regime. My right hon. Friend made a very strong
case about the need to ensure that we have a level playing field, but
he will accept that low-cost home ownership requires a lighter
regulatory touch than low-cost rental accommodation. We are confident
that the appropriate degree of regulation for low-cost home ownership
can be achieved either through the regulator or, crucially, through the
agency imposing conditions on the financial assistance that it provides
under clause
22.</div>

					<a name="08011765000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon. Friend spoke
eloquently about rigidity and the fact that we want to provide mixed
communities. I agree with him. The regime proposed under clause 35
provides the corporation&#151;in future, the agency&#151;with the
flexibility to invest as it sees fit while ensuring that purchasers are
protected. My right hon. Friend makes a strong case, but I should like
to reflect on the matter to see whether we can address those concerns.
What he said about the sub-prime market was valid, and I shall see
whether we can do anything to reassure him at a later
stage.</div>

regime is appropriate, and things should be regulated through contract
and the housing ombudsman. If my right hon. Friend will allow me, I

framework that might bring about perverse incentives that would work
against the provision of social rented housing, such as the problem I
cited in the example that I gave earlier. All those arguments are

					<a name="08011765000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have spent a little time
discussing clause 35. The Minister knows of our concern from
discussions soon after the Bill was published, and he has been
constructive in his understanding and appreciation of the problematic
impact that the drafting of the clause could have on the market.
However, I am not convinced that the redrafting proposed in Government
amendments Nos. 109 to 114 and in the amendments tabled by the right
hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, which are to receive further
consideration, quite nail the point.</div>
					<a name="08011765000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the difficulties of such
discussions is the fact that the matter can be argued in such terribly
technical terms that it would be difficult for anyone reading the
<i class="I">Official Report</i> to understand. We must therefore be clear about
the subject of our discussion. It is my understanding that under the
clause as amended, a builder, perhaps one of the Barratts of this
world, who was creating a development on land owned by the
HCA&#151;that builder would normally construct a development and hand
it over to a housing association to run&#151;would, if the land
continued to be owned by the HCA, have to be the landlord. There is a
mix-up between the provider and the landlord, and I do not think that
the clause as amended deals properly with that problem. I am certain
from conversations with the Minister that that is not the
Government&#146;s intention but, none the less, it would be the
outcome if the provisions were accepted in their current
form.</div>
					<a name="08011765000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the spirit
of co-operation displayed in relation to the previous group of
amendments, will the Minister look again at the examples and reassure
himself and us that the drafting will not inadvertently create a
situation in which the provider and the landlord must be the same?
Another obvious example would be a group trying to create one of the
recently established shared ownership real estate investment trusts. It
would own the stock, but would it be permissible for the housing
association to end up managing it, as would normally happen, if the HCA
were involved in the land 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>deal? It seems to be the same situation as I described with the house
builder, and I understand from the provisions as drafted that the
answer would be no.</div>
					<a name="08011765000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to labour the issue, because we have spent three quarters
of an hour on it, and many relevant points have been made by my right
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire and other members of
the Committee, but will the Minister reassure us that he will take
seriously the concern about mixing up providers and landlords,
reconsider the matter and report back to the Committee
later?</div>
					<a name="08011765000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000308"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with the
sentiments behind the amendment. It is probably far too early in the
morning for me&#151;I am being far too amenable for my own
good&#151;and I prefer the later sittings. The hon. Gentleman is on
to something and the motivation behind the amendments is sound. He is
trying to give the agency more flexibility while protecting
tenants.</div>
					<a name="08011765000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that
is where it stops. I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me
that there are certain key aspects of regulation that can fall only on
the owners of the property. Regulation, as he will accept, protects
public investment in social housing by requiring owners to seek
disposal consent from the regulator or the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government before selling a property. It also,
for example, requires the owners of a home sold to the tenant under the
right-to-acquire scheme to reinvest the proceeds through the statutory
disposal proceeds fund. Those are key protections, which it is
essential to
maintain.</div>
					<a name="08011765000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Registered
providers can appoint a manager to carry out day-to-day management of
their properties. The regulator can operate or approve accreditation
schemes for such managers, and if a commercial developer, as the hon.
Gentleman suggested, wanted to appoint a manager or indeed another
registered provider to carry out that detailed work, that would be
perfectly possible within the existing framework. However, the
fundamental point is that the owner must still be registered to ensure
that investment from the public purse is protected. So, while I am
sympathetic to his concerns, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000309"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> We are getting close to clarification. Will the
Minister confirm that it is his understanding that under the clauses a
developer would be able, as happens now, to use a registered social
landlord&#151;a housing association&#151;to manage the property? He
referred just now to the possibility of bringing someone in to manage
the day-to-day aspects of the property. That did not sound quite the
same as what he said about a housing association being brought in. Will
he just confirm that the relevant format could involve a housing
association?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000310"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I shall try to clarify the
position. The direct answer to the question about housing built by
Barratt on land owned by the HCA is no: the point is that when the
housing becomes low-cost rental housing, the landlord is a relevant
provider. The provision does 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>not force Barratt to register, or stop it making a transfer to a housing
association. I hope that clarifies the point and reassures the hon.
Gentleman. Although I have much sympathy with what he said, I hope that
he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

particular, I refer to column 65, which deals specifically with clause
36. Mr. Richard Hughes, the CML representative,
stated:</div>
					<a name="08011765000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On our
reading, clauses 36 and 37 seem to say that the HCA can demand its

that I did not share the CML&#146;s concern, but I will not be
lending any money. It is important that the CML is confident that the
security their members have when they advance funds is such that they
will continue to lend. Has there been any dialogue since that exchange
on 11 December between the Minister&#146;s Department and the CML
that indicates that the organisation is no longer concerned about
clause 36 and that it does not want the amendment it sent to members of
the Committee but which no one tabled&#151;a proposed new subsection
(4)(c) to clause 36, which deals with the recovery of social housing
assistance&#151;and that the sort of difficulties that were envisaged
in the exchange will not, in fact, occur if clause 36 goes through
without its amendment?</div>

						</b> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that line of
questioning. I do not have the <i class="I">Hansard</i> for 11 December in front
of me, but I seem to recall from my genning up for this debate that the
right hon. Gentleman was extraordinarily helpful to me in respect of
this matter. I believe he realises, because I think he made the point
in December, that the provisions are not, in essence, a change in
policy terms or in the legal framework. He mentioned in December that
the Housing Corporation operates a similar system under the Housing Act
1996, and I believe he agrees that it is not unreasonable to require
repayment of more grant than had been originally understood would go
unchallenged.</div>
					<a name="08011765000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
direct point about dialogue between officials and the CML, I assure the
right hon. Gentleman that my officials have been discussing the matter
with the organisation. The discussion is ongoing, because we are keen
to reassure the CML of the nature of the clause and subsequent relevant

					<a name="08011765000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CML
also raised a specific problem with clause 37. I quote from the
note that it sent to all members of the
Committee:</div>

on to
state:</div>
					<a name="08011765000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If this
is the case then security valuations would have to be adjusted to
reflect the obligation of a successor in title to repay grant. This
would mean that current registered providers could all be in breach of
their loan covenants and would impact negatively on the financial
capacity of registered providers going
forward.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011765000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put the same
question to the Minister as I did on clause 36: is there is a dialogue
on the clause, and has his Department been able to satisfy the CML that
the risks outlined in the passage that I have just read out do not
exist, and that there is no impediment to its continuing to fund

the CML&#146;s point about how the operation of the determinations
will interact with repossessions and so on. Dialogues are ongoing

body, including those unaffected by particular determinations. That
could be unwieldy and unnecessarily bureaucratic. I am sure that is not
what the hon. Gentleman intended, although I understand the sentiment

George Young:
						</b> I think that clause 40 is the first part of
the Bill where the regulator of social housing is mentioned. We will
have a much more substantive discussion about his role later on. This
is rather like Beethoven&#146;s opera, &#147;Fidelio&#148;, in
which the hero does not appear until the second act. However, can the
Minister, who has announced the chief executive of the HCA, say
anything about who the regulator is? Has he been announced? If not, how
far have the Government got in the process of appointing
him?</div>
					<a name="08011765000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause states
that the HCA must co-operate with the regulator. At present, the
regulator and the investor share the same building. Is it envisaged
that the HCA and the regulator will be co-located, or that they will be
separately accommodated? Furthermore, will the Minister shed some light
on clause 40(2), which states that</div>
					<a name="08011765000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the HCA must consult the
regulator on matters likely to interest the
regulator.&#148;?</div>
					<a name="08011765000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does
that mean? We are imposing a statutory duty on the HCA, and in fairness
to it we should shed some light on what information it will be legally
obliged to pass on to the
regulator.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000330"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> The process of appointing the regulator is
ongoing, but when we come to part 2 of the Bill, I might be able to
update the Committee on progress. As for co-location of the agency and
the regulator, that is an operational decision, but we do not intend
that there should be a physical separation as well as an organisational
separation.</div>

					<a name="08011765000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s third line of questioning was about the
circumstances in which there would be co-operation between the
regulator and the agency. That is crucial, because, as he rightly said,
we have previously had a merging of the regulatory and investment
functions. The regulator will be concerned to see that registered
providers are responsive to tenants and that their businesses remain
viable, because that will help to raise standards for tenants.
Crucially, it will need to understand the stresses of business,
particularly the ability to borrow money.</div>
					<a name="08011765000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the investing body, the
agency will be also be interested in the ability to borrow money, and
will need to have an understanding of such matters when making
investment decisions. It would be sensible for the agency to consult
the regulator when developing its investment policies to understand the
overall ability of registered providers to deliver. It is in
everyone&#146;s interests to ensure that the capacity and delivery
capability of the sector is advanced as much as possible. In short, a
close dialogue will be needed, while the regulator should maintain a
clear independence, as has been set out and universally acknowledged. I
hope that reassures the right hon.
Gentleman.</div>

Given that there needs to be a step change in what the agency does, in
comparison with its predecessor organisations, I anticipate that it
will work in new fields, such as project management. I understand that
English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation already have such
roles, but I imagine that there will be new and innovative research on
project management and perhaps communication.</div>

primary role, following my response to my right hon. Friend&#151;in
facilitating, enabling, partnership working and community engagement. I
do not want to box the agency in on what it does, but I imagine that as
a resource hub and repository of best practice, it will help people
step up to the plate and local communities to become involved in
planning permission. It will also help to ensure that infrastructure
projects are understood and communicated as much as possible.</div>

Raynsford:
						</b> This is a supplementary point about the Academy
for Sustainable Communities, the body that is likely to become
Cinderella to the new agency unless we draw attention to it. All our
discussions have been about the merging of the Housing Corporation and
English Partnerships, the two big components of the new body, but the
third component is the academy, which has an important role in advice,
education and training&#151;the subjects of the clause. I should be
grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister could indicate the areas where
the academy, in its new role as part of the agency, will address the
challenges that we face, not least of appropriate skills for the
achievement of the Government&#146;s ambitious housing and
regeneration targets.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000338"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> Over recent years, we have seen
the importance of involving communities, particularly disadvantaged
communities, on many of the larger estates. I am thinking of places
such as Castle Vale in Birmingham, where major schemes have involved
tenants and communities. Does the Minister envisage that an element of
the measure could be to help train community members to be advocates
for their communities and put forward what people want at grass roots,
so that when there are development schemes, one is better able to drill
down, there is no top-down process and the HCA does its best to involve
local communities and get community members to say what their
communities want in the way of redevelopment and
sustainability?</div>
					<a name="08011765000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000339"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful to the Committee for bringing the
issue to wider attention. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich is right: although the focus has been on the establishment
of the HCA due to the merger of English Partnerships and the Housing
Corporation, we should not forget the vital role of the Academy for
Sustainable Communities in ensuring that we have real community
engagement. I am excited by what the academy does, and there is a real
opportunity in the Bill to expand its work.</div>
					<a name="08011765000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">To touch on
what my right hon. Friend said about clause 41, the academy focuses on
broader generic skills, such as project management, vision,
communication, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>partnership working and community engagement, and following my response
to him on that earlier clause, I anticipate that the academy will
expand its role. The academy has identified three broad areas and three
major audiences on which its work programmes will focus when it becomes
part of the agency. The three major audiences include young people,
because it will need to capture their interest, raise their awareness
of sustainable community issues and encourage them to go into
sustainable community careers. Having spoken to stakeholders, I know
that there is a potential skills shortage, which may affect the number
of people going into sustainable community careers, such as
architecture and landscaping. I know, too, that my right hon. Friend is
working hard on the issue.</div>
					<a name="08011765000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must work to encourage
people to have a stake in their communities and to realise that quality
of life and the built environment are important. People can become
productively and positively involved in their communities by taking up
careers as planning surveyors, architects or landscapers. I am really
excited by that work and I would like to drive it forward, certainly at
ministerial level.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000340"></a>Margaret
Moran:
						</b> Does my hon. Friend envisage the expansion of some
of the ideas that he has outlined? For example, I have been working
closely with Ashram housing association in Birmingham, which has worked
with its south Asian women tenants to ensure that they gain
qualifications in design and architecture and can help to design their
own homes. Such schemes give people skills and potential for
employment, while dealing with issues such as sustainable communities
and regeneration. I hope that the HCA will take a much more positive
role in expanding such projects.</div>
					<a name="08011765000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000341"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I certainly hope so, too. I am pleased that my
hon. Friend mentioned Ashram, because its representatives have been to
see me. We talked about skilling specific diverse communities and about
ensuring that in areas where black and minority ethnic communities,
women and younger people are not involved in the careers that I
mentioned they step up to the plate to ensure that they become
involved. That is vital, so I am really encouraged and excited by what
is going on and I want to see those things go forward. The academy is
really good and will make still more progress when it is in the
agency.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000342"></a>Mr.
Hurd:
						</b> Of course, the Bill is not the
only opportunity for the Academy for Sustainable Communities to expand
now that the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 is on the statute book.
As the promoter of the private Member&#146;s Bill that led to the
Act, I am obviously delighted to support the academy&#146;s
expansion. May I press the Minister a little further, however, on what
expansion means in this context? How much more financial assistance
will the Government put into that
expansion?</div>
				
					<a name="08011765000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011765000343"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That will be an operational decision for the
agency&#146;s chief executive and senior management. The clear
expectation is that the agency will help people to realise what they
can do to promote sustainable communities. In that respect, I pay
tribute to what the hon. Gentleman did in the 2007 Act. However, if the
agency is really to step up to the plate to ensure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>communities are engaged and that potential barriers to housing growth
and community infrastructure are identified, addressed and resolved,
the academy will need to play a bigger role. That is what I mean by
expansion.</div>
					<a name="08011765000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have mentioned young people
and potential skills shortages, but let me also mention professionals
because the professional bodies have a role to play. The academy has
identified the need to target professionals and deliver a co-ordinated
programme of integrated learning and skills training to those working
in sustainable communities. That will improve their skills and
awareness and ensure that future generations are attracted to the
relevant professions and that those working in them are excited by them
and want to move forward still further. Again, this is a real
opportunity, and I am really excited by it.</div>
					<a name="08011765000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third strand of the work
programme identified by the academy relates directly to the point made
by the hon. Member for Poole about community leaders. The academy wants
to raise awareness and understanding of sustainable community issues
among community leaders and to support the building of the capacity and
capability to deliver on those issues.</div>
					<a name="08011765000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">From what I have heard, the
whole Committee is really excited, as I am, about the Academy for
Sustainable Communities. As John F. Kennedy said,</div>
					<a name="08011765000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ask not what your
country can do for you; ask what you can do for your
country&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08011765000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the
academy will be doing that on a sustainable community level. It is
really exciting that people can make an impact in their area by using
architects, landscapers and planning surveyors to raise standards and
quality of life, and that planning and design, which we mentioned on
earlier clauses, can play a central role. Through the agency, the
academy will be able to ensure that that happens. I have been
encouraged by our debate, as I hope other hon. Members have been, and I
hope that they will be attracted to stuff that is going on in their
constituencies and will ensure that the agency plays a part across the
country.</div>

presumably there is some distinction between guidance and directions.
Due to my inexperience of my portfolio there may be a standard answer
that I do not know, but will the Minister clarify the matter? How
binding is the guidance that the HCA gives? Is it mandatory, or is it,
within the more conventional meaning of the word, exactly
that&#151;guidance and advice? I hope the question makes sense to the

							<a name="08011765000347"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> My question to the Minister is on a different
tack. I assume that the main purpose of clause 43 is to allow the
agency to give guidance to providers and others involved in the
provision of social housing and regeneration in the way that both the
Housing Corporation and English Partnerships do at
present.</div>
					<a name="08011765000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within the
current arrangements, another area has always been problematic: the
relationship between the regulatory function of the Housing Corporation
and its investment function. The question has always been how to
maintain a proper distinction between those two functions, but without
allowing nonsense to develop whereby the investment side puts money
into an organisation that is subject to concern from the regulatory
side. That will be part of the framework under the new arrangements
whereby the regulator will be a different body from the funder and
there will at times be questions about whether it is sensible for
regulatory action to be taken in respect of an organisation that is
seen to be in
difficulty.</div>
					<a name="08011765000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that in general the record over the past 30 years or so has been
good in terms of successful housing associations. When problems have
arisen, the Housing Corporation has been able to intervene and the
problems have generally been overcome without loss of public money or
threat to tenants. However, as the recent case involving Ujima housing
association highlighted, unhappy circumstances can rapidly develop in
which an association that had previously been regarded as a safe
recipient of investment finance may seem to be getting into financial
difficulties or to be acting not entirely properly in its financial
decisions, and regulatory intervention may become necessary. In the
Ujima case, questions were asked about whether action was taken early
enough when the first warning signals appeared about the organisation
not performing as well as it should. My question is: does guidance in
clause 43 extend to guidance being issued by the agency to the
regulator in such circumstances?</div>
					<a name="08011765000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be essential to have a

George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I launched the probing
contributions made so far. Indeed my hon. Friend the Member for
Montgomeryshire launched a space probe a moment ago. I was not quite
sure which planet he was coming from, but I was reassured because in
the end it was a very thoughtful
contribution.</div>

George:
						</b> Just to reassure my hon. Friend, I fully support
him.</div>
					<a name="08011765000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably, the
HCA will be giving guidance to RSLs and others&#151;local authorities
and so forth. Chapter 5 refers to guidance and direction from the
Secretary of State. To what extent will the HCA be expected to offer
formal guidance to Government agencies, to the Treasury and the
Secretary of State? That is not clear, so perhaps the Minister could
point out where it is formally provided for in the Bill?</div>
					<a name="08011765000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have noted
that the HCA produces an annual report. A lot of bodies that provide
housing&#151;RSLs for example&#151;will be making
representations to Government, and they would be greatly strengthened
if the HCA itself endorsed the concerns of those agencies. An example
is the manner in which stamp duty applies to shared equity properties.
In many parts of the country when such a property is purchased, the
contribution of the occupant is well below stamp duty level but they
still have to pay stamp duty because the value of the whole property is
above the stamp duty threshold. In those circumstances, and given the
fact that it is not open market housing, I hope that the HCA would
support social housing providers by endorsing that concern. The
Government need to address the anomaly whereby people they and the HCA
are attempting to support through low-cost shared equity properties are
penalised by having to pay stamp duty. In that instance, it would be
appropriate for the HCA to make representations not just to the
Secretary of State but to the Treasury itself. Can the Minister
reassure us that it would be a right and proper thing for the HCA to
do?</div>

Wright:
						</b> I am grateful to Members for
that interesting line of questioning. On the point raised by the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire about whether the word guidance is to be
understood in the conventional sense, I reassure him that guidance is
guidance.</div>
					<a name="08011765000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful if I set out what sort of guidance we expect the agency to
provide. It could provide guidance on anything relating to its objects
and we have discussed at length improving the supply and quality of
housing, regeneration and community development. The sort of guidance
the agency might issue could be similar to what English Partnerships
and the Housing Corporation have been doing. For example, in relation
to its investment functions, the Housing Corporation issues a piece of
main guidance called the capital funding guide, designed to help
registered social landlords understand the procedures and requirements
relating to capital grant.</div>
