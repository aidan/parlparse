								The
Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):
						</b> On a
point of order, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I want simply to put on
the record an apology to Committee members. On Second Reading, we
undertook to publish a draft order on the Mayor&#146;s planning
powers in time for us to be able to discuss it in Committee when we
reached the relevant clause of the Bill. We published the draft order
on Tuesday and made it available to the Chairs of the Committee, but
unfortunately, due to confusion, it was not circulated to members of
the Committee, although it should have been. I want to apologise to
members of the Committee for
that.</div>
					<a name="07011184000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did today, as
soon as we became aware that Committee members had not received the
draft order, circulate copies of the draft order. If any Committee
members do not have a copy of it, they should please contact me and I
will ensure that they receive a copy as speedily as possible, as we had
wanted to ensure that Committee members had copies in time for the
deadline for tabling amendments to the relevant provision of the Bill,
which is the end of
today.</div>
					<a name="07011184000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank both
Opposition parties, which I know have had discussions through the usual
channels about the matter, for their understanding and for
accommodating
us.</div>

record my thanks to the Minister for the gracious way in which she has
acknowledged that this situation has arisen? Opposition Members
completely understand that there was no intention to mislead or to
impede the flow of the Committee&#146;s proceedings&#151;we know
that this is just one of those
things.</div>

broadly, and depending, obviously, on progress in Committee, we will
have an opportunity to discuss all the planning clauses, I hope, next
week. During that time, there will be an opportunity to debate the
order. There are amendments standing in our name that would delete
specific clauses. If for any reason our amendments are not accepted by
the Government, we recognise that there may be an opportunity to
propose more specific amendments on Report with the aim of amending the
order once those clauses stand part of the Bill. I hope that that will
be acceptable. If for any reason it is not, perhaps I could be given
guidance to that
effect.</div>

								The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> It is good to see you back in the Chair this
afternoon, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Before the Committee was
adjourned, the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was kind enough
to allow me the opportunity to intervene on him. I had only one word
left to utter, but it would be unfair on him just to say
&#147;satisfy&#148; and then sit down. The substantive question
that I was asking was whether he would like to take on board the valid
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd&#146;s Bush that no consultation, no matter how thorough,
will ever be able to satisfy 100 per cent. of
respondents.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div>
					<a name="07011184000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000518"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Welcome back to the Committee, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. I understand, of course, that no system will be perfect.
We are not asking for that, but what I am saying and what is, I fear,
overwhelmingly the experience of members of the London assembly is that
there is a systemic failure in Transport for London, which stems from
the culture of the organisation. I regret to have to say that. There
are individual officers who are excellent and I have had good
experiences, but there has been such a number of unsatisfactory
experiences that I have a real concern about the culture of the
organisation. That brings me back to my point that that is based on one
that has some advantages in terms of driving forward a business
plan&#151;I accept that&#151;but does not have the advantage that
comes from those who serve on the London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority, as a classic example, and increasingly in the Metropolitan
Police Authority as well. I am referring to the need to interact with
elected representatives and their constituents. That is where the
failure is and where the culture, accountability and transparency would
be improved by going down to the LFEPA
model.</div>
					<a name="07011184000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had nearly
finished my comments this morning. I was just making the point that
there is an issue about Transport for London&#146;s failure to
consult on network roadworks, which affect the public, but that there
is a broader problem,
too.</div>
					<a name="07011184000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I regret that
there are many instances of similar failures on borough roads. For
example, as I was saying in this morning&#146;s sitting, TFL
disburses money to the boroughs to carry out local schemes. There is no
problem with that; but there is often a feeling among the boroughs that
the funding terms and conditions, which are frequently controversial at
borough level, present them with a fait accompli.</div>
					<a name="07011184000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Works as straightforward as
road widening or the installation of a pelican crossing should
ordinarily be dealt with without the need for the Member of Parliament
or the assembly member to rectify communication problems. They should
be dealt with by a local ward councillor taking up a
constituent&#146;s concern with the appropriate officers and sorting
it out. Repeatedly, and repeatedly is the problem, that does not
happen. When a matter is resolved, it seems to be dependent on the good
will of individual officers, some of whom come from borough
backgrounds, rather than on a TFL system that inculcates into the body
the need to consult and to take on board the views of elected
representatives.</div>
					<a name="07011184000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
regret that there is a feeling among TFL management that they are
answerable solely to the Mayor, and that if they are driving forward
the Mayor&#146;s policy, everything else is subordinate. That is not
a satisfactory way of doing business or of delivering those works, and
that is the major failure. The funding is important to London boroughs,
but although they can negotiate individually with TFL, at management
level they have no collective voice on the policies that underpin the
terms and conditions of their funding. They should have a voice, and
the LFEPA model would enable
it.</div>
					<a name="07011184000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the thrust
of my point. Many of us have many other examples: from major schemes to
the siting of bus stops, many of us have postbags full of consultation
problems that could be solved if there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div>were a different ethos in the organisation. The new clause would not
only produce that ethos, but enable London transport policy to move
forward on the basis of a much more effective partnership between the
Mayor and the boroughs. Both must deliver transport policy in London,
and the structure of LFEPA would enshrine that partnership more
effectively.</div>

						<a name="07011184000519"></a>
							<b class="B">Michael
Fabricant</b> (Lichfield) (Con): I did not originally intend
to take part in this debate, or indeed in any debate on the Bill,
representing as I do a Staffordshire constituency, and never ever
having been a councillor; so I assure the Committee that there will be
no discussion, as there was this morning, about the No. 433 bus route
or potholes in Brent.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07011184000520"></a>
							<b class="B">Siobhain
McDonagh</b> (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab): I want to clarify
that point: it is the No. 463 bus
route.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000521"></a>Michael
Fabricant:
						</b> I withdraw my earlier statement. It is the No.
463 bus route, which only goes to show that sometimes there is an
advantage in taking the broader perspective from
Staffordshire.</div>
					<a name="07011184000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall make just two points, which will not be about the detail of the
new clause. Some hon. Members know about my interest in broadcasting
and my service on the Select Committee on National Heritage and, later,
the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport. We constantly thought
that the BBC required protection when criticisms were made of it. There
is a direct relationship with the new clause, which I shall explain
later. The BBC needed protection because until recently it had been its
own judge and jury. I felt, as did the former excellent Chairman of the
Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the right hon. Member for
Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), that an external body should
protect the director-general, the chairman and the board of governors
of the BBC from criticism when they defended criticisms made against
the BBC because it should not be seen to be its own judge and
jury.</div>
					<a name="07011184000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall relate
an example to the clause. I do not know whether you have been in the
back of a London taxi recently, Mr. O&#146;Hara, but
whenever I have been in that position I have heard nothing but
complaints about provisions, congestion charges and other issues
directed at the Mayor. They all say that it was Ken Livingstone wot
done it and that if he were in the back of their cab, they would have
something to say to
him.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000523"></a>Michael
Fabricant:
						</b> Indeed. On one occasion at least I have heard
that said by a London taxi
driver.</div>
					<a name="07011184000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If new clause
10 were adopted, it would offer protection for the Mayor of London
whoever he or she may be. It would clearly provide an open, democratic
and easily visual system whereby decisions could be made about
London&#151;including on the congestion charge and Routemaster buses,
which we discussed this morning&#151;that would be isolated and
separated from the Mayor. For that reason alone, new clause 10 is worth
having.</div>
					<a name="07011184000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point that I want to put on the record is that, whatever we might think
of congestion charging 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div>and whether it works&#151;this morning, it certainly did not work
because there was gridlock around Westminster&#151;the organisation
in Coventry that is employed to operate congestion charging for London
is superb. I have just bought a new car. Before I am accused of being a
profligate Tory, I must say that it was the first time in 11 or 12
years that I had done so. I have had to change the number plate. There
have been all sorts of complications because of a cherished number
plate which I must say, before the hon. Member for Ealing, North says
something, was not FAB 1. For those who remember her, that was the
number plate of Lady Penelope. I am not Lady Penelope nor do I have a
pink Rolls-Royce, but my point is that the company has handled
congestion charging very well indeed.

operation of congestion charging may or may not be admirable, the way
in which it is operated in Coventry in respect of individuals is very
efficient. I felt that that should be put on the
record.</div>
					<a name="07011184000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main
argument is that without new clause 10 not only will there be a lack of
glasnost&#151;I speak as someone who worked a lot in the Soviet Union
in the &#146;80s and early &#146;90s&#151;but there will be no
protection for the current Mayor of London or future Mayors from the
many people, including cab drivers, who would perhaps sometimes
unreasonably like to string him or her
up.</div>

						</b> The late Neville Chamberlain was always accused of
looking at life through the wrong end of a municipal drainpipe. The
hon. Gentleman is clearly looking at life from the perspective of the
back seat of a cab. I assure him that there has been only one time in
London&#146;s history when cab drivers have been united in their
support of any political figure&#151;and that was Ken Livingstone in
his early years when he allowed night pricing. Congestion charging was
also supported by the cab trade, but I appeal to the hon. Gentleman not
always to listen to all cab drivers. They speak sense and with great
wisdom most of the time but, by and large, opposition runs deep in
their veins. Such opposition is very often not directed at an
individual, but is a matter of
principle.</div>

						</b> Clause 18 removes the prohibition of the
appointment of political representatives as members of TFL. It is
important that the Mayor is able to nominate to the board the best
candidates to represent the interests of those living and travelling in
London, which the clause ensures by providing the Mayor with the
opportunity to nominate appropriate political representatives,
including borough and assembly representatives. The Department for
Transport has separately consulted on whether to give the Mayor greater
influence over rail services beyond the GLA boundary. There is a
provision in the Railways Act 2005 to ensure that, if that is taken
forward, the Mayor will appoint to the board at least two additional
members, who may be political representatives for areas outside London,
to represent the interests of rail users from their areas. An
announcement is expected on that shortly.</div>
					<a name="07011184000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 10, which was tabled
by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, seeks to provide a different model
of membership for the TFL board. It would prescribe that membership was
limited to assembly members and borough nominations, which would not
strike the balance that he mentioned during his contribution today. The
clause would also exclude the Mayor from the board and from its chair.
We strongly resist that change. The restrictions could affect the
delivery of the decent transport system that London requires. For that
reason, I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the new
clause.</div>

McDonagh:
						</b> I welcome the clause, which allows the Mayor
responsibility to look at health inequalities across London. I fear
that the way in which the NHS is currently organised is deficient in
taking into account all areas within London and in appreciating the
effect that something done in one primary care trust might have on a
hospital in another.</div>
					<a name="07011184000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am saddened and disappointed that the powers given in the clause are
not larger. I should be grateful if the Minister would consider whether
in future the Mayor might also have the right to be consulted on any
hospital reconfiguration project that occurs in the London area. Areas
of health inequality within a primary care trust&#151;generally a
combination of five or six constituencies&#151;can often be quite
small, and the people who live there are often not represented on any
health boards, be they those of the primary care trusts or of the
hospitals. They need a voice and need to be listened to; the Mayor can
provide that function, as he can for any plan to close a hospital in
the London area, which has an immediate impact on neighbouring
hospitals.</div>
					<a name="07011184000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my own
area, consideration is being given to whether a critical care hospital
should be placed on the current St. Helier site&#151;which I stress
is not in my constituency, but in that of the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington, but serves half of my constituency. The
possible movement of that hospital, even only a few miles away, will
have a drastic impact on the ability of St. George&#146;s in Tooting,
the Mayday in Croydon and Kingston hospital to
function.</div>

while the NHS is superbly equipped to carry out its job of providing
health for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div>population, the structure has a democratic deficit? That is, the NHS is
not so well equipped to carry out large reconfigurations that involve
public consultation and taking account of the strong feelings that
there might be in an area. Giving the Mayor an automatic right to be
consulted on such cases would introduce a much-needed sense of
political representation and accountability into a system that was
never really designed so. My hon. Friend and I share a local hospital
trust, which, while very good, does not have much experience of
carrying out such large
consultations.</div>

								Siobhain
McDonagh:
						</b> I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend.
Unlike what appears to be the direction of travel of the Front Benches
of the Government and the Opposition, I believe that there is need for
a greater democratisation of the health service, not less. If people
democratically had responsibility for the health service, our hospitals
would not sometimes be dirty, but always clean, because that would
determine the life of the elected officials or politicians and whether
they were going to be re-elected or not. I appreciate that that is a
radical view for this particular matter, but I believe that the clause
is a step in the right direction. I urge my Government to consider
allowing the Mayor to have responsibility for considering all hospital
reconfigurations, because of London&#146;s densely populated nature
and the huge impact that a decision made miles away can have on
everyone&#146;s health service.</div>

apologising for not being here earlier because I had to attend a
private event in my constituency.</div>
					<a name="07011184000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the clause, but I
also support what the hon. Lady has just said. It is clear that a
health inequalities strategy devised by the Mayor has every prospect of
being totally derailed by decisions taken on hospital reconfigurations.
Had her amendment been selected, I would have spoken in favour of it
too. She referred to our local hospital&#151;St. Helier&#151;which
is located in an area of great health need. There is a prospect that it
might go in the hospital reconfiguration, and if that were to happen,
the impact on any health inequalities strategy drawn up by the Mayor
would be huge. If he is not involved in consultations, his health
inequalities strategy becomes almost
meaningless.</div>
					<a name="07011184000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady might say that we could take this even further, because the
consultation could be extended to local authorities. However, that is
outside the remit of the Bill and of this debate. I support the clause,
but the Mayor should be given greater powers to be involved with the
key decisions so as to provide a first step in terms of democratic
accountability in an area of major service provision that is singularly
lacking in
it.</div>

								Mr.
Andrew Pelling</b> (Croydon, Central) (Con): It is a great
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. I support the comments made by the hon. Members for
Mitcham and Morden, for Battersea and for Carshalton and Wallington,
because this Bill was an opportunity to go further in terms of the
responsibility of London&#146;s governance. That is not to deny the
excellence of the clauses that we are discussing. I know that there is
a variation in life expectancy of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 117</div>more than 10 years between one part of my borough of Croydon and
another. That loss for the people whom we represent is an important
consideration and should be an important consideration for
London&#146;s governance.</div>
					<a name="07011184000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important for the
Committee to know that Conservative Members would go further than the
proposals suggested so far; we should have confidence in
London&#146;s governance, and NHS London should be run by the Mayor
and the Greater London authority. There has been a tremendous amount of
change in the strategic health authority organisation in London. It was
a confusing process in terms of having a sub-regional structure. Given
the move to NHS London, it would have made a great deal of sense for
that power to have gone to London&#146;s governance as part of the
process.</div>
					<a name="07011184000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the Government must have told the Mayor that there was no way that he
was going to get his hands on NHS London, but there has been a great
deal of talk about accountability. Even Members of Parliament have
frustrations in understanding the opaqueness in the governance of our
health services in London. One of the great benefits of the
reintroduction of London&#146;s governance is the ability to quiz the
Mayor for two and a half hours every month. There could be an
opportunity for London&#146;s representatives to ask questions,
through the London assembly, on important issues such as St. Helier
hospital, which was raised by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden,
although the hospital is located in the constituency of the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington. Perhaps the democratic process
represented by many thousands of people marching to save that hospital
would have found its way of being communicated through London&#146;s
governance much more effectively had NHS London been within the London
power
structure.</div>

					<a name="07011184000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd
to propose so many responsibilities for the Mayor to drive forward the
health inequalities strategy, but in previous clauses to provide for
health advisers to address it through a separate process run by NHS
London, which would denude the Mayor of the power to improve
London&#146;s health. I am sure that much of the local governance
legislation that passed through this House over 120 years ago concerned
public health. It was seen to be important then that city leaders
involved themselves in that matter, and we too should have confidence
in
them.</div>

also to speak in that debate. It would be interesting to see which
members of the Labour party take that view because, as she rightly
pointed out, the Treasury and the Chancellor seem to think that were

new powers that the Bill will bestow on the Mayor could impact on
health and health inequalities. The Mayor must collaborate and
co-operate with the health adviser in preparing or revising the health
inequalities strategy and have regard to any guidance given by the
Secretary of State. The Mayor must also consult relevant bodies likely
to be affected by the strategy. The Mayor&#146;s new powers are in
line with his strategic role and are concerned primarily with the
general health determinants that he influences or for which he is
responsible. The NHS is the national health service accountable to
Parliament, and the delivery of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div>health services will remain its responsibility. The Mayor will meet
regularly with the health adviser as well as the chief executive of the
London strategic health authority, which will provide an opportunity
for regular discussions on major health issues of strategic importance
to London.</div>
					<a name="07011184000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">A mechanism
for consulting the Mayor has been established in a memorandum of

has set the national policy framework within which the NHS must
operate. Any future reconfiguration in London will also have to comply
with the principles outlined in NHS London&#146;s plan,
&#147;Health Care for London: A Framework for Action&#148;. The
Mayor and his health advisers are working together to ensure that the
London framework and the Mayor&#146;s health inequalities strategy
are developed in tandem and are consistent and
complementary.</div>

					<a name="07011184000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
is clear from our debate earlier, there is substantial consensus among
Committee members that the Mayor should enjoy powers to address health
inequality. It is important to ensure that such powers are exercised as
effectively as possible. The amendment would ensure that the democratic
deficit alluded to by the hon. Member for Battersea is addressed even
more comprehensively. It would ensure that, although the Mayor has the
power to develop a strategy, the assembly will have the power to amend
it. On the principle that two heads are better than one, 26 are surely
better than one.</div>
					<a name="07011184000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we talk about inequality with regard to the NHS, some people might be
tempted to ask whether that is the most important factor. Would
reducing inequalities in the NHS mean aiming at one target rather than
concentrating on others? Dealing with inequalities in health outcomes
is a vital measure of how successful the NHS
is.</div>
					<a name="07011184000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the
Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) recently attracted a degree of
controversy by mentioning that, on poverty, Polly Toynbee might have a
better way with a metaphor than Winston Churchill. He was correct,
because Polly Toynbee&#146;s metaphor of the caravan moving through
the desert applies to the NHS as powerfully as it does to any other
collective organisation seeking to deal with inequalities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div>in our society. Her arresting metaphor was intended to demonstrate or
underline that it is important that, as a society makes progress, it
does so in such a way that the gap between those at the top and those
at the bottom does not become too great, because if it does there are
problems.</div>
					<a name="07011184000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past,
some Conservatives have argued, when asked about their commitment to
social justice, that all that matters is that a rising tide lifts all
boats and the difference between people does not or need not matter so
much. This Committee sitting gives me the opportunity to stress
something that I am anxious to get across, which is that we
Conservatives believe that poverty can be measured in both relative and
absolute terms and that, on the NHS and its founding principles, the
way in which the NHS provides a guarantee of a base level of treatment
to all, regardless of income, is a vital way of ensuring social
cohesion and social justice. In that respect, the Mayor&#146;s health
strategy is right, since he has a specific responsibility to address
inequality.</div>
					<a name="07011184000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
the hon. Members for Battersea and for Mitcham and Morden talked about
the need to give people a voice in shaping the future of the NHS. Our
amendment would give those who serve on the GLA an opportunity to
influence the Mayor&#146;s strategy. I suspect that the Mayor himself
would welcome this change. It is certainly a change that the assembly
seeks.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000565"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will correct me
if I am wrong, but I thought that, when the assembly considered this
matter on 6 December 2006, it voted against that and said that it did
not want this additional power. That was a minuted meeting of a full
assembly.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000566"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for
Croydon, Central, who serves on the assembly, that there is an appetite
among assembly members for the chance to influence the strategy.
Extending this power to the assembly would be in its interest.
Politicians occasionally feel that they are overburdened, but I cannot
imagine that any part of policy is more important than the future of
the NHS and I cannot imagine anyone who is better fitted to influence
the Mayor when it comes to adopting this strategy than my hon. Friends
the Members for Bromley and Chislehurst and for Croydon, Central. In
fact, both my hon. Friends have mentioned that the need for a greater
degree of public involvement in shaping health strategies lies behind
an amendment that they have tabled on a different part of the Bill. The
power to shape or influence that strategy would be useful because of
the scale of the health challenges faced by Londoners. London has
specific problems that would be best addressed by the collective
endeavour of all those involved in the assembly, as well as the
Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07011184000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Labour
party rewrote clause IV of its manifesto, the authors of the rewritten
clause IV said that we achieve more by collective endeavour than on our
own. It is in that spirit that this amendment is
tabled.</div>

							<a name="07011184000569"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> There probably is a waiting list for membership of
the Ealing, North Labour party, but I suspect that the Battersea Labour
party has its doors wide open to welcome anyone. I merely wish to point
out that the logic of the Labour party&#146;s constitution would
suggest that members, whether they are serving on the GLA or this
Committee, might look favourably on this
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07011184000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that
it is through common endeavour that we can come up with better
solutions. The scale of the challenges facing NHS London is
significant. London has the highest level of sexually transmitted
infection and the fastest growth in HIV infection of any region in the
United Kingdom. That raises specific health challenges and those are
concentrated not exclusively but disproportionately in particular
geographical and socio-economic sets of the population. Having the
wider spread of voices that the GLA can provide to help the Mayor shape
his strategy will ensure that that concern is
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07011184000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another growing concern, which all of us who are concerned about the
health of Londoners have to address too, and that is the growth in
respiratory infections. Tuberculosis, which many of us would have
suspected was a disease that our grandparents knew but had been
banished from our lifetimes, has returned. It is inevitably associated
both with overcrowding and with migratory flows and is concentrated in
the east end of London.</div>
					<a name="07011184000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Mayor has taken an interest
in the health and welfare of the citizens of the east end of London but
it would be entirely appropriate if those who represent that area in
the GLA&#151;and others who take an interest in health&#151;were
also able to bring their expertise to bear when it came to shaping the
strategy.</div>
					<a name="07011184000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
migratory flows. One of the reasons for London&#146;s success is that
it has been a city that is in every respect open for business. It has
been a uniquely welcoming global city for people who have come here and
contributed their skills, expertise and knowledge. However, we have to
acknowledge that not only have economic benefits been brought, but new
health challenges have arisen. The migratory flows have helped the NHS
because many of the people who work in it and on whom we rely for care
are new British citizens. We welcome that but it would be wrong to omit
the fact that along with all the benefits that these changes have
brought, there are new challenges. In order to address them
effectively, we believe that it would be appropriate to have the range
of voices that the GLA can provide to help shape the
strategy.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000570"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. Gentleman
because&#151;it pains me to say this&#151;he talks a great deal of
sense. His point about the changes in the health profile in London is
well made. However, in reference to the amendment to which he is
speaking, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>can tell him that in my borough of Ealing, particularly in the Southall
area of the constituency, we do have a problem with tuberculosis and it
is addressed by community representation on the primary care trust, on
the board and at public meetings and through elected representatives
from the council in partnership with the primary care trust. May I try
to convince him that where such a problem exists, as it does in my part
of my world, we have the democratic avenues to bring that to the
attention of the people who provide the cures and the treatments, and
that we do not seek the additional power that he is proposing
today?</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000571"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point. I am sure
that those dedicated professionals and others who collaborated in the
work of the PCT that covers his area and also cover Ealing, Southall
have done an exemplary job in addressing these new health
challenges.</div>
					<a name="07011184000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">However
the point that I was about to make in summing up is that the NHS has
had to endure a series of reorganisations under this Government. It
endured a series of reorganisations under the past Conservative
Government but let us look particularly at this
Government.</div>
					<a name="07011184000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
series of reorganisations has seen, for example, the abolition of
smaller-scale PCTs and their consolidation into larger PCTs. There
might be efficiency gains but there is also inevitably a loss of
accountability and closeness to those people who are most affected. One
thing that our amendment seeks to do is to reintroduce a degree of
accountability into one part of the strategic leadership of the
NHS.</div>
					<a name="07011184000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
consequences of reorganisation within the NHS is that individuals have
often had to apply, reapply and then reapply for the same job. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) at the
Conservative Party conference recently pointed out that the individual
who is currently director for public health for the south west has been
doing the same job since 1997 but has had to reapply for it at least
seven times.</div>
					<a name="07011184000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
previous clauses in this Bill will ensure that the current director for
public health for London becomes the Mayor&#146;s health adviser. I
suspect that that individual will carry on doing an admirable job but
once again that individual will be forced to jump through another
reorganisational
hoop.</div>
					<a name="07011184000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consequence
of these reorganisations has tended to be&#151;particularly in the
past two years&#151;a drift away from local involvement in and local
control over the provision of health services. As the scale of the
challenges faced by the NHS increases&#151;the funds available to it
face additional pressures and it moves away from local
people&#151;this simple amendment would allow a re-injection of local
voices back into the process of setting health priorities. It is for
that reason that this simple amendment should recommend itself to the
Minister and indeed to the
Mayor.</div>

								Tom
Brake:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is always persuasive, as he was
in outlining his arguments for the amendment. However, I have to
announce a temporary estrangement with the official Opposition on this
subject. Clearly the Government&#146;s position is not to allow
wholesale change 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div>to the Bill. Our role is to ensure that the scrutiny function is
enhanced, as we argued in the case of confirmation hearings. Our role
is also to ensure that the basic parameters within which the Mayor and
the GLA operate are appropriate&#151;hence the debate that we had
over the budget and whether we should or should not agree a budget on a
simple majority.</div>
					<a name="07011184000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do
not particularly like the existing model of strategic government, which
we have sought to modify. Pushing through the amendment and in effect
giving the assembly the power of veto over every mayoral strategy
destroys the strategic model of government in London that one wants to
see and which we support. For the Mayor to operate in a strategic
manner would be impossible if each and every one of his strategies had
to be approved by a simple majority in the assembly. I will have to
part company with the hon. Gentleman on the amendment. If the matter is
pressed to a vote, then I may reluctantly join the larger numbers on
the other side of the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000573"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> The assembly has done good scrutiny work in the
area of health&#151;on TB, the immunisation of children, the sexual
health of young people, care for HIV sufferers, neonatal care and,
rather more controversially in the House, the cessation of smoking.
Clearly there is some confusion and controversy. I do not want to
regard myself as a messenger from the assembly&#151;I have probably
done that far too often&#151;but my understanding is that the
assembly supported all the clauses on health and health inequality, but
did not divine whether it should be involved in signing off any health
inequalities strategy of the Mayor. There has been no positive or
negative vote as the hon. Member for Ealing, North
suggested.</div>
					<a name="07011184000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in the comment by the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington. He put the role of the assembly into clear relief. Is it
there primarily to scrutinise or does it, through its representation,
have some role in securing the effort from the Executive within
London&#146;s governance in carrying its policies through the
assembly on important issues such as health? I would put it to the
Committee that, if the London assembly is purely to be a glorified
local government scrutiny committee, then expenditure of &#163;11
million per year on such a project surely cannot be justified in terms
of value for the public
purse.</div>

state:</div>

are...committed not only to keeping the Mayoralty but to enhancing
the powers of the
office.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman agrees, could he explain how he squares that with supporting
an amendment that would give the assembly a veto over any health
strategy put forward by the
Mayor?</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000575"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constructive and helpful intervention. It allows me to place on the
record the fact that Conservative Members are firmly in favour of
devolution of significant powers to London&#146;s governance, not
only those under the Bill, but direct powers over the learning and
skills council in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div>London, which has been parked into an arm&#146;s length skills
commission with a powerless effect. We are in favour of NHS London
being within the powers of the Mayor. We would go a great deal further
than the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07011184000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
we are to strengthen the powers of the Mayor, it is important to be
robust about the accountability to which he is held by the assembly. It
is depressing that in many ways so far in the debate the Government
have been dismissive of the role of the assembly as existing purely to
consider matters of general interest within London politics. If we are
to spend &#163;11 million of public money in such a way, we must ask
ourselves whether the process of putting together an assembly for that
rather minor role is good value in respect of the expenditure of public
money.</div>

the ability of politicians, whether in London&#146;s governance or
elsewhere, to discuss and negotiate. So far the response from the Mayor
under that strong mayoral model is that he has been elected, he decides
what happens and he can ignore what people say. We are in great danger
of creating a structure in which the mayoral model is far too strong.
If we are to invest so much money, &#163;11 million a year, taking
into account all the salaries&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]&#151;</i>one
of which I admit that I am taking, we must give the assembly more teeth
to hold a Mayor to

sharpening up the role of the assembly to ensure that the Mayor has due
regard to the comments that assembly members make in helping to develop
strategies during
consultation.</div>
					<a name="07011184000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Mayor is responsible for producing eight statutory strategies. The Bill
makes provision for a further four. The assembly has an important role
in developing those strategies. We have already included provision
under clause 2 to sharpen up the assembly&#146;s role in policy
development. The clause places an explicit requirement on the Mayor to
have regard to the assembly&#146;s comments and those of the
functional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 126</div>bodies in response to consultation. It also requires the Mayor to write
to the assembly identifying which comments he accepts and, when he does
not, the reasons for not accepting its
recommendations.</div>

not believe that the assembly&#146;s powers should be extended
further to allow it to approve the Mayor&#146;s strategies. That
would risk blurring the clear lines of accountability for the

should be if the assembly does not approve a strategy. We ask that the

							<a name="07011184000585"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I rise to oppose the changes suggested in the
clauses. It is important to recognise that of all the functional
bodies, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, LFEPA,
attracts the least controversy. One reason is that it is one of the
most effective&#151;I note that in a previous career, the Minister
was the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. I suspect that
LFEPA attracts so little controversy because of the high regard in
which firefighters are held throughout the country, but also because of
its effective method of working. The suggested changes would alter that
method of working in a way that we believe might open the door to less
efficient prosecution of its
duties.</div>
					<a name="07011184000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are three particular areas of suggested change about which we have
concerns. The first is the membership of LFEPA. It was originally
proposed that the accountable element of LFEPA&#146;s membership
should be diluted. At the moment, LFEPA has a balance of borough and
assembly representatives who work successfully together. As the
Conservatives have pointed out during debate on previous clauses, the
model of consensual work that characterises LFEPA&#146;s operation
was acknowledged by both the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for
Bromley and Chislehurst.</div>
					<a name="07011184000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The original plan was to remove
two borough and two assembly members. Happily, that has been diluted,
and we will now lose one of each, but it still seems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 127</div>wrong to deprive LFEPA of the benefits of its current constitution,
because that precise mix ensures, more or less, that every area of
London has someone to speak for it, whether an assembly member or a
borough representative. There is a risk that certain geographical areas
might fall off the end if the change is made. More broadly, if it is
made, we will lose the rationale that governs the inclusive nature of
LFEPA&#146;s operation. The two individuals lost will be replaced by
individuals appointed by the Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07011184000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The rationale
for mayoral appointments seems questionable. The point has been made
that the two new members should be appointed partly to meet diversity
criteria and partly to ensure a better relationship with business, so
that business takes more account of the need for fire safety,
resilience and emergency planning. In the first case, diversity should
rightly be a matter for political parties. All political parties are
now addressing the issue, and London is an area in which they have all
been successful to a greater or lesser extent in addressing diversity
within their own ranks. Therefore, having representatives who are
assembly or borough members can meet the diversity criteria more
effectively than simple patronage from the Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07011184000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the idea that we need
to appoint someone so that business meets its obligations more
effectively seems a complete misunderstanding of how LFEPA should
operate. Appointing someone to the board from business, however
enlightened, will not necessarily mean that other businesses or
institutions operating in the commercial arena will take any more heed
of what LFEPA says. It seems to us that it is for LFEPA
itself&#151;its members and those who work with it&#151;to make the
case for improved planning to deal with fire risk, improve resilience
and manage emergency planning. LFEPA already does a good job, but if
there is a feeling in the GLA or elsewhere that it needs to raise its
game in those respects, the current composition should address that.
Attempting to amend the current composition will not address that
concern more
effectively.</div>
					<a name="07011184000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
particularly concerned about what is proposed in respect of the power
of mayoral direction to LFEPA. Because of the consensual way in which
LFEPA works, the use of mayoral direction powers suggests that it has
been incapable of resolving a problem and that the Mayor comes in to
cut the Gordian knot. In such circumstances, there is an implied threat
to LFEPA&#146;s accountability. More than that, however, individuals
in LFEPA who might wish to operate to an agenda dictated by the Mayor
could act as a fifth column, disrupting the currently effective
consensual working of LFEPA and hoping that the Mayor&#146;s powers
of direction might subsequently be exercised to favour a minority over
the existing consensus. It would not be appropriate for the
Mayor&#146;s powers to be exercised in such circumstances. That is
why we have tabled an amendment, which may be taken as a new clause
later, that would give the assembly the power to call in certain
mayoral directions. We accept that in rare circumstances a power of
mayoral direction might be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07011184000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acknowledge that mayoral direction has been used, for example, with the
London Development Agency or Transport for London in preparing for the
Olympics, to instil a sense of common purpose for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>project that the majority of Londoners considered vital. We can envisage
circumstances&#151;if, for example, there were a terrorist atrocity
again&#151;where a power of mayoral direction might be appropriate
for LFEPA. After 9/11 in America, the strong mayor model, exemplified
by Mayor Giuliani in New York, was effective in dealing with problems
consequent on that horrific
attack.</div>
					<a name="07011184000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can all
conceive of circumstances where a strong Mayor here may need to use a
power of mayoral direction with LFEPA to deal with emergencies. In such
circumstances, a responsible GLA will not exercise its call-in power,
because it would recognise the importance of letting the Mayor and
LFEPA get on with the job. However, giving the assembly that call-in
power would ensure that the Mayor would exercise it responsibly. Unless
the Minister says that it is appropriate to grant the assembly that
call-in power, we are chary about extending to the Mayor, willy-nilly,
this power of
direction.</div>
					<a name="07011184000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our reasons
for expressing concerns about the clauses relate to the current
composition of LFEPA, the weak reasons being given for the change of
membership and our concerns about the potential misuse or inadequate
scrutiny of the Mayor&#146;s power of direction in specific
circumstances. I would be grateful if the Minister addressed those
concerns.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000586"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I support the points made by the hon. Gentleman.
The information that I have received about LFEPA suggests that it
functions well and has a local government-inspired culture of openness
which, according to my contact, contrasts with that of TFL and the LDA.
I am told that its budget is one of the most robust, because its local
authority input provides a more active degree of scrutiny than might
otherwise have
applied.</div>
					<a name="07011184000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
information that I have received suggests, as the hon. Gentleman said,
that this measure may be about trying to ensure that the ethnic
minority representation on LFEPA is correct. There may be other, more
effective, ways of achieving the degree of balance that the Minister is
rightly seeking than simply switching places from local authorities and
assembly members to the Mayor. The method being used to achieve that
balance is not appropriate. I shall listen carefully to what the
Minister says, but he will have to work hard to convince me that
I&#151;and the official Opposition&#151;should support these
clauses
today.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000587"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The clause, which amends paragraph 1 of
schedule 28 to the Greater London Authority Act 1999, changes the
composition of LFEPA and gives it wider powers in the appointment of
the authority members. It enables the Mayor to appoint the 17-member
board as follows: eight assembly members, currently nine, seven London
borough nominees, currently eight, and two further new members
appointed by the Mayor on his own nomination who are intended to
represent stakeholders who are other than elected politicians. The hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington mentioned the prospect of someone
from the black minority ethnic community being nominated, which is an
option that would be open to the Mayor.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div>
					<a name="07011184000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause
also makes consequential amendments to ensure that the Mayor&#146;s
appointment of eight assembly members continues to reflect the
political balance of the prevailing parties in the assembly. It makes
consequential amendments requiring the Mayor to fill any occurring
vacancy of mayoral representatives on the authority as soon as
reasonably
possible.</div>
					<a name="07011184000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 26
removes the constraints imposed on a chair or vice-chair of LFEPA who
is also an assembly member in respect of receiving allowances for
carrying out those roles. This change reflects the initial
responsibilities of being chair or vice-chair of the authority. The
Government believe that assembly members should not be prohibited from
receiving an allowance in respect of those offices.</div>
					<a name="07011184000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause 27
inserts new sections 328A and 328B to the 1999 Act. The clause provides
power for the Mayor, under new section 328A, to issue directions and
guidance to the authority. In issuing any directions and guidance, the
Mayor must have regard to the fire and rescue national framework and
other fire safety enforcement guidance. That will give the Mayor more
influence over delivery while ensuring that the arrangements for LFEPA
remain broadly compatible with those for fire and rescue authorities
elsewhere.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000588"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> If, for instance, clause 27 was passed, giving the
Mayor the power of direction, why does the hon. Gentleman believe that
it would be necessary for the Mayor to appoint his own people to
LFEPA?</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000589"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> It is our view that the LFEPA board should
have its membership widened to include those other than local authority
representatives. We partly discussed that earlier in respect of the TFL
board&#151;whether there should be outside people on it and it should
be exclusively local authority or assembly representation.</div>
					<a name="07011184000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that it would add to
the experience and ability of the LFEPA board to continue with the
undoubted success that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Surrey
Heath in respect of discharging its duties and which the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst knows better than any of us, having been a
senior figure and leader of the authority over many years and well
respected within the fire community for the role that he has played. We
believe that bringing in other than local authority representatives
would assist the board in its ability to discharge its duties. As I was
saying, this will give the Mayor more influence over delivery while
ensuring that the arrangements for LFEPA remain broadly compatible with
those for fire and rescue authorities
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07011184000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause
27 includes a power for the Secretary of State in the new section 328B
of the 1999 Act to direct the Mayor to revise or revoke the guidance or
directions given to LFEPA that he considers inconsistent with the fire
and rescue national framework or fire safety enforcement guidance. The
purpose of that reserve power is to ensure that if the guidance or
direction issued by the Mayor to LFEPA is inconsistent with that issued
by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State can direct the Mayor
to remove their inconsistency. That will ultimately ensure that the
guidance or directions issued by the Mayor do not conflict with policy
requirements 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div>and guidance at a national level. That should remove any difficulty in
following through decisions that will derive from risk assessment and
will enable the Mayor to direct the authority either on operational or
management matters, such as moving towards shared services with other
functional bodies, such as the Metropolitan Police Authority in
particular.</div>
					<a name="07011184000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Member for Surrey Heath promoted me above my rank. I was not
general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union but a senior lay official
in London, which was several ranks
below.</div>

					<a name="07011184000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the burden of our arguments,

striking that both we and the Liberal Democrats are anxious to remove
the extension of the Mayor&#146;s planning powers, because they will
be extended at the boroughs&#146; expense. It is our united view on
this side of the Committee that any growth in the Mayor&#146;s powers
should not take place at the boroughs&#146;
expense.</div>
					<a name="07011184000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions are more complex in that respect and more open to debate,
and we acknowledge that. They imply a devolution of power downwards to
the Mayor. We accept that that could be a good thing in many respects,
but we have certain concerns, which are embodied in the amendments. We
hope that they precipitate a useful discussion and some clarification
from the Minister. I hope that they also provide an opportunity for my
hon. Friends and other hon. Members to raise their concerns about what
is envisaged.</div>
					<a name="07011184000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments would ensure that London&#146;s housing policy was as
devolutionary as possible and that that power was exercised at the
lowest possible level. The amendments serve two functions: they welcome
the idea that the Mayor should develop his own housing strategy and
liberate him in one regard more than would the Government. The Bill
places a series of constraints on the Mayor in the development 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div>of his housing strategy that will allow his hands to be tied by the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. One principle
that we believe is important in devolution is that policy innovation
should be allowed in different areas of the United Kingdom. We also
believe that those responsible for shaping strategies or delivering
policy should have the opportunity to do so in a way that conforms with
the priorities of those they
represent.</div>
					<a name="07011184000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our
concerns about housing policy&#151;not just in London, but
nationally&#151;is that national targets and criteria, however
well-intentioned their conception, have been applied in blanket
fashion, causing housing policy that may have been conceived in a part
of the United Kingdom for which it is appropriate to be applied in
another part for which it is wholly inappropriate. For that reason, we
want to allow the Mayor to become more of a pioneer and less of an
agent of central Government in developing his strategy. I hope that
those Labour Back Benchers who welcome the idea of giving the Mayor
more powers, such as the hon. Members for Ealing, North, for
Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North and for Battersea, will look
warmly on the liberating potential of our
amendments.</div>

to enhance the Mayor&#146;s powers, wherever appropriate, in a way
that leaves power to flow from central Government to the Mayor,

occasionally bristle at Wandsworth&#146;s success and think,
&#147;If only a Labour Mayor were implementing those policies and
taking the credit, I could feel happier.&#148; I empathise with him

Planning to intervene, because that was the only way to get any

of service that they received. I am sure he is aware that social
housing in Wandsworth is in many, although not all, respects run by the
council. It would be interesting for Labour Members to consider that
some of the most effective housing still in council hands is in the
hands of Conservative councils. Once again, that underlines the point

housing stock in its area, through its hidden homes initiative and
through investment and renovation, underlines its commitment not just
to its existing social tenants, but to other tenants who have been on
its housing list and have been housed successfully. The hon. Gentleman
should bear it in mind that the social mix in Wandsworth is such that
it has been uniquely successful in combining the building of mixed
communities and support for vulnerable people who may
need&#151;through social housing or private rented
accommodation&#151;an alternative to the competitive
market.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, which
refers to one of the Government&#146;s semantic problems in defining
&#147;affordable housing&#148;. The Government have chosen to use
the term &#147;affordable housing&#148; to refer not just to
housing for social rent, but to low-cost home ownership schemes, which
has meant that any shared-equity or shared-ownership scheme qualifies
as affordable housing. I suspect that we both support more low-cost
home ownership schemes, as well as improved and enhanced housing for
social rent. However, we must recognise that, in London, the cost of
some of those schemes can be
prohibitive.</div>

significant. I remind him that low-cost home ownership schemes and
affordable homes were allegedly built in Hammersmith and Fulham when
the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush was leader of
that council that were selling for &#163;750,000. The attempt to make
a partisan point against Wandsworth council backfires because
Hammersmith and Fulham, like Wandsworth, was caught by the wide
semantic net for affordable housing that the Government have
created.</div>

problem that I would like the hon. Gentleman to comment on is the fact
that my borough, which is a no-overall-control Conservative borough, is
taking increasingly oppositional stances towards the introduction of
shared ownership schemes, particularly those for new home owners. Is
that the right direction to take?</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for drawing such
matters to my attention. I shall pay closer attention than hitherto to
the new housing policy for which Merton council is
responsible.</div>
					<a name="07011184000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the hon. Lady, I wish first to set out an overall point of
principle. We are arguing that local councils should set housing
policies and that they should be accountable to their electorate for
those policies through the ballot box. If the new Conservative-led
council is pursuing a housing policy that is out of sympathy or keeping
with the needs of the community, it will pay a price at the ballot box
in much the same way as the Labour party in Hammersmith and Fulham paid
such a heavy price last time
round.</div>
					<a name="07011184000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for shared
ownership schemes, let us consider the Government&#146;s social
homebuy scheme. Conservative Councillor Kim Humphreys in Southwark has
been one of the most enthusiastic champions of social homebuy. We know
from written answers that the Minister has had painfully to acknowledge
in the House that the number of homes sold under social homebuy has
increased from one in the summer to a massive five. The homes under
social homebuy have often been made available as a direct result of the
championing of Conservatives, rather than Labour councillors. The
Government&#146;s record in respect of low-cost home ownership is
&#147;could do better&#148;, while the Conservative record is
&#147;wherever possible, champion
it&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011184000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may
hear more about such matters in the debate, but with the Conservative
takeover in Hammersmith and Fulham, the emphasis on making low-cost
home ownership schemes work better will receive significant impetus. I
am sure that members of the Committee would want to note it in their
diaries that in February Hammersmith and Fulham will reveal more about
its plans to help low-cost home ownership schemes take off in that part
of west
London.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush)
(Lab): It will be better if I comment in some detail, because
the hon. Gentleman mentioned me in respect of low-cost home ownership
under the previous Labour council. I had to ask two colleagues to
repeat what he had said because I did not believe it the first time I
was told. The Labour administration in Hammersmith and Fulham built a
high percentage of affordable rented housing and some shared-ownership
housing. That is different from what the current Conservative
administration is doing, which is minimising the housing for those in
the most severe need and cynically building only shared-ownership
housing that it knows is out reach of most people in housing
need.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000636"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for attempting
to justify his record, but for his benefit in particular, and for that
of the Committee, I shall repeat what I said. The hon. Member for
Battersea said that shared ownership homes in Wandsworth were being
marketed at a price that suggested that they were beyond the reach of
many of those Londoners whom we would think were the targets for
affordable housing. My argument was that Imperial wharf&#151;one of
the developments undertaken when Labour ran 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div>Hammersmith and Fulham&#151;had flats that were marketed at an even
more exorbitant price, yet they still qualified as affordable housing
because they were shared-ownership
properties.</div>
					<a name="07011184000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I was making is that the definition of affordable housing is
semantically elastic, which is a consequence of how the Government
defined affordable housing in the first place. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>
The Minister for Housing and Planning says from a sedentary position
that that is up to the council, which only reinforces my point that if
the hon. Member for Battersea wishes to criticise Wandsworth&#151;he
may or he may not&#151;then in the same light, Hammersmith and
Fulham, under Labour, is open to the same criticism. However, at this
point, I have no desire to revisit the whole question of Imperial
wharf, which has been laboured. I suspect that Hammersmith and Fulham
residents took a view on Imperial wharf, and indeed on the housing
policy pursued by the Labour authority, at the last borough
election.</div>
					<a name="07011184000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
boroughs&#151;as we know and has been acknowledged in the
debate&#151;play a key role in housing delivery. They have a
statutory obligation to meet homelessness requirements and to meet
decent homes standards, and for that reason they are the principal
engines of delivery in housing. Of course, we have moved from a
municipal model of delivering social housing to a more plural one
through the changes that we have seen&#151;not just council houses
moving into private hands, but stock transfer and the growth in the
number of socially rented homes that are managed by registered social
landlords and housing
associations.</div>
					<a name="07011184000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
when it comes, for example, to negotiating with the DCLG for money for
arm&#146;s length management organisations, deciding how allocation
policies are to work within constraints set down by central Government
or meeting the decent homes standards, it is the boroughs that deliver.
Strikingly, as I said earlier, it is Conservative boroughs that deliver
better.</div>
					<a name="07011184000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes
to housing completions&#151;this is a point that I made on Second
Reading&#151;Conservative boroughs perform consistently better. There
are exceptions to the rule, such as Greenwich, for unique reasons.
However, the Conservative record in delivering high-quality housing, on
time and completed in a way that not just satisfies but exceeds
Government targets, is pretty
impressive.</div>
					<a name="07011184000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">One other
thing that I would say about Conservative boroughs in
London&#151;indeed, about all London boroughs&#151;is that there is
a broad consensus on the need for more housing overall and for more
affordable housing. There is a legitimate argument, and one that I will
return to in greater detail, about how the proportion should be
managed. However, there is, as well as a consensus between Front
Benchers on the importance of increasing housing supply overall, a
broad consensus within London.</div>
					<a name="07011184000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at the dynamic way that
a Conservative borough such as Barnet is attempting to address housing
need, one can see some of the most innovative pioneers considering new
methods of financing&#151;for example, investigating how a bond might
work. It is Conservative councils that are looking at new ways to get
the private sector to collaborate with them to provide that
housing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div>
					<a name="07011184000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Our specific
concerns about the Government&#146;s amendment relate to how the
success of the boroughs, to which I briefly alluded, and their direct
responsibility, which everyone acknowledges, could be affected by the
Mayor having, in effect, the power of direction over how the London
housing pot is spent. We want to know how we can ensure that this or a
future Mayor adequately takes account of the diverse needs of all
London boroughs and does not pay disproportionate regard to any of his
pet projects.</div>
					<a name="07011184000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all
know that this Mayor&#151;for example, in how he has sought to target
certain councils&#151;has, as it were, a hit list. Referring again to
Hammersmith and Fulham, it recently wanted to bring forward a
development, which would have increased the housing supply in that area
and helped to address the broader housing affordability problems that
we face. However, the Mayor directed refusal of that application. Fair
enough. We can argue the merits: I think he was wrong, he thinks he was
right. What was striking was the way that the Mayor invoked the shade
of Shirley Porter. Hammersmith and Fulham was increasing housing supply
in its area, which it was elected to
do&#151;</div>

Gove:
						</b> I will allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene in a
second.</div>
					<a name="07011184000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The council
was doing something that it was elected to do and that we all recognise
as wise, but because the proportion of affordable housing in that
development was not exactly right in the Mayor&#146;s terms, he said
no, it cannot go ahead. As a result, what happens? The affordability
crisis in Hammersmith and Fulham is not addressed and affordable homes,
which would have been built, have been delayed. Again, deciding on the
merits of the scheme is up to Members here, and indeed the electors of
Hammersmith and
Fulham.</div>
					<a name="07011184000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Mayor, in
the way that he regards housing policy, has shown that his own ideology
and taste can influence his thinking. We need to know, when we come to
the allocation of money, what safeguards there are to ensure not only
that the Mayor will do more than take casual regard of the boroughs,
but that he will take specific account of their needs. We need to know
what measure of appeal there is. What will happen if the
Mayor&#151;for arbitrary, capricious or ideological
reasons&#151;decides not to give the boroughs the allocation that
they need? How can we be certain that the Mayor will respond to their
specific
concerns?</div>
					<a name="07011184000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another point. The provision of new housing in London, including
affordable housing, to an extent depends on the planning process.
Central Government no longer allocate housing grants to local
authorities allowing them to build socially rented homes. Those
Morrisonian days, for better or for worse, have gone. What happens now,
as most Members will know, is that new housing developments depend on
particular developers finding a site, seeking planning permission and
then, as part of their obligation, providing a measure of affordable
housing.</div>
					<a name="07011184000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One
question in my mind is, what happens with a go-ahead
council&#151;Conservative, Labour or whatever&#151;that is anxious
to see development occurring? Barnet is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 138</div>case in point. It sees not just successful commercial development, but
successful residential development, and, as a proportion of that
residential development, wants affordable housing. Therefore, the
housing association, which is supposed to manage that affordable
housing, will go to the Housing Corporation to ask for money. However,
what will happen if the Mayor, in his allocation of the London housing
quota, says that north-west London can forget it and that east or south
London is his priority? What will happen if the workings of the market,
particularly strong leadership from a local borough, lead to an
expansion of housing and affordable housing in one part of London, but
the Mayor has already allocated the money from the pot elsewhere? Where
will the Housing Corporation turn in such
circumstances?</div>
					<a name="07011184000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
say that there is a deserving housing association&#151;again, for
example, in Barnet&#151;that is desperate to fulfil the affordable
housing requirement there, but it cannot, because of the Mayor&#146;s
direction that the cash should go elsewhere. What will happen in those
circumstances? Who will exercise Solomon&#146;s
judgment?</div>
					<a name="07011184000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One
other area that I should mention, as we are talking about affordable
housing and as we all accept that its provision is vital for London, is
the vexed question of the Mayor&#146;s threshold. As we are all
aware, the Mayor has produced a particular threshold to ensure that
there is greater provision of social housing. The London plan says that
all developments of 15 units or more should include affordable
housing. That is a lower threshold than prevails in other parts of the
country. We can all think of good reasons why that should be so, but
there are, curiously, perverse
consequences.</div>
					<a name="07011184000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
recent issue of <i class="I">Inside Housing</i>&#151;8 December
2006&#151;some survey work by London Development Research shows a
spike in the number of applications for housing development with fewer
than 15 units, then a rapid falling off thereafter. Developers are
clearly attempting to get round the Mayor&#146;s affordable housing
obligation. Why? They recognise that sometimes that affordable housing
obligation can make uneconomic a development that might in other
circumstances have been
economic.</div>
					<a name="07011184000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My
contention is that the precise balance that should be struck to ensure
the maximum number of new homes, both affordable and market, depends on
the circumstances in each borough. The Government almost half
acknowledge that. By acknowledging that there should be a separate
threshold in London, distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom, they
recognise that the London housing market is different. Why do we not
recognise, as is obvious, that the sub-regional market in north-west
London is very different from that in east London? The requirements for
affordable housing thresholds and percentages might well need to be
different in both those areas and could be better managed by the local
authorities, which are already working successfully in sub-regional
partnerships.</div>
					<a name="07011184000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
mention one other aspect of the affordable housing threshold. As we all
know, the Mayor insists, or requests, in the London plan that all new
housing developments be 50 per cent. affordable housing. That seems
admirable, but we all know that a recent development&#151;the Olympic
park&#151;will not have that threshold applied to
it.</div>

can only afford 30 per cent. affordable housing. The developer said
that it could not go ahead in a cost-effective way unless it accepted
that threshold. The Mayor said that that was right and, having looked
at the figures, accepted that it was so. Why, if he can accept that in
respect of the Olympic area, cannot he accept the same freedom for
other boroughs to negotiate in their own way on each development that
they encounter? The Mayor acknowledges that the Olympics is a special
case, so why cannot we acknowledge that each London borough is best
equipped to engage in such negotiations
itself?</div>

						We
seek a more devolutionary housing policy that recognises
Londoners&#146; specific, diverse housing needs. Although the
Conservative party is, broadly, unhappy with power being exercised
regionally, London is an exception in so many ways that it is
appropriate that the Mayor has the power to set a strategy. Such a
strategy could encourage best practice and champion, for example, the
creation of innovative new schemes like community land trusts, specify
areas where boroughs should work harder to meet their obligations and
offer encouragements and inducements to those that work most
effectively. However, the Mayor should not confuse his strategic
function with that of delivery. The boroughs and associated
bodies&#151;primarily RSLs&#151;are responsible for delivering. The
responsibility for delivering money is key. The Mayor should not be
primarily responsible for allocation of money: the boroughs should do
it, by working together and negotiating with the Government through the
Secretary of
State.</div>

						</b> This is quite difficult for me, because I support
some of the amendments in the group and not others. Clearly, amendments
Nos. 20 and 21 are about devolution&#151;in other words, stopping the
Secretary of State&#146;s interference&#151;which I support.
However, amendments Nos. 19 and 22 are different. The official
Opposition spokesman stated that it was important that the Mayor had a
power to set a strategy. The effect of amendment No. 22 would be that,
although he may have such a power, in practice every local authority
could disregard the strategy. Is the hon. Gentleman happy with a
strategy that could never be delivered? Is that his definition of a
strategy?</div>

						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the scenario
he is complaining about&#151;responsibility for a strategy without

London?</div>

						</b> In relation to the NHS issue there would have been
a greater degree of control over the NHS if the Mayor had been granted
the powers to consult that the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden was
advancing in her amendment. However, we are talking about a housing
strategy and we accept the principle that London needs a strategic
government. As part of that process, London will need a housing
strategy that can deliver. If amendment No. 22 were agreed, there would
be no guarantee that that strategy for housing in London could be
delivered.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div>
					<a name="07011184000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">There comes a point when the
official Opposition need to cease the constant repetition of the mantra
that we need more homes, if they are not willing and able to say how
they will be delivered. If amendment No. 22 were accepted, there would
certainly be no prospect that they would be
delivered.</div>
					<a name="07011184000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government could have gone for something stronger in terms of strict
conformity, but it is our view that general conformity will leave the
boroughs room for flexibility without losing the importance that we
acknowledge of achieving London-wide housing figures. I shall give a
couple of examples of when that has been the case in respect of the
London plan, for example, which has a requirement for general
conformity. There was a dispute in Southwark over land classified as
urban or suburban, which would have meant different housing densities
under the plan. I understand that Southwark fought its case. The
Government&#146;s planning inspector ruled in its favour, but also
acknowledged that its proposal was within general
conformity.</div>
					<a name="07011184000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer
now to Islington. The matter has not been resolved. It concerns annual
housing targets. It looked as though an outcome in Islington&#146;s
favour would be secured, but the issue is still ongoing. It illustrates
the point that there is scope for local authorities to argue within
general conformity that their proposals are sound. There have been
examples of when the Mayor&#146;s attempts to overrule local
authority plans have been rejected by the planning inspector. That is
not to say that the Government&#146;s proposals should not be
questioned.</div>
					<a name="07011184000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Surrey Heath has posed several such questions, but it is
worth repeating them for the record. What mechanisms will exist to
ensure that the Mayor&#146;s spending recommendations provide
adequately for boroughs&#146; statutory responsibilities? What is the
appeal mechanism? What safeguards will ensure that the Mayor does not
direct boroughs how to use the money that is made available to them? We
have that argument almost daily with central Government when talking
about their relationship with local government. We do not want that
repeated and the Mayor directing local authorities about how they
should spend
resources.</div>
					<a name="07011184000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
safeguards are in place to ensure that, when the Mayor drafts the
London housing strategy, he considers the statutory duties, national
targets and local issues to which boroughs are obliged to respond?
Finally, will the Government make it clear whether they consider that
the statutory duties of the boroughs to their local communities will be
sacrosanct and that they cannot&#151;and will not&#151;be
overridden by the Mayor and anything he puts forward for the London
housing strategy?</div>
					<a name="07011184000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we come to a vote, I will have a dilemma to resolve quickly about
whether my desire to see the Secretary of State interfere less is
stronger than my desire for London to enact a housing strategy that can
actually deliver the number of affordable housing units that London, in
particular,
needs.</div>

							<a name="07011184000642"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> I rise to support the Government&#146;s proposal
and to oppose the amendments. I do not do so out of any partisan
ideology, but I have considered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 141</div>the Government&#146;s proposals carefully, have read the responses
from various agencies and have listened with great interest to the
points made by Opposition Members. I will confine myself more to the
statements made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath than those of the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. I shall do so not out of
disrespect for the latter, but I cannot help but think that, as the
hon. Member for Croydon, Central intervenes on the hon. Gentleman, a
certain frisson might arise from the current edition of <i class="I">The House
Magazine</i>, in which the hon. Member for Croydon, Central describes
himself as visiting &#147;Mrs Thoroughgood&#146;s banana
stall&#148; in Croydon&#151;we dream of banana stalls in
Ealing&#151;and then wrote about attending a public meeting at which
he was mistaken for the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. In
fact, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central was called
&#147;Mr. Tom&#148;. Having been confused with the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the
Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan), an hon. Lady&#151;one of us
blessed tonsorially and the other cursed&#151;I understand how such
things can be confusing.</div>
					<a name="07011184000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, to turn to the point
raised by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, we have heard an enormous,
almost inordinate, amount about the internal mechanisms of the London
boroughs of Wandsworth and of Hammersmith and Fulham. In many ways the
hon. Gentleman made the Government&#146;s case, because if one thing
has flowed through every aspect of our discussions, as wide and massive
as Old Father Thames, it is the link between executive and strategic
functions. It was brought out in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech. I
was born in the London borough of Hammersmith and brought up in the
borough of Fulham. I am not sure which political party was in control
during my boyhood, but as I lived in Margaret Bonfield house, next to
Chuter Ede house and round the corner from Hartley Shawcross house,
over the road from Harold Wilson house on an estate that was, and still
is, called the Clem Attlee estate, it is entirely possible that there
was a Labour administration.</div>
					<a name="07011184000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The points made by the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath illustrate the subtlety of the approach of my
ministerial colleagues, although I do not wish to insult them by
accusing them of subtlety. London is a city like no other&#151;a city
of mosaics in which individual communities live side-by-side with other
communities of a totally different economic or demographic type. There
must be a balance between the understandable desire for local influence
over housing, if not quite autonomy, and the London-wide strategic
overview. One thing that has not yet been mentioned is the
Bill&#146;s proposal that the Mayor consult not only within the area
covered by the Greater London authority but in the surrounding areas.
That shows a recognition that housing cannot be approached in
isolation. We can look even beyond that: any outer London
Member&#151;there are a few of us in the room&#151;knows that often
when we talk about housing issues people from Hertfordshire,
Oxfordshire or Buckinghamshire ask for their input to be heard. The
Bill allows for
that.</div>
					<a name="07011184000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above all,
housing cannot be a hermetically sealed issue, considered entirely
locally. There must be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div>balance. I speak as one who was proud to wear not the civic chain, as we
did not have one, but the civic title of chair of housing management in
the London borough of Ealing, where I attempted to bring back
standardised paint on front doors and standards for garden cleansing. I
was known as the Stalin of W7, but I always denied
that.</div>

					<a name="07011184000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like most people, I have
considered the evolution of the London mayoralty. We are used to Mayors
in London&#151;we have even had a couple of Lord Mayors&#151;but we
are still not used to the idea of a strategic Mayor combined with an
executive assembly. We have watched the mayoralty evolve. We are here
today because of the evolution of the role of Mayor and the need, in
many matters, to change it where circumstances have changed. Clause
28(3) exempts the Mayor from requirements established in section 41(9)
of the 1999 Act, in which targets were set within the London housing
strategy&#151;the suggestion is that they are not less demanding than
targets and objectives set nationally. That change has come about
because of a recognition of the sub-regional housing supply situation,
and the need to ensure some level of national conformity and&#151;to
risk re-introducing the debate on floors and ceilings&#151;to set a
floor.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div>controlled 18 of the 32 London boroughs&#151;more than half&#151;and

partisan as to cast legislation in line with some party political
prejudice. The Labour party is bigger than that. We look at this
capital city, this great city&#151;a city greater even than

quarter hours on the placement of a comma. Every time the Speaker

heard much from
him.</div>
					<a name="07011184000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is that
we have here a classic example of the dichotomy between the
Mayor&#146;s executive and strategic functions. Whereas the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath seems to want to have his cake and eat it in
allowing local autonomy within a benign strategic city-wide framework,
that is simply not possible in reality. I shall mention a couple of
things that he did not talk about. Housing is not just about housing.
It is about climate change, energy conservation, transportation,
employment and life chances. Housing is, in fact, about everything. If
we are talking about housing in any city, and in this city above all,
we must bear in mind all those other factors.</div>
					<a name="07011184000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all know, housing is the
single most important determinant of a person&#146;s happiness or
sadness in life. If we are ill, we go home until we feel better. If we
lose our job, we go home and write applications for a new one. If we
lose our home, we have lost everything and we are on the street. There
are 101 reasons why that home can be unsatisfactory&#151;the
condition of the property, the journey to work, the amount of
pollution, the noise or vibration or any other issue.</div>
					<a name="07011184000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason, I am utterly
convinced that the Government are trying to keep as much local autonomy
as possible so that local authorities can determine planning
applications to their hearts&#146; content. They can set their
unitary development plans, work within them and raise individual cases,
but they cannot do so in isolation, not just from the rest of London
but from adjoining boroughs and even, as we have seen, from boroughs
abutting the GLA area. It is simply impossible to deal with the problem
in that way.</div>

get as close to it as possible, and that is through the Bill, which

what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath implied. Before I was elected,
when I had an honest job, I worked for Paddington Churches housing
association. I was constantly frustrated by the inability to deal with
housing beyond the purely parochial, because housing throughout London
affects people. People in London move across the city. We are a mobile
city and we must recognise that city-wide mobility. We have on these
green pages possibly not legislative perfection&#151;we do not
achieve that very often in this place&#151;but a blueprint for a
better city, in which we manage to achieve that balance that we all

							<a name="07011184000664"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I just
find it a remarkable coincidence. It is tough to find loyalists in the
London Labour party these days. Remarkably, they are all on this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07011184000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the main provisions before us, the provisions we seek to delete or
amend are significant. They will fundamentally alter the balance in
London between the Mayor and the boroughs. We were told two things
about the original GLA Act and the Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div>before us today. We were assured that the Mayor of London has a
strategic role in the management of London and secondly that the
measures proposed in 1999 and again today would be devolutionary with
powers coming from central Government and given to the Mayor. On both
those grounds these proposals for housing powers fail the
Government&#146;s very own
objectives.</div>
					<a name="07011184000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role
proposed here for the Mayor of London is far more than a strategic
role, but will involve the Mayor and his office and officers in very
localised matters. I will provide some illustrations in due course.
These powers come almost entirely from the boroughs and boroughs will
no longer have much say in their local housing strategies and will
apparently be at the mercy of the Mayor in seeing their funding
determined. For example, under new section 333A(3)(c) the Major will
recommend to the Secretary of
State</div>
					<a name="07011184000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;how much of the
money allocated by him during the relevant period for housing in
Greater London should be granted to each local housing authority in
Greater
London.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4)(b) refers
to</div>
					<a name="07011184000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recommendations as to
the number, type and location of houses which should be provided by
means of grant.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
tempting to believe that those who were drawing up this Bill genuinely
had in mind that there would be a strategic role for the Mayor. I can
understand there being a strategic role for the Mayor. All Opposition
Members can. It might be in terms of determining the overall needs of
the private rented sector, home ownership, how much should be given to
social rented across London and so on. I supposed that that was the
Government&#146;s intention. But the reality in the Bill is
fundamentally different. The reality is that the Mayor already tries to
get involved in the smallest schemes such as the Allied Carpets site in
Hammersmith and Fulham. It is directly on the boundary between my
constituency and that of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd&#146;s
Bush.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000665"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> Can we be clear? It may be on the boundary, but
it is in my constituency and I spoke about it at some length on Second
Reading. Indeed, I was very pleased when we had a victory. I took part
in the photocall. It is just a pity that when the Conservative council
printed the photograph they cut me out of
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000666"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> I was trying to use that local example to
demonstrate a wider point. It seems that the hon. Gentleman still
cannot move on from his days as leader of Hammersmith and Fulham
council. I have been advising him for some time that it is time to move
on. I believe that even his own colleagues have been telling him that.
If he really wants to go back to Hammersmith and Fulham council he
would have great difficulty because his old seat is now held by the
Conservatives with a 427 majority.</div>
					<a name="07011184000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned the Allied Carpets
site not because it is in Hammersmith and Fulham, but because the
scheme was turned down by the Conservative council and was refused on
appeal, but Mayor Livingstone then recommended it for approval. He
said:</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div>
					<a name="07011184000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This was an excellent
scheme by Allied and Morrison, with a ground floor car showroom and a
part 4 storey, part 10 storey building with 50 residential units (50
per cent. affordable) that delivered many London Plan
policies.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sounds
interesting, but the scheme had only 50 units and the Mayor
was giving a view about the percentage content of a tiny development of
50 units. We were told that we would be talking about the
Mayor&#146;s strategic powers, but a car showroom in Hammersmith and
Fulham with 50 units is hardly
strategic.</div>
					<a name="07011184000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
charter that the provision gives to the Mayor or his successors to
meddle in the 32 boroughs of London is immense, and we have seen how
the Mayor meddles. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath mentioned
another site that I shall use as an example. I am not fixated about my
local area, but the scheme at the Prestolite site is a good example.
The Mayor, using his existing powers, rejected the scheme in a press
release issued on Boxing day. If the Mayor wanted to co-operate with
London borough councils, would he issue a press release on Boxing day
and prevent the council from having a right of reply, despite the fact
that 65 per cent. of the scheme consisted of affordable housing? His
own officers recommended it and said
that</div>
					<a name="07011184000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on balance, the
application will deliver substantial numbers of affordable homes,
significantly above the overall strategic targets for
boroughs&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">in London. The
Mayor is supposedly in favour of more affordable housing, but his
reason for rejecting a scheme consisting of 65 per cent. affordable
housing
was:</div>
					<a name="07011184000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Hammersmith&#146;s
actions have the stench of Shirley Porter&#146;s regime at
Westminster Council in the
1980s.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have many new,
young councillors in Hammersmith and Fulham, many of whom are under 35.
I am above the median age of the current councillors. Most of them had
never heard of Dame Shirley
Porter.</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000667"></a>Mr.

							<a name="07011184000668"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> Unfortunately, the schools in Hammersmith and
Fulham were Labour-controlled for the past 20 years and it was
difficult to learn much in
them.</div>
					<a name="07011184000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the following
group meeting, the councillors were passing round a book condemning
Dame Shirley Porter to find out who she was, which shows how far out of
touch the Mayor of London is with London
housing.</div>
					<a name="07011184000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4)(b) states that the recommendations may
include</div>
					<a name="07011184000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the number, type
and location of houses which should be provided by means of
grant.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011184000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sounds like
an incredible charter for meddling in every small development. I
suspect that the Mayor will be able to influence the number and type of
homes, their location and pretty much everything, not in developments
of 50 homes, but in much smaller ones. In addition, he will need staff
to assist him. There will not be one individual poring over a set of
planning applications; there will be yet further growth in the size of
the bureaucracy supporting the Mayor and the GLA. I fear that the
Ministers behind that will be responsible for causing a nightmare for
London.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 148</div>
					<a name="07011184000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power grab from the boroughs
on housing is a purely political move for two reasons. First, the Mayor
asked for the powers as a payback for his support for the Labour party
during its last difficult three or four years. Secondly, at the time of
the 1999 Act, Labour controlled 18 of the 32 boroughs and the Labour
boroughs did not like the idea of the present Mayor, or any other
Mayor, taking their powers. It is purely because of the change in the
political complexion of London that the Government have decided to
rerun the borough council election results from this year. That is no
way to run a democracy and it does not inspire trust in the Mayor and
the
boroughs.</div>
					<a name="07011184000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
I foresee a number of legal rows between London councils&#151;the
individual boroughs&#151;and the Mayor about all the various
developments in which he will start meddling. The worst thing about
those legal rows is that the people will have to foot the bill, because
both sides will in effect be funded by the long-suffering London
council tax payer. The London council tax payer pays both for the
boroughs and for the Mayor and the Greater London authority. I foresee
many rows not only with Conservative councils but with Liberal Democrat
councils and probably even Labour councils. Probably the only exception
would be any council controlled by the Respect party, which seems to be
just about the only party that is closely aligned with the
Mayor&#146;s foreign policy views these days. One disadvantage of the
GLA structure is that the funding of the Mayor is not very transparent.
I believe that council tax payers will
suffer.</div>
					<a name="07011184000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to end
with some thoughts about whether the proposals are devolutionary. That
is the other plank of the proposals: first, they should be strategic,
and secondly devolutionary. As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey
Heath mentioned, most if not all of the powers are coming up from the
boroughs. The London boroughs&#151;I served as a councillor for eight
years on a borough in London&#151;not only are much closer to their
residents but have a stronger electoral mandate than the Mayor.
Councillors are elected on higher turnouts and are not elected with
second preference
votes.</div>
					<a name="07011184000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">In turn, the
Mayor&#146;s strategy also has to agree with national housing
strategies, according to the Bill. Amendment No. 20 would change that.
It would remove the need for the Mayor&#146;s strategy to agree with
national policy and end the Government&#146;s attempted
nationalisation of London&#146;s housing policy. The proposals are
not just about moving powers away from the boroughs up to the Mayor but
about moving them up further, to the Secretary of State. That is a
bizarre result, given that the Bill has been lauded on the other side
of the Committee as
devolutionary.</div>
					<a name="07011184000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
quote again from the Bill, local housing strategies will need to be
&#147;in general conformity&#148; with the Mayor&#146;s strategy,
which must in turn not be &#147;inconsistent&#148; with current
national policies relating to housing. How much individual choice will
be left for boroughs in London at all? The position of housing policy
is being transformed: it is being moved from democratically elected
local councillors all the way up the chain of command to the Secretary
of State. In a Bill said to reinforce the Mayor&#146;s strategic
powers, powers are given on an incredibly localised basis, on the
location, funding and tenure balance of small 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 149</div>individual housing schemes. We have seen in Hammersmith and Fulham that
he wants to intervene even on schemes of 50 units. He is already trying
that, even before he gets the powers. He even gets involved in the
percentage balance of a development of 50 units. That is not
strategic.</div>
					<a name="07011184000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support
the amendments and urge us to return to the principles that we should
have devolution in London and that the powers of the Mayor should
remain strategic. The new housing powers achieve neither, and I believe
that the Government will come to regret that in future years if the
proposals become
law.</div>

								Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I am afraid I thought that some of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments were a little inappropriate. If anyone is
obsessed with Hammersmith and Fulham council, it appears to be him
rather than me. My only interest is that it is a truly dreadful
council. My advice to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath is not to act as
a frontman for it in his contributions, first because it is about as
far away from the position that he tries to express on the Conservative
Front Bench as it is possible to get, and secondly because the
information that he is being given is simply incorrect. However, before
I correct those points, let me explain that most of what I am going to
say I shall go over only in outline, because much of it is more
appropriate to the debate on the planning provisions of the Bill than
it is to the housing provisions. Perhaps I shall make a longer
contribution when we reach that
point.</div>
					<a name="07011184000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
things have been said that cannot be allowed to rest and need to be
corrected. Before I go on to the housing matters, I must say that I
take exception to the comment by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham about the education service in Hammersmith and Fulham. The front
page of the education supplement with today&#146;s edition of <i class="I">The
Guardian </i>has a picture of Phoenix high school in my constituency,
which is the most improved secondary school in the country under the
visionary leadership of William Atkinson and because of contributions
over 10 years from a Labour Government and a Labour council investing
in what was a failing school. The comments that the hon. Gentleman
makes are exactly the same comments that he and his colleagues made
when that school was failing. They were running it down, running off to
the Tory press to deprecate it and trying to get it closed by default.
Despite that, Phoenix high school is a fantastic success
story&#151;the most improved school in
England.</div>
					<a name="07011184000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">To my horror,
I find that now that those people are in control of Hammersmith and
Fulham council they are doing the same to Hurlingham and Chelsea
school&#151;the only other mixed-community school in the
borough&#151;except now they have the power to close it. That is a
truly disgraceful record and I am sorry that the hon. Member for
Hammersmith and Fulham made such a flippant comment about the standard
of education in the borough, which overall is excellent. In fact, many
of his constituents go to those
schools.</div>
					<a name="07011184000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">On housing
matters, I said that I thought that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath
had been misled. I do not want to go over the details, except to say
that some of the developments that he talked about exemplify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 150</div>what is going wrong in many boroughs&#151;Hammersmith and Fulham is an
extreme example. I am surprised that he is associating the Conservative
Front Bench with that. If nothing else, the situation provides a good
reason for a strategic direction in housing powers in London because
the problems are simply not being addressed. Indeed, they are being
worsened by the attitudes, principally but not exclusively of
Conservative councils&#151;the disgraceful housing authority in the
London borough of Islington is controlled by the Liberal
Democrats.</div>
					<a name="07011184000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">In brief,
when the Labour party was in control of Hammersmith and Fulham council,
70 per cent. of all housing units being constructed were affordable
homes. The split was roughly: 50 per cent. shared ownership and 50 per
cent. social rented housing. That met and in fact exceeded the
Mayor&#146;s 50 per cent. target for affordable housing, although the
target for social rented housing was 70 per cent. and for shared
ownership, 30 per cent. The second part of the target appeared not to
have been met, but in fact it was, given that the overall percentage of
affordable housing was 70 per cent. We were building as many rented
houses as we could and more shared ownership ones than was required. So
that lays one ghost to rest&#151;the Labour party has no prejudice or
bias against shared ownership housing. Indeed, many of the policies of
the Government and the Minister for Housing and Planning, such as the
social homebuy scheme, have promoted low-cost home
ownership.</div>

exactly how many homes have been sold under the social homebuy
scheme?</div>
					
					<a name="07011184000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000671"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> I just said that it was an admirable policy. If
the hon. Gentleman wants that justification, he should go to the Front
Bench rather than me. I shall come on to his comments in a moment. He
might want to intervene then rather than continue the rather sterile
debate that I often see him have with my hon. Friend the Minister for
Housing and
Planning.</div>
					<a name="07011184000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
highlighted the position under the Labour administration, which had the
best housing record in London. It still was not achieving the target of
ensuring that 70 per cent. of affordable homes were social rented,
although it pushed closer to it every year. However, land values in
that borough are very high&#151;some of the highest property prices
in London and the country. I take no credit for it, but that was a good
record. The policy and practice of the Conservative administration has
been to drive down that percentage of affordable homes as close as
possible to the Mayor&#146;s 50 per cent.</div>
					<a name="07011184000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">More significantly, the
administration is reversing the percentages of social rented and shared
ownership housing. It wants 70 per cent. of all social housing built to
be shared ownership. It does that cynically. The generally accepted
Housing Corporation and housing association equation is that shared
ownership housing costs about two thirds of its market value. Those
homes with about a 45 or 50 per cent. discount will retail for between
&#163;200,000 and &#163;400,000. The administration knows,
therefore, that given land values in Hammersmith and Fulham, most of
those properties will not be available to those with housing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 151</div>needs. They are not even available to those whose income is two or three
times the average. They represent an important intermediate market but
do not address the primary area of housing need, which is why I think
that the Mayor&#146;s 70:30 housing formula is the right one. Given
the cost of private sector ownership and rental in Hammersmith and
Fulham, or any part of north-west London, no one can say that there is
not a housing shortage. The figures speak for themselves. Most boroughs
in west London have 10,000 or more people on the waiting list and 2,000
or more families in temporary accommodation. Every one of those
families is costing the taxpayer a
fortune&#151;usually&#151;through housing benefit costs, or they
are paying those costs
themselves.</div>

the Government&#146;s initiatives on temporary accommodation,
particularly on ending the use of bed and breakfast accommodation, have
changed fundamentally the conditions in which people live. I remind him
also that because of the prosperous economy, particularly in west
London, house prices and rental values have gone up so much that the
squeeze on people who cannot afford to rent or buy in the private
sector is such that in recent years there has been an increase in the
number of people in temporary accommodation. The Government have now
pledged to address the problem.</div>
					<a name="07011184000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does the hon. Gentleman
support Conservative councils that are going out of their way to thwart
the Housing Corporation, the Government office for London and the

acknowledged, the number of people in temporary accommodation then was
half the number now, so the Government&#146;s target for solving the
temporary accommodation problem will return us only to the position
that they inherited when they came to power. As he knows, it is a
problem not only London-wide, but throughout the UK and in the east of
England in particular.</div>

						</b> I understand why the hon. Gentleman does not
want to answer my question. I am sure that he does not want to take
advice from me, but I advise him again to dissociate himself from
events in Hammersmith and Fulham. &#147;Porterite&#148; is exactly
the right word, because Porterite means unacceptable political
influence in planning and housing processes. It also means incompetent
interference, because unless one is incompetent one does not get found
out.</div>
					<a name="07011184000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman may want to find out more about the Prestolite scheme before
he discusses it again in Committee. It was inherited from a Labour
council 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 152</div>and it included 75 per cent. affordable housing. The new Conservative
council made two demands of it: first, that it decreased the percentage
of affordable housing from 75 per cent. to 64 per cent.; and secondly,
that it swapped the allocations of rented and shared ownership housing,
so that instead of the scheme consisting of predominantly rented
housing, it consisted of predominantly shared ownership housing for the
reasons that I have given. It was cynical political interference, and I
hope that he does not approve of it.
</div>
					<a name="07011184000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Gentleman mentioned Imperial Wharf. Not a day goes by when I do
not receive an e-mail or a telephone call from a housing association
operating in Hammersmith and Fulham, telling me that it has had
unreasonable demands placed on it. I shall provide one more example: a
100 per cent. affordable-housing-designated site, Bagleys Lane in the
Imperial Wharf area, which included 121 units of affordable housing.
The first demand was for one-third market housing on the site; the
second demand was for only 15 per cent. social rented housing on the
site.</div>
					<a name="07011184000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given what the
hon. Gentleman has said about housing need, particularly in London, I
do not understand how he can defend a Conservative council that
believes it is right to designate 15 per cent. affordable housing on a
site that was designated for 100 per cent. affordable housing.
He should put those questions to his hon. Friends rather putting
questions to me.</div>
					<a name="07011184000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have more sympathy with the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham on
the Allied Carpets site issue, save that it was an observation in a
report which the Mayor did not pursue. He did not attend the public
inquiry, because it was an inappropriate development, I am pleased to
say, not because of the housing split on the site. The project was for
a tall tower in a residential area, but it was rejected, which shows
the robustness of the planning process. The example is a red herring in
this context.</div>
					<a name="07011184000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is
essential that in terms of housing policy in London, we build the homes
that people need. The Conservative boroughs have not merely failed to
deliver on that, and they have not merely derogated responsibility;
they have actively and callously gone out of their way to make it clear
to people in housing need that they are not welcome in Conservative
boroughs. I am surprised to find that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to
support that policy, as he indicated on Second Reading, rather than
that advocated by the
Mayor.</div>

							<a name="07011184000678"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> Indeed, it is amazing what one does during
elections. However, I want to be serious in this debate, because there
is a housing crisis in London and it is important that the legislation
is effective and meets the needs of the 62,000 people who are homeless
and the 360,000 people in overcrowded accommodation in
London.</div>
					<a name="07011184000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important for us to debate the efficacy of setting centrally driven
targets for housing, whether nationally or regionally. The current
system, particularly in London, has created a distortion in the supply
of one and two-bedroom flats, when what is really needed is the
provision of family housing, particularly houses with gardens. I do not
believe that being opposed to back-garden development is an appropriate
policy in Greater London. Such is the stress on housing in London that
that is one place from which housing has to
come.</div>
					<a name="07011184000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Behind
people&#146;s concerns in this debate is a lack of confidence in the
ability of local authorities to deliver on municipal and social
housing. That is not my experience with my local authority in Croydon.
I pay credit particularly to Councillor Dudley Mead, who led on housing
before 1994 and who leads on it now. I am pleased that funds have come
from the Government via the GLA for new council housing in Croydon.
That is important, when my constituents face extreme overcrowding and
are advised that their prospects for new social housing will see them
re-housed in nine to 10
years.</div>
					<a name="07011184000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
significant votes in providing extra social and council housing in
Greater London, but it is people locally who will be strongest in
responding to that need and demand. It is more than likely that the
initiative taken by a local authority will be blunted by the need to
visit city hall and argue its case for one allocation or another. It
would be much better if this issue were driven upwards, rather than
downwards. That is the problem with the philosophy and approach behind
all the amendments. Our approach has been about taking power downwards
from the Government and the Government office for London and for giving
the GLA responsibilities for the NHS in London and the learning and
skills councils in London. Housing being built in localities in
response to local pressures is best delivered by local authorities
themselves.</div>

						</b> I shall respond to the points made on the
amendments this afternoon. I found the amendments confusing and
contradictory in their nature. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 and a bit of
amendment No. 19 would reduce the influence of the Secretary of State
in relation to the Mayor. Amendment No. 22 would reduce the influence
of the Mayor in relation to the boroughs. However, amendment No. 19
would substantially reduce the influence of the Mayor in relation to
the Secretary of State and the Housing Corporation. The overall impact
of the amendments is not devolutionary, as the Opposition have
suggested, but centralising; they would hand power and decision making
back to the Secretary of State.</div>

housing policy.</div>
					<a name="07011184000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an existing structure in housing policy and in the role of the
regional housing boards, which were set up by the Government so that
recommendations were made at the regional level rather than simply by
civil servants in Whitehall. We thought that an important devolutionary
measure. However, we now think it important to democratise that
regional voice in London and to give that voice to the Mayor. We think
it important to recognise the important strategic issues that reflect
the nature of the housing market as a whole, rather than simply local
areas and the bricks and mortar that are put
up.</div>

							<a name="07011184000687"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> In many ways the Bill does exactly that. The
effect of the Opposition amendments, particularly amendment No. 19,
would be to reverse that and simply put a lot of the spending decisions
back in the hands of the Secretary of State.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div>
					<a name="07011184000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to recognise the way
that decisions are taken at the moment. The Housing Corporation
receives bids for affordable housing. We also have to make decisions
about how resources allocated for housing in London are to be carved up
between boroughs, perhaps to address problems of the supply of decent
homes, of overcrowding or of empty or temporary accommodation. Those
are the different ways in which the Government support investment in
housing in different areas across
London.</div>
					<a name="07011184000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Decisions are
currently made either by the Secretary of State directly or by the
Housing Corporation on the Secretary of State&#146;s behalf.
Currently, decisions are made subject to the Secretary of State
receiving recommendations from the regional housing board. The boards
are composed on the direction of the Secretary of the State, not by
decision of the Mayor, and consist of a small number of people whose
role is to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. We think
that those recommendations about the spending priorities across the
city as a whole would be far better coming from the democratically
elected Mayor who represents the city as a whole. He should be making
recommendations about strategic priorities for London as a
whole.</div>
					<a name="07011184000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly, if
recommendations are not made about money and the strategy does not have
an impact on resources, it will not have half the impact on the city as
a whole. Over two years, &#163;1.5 billion will go into new
affordable housing for London through the Housing Corporation. That is
almost half the budget for affordable housing for the country as a
whole. That is a lot of investment going into the capital, and we think
that it is right that the democratically elected Mayor of London should
have a say and make recommendations about the priorities for that
investment. If we simply remove the Mayor&#146;s spending
recommendations from the process, we will be back to where we started,
with the decisions being made by the Secretary of State and the Housing
Corporation instead. It is about having a devolutionary
effect.</div>

Slaughter:
						</b> My hon. Friend may not have plumbed the depths
of the Opposition, who do not actually want the investment. I mentioned
some schemes earlier: on the Prestolite scheme, &#163;30 million of
public funding was withdrawn because of the Conservative
council&#146;s decision, and on the Bagley&#146;s lane scheme,
&#163;6 million was withdrawn. The Opposition do not want investment
in housing, in the same way as they did they want the decent homes

particular housing policy issues between individual Conservative London
boroughs and the Mayor rather than a rational argument about
structure.</div>
					<a name="07011184000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
second contradiction in the Opposition Members&#146; approach.
Amendment No. 20 is about removing the role of the Secretary of State
with regard to the London housing strategy. However, Opposition Members
have asked for decision making to go back to the Secretary of State and
for safeguards to prevent the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 156</div>Mayor from being capricious and from favouring one London borough over
another. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has asked for
safeguards to ensure that the resources and spending allocations
reflect the statutory obligations of London boroughs, which is
important.</div>
					<a name="07011184000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important that the way in which the resources are allocated reflects
the obligations set out under national policy. We have retained a role
for the Secretary of State in order to ensure that the London housing
strategy conforms to national housing policy, which includes those
statutory obligations. A list of safeguards has been included, and we
have limited the Secretary of State&#146;s role in these clauses.
That constraint is in place to ensure that the London boroughs are not
asked to do something by the Secretary of State and the statutory
framework, when the framework for delivering resources through the
Mayor and the Housing Corporation does not reflect those
obligations.</div>

							<a name="07011184000690"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The Minister is labouring under a misapprehension,
and is therefore tilting at an Aunt Sally. In our remarks, my hon.
Friends and I did not want the powers, particularly the powers of
allocation of funding, to remain with the Secretary of State. As
amendment No. 66 makes clear&#151;it is on the amendment paper,
although it has not been selected&#151;we wanted such decisions to be
made by London boroughs acting corporately. As the Minister will know,
that was an entirely satisfactory way of operating before the advent of
regional government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000691"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman should consider carefully
whether he is asking for London boroughs to decide how resources are
distributed between London boroughs. Which London borough should have
how much and how should those resources be allocated? It is inevitable
that each London borough will argue for resources for its area, which
it should be able to do. However, it is also important that the largest
London borough does not have the strongest voice and that particular
coalitions of London boroughs are not able unfairly to affect resources
for another London borough. Ultimately, it is important that a
strategic view is taken of the capital as a whole, which is why we have
an elected Mayor for the whole of the capital.</div>
					<a name="07011184000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">The implication of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks is that he would prefer not to have a Mayor
at all, and if that applies to housing resources it presumably applies
to many other areas, too. The hon. Gentleman considers that decisions
should simply be taken as a result of discussions between London
boroughs; in fact, strategic decisions must be taken and, in the
absence of a Mayor, many of them would have to be taken by the
Secretary of
State.</div>

						</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s argument, but I
ask her to provide some reassurance. She says that decisions on funding
would be made by the Mayor, but other aspects of local authority
funding are determined by formulae and through transparent processes.
There appears to be no protection here from a Mayor who makes decisions
randomly and perhaps in a fit of pique.</div>

Cooper:
						</b> To clarify the situation, we have made it clear
that the clause is about the Mayor&#146;s spending recommendations
and recommendations to the Housing Corporation as to how it should
exercise its functions. The Housing Corporation will still have to take
decisions about individual bids and take account of the fact that, for
example, there could be a situation in which, although a particular
priority had been set, in practice there were not sufficient
good-value-for-money bids put forward within a 12-month period to make
it possible to deliver on that priority. The Housing Corporation would
have to take that into account and accordingly make adjustments within
a year or two years to ensure that its overall programme is to deliver
the priorities set and is not compromised because of value-for-money
considerations.</div>
					<a name="07011184000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The clause
also includes a recommendation to the Secretary of State as to how they
should make allocations to the Housing Corporation as opposed to
directly to local councils. Not all the money allocated for London as a
whole goes on new affordable housing, because some of it goes on other
issues such as decent homes. The Mayor should be making recommendations
as to what that balance should
be.</div>

Linton:
						</b> Far from tilting at an Aunt Sally or setting up a
windmill, may I ask my hon. Friend whether she is convinced, because I
am certainly not, that all Conservative boroughs would want affordable
housing, if they had a completely free hand? I remind her that for
several years Wandsworth asked for 0 per cent., which was only changed
when it came to realise that if it failed to ask for affordable
housing, it would be forced to do so by the Secretary of State.
Eventually, Wandsworth was dragged kicking and screaming to ask for 25
per cent. affordable housing, and now it grudgingly provides 33 per
cent. when 50 per cent. is
demanded.</div>

						</b> My hon. Friend is right. There may be wider
underlying fundamental disagreements about policy, which are often the
real issues that divide us in politics, and we should not necessarily
hide them behind
structures.</div>
					<a name="07011184000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may
be real disagreements and hostility from Conservative boroughs to
levels of affordable housing. At a national level, I know that the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath has echoed my concerns that 200,000 new homes a
year should be built. However, he also knows that many London boroughs
are anxious about the overall level of house building and have rather
different views on new affordable housing. The hon. Gentleman was
enthusiastic in his endorsement of Wandsworth council, but, like my
hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush, I
caution him on simply accepting a briefing from an individual council
and endorsing it so enthusiastically. The figures that I have from the
GLA suggest that in Wandsworth in 2004-05 only 20 per cent. of new
homes were affordable housing, and figures from the Housing Corporation
suggest that only nine new social rented homes were built in the whole
of Wandsworth in 2005-06. I accept that there are limitations on any
set of figures and that the figures will count different types of
housing in different ways. Nevertheless, I seriously caution the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath in being so enthusiastic in his support for
Wandsworth.</div>

Hands:
						</b> Equally, the Minister should be careful about whom
she chooses in this debate, because I think that the Mayor of London
has got things fundamentally wrong. If one looks at the Prestolite site
in Hammersmith and Fulham, which has been much discussed today, the
Mayor of London rejected 65 per cent. of the content of the
scheme&#151;bear in mind that it seems that the rejected scheme will
not be built. There will be no affordable homes at all as it currently
stands. The Mayor&#146;s own office
said:</div>
					<a name="07011184000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
balance, the application will deliver substantial numbers of affordable

							<a name="07011184000698"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> The solution to the negotiations between the
Mayor and the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is quite simple.
If Hammersmith and Fulham council agrees to a reasonable tenure split
of housing on the site, the scheme can be built tomorrow. It would be
being built had, as I think that I have made clear, it not been for
unacceptable political intervention not by the Mayor, but by the leader
of the council in Hammersmith and Fulham.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011184000699"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> My hon. Friend has made important points, subject
to the caveat that I cannot comment in detail on individual cases that
may still be live within the planning system. At the heart of this is
the anxiety among Conservative Members about the Mayor taking a view at
all on the overall level of social and affordable housing&#151;and
housing in general&#151;needed across the city. Instead, their
proposal is that this should be decided, as they put it in amendment
No.66, which I have now seen, by negotiation between London boroughs
and the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has a clear role in
their amendment and would have to take a strategic view in the absence
of the Mayor being able to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07011184000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
recognise that decisions about housing, particularly major decisions
about the level of overall affordable or social housing in one borough,
have implications for the city as a whole. The way in which the London
housing market works reflects the London labour market and the fact
that millions of people travel every day from one borough to another
from where they live to where they work. Millions of people will move
around during the course of their lives to live in one borough and then
another and perhaps to move in and out of London
altogether.</div>
					<a name="07011184000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
issues that affect London and the London housing market as a whole, and
there are issues around the way in which the London housing market
works that affect the national housing market and the national economy.
That is why it is important to retain a role for the Secretary of
State, because if the Mayor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 159</div>and the London boroughs between them decided, for example, substantially
to reduce new housing built in London and new affordable housing in
London, it would have a substantial effect on the London economy and
the housing market of neighbouring regions.</div>
					<a name="07011184000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The way in
which the housing market is linked between one region and another is
important and has national repercussions. It would be irresponsible of
the Secretary of State not to have some role in recognising the
implications that go beyond the city, whether it be for the London
economy, the wider national economy or the wider housing market.
Similarly, decisions in one borough can impact on decisions in another.
We know, for example, that if all the Conservative boroughs decided
tomorrow to halve the level of new affordable housing in their
boroughs, it would have a substantial impact on not only residents of
those boroughs but those who are on low incomes or who cannot afford to
buy their own homes in neighbouring
boroughs.</div>
					<a name="07011184000457"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">That
is why this is an important matter for the Mayor to take a view on and
why a London housing strategy is important. I say to Opposition Members
that the sum of affordable housing proposed by the individual London
boroughs does not reach the level of housing needed in London as a
whole&#151;</div>

Surrey Heath, who wanted farmers to grow only crops of concrete.
Although it was in fact a nice turn of phrase that I would normally
have attributed to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, given his
enthusiasm for speechwriting and oratory&#151;I always presumed that
he would contribute to the speeches of the right hon. Member for
Witney&#151;I thought that it was pushing his internal contradictions
too far to come up with a phrase criticising
himself.</div>
					<a name="07011184000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair,
the hon. Gentleman has occasionally suggested locations for homes, but
he has not been realistic about the mechanisms by which we can ensure
that they are delivered in practice, given the restrictions inevitably
and rightly placed through the planning system that prevent the market
from simply delivering all the homes that we
need.</div>

Members have moved a series of amendments that do not even achieve
their own purposes. The Government do not agree with them. We think
them to be counter-productive. These are sensible measures to give a
stronger strategic voice to the Mayor rather than the Secretary of
State on housing issues affecting the capital. Clearly, this is simply
about strategic housing issues rather than local housing questions,
which must be matters for the borough. We think that the framework and
the balance are right, so I urge the Committee to reject the
amendments.</div>

reject the amendments, which were intended to fulfil the overall spirit
of the Bill as a devolutionary document. When it was introduced by the
Secretary of State, that was her stated intention. I am sorry that the
Minister feels incapable of accepting them, but given the hour, it is
perhaps appropriate that as she has expressed her opinion, we should
have an opportunity to cast our votes.</div>
