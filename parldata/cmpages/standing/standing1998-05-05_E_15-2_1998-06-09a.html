<H4><center>[Mr. John Butterfill in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Continuation from column 678]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My point, reiterated by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, was that there was demand from the industry and from practitioners for the rules to be rationalised and codified in one place. There is some confusion in the industry about the differing thresholds and control tests. The industry believes that the schedule will complicate and confuse matters so that there will be a lack of coherence. Will the Paymaster General respond to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that I have grasped the complaints of the Law Society, Opposition Members and others about the complexity of the schedule. However, as the right hon. Member for Wells acknowledged, that complexity is inherent to the subject. That does not mean that the schedule cannot or will not be improved, but I repeat to Opposition Members if the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds listens carefully, he will understand the point that paragraph 1 gives the basic rule for UK tax purposes and is the first point of reference, while paragraph 2 sets out rules for the construction of that basic pricing rule in a manner consistent with the OECD model limits. I do not believe that it matters whether we use "best endeavours" or "best" in that regard.
<P>
The requirement to construe the basic pricing rule in a manner consistent with the OECD model is clearly intended to limit the scope of the basic pricing rule. Paragraph 1 is therefore drafted in broad terms, while paragraph 2 ensures that paragraph 1 cannot be interpreted in a way that goes beyond what is covered by the OECD model. That is a precise reply to the hon. Gentleman's question. I cannot be clearer than that, because the advice we were given did not incorporate the matter directly. I have explained the reasons for that and it therefore seems fair to say that the legitimate objections of Opposition Members have been accommodated. I suggest that we make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In his genial way, the Paymaster General has grappled with some of the issues raised by Opposition Members in what has been a constructive debate. It would not be appropriate for us to vote against the schedule, but I must protest that, despite all that the Paymaster General has said, we are being invited to accept 10 pages of legislation that lawyers say are comprehensible only to parliamentary draftsman or to people who have discussed the legislation with Inland Revenue officials. That is a bad way of legislating 10 pages of what can be described only as verbal treacle.
<P>
An instance of that I have not selected a particularly difficult excerpt is paragraph 4(6), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In paragraph (d) of sub-paragraph (3) above, the reference to rights and powers which would be attributed to a connected person if he were the potential participant includes a reference to rights and powers which, by applying that paragraph wherever one person is connected with another, would be so attributed to him through a number of persons each of whom is connected with at least one of the others."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That reminds me of a parlour game for the super-intelligent, in which one has to try and work out whether Uncle John is somehow related to nephew Geoffrey. That is not the way to attract and retain business in this country.
<P>
Apart from our comparatively low business taxes, foreign companies are attracted here because of our judicial system, which operates not on purposive legislation but on literal interpretation, so that people can work out for themselves where they and their companies will stand in relation to the Revenue. A foreign company hoping to invest or to set up a subsidiary here would get hold of the relevant legislation, but would find that a paragraph such as the one I have quoted would prevent it from working out where it stood. To foreigners, it is gobbledegook. Such a company would have to go and talk to a firm in the City, which would refer it to a lawyer not an ordinary lawyer, but one who has talked to the Inland Revenue or who is connected with a parliamentary draftsman. That is the sort of overhead that the foreign company would incur. The legislation will create a superstructure of costs that will affect both UK companies and foreign companies that want to locate here without falling foul of the Inland Revenue on transfer pricing.
<P>
I am pleased that the Paymaster General said that the tax rewrite project did not die with my resignation from the Treasury. Indeed, he said that that small monument of mine was alive and kicking so it was a healthy baby that has survived a change of Government. It is therefore all the more regrettable that it has not informed the legislation.
<P>
The Paymaster General gave us few assurances on the schedule, but we shall return to the matter. As I said, we will not vote against it but I hope that our reservations about it have been noted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> It might be helpful to the right hon. Gentleman if I responded briefly. Our provisions are in line with the OECD guidelines. We have consulted fully and have changed several of the undertaking in the published guidance, but the legislation will not go wide of the OECD formulation. There is significant deregulation for UK-UK transactions. We intend that the UK will remain a most attractive area in which to do business and in which to invest much of our debate today has turned on that attractiveness, an important part of which is what we have done in our two Finance Acts to reduce the burden of taxation on companies. We now have the lowest level of taxation: 30 per cent. for large companies and 20 per cent. for small companies. We intend that that should continue and that is why we have given the undertaking, as we have with personal taxation, that corporate tax rates will last for the length of the Parliament. [Interruption.] Opposition Members do not like to hear[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
about our success, but it is a fact and that is why people continue to come to Britain to do business. I commend the provisions to the Committee.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would explain why the power under subsection (3)(b) appears to be discretionary. Presumably, the Inland Revenue itself contravenes subsection (1) and it should therefore always allow a period of notice for making or amending a claim. Should not that power be mandatory, not discretionary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I do not see why; a discretionary power is adequate for the circumstances envisaged. The Opposition normally prefer discretionary to mandatory arrangements and I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would approve of the subsection. If he wishes to elucidate his point, I shall be happy to answer him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I welcome the opportunity to elucidate, although I am slightly suspicious that the Paymaster General may be playing for time to consult his professional advisers or perhaps his amateur legal adviser. My point is that if the Inland Revenue contravenes subsection (1), it should always allow some period for a claim to be made or amended; that should not be discretionary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. However, to set down a statutory time limit would be unnecessarily restrictive. We had a similar discussion about motive. Leaving the matter to the Revenue's discretion allows it a degree of flexibility to respond to the facts and circumstances of the case in question. I do not want to anticipate what should be at the Revenue's discretion or what should be mandatory everything depends on the circumstances.
<P>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point and correct slightly what I said before. I understand why he whould want a restriction or obligation on the Revenue to be mandatory and other matters to be discretionary. As with the question of motive, however, it is up to him to prove that there is a need for the change that he suggests. If he has evidence that the Inland Revenue does not respond as it should, that it does not allow the necessary time or that it behaves in an oppressive manner that is the adjective that is usually used to describe unacceptable Treasury behaviour let him produce it. I will willingly consider it to see whether there are grounds for changing the Bill. However, no representations have been brought to my attention. The change would be unnecessarily restrictive. We should let the Revenue judge each case according to its circumstances.

<P>
This is one of several small amendments on numbering that we have had to table. It is nothing our of the ordinary. Numbering problems arise in Opposition amendments of only two lines, let alone in a whole Bill. I command the amendment to the Committee.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 282, line 38, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3)In subsection (2)(b) after `section', add "but in the application of subsection (7) of section 839 for the purpose of the Chapter, references to persons acting together to secure or exercise control of a company shall not include members of a partnership, and in the application of subsection (10) of section 783 for the purposes of this Chapter, there shall be omitted from subsection (11) of section 783 the words `body of persons' includes a partnership".'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a technical amendment, but it has a commercial implication for the amount of investment that this country's venture capital funds carry out overseas. Controlled foreign companies legislation was introduced in about 1984 to stop UK companies siphoning off profits and storing them in overseas tax jurisdictions with low rates of tax. A company could, for example, store large amounts in a subsidiary's bank account in a tax haven. The interest would be free of tax or subject to a low rate of tax. The money could be distributed back to the UK when it was more convenient for tax purposes, rather than just earning interest in the UK and being subject to UK tax. It could also be re-invested elsewhere in the world.
<P>
The amendment tries to deal with a problem that is created by schedule 17. UK capital funds are typically structured as limited partnerships under UK law. That creates the appropriate relationship between the investors in the fund and the fund managers. It also achieves transparency for tax purposes for the investors. There is an increasing amount of investment abroad. Technically, under sections 416 and 783(10) of the Taxes Act 1988, as modified by section 756, a UK investor could be deemed to control an overseas investment for controlled foreign company purposes even though his investment was small.
<P>
Earlier, we discussed control in terms of owning more than 50 per cent. of the shares. However, it is possible to have control with much less than 50 per cent. even less than the 25 per cent. that the schedule requires, because the various partners in one of the venture capital trust funds must be attributed to each other. That is because the legislation requires the attribution to them of the right of their partners as associates.
<P>
In such a circumstance the investor would control a controlled foreign company, with all the implications that that would bring. Before the Bill, the matter was academic. Of course, there is nothing in the Bill that would necessarily bring that into effect but it was always a theoretical possibility. However, the Inland Revenue seemed never to take the point.
<P>
Before the Bill, a partner in a fund faced with that theoretical possibility had simply to wait and see whether the Inland Revenue took the point and made a direction under the CFC legislation. It was the Revenue's responsibility to make the direction under the legislation; it was not the investor's or taxpayer's responsibility to say that the CFC legislation applied. The Bill introduces schedule 17 in order to prepare for self-assessment. It will require a company to include any such liabilities in its self-assessment corporation tax return. We cannot continue with the unreceived technical possibility that a CFC exists, so matter must be classfied in the Bill.
<P>
It is possible that investee companies and their subsidiaries will be resident in territories on the excluded countries list, where tax rates are as high or higher than the UK's. No advantage can therefore be derived from seeking to siphon money offshore to such countries. It is also possible that investee companies might engage in exempt activities such as trading in those local jurisdictions. However, it would be difficult for a UK investor to acquire sufficient information about the investee to sign a tax return with confidence and in good faith without including any controlled foreign company income. It would be harder still to compute the share of the chargeable profits. The burden of signing something that might not be true might discourage the making of an overseas investment, which would otherwise benefit UK plc through the significant capital gains that generally arise when such investments are exited.
<P>
The solution is for the Paymaster General to accept the amendment, which excludes the attribution of partners' interests from the definition of control for CFC purposes. Should he consider the amendment insufficiently well drafted, I hope that he will nevertheless accept the principle behind it and table a similar amendment on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I hate to disappoint the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, but we cannot accept the amendment because we think it inappropriate to do so, and because, as he realises, it is technically woefully deficient.
<P>
The amendment would set aside for CFC purposes some of the references in the Taxes Act 1988 that require partners' interests to be regarded as connected or associated. The intention is clear but, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, the amendment would not achieve it. As I understand it, the amendment is intended to deal with two circumstances. The first concerns the test of whether a non-resident company is controlled from the UK, and is therefore potentially a CFC. Under the existing rules, partners' interests in a CFC are regarded as being associated when applying the control test. That is quite clear.
<P>
The second circumstance concerns the test of whether a UK company has sufficient interest in a CFC to be potentially liable to CFC tax in respect of it. The test is that the UK company and persons associated or connected with it must together have at least a 25 per cent. share which is an increased amount in the CFC's profits. Under existing law, partners are regarded as having been connected with each other. Because partners' interests have to be viewed together, it is possible that a non-resident company that would not otherwise be regarded as being controlled from the UK might be so regarded, and that a partner with a direct share of less than 25 per cent. of a CFC might be chargeable for CFC tax. As I understand it, the amendment is intended to prevent those two outcomes. It would not achieve that, as it is technically deficient. Those defects aside, the Opposition must realise that CFC legislation is important anti-avoidance legislation that protects significant amounts of UK tax. The attribution of partners' interests is an important protection against potential arrangements to get round the rules. I shall come to our intentions in a moment.
<P>
As CFC tax is due only when a company is involved in UK tax reduction, loosening the rules would mean increasing opportunity for investment, free of CFC tax, in non-resident companies engaged in avoiding UK tax. That is plain. I ask the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to think through the full extent of the amendment, which I know is supported by the British Venture Capital Association. If the hon. Gentleman listens carefully, he will realise that it is unnecessary. Loosening the rules would be entirely contrary to the purpose of bringing the CFC rules into self-assessment, and would be unacceptable for that reason.
<P>
The rules that the amendment would change have been in place since 1984, when the previous Government introduced the CFC legislation. They were necessary then, and they are necessary now. The business relationship between partners means that it is right to consider their interests together when determining issues to do with control and de minimis limits. As I mentioned, I am aware that the BVCA's specific worries about the attribution rules for partners lie behind the amendment. No Government have done more for the venture capital industry than this Government. The university scheme, the challenge scheme and what we have done for small companies are part of that, and we are seeing a remarkable response and uptake of venture capital. We are still considering some recommendations put to us.
<P>
The BVCA has now put its concerns to the Inland Revenue and I have a copy of the Revenue's detailed and helpful responses. Rather than detaining the Committee, I shall make those responses available. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton might not have had the opportunity fully to study them to see their good and common sense. The rules should continue to stand, which will be of no detriment to partners participating in relevant venture capital arrangements.
<P>
I reject the amendment for the following reasons. First, the partnership attribution rules have an important[Mr. Geoffrey Robinson]
role to play in preventing avoidance. That was so in 1984, and it remains so. Secondly, the self-assessment measures will not change the rules in any way. The potential exposure of UK companies to CFC tax is not being increased, nor will companies have to provide information for which they could not be asked now. Thirdly, CFC tax is payable only when a company is involved in UK tax reduction. Fourthly, partners have to pay tax only in respect of their own interests. The attribution rules do not mean that they have to pay tax in respect of partners' interests. The rules simply affect whether the conditions are met for tax to be due. Fifthly, schedule 17 and the administrative steps being taken by the Inland Revenue will keep the compliance costs of self-assessment to the minimum necessary for a fair and effective system. Sixthly, companies will able to obtain rulings from the Inland Revenue under the new CFC clearance procedure if they are in any doubt about any aspect of the CFC rules. That is heavily stressed in the letter received by the BVCA.
<P>
For those six specific reasons, and because of maintaining the good standards that have applied since 1984, I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In order to speed matters along, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 287, line 44, after "directly", insert "or indirectly".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 170, in page 288, line 49, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4)In sub-paragraph (5) in paragraph (b) after `is derived directly or indirectly from' there shall be inserted `non-trading income.'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment is again about controlled foreign companies. One way in which a company can avoid being a controlled foreign company is by being located in an excluded country, as I mentioned earlier. Such a county will have a relatively high tax regime compared with the UK. Alternatively, the company in question may be engaged in an exempt activity. An exempt activity is when a company trades in an overseas jurisdiction and generates 90 per cent. of its income there. In such circumstances, the company cannot be said to operate some kind of conduit for money from other jurisdictions, nor is it merely a passive entity with no purpose. Holding companies can also be exempt if they hold shares in a company genuinely trading in that jurisdiction.
<P>
The rules created problems for multinational companies with many layers of subsidiaries, as only holding companies with shares in local trading companies could be counted as engaged in exempt activities. In 1995, The Inland Revenue introduced a concessionary practice allowing more tiers to exist, subject to certain conditions. Schedule 17 will codify the concession by creating the concept of a superior holding company. Such a company is one whose business is wholly or mainly the holding of shares or securities in other superior holding companies, in holding companies or in local holding companies.
<P>
The schedule will permit multiple layers of holding companies to exist in a group structure without prejudice to the group's CFC status. There is a requirement that 90 per cent. of each superior holding company's income must be traceable, directly or indirectly, to local holding companies or trading companies.
<P>
Paragraph 33 of schedule 17 introduces a new paragraph 12A to schedule 25 of the Taxes Act 1988, enabling such a company to derive such income directly or indirectly from its subsidiaries. However, a superior holding company may hold shares in a holding company that, for ease, we may call Holdco. Holdco may hold shares in a trading company, T1, which in turn holds shares in a subsidiary trading company, T2. The new rules require that each holding company owned by a superior holding company must either be a superior holding company or pass the exempt activity test set out in schedule 25 of the Taxes Act 1988.
<P>
However, to qualify as a holding company under that schedule, income can only be received directly from a trading company, which is not allowed to receive income from a third trading company. So in my example, although the superior holding company receives exempt activity income as defined in schedule 17 because Holdco pays money upwards to it Holdco itself will not pass the exempt activity test set out in schedule test 25 of the 1988 Act, because of the receipt of dividends from T1. As a result, the superior holding company will not qualify for CFC purposes, as Holdco will not be considered to be engaged in exempt activities.
<P>
The problem can be dealt with by two simple amendments, Nos. 169 and 170. The rules in schedule 17 seem incompatible with the existing legislation. The apparent flexibility in the new rules granted by the words "directly or indirectly" in proposed new paragraph 12A(2) will not help in practice because of the existing problem in schedule 25 of the 1988 Act, which schedule 17 does not fix.
<P>
Amendment No. 169 would add the words "or indirectly" to paragraph 5(4A)(b) of schedule 25 of the Taxes Act 1988. That would tackle the drafting changes omitted from schedule 17. Amendment No. 170 would add a new subparagraph to schedule 17(32), to resolve an anomaly created by the present drafting.
<P>
I am aware that the amendments may be technically defective, as I do not have the resources of the Inland Revenue behind me. If they are, I hope that the Paymaster General can accept the principle of the amendments and table correctly drafted versions on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I hate to disappoint the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton again. I do not want it to become a habit. I shall explain in a few simple words why I must reject the amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 169 and 170 and amendment No. 18, which is not grouped with those amendments would widen the new exemption for superior holding companies. Amendment No. 169 would break the concept that a superior holding company will usually pass the test only if all the intermediate companies in the chain below it are themselves exempt. The hon. Gentleman took the point that that is precisely what his amendment attempts to do. The amendment is not technically proficient, but that is besides the point.
<P>
Amendment No. 170 would make it easier for certain intermediate companies in a chain to qualify as exempt. We have already responded to representations from the Confederation of British Industry and others on the matter and what is proposed is a loosening; we are being urged to go further.
<P>
Although I accept that the new superior holding companies exemption does not cover all the circumstances when United Kingdom tax reduction is not involved, that is not the point. It is not intended to be such a test; that is for the motive test. That is a good example for the hon. Member for Sevenoaks of the motive test working; it is accepted and has proved to be effective. There was a clear case for establishing it because the motive in such situations, because of the complexity of the arrangements being set up, is a key element. It is not a simple, one-off tax transaction, but a series of complicated interrelationships in a series of holding companies when the motive is most important. We are not trying to restrict it or to remove it.
<P>
The new superior holding companies exemption is intended to deal with the straightforward situation of multiple tiers in a holding company when each tier meets the criteria in the exempt activities test. That must remain the key test. Companies that fall outside the test will be dealt with, as at present, under the motive test. I give the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that assurance in resisting his amendment.
<P>
It would be possible to widen the new superior holding companies to cover various permutations such as the hon. Gentleman suggested and the three amendments attempt to do that. It is not surprising that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendments, but it is surprising that certain distinguished bodies should have associated themselves with them. Given our reliance in these complicated arrangements on the motive test, there is no need for the further loosening that the amendment proposes and we shall reject it if the hon. Gentleman puts it to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was a disappointing reply. There is genuine need for the amendments and it is not sufficient to say that companies can rely on the motive test. I could say that the motive test for controlled foreign companies purposes is the last refuge of the scoundrel. That would be going too far, but companies are reluctant to rely on exemptions from CFC because of its vagueness and the lack of certainty. In the real world, companies will have to engage in massive restructuring inserting and taking out subsidiary companies for no purpose other than to comply with schedule 17. However, our disappointment is on the record and, to speed matters on, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 289, leave out lines 8 and 9 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are holding companies, local holding companies, trading companies or superior holding companies.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I rise with a sense of foreboding, as in his reply to the debate on the previous amendment, the Paymaster General expressed his disappointment that he may not be able to accept amendment No. 18. However, there are some points that are worth making in support of the amendment, which raises a slightly different matter from that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, although it builds on it in its definition of holding companies.
<P>
You, Mr. Butterfill, perhaps more than other members of the Committee, will be familiar with the previous regime, under which controlled foreign companies legislation was essentially administered by the international division of the Revenue. It decided and computed tax, and it issued advance clearances and comfort letters. Under self-assessment, companies must now do all that computation themselves.
<P>
I suspect that, in trying to codify existing practice, the Inland Revenue has quietly changed the rules. Indeed, in the press notice accompanying the Budget I refer the Paymaster General to the budget notice, Inland Revenue 24 the only reference to codification is in paragraph 4, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government proposes making a number of further refinements".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, there is discussion of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a number of other detailed amendments and clarificatory changes".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly, the drafting of the clause seems curious, and could be improved. Thirdly, as amendment No. 18 suggests, the definition of superior holding companies could usefully include trading companies.
<P>
I shall deal first with the change in the rules. It is clear from paragraph 23 of the explanatory notes that this is not a mere refinement. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the definition of companies from whom holding companies can receive income enabling them to pass the test has been widened."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government admit that in the explanatory notes, but they concealed it from the outside world in the press notice accompanying the Budget statement.
<P>
Secondly, I suggest that the codification is an attempt by the Revenue to impose an almost perfect system that might somehow apply to every conceivable scheme. That may not necessarily be possible.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 is directed at the Bill's drafting. The problem is that, since the 1995 tax bulletin, several large United Kingdom multinational groups have set up structures that comply with that concession. They include holding companies that own a mixture of shares and securities in other holding companies and trading companies. Those structures could, of course, be changed to comply with the proposals in the Bill, but only by the insertion of further holding companies into the structure to ensure that the superior holding companies do not directly hold interests in trading companies.
<P>
That cannot be done quickly in every case. There could be different regulatory frameworks in the different local territories; it may take some time in different countries to incorporate new companies; clearance of various sorts may be required; and those[Mr. Fallon]
UK multinationals will be put to considerable expense and inconvenience.
<P>
Even if the new companies could be quickly inserted into the structure of the multinational, the holding companies in the existing structure would cease to qualify for exemption from the CFC rules for the entire accounting period in which the structure was amended. That will increase the tax burden on UK multinationals, even though they have been operating entirely within established Inland Revenue guidelines.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 is a probing amendment aimed at mitigating some of that damage. Even if the Paymaster General cannot accept its current wording, I hope that he will at least answer the points that I have made in support of it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Before we adjourned for dinner we were discussing amendment No. 18. I said that we were back on to technical matters, and I was replying to the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks.
<P>
The amendment covers similar ground to amendments Nos. 169 and 170. It would extend the definition of companies that fall within the exempt activities test. The central issue is where the line should be drawn between dealing with every eventuality in the exempt activities test and leaving permutations or hybrids to the motive test. However, it is clear that companies that are not involved in the reduction of UK tax are not liable to CFC tax, and that they will not be so liable under the Bill. There is no need to extend the exempt activities test to ensure that such companies are exempt. Regardless of the scope of the exempt activities test, the motive test ensures that CFC tax is not due in respect of companies that are not involved in the reduction of UK tax. That has been the case since 1984, when the previous Government introduced the test, and will continue to be so under the self-assessment that we are introducing. It is important to be clear about into which exemption box the exempt activities box or the motive box certain companies should fall. It could be a combination of both.
<P>
The rules that were introduced by the previous Government in 1984 restricted to a maximum of two the number of layers of holding companies that can gain exemption under the exempt activities test. In response to suggestions that were made following the 1997 consultative document, paragraphs 30 to 33 remove the limit on the number of possible layers. It will be possible under the Bill to have an indefinite number of layers. Any companies that fall outside the extension to the exempt activities test will continue to be exempt as before, under the motive test, if they are not involved in UK tax reduction. Paragraphs 30 to 33 widen the exempt activities test box. They do not narrow the motive test box or the Inland Revenue's existing application of it, which was set out in tax bulletin No. 19. If the hon. Member for Sevenoaks reflects on the papers that he has before him, he will see that he has misunderstood our intentions. We are extending the exempt activities test in a way that was not attempted by the previous Government in all the years that followed their introduction of the CFC rules in 1984.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would extend the exempt activities test still further. It would widen the proposed definition of a superior holding company to cover a company whose business consisted wholly, or mainly, of the holding of shares or securities in trading companies, rather than of the holding of shares or securities in other holding companies. It is not clear whether the intention is to restrict the extension for the holding of shares or securities in 51 per cent. trading subsidiaries, as does the present holding company definition. The extension is unnecessary for three reasons.
<P>
First, some representations on the Bill have suggested that the definition should be widened in order to allow superior holding companies to hold shares directly in trading companies. That is not the case. Paragraph 33 will not prevent a superior holding company from holding shares directly in trading companies. All that matters is that its business consists wholly or mainly of holding shares in the various types of holding company. Its business does not have to consist entirely of holding shares in holding companies. The direct holding of shares in trading companies is therefore possible within the definition of the Bill. Secondly, if a company's business consists wholly or mainly of holding shares or securities in trading companies, it may fall within the existing definition of a simple holding company. To the extent that it does not, the grievance of Conservative Members should be with the definition of a first-level holding company, which their Government introduced in 1984, not with the Bill's definition of a superior holding company.
<P>
Thirdly, any companies that fall outside the definitions of a local holding company, holding company or superior holding company, will, as now, be exempt under the motive test if they are not involved in the reduction of UK tax. There will be no need for companies to restructure to continue to be exempt. I emphasise that last sentence because it deals with a genuine concern among Opposition Members and others.
<P>
For all those reasons, the amendment is unnecessary. We have gone much further than the previous Government in extending the exempt activities test in respect of layers of holding companies. It would, however, be foolish to get into an ever-increasing spiral of definitions to cater for every conceivable permutation and hybrid. We have put the line in the right place between extending the exempt activities test and looking to the motive test to deal with the balance of cases.
<P>
The issue is complicated, but I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Sevenoaks will see that the intent behind our proposals is not to change the rules. We have tried to put the core of the practice in tax bulletin No. 19 into statute, which must be welcome. The motive test and the tax bulletin will continue as before. I hope that those assurances are sufficient for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment; if not, we will have to resist it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am afraid that the Paymaster General is not correct in saying that the provision takes nothing away from previous regimes. The 1995 concession, which was published in the tax bulletin, permitted superior holding companies to hold shares directly in trading companies; the present rules do not. The Paymaster General is wrong the rules impose a restriction on the number of tiers that can be held. Under the previous regime, an unlimited number could be held. In 1995, worldwide multinational groups set up a mixture of holding companies that owned trading companies and other holding companies in their worldwide structures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman I am anxious to make progress, but I do not want to cut short the debate. The 1995 tax bulletin article continues to be relevant. If he wants to demonstrate the contrary, he should do so, but he cannot simply assert it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> All the representations that Conservative Members have received suggest that, under the new regime, a superior holding company the Paymaster General has said this himself must hold companies that are wholly or mainly [Hon. Members "Mainly."] In my understanding, a company is not wholly or mainly a holding company if more than 50 per cent. of its income arises from a trading company. That is the commonly accepted definition of the term "wholly or mainly". That was where the Paymaster General's first explanation was inadequate. The Bill will place a restriction on the concessions that previously applied.
<P>
The Paymaster General's second suggestion was that a company could be regarded as a holding company, which takes us back to the problem of the limited number of tiers. His third suggestion was that companies could always rely on the motive test. It is, however, too subjective and there is not sufficient certainty for companies with millions of pounds of tax at stake to rely on it. The Paymaster General says, "You can apply in advance to the Inland Revenue to see whether you would fall within the motive test." However, worldwide multinational groups based in the UK have hundreds of subsidiaries. It is not possible for them to keep writing to the Revenue for every one of their subsidiaries abroad to ensure that they do not fall foul of the Bill.
<P>
This one schedule, if it is not changed by the amendments in my name and those of my hon. Friends, will mean that multinational companies throughout the world will have to restructure their group by inserting companies [Interruption.] This is the view of industry; I could quote you the names of large, well-known plcs.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot quote me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I could quote the names of many large multinational plcs, but I will not do so because they came to me in confidence [Laughter.] I would have to check with them. I am sure that the Paymaster General is also aware of companies that are deeply uneasy about the schedule. They will have to insert holding companies throughout their worldwide group structure, thus incurring regulatory costs in the local territories. They will have to spend time to incorporate new companies and apply for various clearances in the UK and abroad. They will also have to meet the expenses involved in the running and administration of the extra subsidiaries.
<P>
It is absurd for the Government to subject some of the most successful UK groups to that administrative inconvenience. The Government have not listened to the representations from the companies involved, nor to the advice of Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It may be that the Paymaster General wants to help the Committee, and that he has set out the positon as he sees it. It is possible that there is a genuine disagreement about the interpretation of the clause. However, I assure him that the amendment would not extend the exemption. It is based on the interpretation that the schedule would extend the restriction. I hope that he will withdraw the charge against us that he made earlier. We do not want to extend the exemption. We feared that the schedule as drafted would extend the restriction.
<P>
The concessions published in the tax bulletin in 1995 stated that superior holding companies could hold shares or securities directly in trading companies. It would be of some comfort if the Paymaster General gave the Committee a categoric assurance that the schedule, as drafted, will not affect that. Such an assurance would be helpful, as his words certainly will be studied outside the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I think that I have made the position clear. I agree that what I say will be studied with care, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my words have been carefully chosen.
<P>
However, I repeat that the Budget day press release made it clear that companies will continue to be able to claim the benefit for the motive test under practice and tax bulletin No. 19, when a holding structure falls outside the new extended exempt activities test, and where companies prefer to claim the motive test rather than the exempt activities test.
<P>
I can do no better than to refer the hon. Gentelman to the precise language that I used. What I said will be studied by those who think that they may be affected and by those who feel that they may have to restructure. I am sure that they will be reassured: if not, there will be ample time for the matter to be brought up again on Report. As far as I am concerned, the reassurances that I have given about the motive test and about the 1995 tax bulletin article are adequate.
<P>
I hope that the amdendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Seventeenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the schedule as drafted reaches the statute book, the Bill will be another piece of defective legislation that will have to be amended next year.
<P>
The schedule does not amend schedule 25 of the Taxes Act 1988. Therefore, if an intermediate holding company receives dividends from a trading subsidiary that itself receives dividends from its own trading subsidiary, that holding company will not pass the exempt activity test, thus tainting the exempt activity test status of the superior holding company. That cannot be right.
<P>
There is also the absurdity that partners in a venture capital fund holding a small percentage stake in an overseas company will find that they cannot sign their tax return or that they will have to get advance clearance from the Inland Revenue that CFC will not apply. However, they will not be able to supply the relevant information to apply for clearance from the Inland Revenue because they will not have access to it no more than I, with my £500 investment in it, can access the research findings of British Biotech. Incidentally, that investment is now worth £250.
<P>
A superior holding company will not be permitted directly to hold shares in a trading company, even though the 1995 tax bulletin permitted that. As a result, many UK multinationals will incur the enormous expense of restructuring their worldwide groups simply because of one schedule of one Finance Bill. The schedule is badly drafted, inadequate, and will cause problems. It will come back to haunt the Committee in future years.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): The schedule is long and complex. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford called the previous schedule dense and impenetrable. I would be less than honest if I did not say that virtually all of the schedules are dense and impenetrable except, perhaps, to the hon. Member for Dudley, North, who seems to have a penchant for dense and impenetrable prose.
<P>
I should like to raise a specific point about paragraph 3(5)(b), which appears to create a power to make regulations through delegated legislation that will impose retrospective taxation changes. The paragraph allows the list of excluded countries to be amended with retrospective effect in relation to accounting periods that end as much as one year prior to the change.
<P>
I do not pretend to be a legal expert, but the use of delegated legislation powers to make changes that could enormously effect the commercial operations of a company seems something of an innovation. Companies will make their commercial decisions in reliance on the list of excluded countries available to them at the time. The suggestion that the list could be changed with retrospective effect by regulations, without the opportunity for proper parliamentary scrutiny and to the disadvantage of the companies concerned, strikes me as an issue about which the Committee should be extremely concerned.
<P>
We should ask whether it is fair for changes to be made in such a way, without proper parliamentary scrutiny, when they could have serious negative effects for taxpayers and companies. Will the Paymaster General tell the Committee why such a move is thought to be necessary? It is innovative, unwelcome and potentially dangerous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's last point first. I undersand his concern. We have arranged the matter to allow proper consultation on the decision announced about any excluded country. That facility is necessary to allow present practice to continue. There will be consultation on any changes to the list of excluded countries. The practice followed by the previous Government was to announce proposed country changes by press release, to consult on the proposals and then to confirm the changes through a second press release, with effect from the date of the first press release.
<P>
That sequence is clearly set out in the Inland Revenue's published guidance on CFCs. Under new arrangements, country changes will continue to be announced by press release, and will be confirmed, following consultation, through regulation apply from the date of the press release. Those arrangements are the same, and their purpose is to enable consultation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I think that the Paymaster General has come 90 per cent. of the way towards solving my problem. Is he saying that he guarantees that the change will in no circumstances be backdated further than the first public announcement by the Inland Revenue of a proposal to exclude a country or to change the list?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point. Furthermore, I should say that there is no risk of serious tax loss. The provision will not be used to make changes for periods beginning before any press release announcement. That is a very precise point. The provision recognises businesses' concern about retrospection in a way in which the previous Government did not. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured.
<P>
I hate to say it, but the continuing reference to the hon. Member for Guildford as dense and impenetrable is rather unkind. Labour Members would never make any such suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> For the record, I did not describe my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford as dense and impenetrable; I ascribed to him that description of schedule 16.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am happy that it is my thought processes that are felt to be impenetrable rather than my financial affairs, as is the case with some members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I am sure that none of us would think the hon. Member for Guildford dense and impenetrable, but should he not disqualify himself from the Committee if he feels that way about the voting on particular schedules?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Schedule 17 has been acknowledged to be difficult by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. A lot more work is needed on it, which we shall get under way.
<P>
I am disappointed in the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He has so much promise and is clearly aspiring. He did not quite make it to the Front Bench this time around, but he has an accounting pedigree and a grasp of technicality unmatched in the Committee, if not in the House. He resigned from a position of great promise in the profession to serve as a humble Back Bencher. Regrettably, however, he made a series of assertions without justifiable evidence indeed, they were in plain contradiction of the facts, which are set out on paper in front of us. Anyone could read and understand them, whether they relate to venture capital arrangements or the position of superior holding companies and their investment and trading activities. There is nothing in what the hon. Gentleman said. I made the position crystal clear, and I am sure that the reassurance that I gave will be read by a wider audience than the Committee can provide. I commend the schedule to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There is one further point. The Paymaster General referred to other work in hand, which clearly includes the clearance procedure. When will that appear? Will it be included in the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall certainly get back to the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<P>
Schedule 17, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Postponed corporation tax</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Again, this is a complex clause. As far as I understand it I believe that my understanding is no more limited than that of other Committee members, although, unlike the hon. Member for Dudley, North, I did not vote on the clause to which he referred those in the profession have pointed out that the clause contains anomalies. In particular, it could mean a perfectly innocent party to a transaction unwittingly finding that, owing to attempts to avoid tax by the other party, it was to be chased by the Revenue to make good the lost tax.
<P>
Conservative Members abhor tax evasion. We recognise that the intention of clause 112 is not just to stop tax avoidance, but to stop tax evasion, I hope that the Paymaster General will pay tribute to the previous Government's efforts in that regard. It has sometimes been suggested in the course of debate that the previous Government were not up to the mark on these matters. In fact, they were very much up to the mark.
<P>
It is significant that the explanatory notes on clause 112 refer to the Finance Act 1994, in which the previous Government grasped the nettle on this problem. I understand that the Government intend the clause to embellish the efforts of their predecessors. However, it is not fair that an unwitting and innocent party should be put at risk because of the other party's activities. That might happen as a result of the clause. Line 25 on page 101 gives the condition under which clause 112 would apply. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at least one of those transactions was entered into by one or more of its parties on the assumption ... that that liability <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to tax 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would be unlikely to be met, or met in full, if it were to arise."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How would one party to a transaction know that the other party, in striking a deal, was planning surreptitiously to use that transaction to avoid tax? That is unreasonable; it requires, in effect, not only that a party, perhaps selling or transferring a business, has the normal due diligence, but that it looks into the mind of the other party to the transaction. It may be said that when one party sells to another, it is normal for indemnities to be given. It is one thing to be given an indemnity, but another to be able to enforce it. An innocent party may enter a transaction in good faith, but find that the indemnities that have been sought from the other party cannot be enforced.
<P>
We want to encourage businesses to take sensible but calculated risks and to expand their frontiers. When businesses are dealing with counterparts, they may perceive a great opportunity but not know the counterpart as well as they might have known one in the town or neighbourhood next door. They may believe that they are dealing with reputable people, only to be disappointed.
<P>
If it is not in the clause, we must ask what assurance the Paymaster General can give that the Board of the Inland Revenue will, first, make assessments against vendors of companies only when they are satisfied that they had the legal means to recoup the loss from the offending party. Secondly, will the hon. Gentleman comment on the situation in which a bona fide transaction takes place with a company in recovery involving banks that have a first charge on the company's assets? If the recovery does not go as well as those involved hoped, the banks may have first charge on the assets and get their money back, but no money will be left for the Inland Revenue. What assurance can the hon. Gentleman give that in those circumstances the Revenue will not go after an innocent party to the transaction, claiming that clause 112 was a device by which there would be tax evasion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My reading of clause 112 is that it requires at least one of the parties to the transaction to be up to no good. What appears to be missing is a provision that it is the party who is up to no good who should suffer at the hands of the Revenue. It appears that the wholly innocent party could be attacked by the Revenue because the other party was up to no good. As my hon. friend argued, there is no requirement that there should be evidence of a conspiracy,
<P>
The notes on clauses state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This legislation is designed to counter these and other new schemes. It is not intended to catch sales and purchases where all those concerned are motivated solely by bona fide commercial considerations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We accept that, but it does not tackle the problem of the innocent party who discovers that he has sold his business to a shark. The hon. Member for Dudley, North, who diligently reads the Law Society's briefings, will have picked up my second, narrow point and[Mr. Hammond]
perhaps tipped off the Paymaster General so that he will have the answer ready.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
According to the Law Society's experts, the clause's definition of control will be equivalent to the definition that is contained in section 416 of the Taxes Act 1988. That means that venture capitalists who are lone creditors will be caught by the new provisions. Did the Paymaster General intend that, or was it an inadvertent inclusion that he may want to deal with on Report.
<P>
The aspiration of many a small business, following the period of growth that has occurred after its start-up period, is no greater than to be gobbled up by an avaricious competitor that has recognised its merit. Anyone who has ever been involved in that type of transaction will know that if the business is sold to a larger company especially if that company is American the matter of tax warranties and indemnities is often the biggest hurdle that has to be jumped. The small business man's view of such issues tends to be less formal than that of the large company that is buying his business. Conservative Members are worried that the clause may inadvertently create great difficulties in the drafting of the tax warranties and indemnities in cases that involve the sale of a small business to a much larger business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have three questions for the Paymaster General. The first relates to the points that have been raised about transactions in good faith. A situation could arise in which a company sells a subsidiary to a purchaser in the knowledge that it is insolvent or likely to become insolvent, and in the knowledge that there are, or could be, contingent tax liabilities that have not yet crystallised yet the company is doing that on the basis of good faith. That situation could arise in two ways. First, the purchaser and the vendor could both genuinely believe that the company can be turned around. Secondly, the company could be insolvent and the purchaser and the vendor both genuinely believe that the assets can be realised for more than the amount that is set out in the contract of sale. By any sensible definition, both of those examples represent transactions in good faith, yet they would be caught by the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am delighted to give way to the distinguished jobbing barrister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I did not intervene on his hon. Friends the Members for Guildford and for Runnymede and Weybridge because they may not be as aware as he is, as a lawyer, of the meaning of the word "reasonable" in the subsection. It refers to an objective test that is designed to identify persons who ought to have inferred, on the basis of the facts, that certain circumstances will follow. Good faith involves dishonesty. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he wants to catch only the dishonest? The clause is designed to catch those who should have recognised objectively, on the basis of the facts, that a particular situation has arisen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. His point was also made in the Law Society's submissions that is, that the Bill should contain an express mens rea test. Such a test would put the issue beyond doubt.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General give us his view on my example of the sale of an insolvent company in which it is reasonable for the vendor and the purchaser to assume that there are contingent liabilities, as yet uncrystallised, that may not be met in the future that is, a sale that has taken place on the basis of good faith?
<P>
My second question follows on from that point. There have been many instances of insolvent subsidiaries that cannot pay tax. In those situations the Inland Revenue often cannot pursue the parent company or the holding company for that unpaid tax. That is generally the position, so why should the clause make it possible in the situation that I have outlined?
<P>
Finally, new section 767AA appears to bring into force the provision that a taxpayer receiving a levy from the Revenue would have access to no appeal mechanism other than judicial review of the board's opinion. Why is no other customary right of appeal available against a judgment by the board about a company's taxation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall not go into too much detail, but I need to set out a little of the background. This problem was acknowledged by the hon. Member for Guildford when he began the debate. Some intitial work was done by the previous Government, and the Bill will complete that unfinished business.
<P>
The amount at stake each year is about £100 million. About 40 cases are under review, amounting to a potential tax recoupment of £300 million, so the Committee will accept that the proposals are not made lightly or for no good purpose. The problem is that the type of tax evasion that has been described can be undertaken deliberately.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> None of us wants such tax evasion to happen, but how confident is the Paymaster General that even this fairly draconian clause will stop the loss of £100 million a year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The clause will certainly make those deliberately involved in such evasion pay more attention to what they are doing. The application of the mens rea test, to which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred, might call the hon. Member for Guildford into question again.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked about appeals against assessments under proposed new section 767AA. I can assure him that the normal provisions of the Taxes Management Act 1970 already provide for appeals against assessments. I can give him the specific references at another time.
<P>
The problem cannot be allowed to continue. The measures proposed to be put at the Revenue's disposal are serious. They amount to a shot across the bows for companies if it can reasonably be thought and the next two clauses stipulate the requirements for proof that a vendor and a buyer have connived together. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly pointed out that tax warranties and indemnities are a big stumbling block, especially when a big company buys a small one.
<P>
The usual motto is caveat emptor, but the Bill amends that in this case to caveat vendor: vendors will have to pay great attention to the purpose of the arrangements into which they enter. If it is clear that the price paid for a company being sold is way in excess of what could be justified reasonably and objectively and that the aim is the subsequent stripping of the assets and the evasion of the tax liability sold with the company the vendor company will be liable to the measures set out in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General has acknowledged the difficulties faced by a small company being sold to a large company. The suggestion that the motto be caveat vendor does not take account of the fact that the small company will not have the resources to be informed fully about the activities and circumstances of the larger purchasing company.
<P>
Paragraph 5 of the notes on clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The effect of this subsection is that the reasonable inference to be drawn is that of a hypothetical observer with full knowledge of the terms of the transactions and the surrounding circumstances."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A small vendor selling to a larger purchaser possibly a foreign company would not be likely to have full knowledge of all the surrounding circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> In that case, the test will not be met, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North explained, and no assessment will be leviable on the vendor.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly pointed out that warranties and indemnities are sought. It will not be beyond the wit of most companies or people selling their companies to see what is required. I have never been involved in such matters, but obviously the hon. Gentleman has some personal experience of them and can see what he is required to give. I should think, naturally, that there may be implications for him in that respect.
<P>
We are speaking about 40 cases and £300 million. The deals in question are not high street back-of-the-shop deals, but involve substantial business. The reasonable and objective tests are the good faith in which the Revenue has approached the matter and the fact that we are building on the previous Government's actions and closing loopholes that they tried specifically to close. That should be the reassurance that Opposition Members seek. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I have a point about an insolvent company that is being sold. It is perfectly clear that in such circumstances the Revenue, examining the vendor's activity, would undoubtedly say that the vendor was aware that the company was insolvent and that there were contingent tax liabilities that had not crystallised. Such a vendor could say that the purchaser can turn the company around. Is it not difficult for the Paymaster General to say that the Revenue would apply the objective test of an officious bystander in such a way as to let that vendor off the hook? Clearly, in such circumstances the vendor should be let off the hook. I am not convinced by what has been said; I do not believe that the Revenue would necessarily let off such a vendor. Will the Paymaster General comment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will comment. The hon. Gentleman is speaking of a hypothetical case. Clearly, insolvency and turn-around circumstances are closely related in this sense. The question of degree is one aspect. I would give the following advice to vendors in those circumstances they should seek the Revenue's advice and seek warranties and indemnities specifying fixed amounts and periods from the buying company. We are speaking of the real world, not some innocent at large, especially as the matter involves the sale of insolvent companies. One does not get hold of an insolvent company without knowing something about insolvency, and one does not get into insolvency without knowing some of the routes that lead to it. However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point, which is a good and narrow one although it is more of a debating point than a real world point. [Interruption.] I give way to the hon. Member for Witney, who has not contributed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I have not contributed because I have not yet had a substantive point to make. The Paymaster General has raised a question in my mind that is appropriate and which justifies an intervention. The question is specific, and concerns a matter of justice. Is the Paymaster General confident that no individual could face a tax liability as a consequence of the clause, through no fault of his own?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am satisfied that that is the case. I willingly give the reasonable assurance for which the hon. Gentleman asked. The clause is not devoted to such a purpose; it is devoted to precisely the cases and circumstances with which the Inland Revenue was getting to grips under the previous Government. I give that assurance readily. The clause is not aimed at innocent people. We are dealing with millions of pounds £300 million and 40 cases. That is £100 million a year. The sheer scale of the matter implies a level of involvement in company affairs and a knowledge of them that preclude the circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Perhaps the Paymaster General was about to give the assurance for which I shall ask. Will he extend his assurances to the case that I mentioned? I spoke of circumstances in which assets are secured by the bank, which, perfectly legitimately, takes them because the turn around has been unsuccessful, leaving nothing. The company may not be insolvent, but may be on the brink of negative equity. What assurances can the hon. Gentleman give that the Revenue will not go after the vendor saying that is his fault that the purchaser failed to make a success of the company and that the tax revenue that was due to the Exchequer has been lost?
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the same assurance that I gave the hon. Member for Witney, but I cannot give a blanket assurance about a person who sells a business that is on the verge of bankruptcy.
[Mr. Robinson]
<P>
The point that the hon. Member for Guildford made about the bank having first charge on the assets is irrelevant. If the bank has first charge on the assets, that is the end of the story; it takes them. Whether that happens, or whether there are no assets, or whether the assets have been deliberately voided by the purchasing company and there has been, for instance, clear collusion between it and the vendor, are all factors that the Revenue must establish. All that is readily set out in the clause.
<P>
Where there is clear evidence of, for instance, collusion a deliberate involvement between the vendor and the purchaser of course the Revenue, regardless of whether or not there are assets, will go after the vendor. That is the whole purpose of the Bill where there is a deliberate attempt to evade tax. That must be the case. That stands, whether or not the assets are left in the company. In these circumstances, the Revenue goes against the vendor for collusion for deliberately participating in a tax-evasion scheme.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am aware that significant abuse takes place and that some overseas companies and individuals specialise in the form of tax evasion that we are discussing. Does the evidence that has to be adduced against the UK taxpayer the vendor have to make the case beyond all reasonable doubt, or on the balance of probabilities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We are getting into refined legal terminology, on which I do not want to pronounce. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the reasonable and objective tests as set out. If we get down to the level of legal terminology that was suggested by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, we shall be in difficulties. My view I believe that this is the Revenue's view is that, because we are dealing with a deterrent, we have to go on the balance of probability. It would be going too far to speak of all reasonable doubt, but I do not want to pronounce on the nuances in any individual case. In the generality, however, matters would be decided on the balance of probability.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have given way an awful lot in the debate on this clause. I commend it as the proper way to close loopholes. The previous Government made fine attempts to do so, but they were unsuccessful. The measure is necessary we are talking about a large amount of tax and we have given assurances about how we shall proceed. The clause is the only way to close the loopholes.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> While the Paymaster General was answering the question from the Liberal Democrat Benches, I tried to find the word "collusion" in the clause. Perhaps he can help me, because I cannot find a collusion test anywhere in it. Much though the Paymaster General's assurances are welcome, we saw this morning that his colleague the Economic Secretary was prepared to defend the new sheriffs of Nottingham in robbing poor pensioners to enrich their coffers. The Paymaster General is now spinning us a yarn about how the Revenue will exercise the momentous powers in clause 112.
<P>
What assurance do we have that the Revenue will be any more reasonable when exercising those powers than it has been in other instances? That is the problem. Throughout the debate on the Bill, the Paymaster General has failed to give us confidence that the powers that are being demanded to eliminate a recognised problem will be exercised in a sufficiently responsible way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I concur with everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said. I must press the Paymaster General, as I understood him to say that the Revenue would have to show that there had been collusion between the vendor and the purchaser. If I understood him correctly, that will greatly reassure Conservative Members. However, subsection (1)(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The condition is that it would be reasonable. . .to infer. . .that at least one of those transactions was entered into by one or more of its parties on the assumption, as regards a potential tax liability, that that liability would be unlikely to be met".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that to mean exactly the opposite of what the Paymaster General just said. It will not be necessary for the Revenue to demonstrate collusion it will be merely have to demonstrate that at least one of the parties entered into the transaction with mens rea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The plot thickens. I turn the Paymaster General's attention to paragraph 16 of the explanatory notes, which says that the clause is not intended to catch situations where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"all those concerned are motivated solely by bona fide commercial considerations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given what may hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and other hon. Friends have said, and given that explanatory note, we seem to be mired in confusion, particularly in view of what the Paymaster General said about collusion, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge observed, clearly connotes two parties and not one or more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am rather worried about the principle of justice that is being laid down in the clause. It is an important principle and it would be a mistake for the Committee not to take note of it.
<P>
It is very important that the law offers the possibility of not only being seen to be fair, but being fair. It must offer reassurances to people when they are up against it. What worries me about the Paymaster General's description although I readily accept his reassurances on the question that I asked during my intervention is the difference between reasonable doubt and the balance of probability.
<P>
I am worried lest we construct a system of justice that is based on the balance of probability, rather than matters having to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It would be interesting if Labour Members were freed for the evening from their programmed status of mutedom and could contribute constructively to the debate. The subject is crucial.
<P>
We should establish law and regulation only when we believe that it can have the respect of those who have to abide by it. Having listened to the Paymaster General and read the representations of the Law Society which ought to be a particularly credible institution I have yet to be convinced that this is the right way to proceed. The Paymaster General said that he did not want to pronounce, but it is important that lawyers having to defend people against actions to which the clause may give rise can cite what the Paymaster General said tonight, as well as what Conservative Members said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I want to make two points, which will bring debate on the clause to an end.
<P>
I remind the hon. Member for Witney and other Opposition Members that all tax disputes are settled on the balance of probability. I recognise that not all tax disputes are susceptible to resolution by the means that this particular clause envisages for the Revenue, but to change the balance of probability in this case would be unduly to fuss. As I made clear to the Liberal Democrat spokesman, I do not want to pronounce on individual cases. That must remain my position, as it is for all other tax disputes.
<P>
I stress again that the legislation is not aimed at bona fide sales of companies. In applying the provisions, the Inland Revenue will have regard as it must to that overall purpose.
<P>
As I said, the arrangements that the clause is designed to counter are particularly objectionable, as hon. Members on both sides of the Committee admitted, and pose a considerable threat to the Exchequer. I gave the figure of £100 million a year. There are 40 cases currently being disputed, which amount to some £300 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that the Paymaster General will be grateful if I say that the clause has great merit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am always grateful for interventions from Liberal Democrat Members, especially when they are so helpful. I am pleased to have their support on this matter.
<P>
I commend the clause to the Committee. I hope that Conservative Members will not send out the wrong signals by pressing clause stand part to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to rise again, but I want to place on record the fact that Conservative Members understand what the Government want to achieve in the clause. However, the Paymaster General has ignored the issue about the use of the word "collusion". He said specifically that it would be necessary for the Revenue to demonstrate collusion. That may have been a slip of the tongue; it may have been a mistake if so, it is very important that the hon. Gentleman places that fact on the record now. If the Revenue is successfully to pursue the vendor of a company, will it have to demonstrate collusion between vendor and purchaser to defraud the Revenue of tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I said no such thing. I must make it quite clear that I was instancing one thing that, in the event that it was clearly demonstrated, would naturally fall within the terms of the clause. If the dense and imprenetrable hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has not understood, I repeat that the clause is not aimed at the bone fide sale of companies. In applying the provisions, the Revenue must have regard to the overall purpose.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is clear and I again commend it to the Committee. I urge the Opposition not to send out the wrong signal by opposing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I note that the Paymaster General is gradually spreading the appellation "dense and impenetrable" along these Benches. If my interpretation of what the hon. Gentleman said is wrong, I shall apologise after I have read the Hansard report of our proceedings. If he is wrong, I hope that he will apologise to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As long as the phrase does not spread to this Bench.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 112 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clauses 113 to 115 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Company tax returns, assessments and related matters</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 298, line 19, after "may", insert "reasonably".
<P>
Schedule 18 deals with the regulations affecting self-assessment for companies. Paragraph 21 sets out the detailed requirements for companies to keep books and records.
<P>
I shall start with a prosaic point about the numbering of paragraphs. The Government have tabled various renumbering amendments, but none to paragraph 21 of schedule 18. That paragraph appears to be missing a subparagraph (7), as a sentence at the end of page 298 seems to float on its own. However, I shall leave that for the Paymaster General to respond to when he winds up the debate.
<P>
Paragraph 21 has aroused enormous anxiety outside the House about the burdens that it will impose on British industry. The Institute of Directors has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The record keeping requirement imposed by paragraph 21 is excessive. The effect of paragraph 21 ... is to require companies to keep every letter, every till roll, every petty cash voucher for six years. No trading company is going to comply with this, and it will be a serious waste of the nation's resources for them to do so."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have major reservations as to the duty to keep and preserve records, since they go far beyond the requirements of the Companies Act and will introduce an unduly onerous burden on companies... We are of the opinion that the requirements of the Companies Act are sufficient and that companies should be able to request permission to destroy some of the records on request as they are able to do with VAT."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The criticism continues. The CBI, the great representative of British industry, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We continue to urge that reasonableness and materiality be applied to this situation, and that record keeping which satisfies the Companies Act should also suffice for self-assessment. To do[Mr. Gibb]
<P>
otherwise, as the standard rule, would be to make a mockery of the better regulation campaign of the Government."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it; three quotes from three distinguished organisations which wholeheartedly condemn the Government's legislative record on the issue.
<P>
The Revenue mailshot on self-assessment for companies states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for most companies, in most circumstances, compliance with the requirements of section 221 of the Companies Act 1985 will satisfy the requirements of the tax record-keeping obligation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My amendment would add the word "reasonably" to paragraph 21(1)(a), which should justify the stance taken in the Inland Revenue's mailshot. It would also help companies to plan how they propose to comply with the new obligations, rather than being left with legislation saying one thing and the Revenue interpretation saying another. Most companies will be unable to satisfy the strict letter of the Bill as drafted. It therefore makes sense to amend the Bill to include the word "reasonably". If the Government accept the amendment it would be highly welcomed by Opposition Members and by industry, which, by means of the Bill, faces another Government-imposed burden.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I shall take the narrow point made by the hon. Gentleman and develop my argument from it. It is not that he does not have a point; we are as concerned about the issue as he is. I sometimes think that the deregulation unit creates as much work as it reduces, although I accept that there is a job to be done.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that companies would have to keep large quantities of minor records such as till rolls, receipts for petty cash expenditure and so on, which they do not keep at present. It is not good his developing a general theory from a narrow point when it is clear from the Inland Revenue's draft guidance note that, if such records do not have to be kept for Companies Act 1985 purposes now, they will not have to be kept for self-assessment. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that matter. The key requirement is that records to be kept need to be sufficient to enable a company to make a correct tax return.
<P>
The amendment would mean that the records to be kept would be those reasonably required to make a complete and correct tax return. The implication is that, without the amendment, there would be circumstances in which the requirement to make a correct tax return could place unreasonable record-keeping requirements on companies. Parliament is extremely careful to ensure that none of the tax rules that companies have to apply in calculating their profits impose unreasonable requirements. Not surprisingly, our legal advice is that paragraph 21 as drafted would never be interpreted by the courts in a way that imposed unreasonable record-keeping demands on a company. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take that advice seriously, as we have done.
<P>
My real reason for resisting the amendment is that, in effect, it adds nothing to and subtracts nothing from the necessity to keep all relevant records. I do not think that the inclusion of the word "reasonably" would help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I see that my in-house legal adviser concurs. I am glad, but I assure the Committee that we did not consult beforehand.
<P>
When income tax self-assessment was introduced, the then Labour Opposition made exactly the same point about reasonableness. The previous Conservative Government's reply was exactly the same as mine, and the word "reasonably" was not accepted for the same reason it is otiose.
<P>
If the Government were to accept inclusion of the word "reasonably" in connection with corporaton tax self-assessment, two different definitions and legal renderings would exist. That would not be good. If such an amendment is ever considered necessary, it must be done in a future Bill that ensures that both definitions are amended properly.
<P>
The amendment makes a reasonable point, and we shall bear it in mind. However, it should be noted that some institutions, such as the CBI or the Institute of Directors, seem to consider finding even annual accounts an unnecessary burden on companies. There is no intention to increase the burden on business. As with income tax self-assessment, the aim is to make it possible for companies to assess their tax liabilities correctly and sufficiently.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will be reassured by what I have said, and that he will understand that the consistency between income tax and corporation tax self-assessment should be maintained, not broken unilaterally. If the matter is to be dealt with, it must be in a future Bill that tackles both on the same terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am disappointed by that response. The word "reasonable" is widely used in tax legislation, especially in those provisions giving the Revenue power to seek information from taxpayers. This clause contains a similar provision.
<P>
There should be a distinction between income tax and corporation tax requirements. It is not a great burden for an individual to keep all receipts and vouchers to back up a personal tax return, as there will not be that many. However, the end of paragraph 21(6) what perhaps should be paragraph 21(7) states that "supporting documents" includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"accounts, books, deeds, contracts, vouchers and receipts."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first three stipulations are fair enough, but companies will have millions of vouchers and receipts. As I said in my opening remarks, they will include till rolls in Asda or any supermarket. A phenomenal volume of paper will have to be retained, according to paragraph 21, which does not require the Revenue to act reasonably.
<P>
The inclusion of the word "reasonably" in this measure may make it different from the income tax regulations, but that is irrelevant because the circumstances of large companies and of individual people are different.
<P>
If the Paymaster General cannot accept the amendment, I hope that he will tell the Committee what he means by "vouchers and receipts". That will put the matter on the record, to be used on the basis of Pepper v. Hart. Which vouchers and receipts would he not expect companies to keep for the purposes of the paragraph?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is descending into pettifogging detail. I have made perfectly clear what was not involved, and the details are in the Inland Revenue draft regulations. Everyone knows that, and it is unworthy of the hon. Gentleman to try to make something out of nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall give way in a moment, as I want to make progress.
<P>
The Government will keep the matter under review to see whether some elements of the regulations are unnecessary. However, there are no good grounds for changing the existing consistency between the two kinds of self-assessment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Paymaster-General explain why he will not accept the amendment when paragraph 33 of the relevant notes on clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Paragraph 15, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3), allows a company to amend its company tax return. Such amendments must be notified in the form required by the Inland Revenue and should contain such information and statements as the Inland Revenue may reasonably require"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the notes on clauses say that, why is the Paymaster General not prepared to accept the amendment?<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> As I have explained, we made precisely that point on income tax self-assessment to the Government when we were in opposition. There is no point in introducing a difference between the two forms of self-assessment. We should review the matter. The key point is to ensure that we do not require excessive paperwork and records. Regardless of whether the word "reasonable" is mentioned, the key question is what the Revenue agrees in specific cases. I am sure that we shall be sensible and pragmatic about that.
<P>
We are allowing ourselves to become bogged down. The Government will reconsider the matter in the context of income tax and corporation tax self-assessment if we need to do so. To treat one without the other, however, unbalances a natural consistency that the Conservative party endorsed when it was in government. We take the same position now. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am extremely disappointed by that response. Companies have to obey the letter of the law. The Paymaster General describes a society in which the Revenue can, by diktat and negotiation with the taxpayer, decide who has to keep a large volume of records and who does not. That is what he defines as the Revenue acting reasonably.
<P>
The reasonableness test should apply to all taxpayers and companies. I urge my hon. Friend to press the amendment to a vote, so that we can place on record the fact that Conservative Members believe in minimising the burden of regulation on UK companies, and the fact that the Labour Government are unnecessarily adding to that burden and hindering our competitiveness on the world economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for more than a moment. I may be being more than typically dense and impenetrable, but a brief reading of the clause suggests to me that it seeks to give the Inland Revenue power to allow taxpayers to communicate formally with the Revenue by means other than writing. I can perfectly understand the reasons why such a clause is in the Bill. It strikes me, however, that during the next few years, the entirety of the body of legislation in force will require such changes to allow electronic communication with the bodies of government. Is the Treasury, which is perhaps in the lead on the matter, minded to take it up with the powers that be, with a view to general statutory provision allowing a general permission for communications currently required in writing to be acceptable in electronic form? That is the essence of the clause. Will the Paymaster General give the Committee some insight into the development of the Government's thinking about the matter as we approach the millennium?
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): It is a full moon this evening. As so many Conservative Members have spoken, I thought that I might as well point out the excellent virtues of clause 116 and of the fantastic new Labour initiative that is being brought into law. The Government are opening up the Inland Revenue an organisation not previously known for its user-friendly customer relations, especially under the Conservatives. A new Government have come along and are sweeping out the cobwebs of bureaucracy, opening up the doors and making the Inland Revenue a much more modern service that is willing for customers and taxpayers to have much greater interface with the people who process their taxes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has taken the elementary precaution of checking whether the clause is one of the many that the Paymaster General has told the Committee were already in draft when he came into office last May.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> That is a point for the Paymaster General. I am just keen to point out that a Labour Government are enacting the provisions. I am pleased to be associated with them. Banks do it, insurance companies do it and even mortgage companies do it. Let's do it. Let's involve the Inland Revenue. It should be open and available for telephone calls.
<P>
I have had a short life, and very few dealings with the Inland Revenue. As self-assessment looms large over coming months, I am wary of the fact that I may need to pick up the telephone, give the tax people a quick call and ask the odd word of advice. That is much more attractive to members of the public especially those who do not know the intricacies of tax and of bean counting, as my hon. Friends have called it than written communication. Those of us who are not familiar with the accounting regimes of tax are also more amendable to picking up a telephone and speaking to a friendly and happy person who can advise about our tax affairs. That is the innovative way in which we want the Inland Revenue to develop.
<P>
Why are we doing this? Not only will it open up access to a wider variety of people, but it will provide a better, cheaper and quicker service, remove bureaucracy and end the Inland Revenue's remoteness.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): The hon. Gentleman makes much of the fact that the Inland Revenue and the Labour Government have woken up to the discovery of the telephone, but does he agree that if they really want to be up to date and in the modern age, they should arrange for the Inland Revenue to accept claims by e-mail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> That is an excellent point. In fact, clauses 116 and 117 provide for a greater degree of electronic communication, including internet questionnaires. We will be able to send e-mail queries and hold discussions with our tax man or tax woman via e-mail, if we so wish. That is the beauty of clause 116, which provides for not only the telephone but all other forms of electronic communication. I am not sure, however, that that dialectic would include pagers.
<P>
How is this happening? There is a pilot study, which is an appropriate means of testing such an initiative. I understand that it is intended to set up a call centre in Scotland. I once saw a study which said that call centres thrive in Scotland, as well as in my constituency and in Bradford in Yorkshire, because people tend to trust the Scots and Yorkshire accents. They are trustworthy parts of the world, full of financially prudent people. I commend the Government for locating the call centre in Scotland, and I urge them to consider Shipley as a venue if a further pilot study or call centre is required.
<P>
Other forms of electronic communication will be very useful in future. I am extremely pleased to be associated with these modern and forward-looking provisions. They will open up the doors of the Inland Revenue and enable it to become a popular institution that can be loved and cherished by the great people of this country.

<B>Hon. Members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am delighted that Labour Members have had such a good dinner and are giving me such a warm welcome. I knew that I had brought my fan club with me this evening.
<P>
As someone who launched my own internet site this week and got on to e-mail, I have considerable sympathy with the clause. I want to know whether the Paymaster General has had a chance to consider my earlier request. As a quid pro quo for taxpayers communicating electronically about their affairs with the Revenue, will they be electronically informed by the Revenue of any draft legislation, particularly draft secondary legislation? In that spirit, will the Paymaster General confirm that all electronic communications with the Revenue will meet tax deadlines? How can that be verified if there is a dispute?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is good to talk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I have no intention of talking this Bill out this evening, but I would respond in the good humour that has been shown on both sides of the Committee by saying that the Inland Revenue as well as the Government
