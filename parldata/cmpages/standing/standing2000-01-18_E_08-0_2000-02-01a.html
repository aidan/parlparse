Bill</a></center></H3>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I am grateful to you for allowing me to rise on an issue that has been discussed to some extent—and will be raised again later—namely, the extinguishment of liabilities and ultimately of the net proceeds of the public-private partnership of National Air Traffic Services. The explanatory notes to the Bill imply net proceeds of £15 million. However, I have received an explanatory letter, which has not been circulated to the whole Committee, which suggested that £15 million was not the correct figure. On Thursday last week, in column 92, the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) introduced a new figure of £650 million as the estimated gross consideration of the PPP. We are now totally confused. Will the Under-Secretary furnish us with further information before we discuss the extinguishment of liabilities?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Clearly, that is not a point of order for me because I am not responsible for the provision of information to the Committee, but I always take the view that the more information that is provided to the Committee as soon as possible the better, because it enables Committee members to take informed decisions. The Ministers responsible will have listened attentively and courteously to the hon. Gentleman and if they can—and wish to—assist, they will do so.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to obtain information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 288 in page 13, line 41, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
We require a fuller explanation of how subsection (3) relates to the rest of the clause, as it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Only if the person is carrying on a business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need more of an explanation of how the clause is constructed. Will the Under-Secretary give a more general overview? Under clause 19, the CAA has power to demand information if it appears that the licence holder may have contravened, or may be contravening a ``section 8 duty''.
<P>
In terms of enforcement, would the CAA have power to demand information if it did not appear? On occasions, as the regulator, it would do a spot check, not because it thought that something was wrong, but to keep National Air Traffic Services on its toes—the safety regulation group would every now and then ask the organisation for information. Under the clause, the regulator and the former Civil Aviation Authority have to have a reason for suspicion. That is fine, but, in another walk of life, a police officer can take a heavy goods vehicle off the road and check it to see that everything is all right. We should consider whether a spot check regime would be better. We have talked about the culture being that of a safe organisation. If everything is working properly, NATS should not be worried if on occasions the safety regulation group does a spot check on tapes of what has gone on. Otherwise, it would need a whistleblower or a suspicion for it to act. Will the Under-Secretary explain more fully how clause 19 will operate? Is he satisfied that the provision in clause 19(1) has to be based on suspicion rather than good practice whereby four guys in raincoats could turn up a Monday or a Wednesday and say, ``Give us your information'', which might be a more robust safety regime.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I will deal first with spot checks which were raised by the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms). Although I know that he was not suggesting it, it would not be appropriate for the proposal to appear on the face of the Bill. It concerns the modus operandi for the future relationship between the CAA and the licence holder. I am not sure that the CAA will have thought so far forward at this stage about the way in which it will operate in relation to the licence holder. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will be content if I say that the CAA will want to take cognisance of his observations. We will convey his suggestion to the CAA and pursue the matter with it as we begin to look in more detail at the way in which it will operate the scrutiny regime.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) would extend the effect of clause 19(2)(b) to any person to whom the Secretary of State has served an appropriate notice. Let me explain to the Committee why we want to limit this paragraph to those persons carrying on a business.
<P>
Committee members will have noted that the limit applies only to the supply of information, rather than the supply of documents in the possession of any party. Clause 19(3) would protect individuals in their private capacity from the full impact of this power, which is intended to be directed at businesses. Individuals can be required to produce the documents that they hold, which is straightforward, but are not subject to the potentially wider and more onerous duty to provide information in other ways. The clause is well precedented in utility legislation. I need hardly name the most recent case, which will be familiar to us all—I shall resist that temptation.
<P>
In the circumstance, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation. Whether spot checks are done is a real issue. We all appreciate that the safety regulation group has limited resources and has had difficulty filling all the posts in recent years. There will have to be a good deal of trust between the licence holder and the regulator. Nevertheless, given what the Minister has said and the manner in which he said it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders for securing compliance</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I shall be grateful if the Minister will give the Committee an overview of the enforcement of licence conditions. What is said on page 15 is specific, but what happens when the CAA feels that a licence condition is being breached and the company, becoming aware of that, applies for a modification of the licence? In the clause, if the licence is definitely being breached a final notice is served. If there is an appearance of a breach, a provisional notice with a time limit is served. One could become aware of the fact that an element of the licence was being breached, but the licence holder could then say ``In which case, this is daft. I'm going to apply for a modification''. How do those provisions interrelate and what will be the impact on the enforcement regime? I should be grateful for an explanation. I notice also that clause 21(10)(c) states that no action will be taken when,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the contraventions or apprehended contraventions are trivial''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister give us perhaps six or seven examples of a trivial contravention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am pleased to respond to the hon. Gentleman's request for an overview of this part of the Bill, which is a useful habit that the Committee has adopted. I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's specific questions in due course.
<P>
We spent a considerable time on Thursday and also this morning looking at the first of the two groups of clauses dealing with enforcement. Clauses 15 to 19 concern the enforcement of the licensee's duty under clause 8, and clauses 21 to 25 concern the enforcement of a condition of the licence. As we said on Thursday, we accept in principle that the CAA should be the enforcing authority for the clause 8 duty rather than the Secretary of State and we have agreed to table amendments to that end.
<P>
Clauses 21 to 25 require the CAA to make orders that will be binding on a licence holder where the CAA is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, a condition of the licence—in other words, a final order—and where there appears to the CAA to be a contravention or likely contravention of a licence condition—in other words, a provisional order.
<P>
The clauses mirror clauses 14 to 19 and, as with enforcement of a clause 8 duty, enforcement of a licence condition is by means of an enforcement order containing provisions necessary to secure compliance with the licence condition that is being, or is likely to be, breached.
<P>
This may be an appropriate point to respond to the hon. Member for Poole's question about the CAA having potentially identified a breach of the licence and the licence holder responding. It would be for the CAA to consider whether a modification would adequately remedy the breach; if the breach were sufficiently serious the CAA would nevertheless proceed with an order.
<P>
Two sorts of enforcement orders are set out in the clauses: final and provisional. Before the CAA makes a final order, it must be satisfied that there is a contravention or is likely to be one. To satisfy itself, the CAA will go through a detailed procedure including a comprehensive investigation, where necessary, the giving of notice and the opportunity for challenge. The procedural requirements are set out in clause 22.
<P>
A provisional order is made when it ``appears'' to the CAA that there is a contravention of a licence condition or that there is likely to be one. As such, it can be used as an interim or temporary measure. A provisional order can be made immediately so as to have effect at the earliest possible time to prevent possible or perceived loss or damage to a third party, which may result from the apparent contravention. In other words, a provisional order plugs a gap between there appearing to be a contravention in the first place and the CAA going through the procedures to satisfy itself that there has indeed been a contravention. A provisional order expires after three months unless confirmed—because the CAA is now satisfied that there has been a contravention—or revoked.
<P>
A provisional order must be confirmed, in which case it becomes a final order, if the CAA is satisfied that a licence condition is being contravened or is likely to be contravened and if confirmation is required to ensure compliance with that condition.
<P>
The CAA can make a final order without having first made a provisional order where it is satisfied that there is, or is likely to be, a contravention. Therefore, while a provisional order can be an interim measure, it is not a necessary stage in the process of making a final order.
<P>
Clause 21 requires the CAA to take enforcement action where it is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, the licence condition. Enforcement action is through the routes just described. Clause 21 also sets out the circumstances in which the CAA must not take enforcement action.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked me for five, six or seven examples of trivial contraventions. I hope that he will be content if I offer him two because, if they are trivial, it is difficult to think of the circumstances. It is a challenge, but we have found two examples. One would be the slightly late delivery of regulatory documents or other information for good reason: a good example is to meet a point being made to the regulator. Another example would be a small shortfall in the service standard that is quickly remedied. These seem to be two reasonable examples of trivial cases where further action would not be appropriate or required.
<P>
To continue with my overview before making an order, the CAA must go through a detailed procedure, That procedure, which applies both to making a final order or confirming a provisional one, is set out in clause 22 and includes publishing a notice proposing the order and serving the notice on the licence holder, publishing the order and serving a copy of it on the licence holder and, considering representations made in accordance with the notice. Similar procedures are also put in place to cover modifications to orders, revocations and decisions not to make any order. The procedures then ensure that the process of enforcing the licence condition is properly brought to the attention of the licence holder and all interested parties.
<P>
There are also mechanisms for a licence holder to question the validity of a final or provisional order made—in relation to him—to secure compliance with a licence condition, either on grounds that the CAA has exceeded its powers or that the procedural requirements were not complied with. The licence holder may apply to court to have the order, or part of it, quashed. That is the only way in which the validity of a final or provisional order may be questioned in the United Kingdom courts. These provisions appear in Clause 23.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am aware, and the explanatory notes show that Clauses 21 to 25 are almost inextricably linked, which is why I have not stopped the Minister before now. He will be aware that we are debating clause 21 only. I am prepared to expedite the debate and allow the Minister to continue, but only provided that Back-Bench Members and those on the Opposition Front Bench are satisfied that they can take in the information that is being given at some speed and on the understanding that all Committee members will have the right to challenge or comment later. On that basis, the Minister may proceed, but this should not be regarded as a precedent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale, and I understand your point. We may have to consider a less detailed approach to the overview in future. It is a useful device and it has been a help to the Committee. I will be brief.
<P>
The licence holder to which an order relates is under a duty to comply with the order. Should that be breached, civil legal proceedings may be brought against the licence holder by any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of the breach. In addition, the CAA can enforce compliance with an order by means of an injunction or other relief. A licence holder will have a defence in any such proceedings, if he can prove that he took all reasonable steps to avoid breaching the order. The provisions in clause 24 give access to a remedy for a licence holder's failure in his duty to comply with an order, both for the CAA and for any person who suffers loss as a result of a breach of that duty.
<P>
Finally, to ensure that the CAA may be fully aware and informed of any facts necessary to determine whether a final or provisional order should be made, clause 25 gives the power to obtain information on a possible contravention of a licence condition. The power extends to obtaining information from persons other than the licence holder.
<P>
I hope that that explanation of this part of the Bill has been helpful to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I thank the Minister for giving way and for a very helpful overview. We have been told that it would be in order to question some of the wider aspects. Before the Minister sits down, will he explain the 42-day period in respect of the ability of the licence holder to go to court, either for alleged breach of the licence terms or the ``section 8 duties''? Why 42 days?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall be candid. I do not know why it is 42 days. I note that the legislation has often allowed for periods in which representations may be made of 21 days and I cannot help but note that 42 days is twice that period. There seems to be a certain amount of symmetry in that regard. There may be an explanation in law for that 42-day period. It may relate to other statutes or to procedures of the courts. If that is the case, I shall convey that information in writing to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having allowed the Minister to make a statement that embraced clauses 21 to 25, I am prepared to allow hon. Members to raise issues arising out of any of those clauses, on the understanding that we do not have another full stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Portillo </B>(Kensington and Chelsea): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The Minister has been helpful to the Committee and I was one who suggested that we have such overviews. You will however recognise, Mr. Gale, that we are at a stage of the Bill where we are making quite rapid progress. I had not understood that if we had an explanation covering a number of clauses it would debar us from discussing clause stand part. The Minister proceeded at a fair pace. I would not wish to be tested on everything that he said, as I am not sure that I understood it all first time.
<P>
I do not wish to delay the proceedings, but I had intended to debate clause 22 stand part, when I thought it would be convenient to deal with the way in which the notice is served. I should be grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The guidance is straightforward. As no amendments have been tabled to the clauses, the Chair is not in a position to deny hon. Members a stand part debate if they wish to have one. However, I suggest that they may not entirely have their cake and eat it. If the Chair is to allow a degree of flexibility to enable a slightly more wide-ranging debate over groups of clauses to take place, it is also reasonable for the Chair to exercise some control over the amount of time that is spent. Having said that, let me reiterate that each clause will be called for a stand part debate and if an hon. Member rises, the Chair will probably call him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> On clause 21, I raised the use of the word ``trivial''. The CAA will have to keep a register into which the orders will be put. I am presuming that, since paragraph (10)(c) describes a situation where a provisional order may have been issued but not proceeded with, all those matters, even trivial contraventions, would be swept up into the register. In some regimes, trivial contraventions in themselves do not mean very much, but a series of trivial contraventions, such as information always being given late, would set out the history of the regulation of an organisation. Trivial contraventions on their own might not make much difference, but a series of trivial contraventions might determine how robustly that licence was interpreted.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that under the Bill the information would still be swept up into the register and thus available for public inspection?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, it would. The issues of concern, however trivial, are on the record because the CAA will have considered issuing a final order or confirming a provisional order. It certainly will be on the record and will appear in the register.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Procedural requirements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I would like to reiterate to the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), that I am grateful to him for his overall approach when he explains a number of clauses together. Without in any way contravening that spirit, may I suggest that the performance would be even better if just occasionally he could go a little more slowly in the explanation, perhaps allowing a little shading of light and dark to come into his voice, so that we are better able to take in what he is saying? He has a lovely speaking voice and he ought to allow himself to use it to the full.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I agree about the need for shading in tone of voice, but would not the right hon. Gentleman accept that the Minister uses some wonderful hand gestures?
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> Yes, it really is a great pity that Hansard is unable to include sketches as well as words. I have observed before that the hand gestures rise higher and become faster according to the pressure that the Minister is under. He may relax now and his hands may drop to his sides because I am going to ask him only some very easy questions that relate to what is meant by publishing. ``Published'' is a word that is used many times in this clause. We are talking about giving notice to the licence holder of a possible breach and then taking action in respect of that breach. The clause allows the licence holder the opportunity to make representations.
<P>
A distinction is made in a number of places in the clause between publishing a notice in a manner that the CAA thinks appropriate and serving on the licence holder a copy of that notice. Publishing as the CAA thinks appropriate is what I would like to probe. How, where and for whose eyes is the notice to be published? Clearly, publishing does not necessarily mean the same as simply writing out the notice and serving it on the licence holder. Otherwise, I assume, we would not have two separate subsections dealing with publishing and with serving. There are arguments on either side, for the widest or for minimal publication.
<P>
At a stage when the licence holder has not yet had an opportunity to make a representation, one might say that the notice should not be very widely published. At that stage, the opinion of the CAA does not carry full weight because it is not yet a final decision. Public confidence may be shaken if a notice is published before representations against it have been made. There are questions about market value, because we will be dealing with an organisation with a large element of private ownership and whose shares can be quoted. On the other hand, publication that does not reach very far may be seen to be part of a secretive environment and that may not be thought appropriate either.
<P>
I am sure that the Under-Secretary will say that there are clear precedents for all this and I dare say there are. He may even be able to point out the schedules that describe how publication should be carried through. However, it would be convenient for the Committee to understand how a notice is published and who sees it and, indeed, whether there is a distinction between a provisional notice and a final notice. The arguments that I have been making about the possible undesirability of a provisional notice being widely seen before representations have been made against it would obviously not apply to a final notice. What balance is to be struck between the need for an open environment—the legitimate access of the public to this information—and the premature publication of information that is really an opinion and could be damaging either to public confidence or to market values?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The right hon. Gentleman raises an interesting and important issue. Before I address that, may I hope that there was a certain irony in the complaints about a lack of shading in the way in which I delivered my tour d'horizon earlier. The last thing I seem to have been accused of recently in this Room is a lack of shading in my style. Earlier in the proceedings, the hon. Member for North Essex welcomed me as the pantomime dame. It is not a performance, but entirely natural. In future, I shall attempt to be natural and to inject plenty of shading into my presentations.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before going on to wider issues, let me explain that ``publish'' normally means issuing a press release; making available a public document through a website; sending it to interested persons, who, in the terms of the Bill, are licence holders; and, if appropriate, consultation in advance.
<P>
I fully take the point about the extent of publication of the notice and issues of market sensitivity and how they would affect the licence holder. There is a balance to be struck. In clause 22 we are looking at the preparations before the making of a final order or the confirmation of a provisional order, which implies that a process has already been gone through and the order is, to a greater or lesser extent, in the public domain.
<P>
An interesting issue to which we would expect the CAA to address itself in future is how to approach the issuing of a provisional notice. A provisional notice implies an element of suspicion, and very often the CAA may be responding without investigation to the suggestion that there may be a problem. We should allow that, but the CAA should consider the wider implications and the way in which the licence holder will regarded by the market, with the notice in the public domain.
<P>
It is arguable that by the time of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``making a final order or making or confirming a provisional order''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
there will have been some evidence and investigation, and at that moment it would be appropriate to allow a reasonable amount of publicity on the serving of the notice. Hon. Members will agree that once the notice has been served and the order confirmed, we would expect it, quite reasonably, to appear extensively in the public domain.
<P>
I accept that there is a balance to be struck. At various stages in the CAA's regulatory role, that market sensitivity needs to be observed. I acknowledged earlier that the clause concerns the modus operandi of the CAA, which the Committee had not considered in great detail. I undertake to convey to the CAA, when it studies in detail how to approach these matters, the representations made by the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo).

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I accept his main point, which is governed by the first line of clause 22:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Before making a final order or confirming a provisional order the CAA must''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is right to say that that does not cover the first issuing of a provisional order. That being so, while he was speaking, I was looking back at clause 21, which we have already debated. As far as I could see, the clause was silent on the question of publishing or not publishing a provisional order. I would have expected to find that in clause 21.
<P>
I do not wish to catch the Under-Secretary out, but it seems that he and I share the perception that what happens with a provisional order is important. If the Bill does not say anything about it, it is possible for the CAA to behave inconsistently or capriciously. If one provisional order escaped into the public domain but another was kept quiet, many questions would be asked. In a spirit of friendship, can I ask the Minister to reflect on that? If I am right, would it be useful to be specific about how provisional orders should be handled?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the point being made by the right hon. Gentleman and I shall consider it sympathetically and determine whether we want to revisit the matter at a future stage.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we embark, when I ruled earlier, I said that it was perfectly possible to have a debate on clause 22 because no amendments were tabled. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that there are two amendments tabled to clause 23 that have already been debated. That ruling does not therefore apply to this clause and I would not wish to go over ground that we have already covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am fully aware of your ruling and mindful of it, Mr. Gale. I would hesitate before arousing that irascibility for which you are famed—but which I have never seen myself.
<P>
The orders made under clauses 20 to 23 are made exclusively by the Civil Aviation Authority. Clause 23 is about the ability of the licence holder to challenge the validity of an order, but where the Secretary of State makes similar orders, no such ability is set out specifically, although the Secretary of State is always open to judicial review. Will the Minister explain why vulnerability is created for the Civil Aviation Authority and not, elsewhere in the Bill, for the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. We do not quarrel with the right to make such representations to the Secretary of State and in earlier exchanges we debated at some length the opportunities for the licence holder to do so.
<P>
It is an important observation, Mr. Gale, because it responds to the point with which you dealt—that this group of clauses mirrors the earlier set under the enforcement of ``section 8 duties'', clauses 15 to 19, and the language is practically identical throughout. The precise answer to the point being made by the hon. Member for North Essex is that clause 23 mirrors clause 17, which we have, of course, already debated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, I fully accept that, except that following our sweeping victory last week, the Government accepted in principle substantial amendments to clauses 15 to 18, notably that the Secretary of State should be taken out of the equation. Elsewhere in the Bill, where the Secretary of State makes orders they are not as open to challenge as provided for in clauses 23 and 17.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has made it clear that this set of clauses parallels an earlier set, the similarity of which is now more apparent because the Minister has accepted in principle that the Secretary of State should be taken out of the equation in clauses 15 to 19. However, elsewhere in the Bill, where the Secretary of State makes orders, he is not explicitly open to challenge by the licence holder on the validity of those orders. I wonder why the Secretary of State should not be put in a similar position with these orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I begin to get a little confused by the hon. Gentleman. The provisions of clause 23 make it clear that the licence holder may apply to the court. The explanations of the powers there are set out in clause 17. I am not sure what problem the hon. Gentleman is identifying. That legal recourse seems to be evident on the face of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are rapidly going up a cul de sac and I do not want to press the matter any further. I have no doubt that there will be opportunities to raise a similar point later in the Bill.

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): I shall not detain the Committee long. The clause seems familiar to me. I believe that it may appear in the Railways Act 1993. The clause gives the Civil Aviation Authority considerable powers and I should like to test with the Minister the extent of those powers. There are clearly concerns when a body that is not a police body or a law enforcement agency has such powers. I understand the necessity for them, but perhaps the Minister will help me on the limits of those powers.
<P>
The whole operation is based on the fact that it must appear to the Civil Aviation Authority that the licence holder may have contravened, be contravening or be likely to contravene a licence condition. That is done simply on a suspicion, I take it. What happens if the CAA then requires that private company to produce various documents and is shown to have been wrong in its judgment? It would be very damaging for the reputation of a public company to have a Civil Aviation Authority hit on it. Would there be any recourse for the company if the CAA were found to have acted wrongly? It is a matter of the CAA's judgment; how would the company challenge that judgment?
<P>
The documents that the CAA is entitled to obtain are specified in the clause. Does that allow it also to go on a fishing operation? Could the Civil Aviation Authority send a gang of heavies round to the company to go through its filing cabinets and computers to find something that it believes may exist? Is it given a free hand, or is it circumscribed in exactly what it can do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I want to raise one specific issue about the power to obtain information under clause 25. It concerns information arising from confidential reporting systems. Those are vital for the safety of the operation and are an integral part of the safety management of the staff and operations. Their integrity relies on their confidentiality. They are not used, for example, for punishment or disciplining. The procedures are outside the line management structure. They are not used for assessing people's careers or judging their performance. They would be open to abuse, but because air traffic controllers are professional people they do not abuse them. However, would not it be unfortunate if, when a dispute arose between the licence holder and the CAA, or between the licence holder and the Secretary of State, in the scrabbling around for evidence against the licence holder the information became germane to the debate?
<P>
I am looking for an assurance from the Minister that such confidential reporting procedures would be protected from any power to obtain information. That may seem contrary to the spirit of co-operation that exists between the CAA and the licence holder, but if the air traffic controllers are to have confidential reporting procedures they will want to know that the information cannot be used in a contractual dispute and find its way into the public domain. That would completely undermine their confidence in the system of confidential reporting, which is so vital to the safety of the operation.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> My hon. Friend has raised an interesting point, although I wondered whether the information really came in two parts. There is the information itself—a report that something untoward has occurred that has raised a doubt or a question or an anxiety in the mind of the person making the report—and there is the source of that report: either the name of the person who made it or such information as to make their identity obvious. I am not sure whether I am agreeing with my hon. Friend here, but I am just probing. It seems to me at first blush that it might be quite worrying if the information itself was debarred from being discovered through the process described in the clause, because information about something that had gone wrong—some lapse or systemic failure—might be interesting and important. Let me put it the other way round: if information was sought and it then became clear that whole categories of information had been excluded because they arose from that reporting system, the public might be somewhat alarmed.
<P>
On the other hand, I entirely take the thrust of what my hon. Friend said. If people suspected not only that the information that they gave would be produced in another context but that their anonymity would be breached, that information would not be forthcoming in the first place. As with so many of the issues that we have debated, it seems to be a finely balanced issue. We cannot tell the Government that it is clearly black and white. My hon. Friend and I want to know that the Government have really thought through some of the issues and have a good idea of how the provisions will work in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This has been an important exchange and we are dealing with very sensitive matters. In all accuracy, one could not offer an absolute guarantee that such confidential reports could not be used ever, in any circumstances. That goes for sources, which was the concern of the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea, as well as the objects of the reports, which seemed to be the greater concern of the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
In the context of defaults and defective behaviour on the part of the licence holder, it will not always be obvious that such information will be germane in any case to the regulatory activity of the CAA, which forms part of the clause. However, let me offer what I consider to be powerful reassurances about access to information and confidential incident reporting.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) asked about access to information. Schedule 9 restricts the disclosure of information obtained under the Bill and provides additional safeguards. For example, paragraph 1(2) of schedule 9 states that information relating to an individual may not be disclosed in his lifetime except to other relevant authorities on a protected basis.
<P>
On the broader issue of confidential incident reporting, I assure the Committee that the confidentiality of incident reporting procedures is highly regarded in the aviation world and will be respected by the CAA. In other words, there is a tremendous presumption towards the protection of such information and there are provisions in the Bill to afford protection to individuals. However, it would not be right to give an absolute guarantee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Portillo:</B> I was not entirely sure whether the first and last comments that the Minister made were consistent. He began by saying that he would not want to give any assurance about the confidentiality either of matters or of the persons who had raised those matters. Then, towards the end, he said that confidentiality was highly regarded. What may bring the two things together is that he said that the information would not pass outside the CAA. Is he saying that the confidential reporting system might be the object of an application under the clause, but even if it were, once the CAA had the information it would not go any further? I am not sure that that is plausible. The CAA will have to take a view on the information that it has received. Will the Minister reflect a little further on that? There will be intense interest in the matter because people who are in the habit of participating in the system will want some fairly black and white answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will reflect on it. I do not believe that there is a contradiction in what I was saying. We are dealing to some extent with customer practice and the way in which the system operates. I return to the observation that confidentiality of such reporting is essential to the system and highly regarded. The presumption is that there would have to be entirely exceptional circumstances for such information to be the object of disclosure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Perhaps I might be helpful to the Minister. My understanding would be that the information that is obtained would be through the type of inquiry or investigation that is carried out by the CAA under clause 34. That information would then form part of the register, which is covered by clause 35. Clause 35(5) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``So far as practicable the CAA must secure the exclusion from the register of any matter relating to the affairs of a person if the CAA thinks its inclusion would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the person's interests.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (6) gives the Secretary of State the right to intervene. I suggest to the Minister that the issue is that the CAA is judge and jury, and there may be cause to reflect on the right in clause 35 of a person to apply to the court for the exclusion of information before it is published.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to the provisions of clause 35. We can pick up these matters when we come to that important clause. It will be of assistance both to him and to the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea if I say that the identity of people providing information will be protected. The key objective of the exchanges is the concern about prejudice towards individuals in terms of the information that has been disclosed or the activities that have been reported on. Our total expectation is that in these activities by the CAA the identity of people providing information will be protected.
<P>
I revert briefly to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Hexham. I was interested in his reservations about fishing operations. They did not seem to be different necessarily from the spot checks advocated earlier by the hon. Member for Poole. I assure the hon. Gentleman that a fishing operation is limited by the reference in subsection (4) to nothing not discoverable in court. On his point about recourse, if the CAA gets it wrong, the Bill requires that it must act reasonably. It will also be subject to judicial review. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Committee should be extremely grateful to the Under-Secretary for the candid and open way in which he deals with sensitive issues, but I regret to say that I am not entirely comforted by what he has told the Committee this morning about the potential operation of the clause.
<P>
The Confidential Human Factor Incidents Reporting Programme—CHIRP—is one of the issues raised by the air traffic controllers' employee representatives, who clearly regard it as important. In their submission to the Select Committee, they said that they wanted it to be strengthened. The time may not be right to discuss it in detail, but that would seem to reduce confidence in the system, notwithstanding the Minister's assurance that it would not be the intention of the Government or the CAA to release the identity of people making such reports. That is in keeping with the culture and spirit of civil aviation safety in the United Kingdom. The positive and co-operative atmosphere between licence holder and licensor may not always exist.
<P>
One need only look at the atmosphere that surrounded the Paddington crash, where deep mistrust between operators, Railtrack, the Government and the Health and Safety Executive was fermented over a period of days. Accusations were flying around, people were saying, ``People should pay for this; they should go to prison; those responsible should be punished.'' After the Stansted air crash, people were asking who was responsible. At present, the CAA handles accidents much more professionally than the rail companies. Trust can easily break down and the search for scapegoats can run rampant around the media and affect the judgment of politicians and those in positions of authority. It would be contrary to the general duty of the Secretary of State or the Civil Aviation Authority to consider for a moment breaching confidence by releasing names. It does not say that in clause 25, although it is provided for in clause 35, as pointed out by the hon. Member for Bath [Interruption.] Does the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) want to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): I was following the hon. Gentleman's earlier lead. I was not sure whether he was making an intervention or a speech here. I agree with some of the things that he said, but the fragmentation of the railway industry was, at least in the main, the responsibility of the previous Government. On scapegoats, does he not agree that it is deplorable of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) to accuse the Deputy Prime Minister of doing nothing about rail safety on the Great Western main line following the Paddington accident?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall treat that comment with the contempt that it deserves and I suspect that it is out of order, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You suspect absolutely correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The point that I was making was that after an accident of that sort, the usual bonds of trust in an industry could break down extremely quickly. That may well happen in the aftermath of an aviation accident, if it is thought that an air traffic controller or a group of air traffic controllers made a mistake. It might be completely wrong, but the public will want to know the names, and when they hear of the Confidential Human Factor Incidents Reporting Programme they will realise that that information will not be released. That could be the situation during a dispute between the licence holder and the CAA.
<P>
Will the Minister reflect on whether the clause provides air traffic controllers with sufficient confidence to carry on in the safe knowledge that whatever they report through the process, their anonymity will be maintained and guaranteed? There should be an obligation for the licence holder not to release names. I cannot understand how, if the names are not germane to the issue, putting in such protection would weaken the purpose of the set of clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I accept that the hon. Gentleman raises important issues. I remind the Committee that I have spoken before about the important role of confidentiality as part of the ethos of the industry, and there will be a powerful desire to preserve that.
<P>
I have shown that there are certain safeguards in the Bill about disclosure and I have sought to emphasise that the identity of those providing the information will be protected. Those are powerful reassurances for the staff and, I hope, for the hon. Gentleman. I assure the Committee that it is the Government's intention to preserve the efficacy of the two confidential reporting systems, and we have give such assurances to the unions as well. However, I will reflect on whether the present wording is adequate for the purpose. I hope that that will be acceptable to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Protection of licence companies, etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This clause seems to be a critical part of the Bill since it deals with administration orders. It will be helpful if the Minister will set out exactly how it will operate. As I see it, there are two conditions that would cause an administration order to be made. The principal one would simply be the company being short of funds and unable to carry on and the other would be a breach of safety regulations.
<P>
We need to have a clear idea of how the provision would operate. As the Bill stands, if a creditor bank were concerned about whether it would get its money back, it could go for an administration order. It does not necessarily have to come from the Secretary of State or the CAA. Any commercial organisation that tried to have an administration order served on a company would have to be aware of the fact that, as the Bill stands, it could destroy that company. Under later clauses the licence may have to be transferred either to another company or to different companies, paying regard to those people who have liabilities in the former concern. I still believe it unlikely that a bank would wish to go down that path since it would be imperilling its own loans. We need a much fuller explanation of how that will work.
<P>
It is also conceivable that somebody might go for an administration order and the courts could refuse it. They might say that it was not appropriate. Given what my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea said earlier, that may well have an effect on the share price of the business.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave an overview of the impact of an earlier group of clauses. We have a similar position now in respect of clause 26, the subsequent clauses and the three related schedules, 1, 2 and 3, which form something of a whole and cover the procedure for administration orders. I propose to say something about the general effect of this group of clauses, without precluding the right of hon. Members to raise specific points on the individual clauses.
<P>
Clauses 26 to 33 and schedules 1, 2 and 3 relate to air traffic administration orders. They are important, and it may be helpful if I set out why. The United Kingdom is bound by article 28 of the Chicago convention to provide air navigation services in its territory. Notwithstanding that obligation, it is clearly essential for the Government to be able to ensure the continuity of air traffic services in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances. The air traffic administration order provisions allow the Government to step in should the continuity of services be threatened.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole described two possible circumstances in which the problem could arise: if the strategic partner of a company was unable to meet its liabilities, and if there was a breach of safety requirements. In fact, there are five sets of circumstances set out in clause 28, but they essentially come down to a broadly similar division between two areas: circumstances leading to insolvency or normal winding-up procedures; and a breach of either the requirements of clause 8 or the licence conditions.
<P>
The main foreseeable threat is the risk of insolvency when creditors and others would normally be able to apply for an administration or winding-up order under the Insolvency Act 1986. Unless special provisions were set by the Bill, those would be the statutory measures available. Creditors who were concerned about potential insolvency would be able to avail themselves of those provisions However, implementation of the normal Insolvency Act 1986 provisions could result in the business being wound up, which would be disastrous if there were not parallel arrangements to ensure the continuity of air traffic services. That is why the special regime, which is covered in these clauses, is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Before the Minister explains how the administration orders work, will he clarify whether, if the non-regulated parts of the business became insolvent, the regulated parts—the air traffic control parts—might equally have to come under an air traffic administration order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The provisions of this part of the Bill relate to the potential insolvency of the strategic partner. If that were triggered by circumstances outside the licence activity, such an eventuality could arise. These provisions are in place to maintain the continuity of the licence activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): Who does the Minister envisage will audit the insolvent state of the company?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was going to explain the way in which these procedures will operate. The hon. Member will have received a huge wodge of paper today, for which I apologise, Mr. Gale, but we have been trying to honour our commitment to make available to Committee members the necessary background paperwork. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the articles of association and the shareholder's agreement he will see specific provisions for ensuring a close audit on these matters. When we come to clauses 40 and 49, I will be able to say a great deal more about the safeguards that are built in there and through those articles and the agreement to ensure that the public interest is fully protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was momentarily distracted by the large wodge of paper that arrived in the post this morning, for which we are extremely grateful. The Minister may have solved one mystery that has troubled me about this section of the Bill which is that, in these clauses, the licence holder is referred to as the ``licence company''. If we are concerned about the solvency, or the possible insolvency, of not merely the sub-entity of a group that is holding the licence, but the whole conglomerate that might be the controlling partner in the organisation that holds the licence, are we bringing into the scope of this agreement a much larger entity and a lot of unlicensed activities rather than merely the subsidiary of the company that might be the licence holder?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As we have explained in previous exchanges, we do not yet know the identity of the strategic partner. Therefore, is impossible to be precise. In the event of the strategic partner being a company with wider interests, which is a possible option, or indeed a consortium, the external interests of that company or consortium, apart from the licensed activities, might well create a situation in which insolvency could occur. In that situation, there must be safeguards to ensure the maintenance of air traffic services that are our primary concern. That explains this provision and it probably explains the differential wording in the explanatory notes. As we explained at the outset, the notes are compressed and do not always provide the detail that hon. Members would like.
<P>
To return to the circumstances in which an administration order may be necessary, we must ensure continuity and provide, if necessary, for the transfer of the licensed activities to another company or group of companies if the licensee demonstrates himself to be either incapable or unwilling to provide the required level of services by being in serious breach of duties under section 8 or a related enforcement order. Therefore, we need to provide a number of protective mechanisms to cover those eventualities.
<P>
Argument A of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) applies in this case. I shall not deploy it, but the hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that similar provisions are commonplace in other utility regulation legislation. To put it in context, I should also stress that, to our knowledge, we do not know of the equivalent provisions ever having been activated. Hopefully, it will never be necessary for them to be activated in the case of air traffic service, but the safeguards must be in place to ensure that we can act decisively, if that should ever prove necessary.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clauses 26 and 27 cover the legal protection of licence companies from the consequences of insolvency. We intend that no person—such as a creditor—will be able to enforce any security over the property of the licence holder or apply to a court for a winding up order against the licence holder without giving 14 days' notice to the Secretary of State. Picking up the point made by the hon. Member for Poole, that is the first important action that it is open to a creditor. If the special provision were not in place, creditors would seek action under the normal provisions of the Insolvency Act. We are including a special provision for 14 days' advance notice to be given to the Secretary of State, who will then have a window of opportunity to consider whether it would be appropriate to apply to the court for an air traffic administration order to be made or whether some other action would be more appropriate. The whole mechanism can be set in train by that process.
<P>
If an application is made to the court for a winding-„up order against the licence company and the court is minded to make the order, it must make an air traffic administration order, rather than a normal insolvency order, to achieve the effects that I described.
<P>
Clause 28 provides five conditions, under which the court may make an air traffic administration order. All those relate to the company being unable to pay its debts, to the order being just to wind up the company or to the company being in breach of a statutory duty, a licence condition or an enforcement order.
<P>
Clause 29 describes the purposes of an air traffic administration order, which are to ensure the continuity of air traffic services by transferring the licensed activities as a going concern to another company or companies. That should be done in a manner that protects the interests of the licence company's members and creditors, but—and I stress—the primary purpose of the provision is that the performance of licensed services is maintained at the levels required by section 8 and set out in the licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The licence company would include the percentage owned by the Government. The Government's shareholding is no better or worse than that of the private shareholder—they are in exactly the same situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> That is correct, although, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate when we consider the shareholder agreement, in the event of the order being made and another body coming in to perform the licensed function, the Secretary of State and the Government will have no further need to hold its shareholding in the former licensed company whose activities have been transferred. There is a special provision for the disposal of the Secretary of State's shares in those circumstances—again, to protect the public interest. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that the Government, who are a significant shareholder, are in the same position, in general terms, as any other shareholder, apart from the responsibilities that I have described.
<P>
Clause 29 describes the purposes of an air traffic administration order, which are to ensure the continuity of air traffic services by transferring them as a going concern.
<P>
Clause 30 introduces schedules 1 and 2, the first of which is concerned with the incorporation of the relevant Insolvency Act provisions into the air traffic administration order regime. I stress that that is not the total sum of the insolvency legislation, for obvious reasons, because there have to be special provisions, but all the relevant and appropriate provisions in the Act are incorporated through the schedule.
<P>
Schedule 2 provides details of ``schemes'', which are the mechanism by which the air traffic administrator ensures that a new licence company has everything that it needs to carry out licensed activities in all or part of the licensed area. That would cover, for example, property rights and interest.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Perhaps the Minister will bear with my small brain if I raise again an issue with which I am still having some difficulty. Condition 5 refers to the disposal of relevant assets. I can imagine a situation in which the strategic partner in NATS has been involved in the purchase of some new equipment necessary for the ever safer delivery of air traffic services. In the event that it is necessary to wind up the company, but the Government desire to continue the delivery of air traffic services, will the Minister explain yet again, so that I can get to grips with it, what happens to new assets purchased by the company that are not covered by condition 5? Will they be available in their entirety to the new company that is to form part of NATS and who will pay for the retiring company's share of the assets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman modestly described himself as being a bearer of little brain. While I do not for a moment accept that, the immense complexities of the provisions are, perhaps, a little difficult to grasp at the first attempt. That is why, honouring the pledge I gave last week, I sent out a summary of the range of interlocking safeguards and a brief comment on their impact on assets. If the hon. Gentleman refers to that letter and the document enclosed with it, in paragraph 11, I describe how, if a new licensed company has taken on the arrangements and the previous one is no longer performing its functions, there would normally be the standard market clearing procedure for the transfer of any assets from the one to the other.
<P>
In the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman set out, the acquisition of the assets would be by the company as a whole, not uniquely by the strategic partner, which we envisage having a shareholding of 46 per cent. at the outset. The strategic partner would have an interest and that could pass through normal market mechanisms to the new partner. We would expect that to happen, but the strategic partner would certainly not be the only interested party. It would have a share in the total, but it would not be the sole owner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Not only am I a bearer of a small brain, but I have not received the letter. The document to which the Minister refers is one that I have not yet had the opportunity of seeing. Perhaps he will understand therefore, if I defer any response to his comments to a later date when I have received and read my post.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On a point of order. I also have not received the documents to which the Minister referred. The last communication that I received was a letter to Mr. Benton dated 31 January. If documents are to be circulated to members, would it be possible in future to bring spare copies to the Committee so that we can read them on the spot?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Strictly speaking that is not a point of order for the Chair, but the Minister has heard the request. It is up to him and his Department to make documents available to Committee members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry if individual Committee members have not received copies of the various papers that my right honourable Friend, the Minister for Transport—a Minister in another place—and I arranged to send out.
<P>
We have spare copies here and I will certainly ensure that they are made available so that hon. Members who want to check them over the lunch break may have a full opportunity to do so. It was certainly our intention to get copies out to all members of the Committee before this morning's proceedings.
<P>
Continuity is important, and financial assistance might be required to ensure it—for instance, if a previous strategic partner faced insolvency. Clause 31 therefore empowers the Government, with Treasury consent, to provide financial assistance to the new licence company to ensure the continuity of services.
<P>
Finally, clause 32 relates to the reporting of financial support to Parliament and clause 33 introduces schedule 3. The schedule makes necessary changes in Northern Ireland law to ensure that an air traffic administration order has the equivalent effect there.
<P>
Taken together, the proposals provide the necessary safeguards to meet our primary objective, which is to ensure the continuity of air traffic services in the unlikely circumstances that I have outlined. Although we shall probably never need them, it is right and proper that they should be in place to ensure that the United Kingdom can provide continuity of air services in all events. I hope that hon. Members recognise the importance of this group of clauses, and understand the reasons for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall reply briefly to a central point made by the Minister in his tour d'horizon—a phrase beloved by the Committee when speaking about this group of clauses.
<P>
The Minister seemed to touch on the central conundrum of the notion of a PPP. Under a straightforward privatisation, the privatised company assumes the risk and may become bankrupt—in which case legislation would allow the activities of that company to be carried out by the Government, who would step in as a safeguard of last resort. However, a PPP such as the one proposed is quite different, because the Government will remain a substantial shareholder, owning 46 per cent. of the shares.
<P>
The Minister described a company—in which the Government will own a large part—which, if it goes bust, will lay people off and be wound up. The Government will not fork out to help meet the company's debts. They will take no action, acting instead as a sleeping shareholder or pretending to be the same as any other shareholder. The Government will allow the company to be wound up, and will then step in and serve an administration order of the sort described by the Minister, so that the regulated activities of the company can continue. Under schedule 3, the Government may even decide, with the Treasury's consent, to give money to the new licence holder to allow the regulated activities to continue. That is a peculiar attitude to risk. The Government are saying that they would not prevent the company being wound up; indeed, they would want it to be wound up if that was a normal commercial consequence of its activities. They would then take steps to ensure that the company's licensed activities could continue and would even consider lending the company money.
<P>
Such muddled thinking about risk brings us back to the income generated from the sale—a subject that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex mentioned on a point of order at the start of the sitting. The Government have not thought carefully enough about the risk for the company. What will happen if the company fails? What will happen to the company's debts—to NATS debts, as they will be after privatisation? Above all, why should the Government step in with administration orders or lend money to the new licensee when they have some share—a 46 per cent.—share in allowing the company to go down? It would be useful if the Minister gave us some feel for his justifying that sort of public-private partnership rather than a straightforward privatisation, where the location of risk is completely clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point about the fundamental nature of the PPP. One would have expected the Government's 46 per cent. shareholding to have considerably reduced the risk of insolvency. The real risk lies not in the possibility that the activity itself will become insolvent, but in the possibility that the strategic partner will become financially vulnerable. We must ask ourselves whether the arrangements allow the Government to protect the solvency and operations of air traffic services, and whether in doing so they do not absolve the strategic partner's creditors and shareholders of their obligation to pay their whack to maintain the solvency of the services.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, we would expect the Government to act decisively to take the operation 100 per cent. under the control of the Crown as a matter of urgency, rather than be involved in extensive negotiations to prop up some foreign parent that might have had difficulty with foreign operations. The priority must be to maintain the viability of air traffic operations, regardless of what happens to the strategic partner.
<P>
Having a 46 per cent. strategic partner is probably a riskier way in which to bring in private capital than a straightforward flotation of the business. A flotation would leave no other potential liabilities on the licence holder except the obligation to maintain the confidence of its shareholders. By incorporating that business into the balance sheet of another business involved in all kinds of activities, we increase the risk.
<P>
The copy of the letter to the Chairman of the Committee from the Minister, which I received last night, comforts me. It reassures the hon. Member for Bath about how the assets would be transferred if an administration order were in force, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There is precedent for this; the expiry and non-renewal of Broadcasting Act licences to franchisees has been accompanied by transfers of assets between outgoing and incoming licensees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although there may be a dispute between the licensee and the Government or the CAA, there is unlikely to be one between the outgoing and incoming licensees, so the transfer of assets should proceed quite safely. Whether the outgoing licensee was in administration, liquidation or subject to some sequestration order by a creditor, it could be only in its interests if the licence were to be taken away to dispose of the assets as quickly and efficiently as possible for the maximum possible value. The only buyers would be either the Crown or the incoming licensee.
<P>
I have broad confidence in the proposals, but the overriding objective of the clause must be to provide administration arrangements that do not require that the service be switched off at any time. NATS cannot be switched off. The aircraft have to keep flying, and the consequence of closing NATS would be to ground every civil aircraft in the country. That would cut off this country from the continent, as we have been told that fog used to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend says that he takes great comfort from the letter and the clause, but surely all that he is saying is that the Government will bear the sum total of all the risk. They are saying that things shall be the same as they are at the moment, and that even if the strategic partner goes bust because of some dodgy air traffic operation in Mongolia, they shall continue as before. In other words, there will not be a privatisation, or even a PPP; the Government will play the same role as now, with the taxpayer taking the risk and possibly having to bail out the strategic partner. Although my hon. Friend can take comfort from the point of view of safety in the air, from the point of view of commercial activity, surely the Government will create the worst of all possible worlds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I understand what my hon. Friend means. He requires comfort from the Minister that at no point will taxpayers' money be given to an incompetent operation or parent company to ensure that that company continues to be the licence holder. We want comfort from the Minister that in such circumstances the company involved would be cut off without a penny and that the powers would be used to secure air traffic control services at the minimum liability to the Government, regardless of whether that meant that the previous strategic partner failed. Such circumstances might put pressure on the Government. Were the strategic partner to be a British company that employed a lot of people in this country, the Government would be under intense pressure not to seize this prized asset from the company and put it back under the ownership and control of the Crown. I should like an assurance from the Minister that, were such a bottomless pit to emerge, the powers would not be an extension of the old George Brownian industrial policy, like a National Enterprise Board plan, and that the principal purpose of the powers is to ensure efficient air traffic control at minimum cost.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) can take comfort in the fact that the risk would be transferred inasmuch as, in the event of insolvency, the provisions would apply only if the strategic partner has already lost all its money. That must happen before the taxpayer comes on line. Provision must be made to allow the Secretary of State to provide resources to air traffic control in the event of resources being unavailable from anywhere else to pay the electricity bill and staff salaries and to maintain the viability of the pension scheme, which we intend to discuss later.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): When my hon. Friend the Minister introduced the clause, he explained that it was exceedingly important, and it is. If an administration order is granted, the court is essentially appointing someone to take control of the deployment of the company's assets and its operation.
<P>
Ministers have frequently reminded us that we are dealing with a monopoly provider of a service that is essential in the national interest. Indeed, the fact that it is essential in the national interest and that, as hon. Members have pointed out, continuity of service is essential is one of the reasons—but not the only one—why other Governments, such as France, Italy and Germany in the European Union and the United States, consider it right that a public service should be provided by the public sector.
<P>
The Opposition spokesperson said that an order is less likely because the company will have a 46 per cent. stake in the new operation. The logic of that argument is that the Conservative's policy of complete privatisation would, presumably, involve a greater risk of Government intervention. The hon. Gentleman seemed to be saying that in such circumstances the Government should intervene, take the asset into public ownership and run it as a publicly owned operation, as it is run at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is a slight advance on what I said. What would happen would depend on the balance of probabilities of where the least liability lay. If allowing the licence holder to continue to operate the business would be likely to increase the liability to the taxpayer, there would be an obligation in the short term to take the business back into public ownership or to find another licence holder, which would be possible in such circumstances. The management of air traffic control could establish its own company and become the strategic partner, if only for a limited period. Bringing the business back into public ownership may not be the only option.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I have a question. I want to raise a point on clause 28; as we are taking the clauses together, should I raise it during the stand part debate on that clause, if we are to have one, or now?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It would be perfectly appropriate to ask for a stand part debate on clause 28.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> In that case, I will leave the remainder of my remarks until then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I want to make a point about the administration order, having glanced through some of the documents. The partnership directors obviously have responsibility for the company and also have a certain responsibility to the Crown. On the basis that it is difficult to serve two masters at once, it is conceivable that, as they sit on the audit committee and have the power to request the company to clarify its financial arrangements, the partnership directors may become concerned about its viability and credit worthiness and report the matter to the Crown. The Crown might decide that things are so bad that it issues an administration order, as a result of which the share price collapses and money is lost. Where do partnership directors stand in that situation? They have fulfilled an obligation to the Crown but possibly not to the shareholders of the company. Are they likely to be sued? What is their legal position? Are they damned if they do and damned if they do not? Has the Crown thought of that eventuality?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Two key issues have emerged from the debate, the first of which concerns the circumstances in which insolvency may occur. Rather different interpretations have come from the hon. Members for North Wiltshire and for North Essex; I agree more with the latter about what is likely to happen. Concern has also been expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) and the hon. Member for Poole, who raised an interesting question about the role of the partnership directors. I shall address that point first.
<P>
The partnership directors are part of the arrangement to ensure that there is close scrutiny of the company's financial affairs and that the public interest is safeguarded. As the hon. Member for Poole rightly said, partnership directors have, in their role as directors and under the Companies Acts, normal obligations to the company but also a specific obligation to safeguard the Crown interest in that company. Clearly, were a situation to arise along the lines that he suggested, in which they were concerned about the financial viability of the company, their obligation would be to raise that with the board of directors, and that is provided for specifically in the shareholders' agreement. If they did not succeed in securing satisfaction as a result of those internal discussions within the company, they would then have an obligation to raise the matter with the Secretary of State.
<P>
At that point, the Secretary of State may seek to use his considerable powers to avoid a situation whereby air traffic services could not be maintained. This is pure surmise on my part, but I think it unlikely that the Secretary of State would seek an insolvency order or an air traffic administration order in such circumstances. It is far more likely that Secretaries of State would use their powers to serve a preliminary order or to seek a transfer to another strategic partner who would take on the role in an orderly way.
<P>
The situation that the hon. Gentleman envisaged, whereby the partnership directors could be in a cleft stick, is unlikely to arise, but we accept that they have dual responsibilities and have tried to ensure that there are mechanisms in place to enable them to cope with circumstances and fulfil those dual responsibilities without putting themselves in jeopardy. I will take further advice on that because it is a difficult technical point relating to company law and obligations. If I need to add any qualifications to what I have said, I will write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister has pre-empted me, as I was about to ask him to do that very thing—to report to us verbally or to send us another little note.
<P>
Directors have to balance different interests—their responsibilities to shareholders, creditors and employees and their contractual obligations to customers. Would it not strengthen the Government's position if the articles of association—I have not yet read them—included a provision that obliged all directors to have regard to the obligations of the licence? That would put an explicit obligation on the company, instead of putting one class of directors in an invidious position, perhaps with regard to creditors and employees or to other obligations of the company. It seems to be a slightly unusual situation. I have been in that situation myself; I was an institutional director in a business that represented institutions. It should always be made plain that the first obligation of a director is to the company as a whole, not to an individual interest that might have put the director in place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that I can give the assurance for which the hon. Gentleman looks. All directors—not just the partnership directors—will be obliged to have regard to the maintenance of the objectives of the licence and the delivery of the air traffic service for which the company has been established. The partnership directors are in a special position; they are the conduit for communication with the Secretary of State if they feel that the board of directors as a whole is acting in a way that could jeopardise the public interest.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will recall the explanation that I gave about the process that will be followed when the partnership directors initially speak to their fellow directors about their concerns. Only if they believe that the board of directors as a whole is unlikely to act in a way that would safeguard the company's interests and thereby ensure the maintenance of air traffic services and the safeguarding of the public financial interest can they proceed along the second route. It is a stopgap. It is yet another safety measure. I hope that hon. Members will recognise that this carefully crafted series of safeguards is designed to ensure the maintenance of air traffic control in all circumstances.
<P>
I return to a point raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. The hon. Member for North Essex hit the nail on the head. I tried, rather imperfectly, to explain earlier that the risk of insolvency is much more likely—if it comes at all—to befall the strategic partner than the company itself. We tried to cover that by ring-fencing arrangements in relation to non-licensed activities and by providing other safeguards, but in the event of its happening, arrangements must be in place to maintain air traffic services and safeguard the public interest. That is what the provisions are all about.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> While we are on the subject of administration orders, will the Minister explain something about the strategic partnership agreement that I do not understand? The Government's administration order put option has been mentioned. The Minister suggested that the strategic partner is most likely to get into trouble, so is the purpose of that put option to allow the Government to insist that that partner acquires all the Government shares?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I did not explain that clearly. I shall go over the matter again, because it is complex. In the event of its being necessary to transfer from the first strategic partner to a new strategic partner, the former strategic partner will have no further role or purpose in relation to air traffic services. It would be anomalous for the Government still to have a 49 per cent. shareholding in that company. In that situation, it would obviously be necessary for the shares held by the Government to be transferred to that company, so that the Government could take their assets from the sale and continue with the new strategic partner. That is our purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I understand what the Minister says, but if the company has financial problems, how is it to pay the Government for the shareholding?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, the shareholder agreement has to cover an enormous range of circumstances. There could well be circumstances where the former strategic partner is no longer the strategic partner, a new strategic partner is brought in and the Government have to regularise the position. Where the former strategic partner is insolvent, the position is more complicated. The shareholder agreement covers circumstances far wider than insolvency, which are the issues covered by the clauses. Therefore, section 23 of the strategic partnership agreement, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, is necessary to cover a wider range of circumstances. It would be difficult to require an insolvent company to acquire the share ownership in such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> ``Difficult'' is an understatement. It is purely a tidying-up provision. If a company were in administration or liquidation, the Government would not be able to obtain even one penny for the shares. The shares would become worthless. It would not apply in the case of administration or liquidation; it would apply only in the event of the retirement of the licence holder for another reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I was explaining to the hon. Member for Hexham, the strategic partnership agreement has to cover a full range of circumstances, not just insolvency. We have rather strayed on to that, at the hon. Gentleman's instigation, and away from the purpose of the clauses. I shall return to the provisions relating to the clauses under discussion.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire suggested that PPP was a less satisfactory option than outright privatisation, where the private sector would take all the risks. We take an exactly opposite view. We believe that the public-private partnership is a far better option, because it ensures that there is a private sector partner who will bring investment and management expertise to the table, but who also provides a series of safeguards which ensure the continuity and maintenance of this crucial service.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will realise, after hearing his hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, that the decisive action that the Government are able to take in the event of difficulties arising is designed to ensure a transfer to a new licence holder who will be able to continue the operation, and so maintain the service. That is the crucial purpose. There should therefore be no financial disadvantage to the state; on the contrary, where the licence holder was in financial difficulties, there would be a far more orderly transfer than under an outright privatisation, where the scenario outlined by the hon. Gentleman might well arise and it would be necessary for the state to step in to bail out a bankrupt company. A series of safeguards has been put in place to ensure an orderly transfer and the maintenance of service, with the injection of some additional financial support from the state if really necessary. As I stressed when I introduced this provision, a raft of measures and safeguards are provided to ensure against an unlikely eventuality occurring. We do not envisage having to call on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister appears to have misunderstood what I said. He suggested that, if there were a wholehearted privatisation and a private company running these services then went bankrupt, the Government might have to bail out that company. That is not the case. If a company running nuclear power, for example, or a water company in a particular area of England goes bust, the Government can take regulatory steps to make sure that those services continue to be provided. There is no suggestion whatever that the Government would financially bail out the commercial company that had gone bust. The situation is much clearer. What the hon. Gentleman describes is neither fish nor fowl. The Government have the risk and have to pay the cash to bail out the strategic partner in a way that they would not have to do if, for example, a nuclear power company went bust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is pushing his case to an extreme conclusion. Does he really consider it a credible scenario that the Government would sit on their hands and do nothing while a company generating a significant proportion of the nation's power requirements and holding assets that were potentially hazardous was left in the lurch? That is not the scenario. Regulatory arrangements, such as those to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and those in respect of the PPP are in place. They protect the public interest. They ensure that arrangements exist to guarantee an orderly transfer of procedures and assets in the event of an insolvency or a failure by the licensed company to meet its obligations. The safeguards are there; these provisions are designed to achieve that and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> The clause describes the circumstances in which the court may make and may establish the administration order in relation to a licensed company. It sets down the conditions that have to be met. I would like to ask about the position of the employees. If the court is to consider granting an administration order, that is not only of huge significance for the customers, passengers, airlines and UK Government, but of particular concern and interest for the employees of the new public-private partnership or semi-private National Air Traffic Services.
<P>
I should like to ask the Minister whether a provision will be introduced at a later stage placing a requirement on the court to listen to the views of representatives of the work force in the appropriate trade unions so that those matters can be fully considered and taken into account before an administration order is granted. That would reveal the issues that will need to be addressed properly by the person appointed to take complete control—that is what the administration order does—so that he or she can properly protect, and reflect in subsequent decisions, the legitimate concerns and aspirations of the work force.
<P>
It seems to me, Mr. Gale, that in such a traumatic event—it would be a traumatic event for the employees if the company suddenly disappeared and were taken over by a new set-up—it would be only reasonable to inquire whether the court could be required to listen to the point of view of the trade union representatives and the work force so that all these issues were taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> What would happen if the CAA and the Secretary of State were of the view that the company was no longer viable, but the unions believed that it was essential for the interests of the workers that the company should continue to operate under licence?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> We are in the hands of the court. The court has to grant the administration order. It is an unlikely circumstance, and the Minister shows us that he thinks it is unlikely that it would ever get to a point where the court considered granting an administration order. Surely, however, if the arguments of the work force and the union were compelling in the sense that they were about to demonstrate that an administration order at that point was not really necessary—one would expect the court to take that into account. It is more likely that the court would be guided by the Secretary of State and the company management, but there are other issues—for example, in relation to how the administration order will be implemented. The individual appointed will need to look at all the crucial issues relating to the workforce. The answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is that the court should consider it. After all, the issue might not be as black and white as one might fear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My right hon. Friend raises a valid concern, but I suspect that one of the problems of the way in which we are considering the matter—it is my fault for suggesting that we should consider the clauses together—is that the most relevant clause to discuss is 29. I beg your indulgence, Mr. Gale, in referring in advance to provisions in that clause, which I think will give my right hon. Friend the comfort that he seeks.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My right hon. Friend will notice that the purposes of the air traffic administration order are, first, to transfer to another company as a going concern as many of the assets of the former company as are necessary to maintain the licensed activity. The second purpose is the carrying on, pending the transfer, of the present licensed company's licensed activities. They are the overriding objectives: to keep the company as a going concern and to maintain the licensed activities. That, I think, gives my right hon. Friend the first reassurance.
<P>
Secondly, when an air traffic administrator takes on a role under the air traffic administration order, the administrator has to take on the views of the staff, as far as reporting back to the Secretary of State is concerned. I do not blame my right hon. Friend for not having spotted the provision in paragraph (9) of schedule 2 that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``contracts of employment with the existing licence company are not to terminate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are real safeguards for existing staff and an overriding presumption on the maintenance of core services, which depend on the staff.

<P>

<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I wish to raise a point on clause 99, when we reach it. It was helpful of my hon. Friend to remind us that the intention is for the company to remain a going concern, but there are companies and companies and managements and managements. The unions will rightly want to express the view that the management policy should be followed by the new company. To take an extreme example, it would be highly unsatisfactory if a company that took over had a notorious reputation for the way in which it treated its workforce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hear what my right hon. Friend says, but where the continuation of air traffic services were in doubt because of the insolvency of the strategic partner, the overriding priority must be to ensure an arrangement whereby matters could be transferred to a new strategic partner and the operation could continue without risk of breakdown of the service or risk to the jobs of the staff. The provisions in clause 28 make appropriate allowance for that. Speed is of the essence and, while I hear his comment about the importance of both consultation and investigation of the record of the new strategic partner before a decision is taken, the overriding priority for the Secretary of State—and for the courts in carrying forward an air traffic administration order—must be to meet the obligation that the service is not disrupted and to transfer as much of the existing company as can be transferred as a going concern. Those objectives are spelt out in clause 29 and will give the bulk of the assurance that my right hon. Friend seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am inclined to seek the contrary assurance to that sought by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh. Clause 28 would not be operative unless there was a considerable emergency in the operation of business. I cannot imagine circumstances in which the staff, professional as they are in air traffic control, would want to intervene at that point, knowing that they have the safeguard of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 as expressed in schedule 2, and that the objective would be to transfer the business as a going concern. All those matters would have to be negotiated with the new management, but it would want the matter to be dealt with as swiftly as possible to restore morale throughout the service. I seek an assurance that employee representatives could not quixotically put a spanner in the works.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to be tolerant, but this is an intervention and not a speech. I call the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that I gave the hon. Gentleman the comfort that he sought by saying that speed was of the essence in this situation. I also pointed out to my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh that the real comfort for staff is the provision whereby an overriding priority is to maintain the business as a going concern. There are also the safeguards in schedule 2 to which I have already referred.
<P>
I believe that there are proper safeguards for the staff, but the overwhelming priority in a situation of insolvency would be to ensure the maintenance of air traffic services and of the business as a going concern. That is what the provisions are all about and that is what we are committed to. I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 28 should stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 289, in page 21, line 1, at beginning insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) If an air traffic administration order is made under section 27 or 28, the Secretary of State must publish a report within 24 hours—
<P>
(a) into the circumstances leading to the granting of an order;
<P>
(b) into the financial prospects of the licence holder; and
<P>
(c) explaining what measures he will pursue in order to fulfill his duties under Section 1 and for the licence holder to fulfill his duties under Section 8'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It has fallen to the lance corporal to speak to the amendment, which is tabled in the name of the young subaltern on the Front Bench, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Where is the field marshal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Unfortunately, the field marshal has had to go a memorial service at St. Margaret's, Westminster, for our late colleague Alan Clark, the former right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea. No doubt the field marshal will be back later to give you a difficult time—I mean, to give the Government a difficult time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman might have been right the first time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am certain that my right hon. Friend would never give the Chairman a difficult time.
<P>
The clauses in this group deal with a calamity that I am sure the Government very much hope will not happen: the strategic partner with which the Government will have gone into business either going bust or, for one reason or another, no longer fulfilling the duties imposed by clause 8. That would be an extraordinary situation which, if it were ever to happen, would fundamentally undermine the entire principle of the PPP, which is what we are legislating for. We all very much hope that it does not happen, but the possibility must exist. The clause, very reasonably, sets out strategic safeguards to ensure that the provision of air traffic control would continue safely even in that extremely remote and unlikely event.
<P>
If such a catastrophe happened, the whole of Government policy would be undermined, the entire thing would fall into disrepute and thousands of holidaymakers would worry about Heathrow air traffic control. Incidentally, members of the Transport Sub-Committee and I are travelling out of Heathrow this evening, so I speak with some feeling on the subject.
<P>
Although the travelling public would be terribly worried about the fact that the Government were apparently applying an administration order to the air traffic control company, the Bill does not require the Secretary of State to say why he is doing so. He can simply say that he is applying an order, without having to publish his reasons. Nor is he required to publish information on the financial standing of the new licence holder. He could appoint anyone he liked and the travelling public would have no information on who it was or how they could be certain that that person would provide the services on which we all rely. Equally, the Secretary of State has no duty to publish his reasons for believing that the new licence holder will be able to carry out these duties—we are not talking about just giving it to the old licence holder or the new licence holder, but about giving his reasons to the travelling public.
<P>
We have already discussed the difference between reality and the public perception of that reality several times. The purpose of the amendment is not necessarily to require that the Secretary of State do his job properly—I think we are all perfectly content that he will do that—but to publish his reasons for believing that the provision of air traffic services will continue safely in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have to tell the hon. Member for North Wiltshire—the self-styled lance corporal—that his amendment is neither necessary nor desirable. I hope that when he has heard my explanation, he will appreciate why.
<P>
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to publish a report within 24 hours of an air traffic administration order being made, detailing the circumstances leading to the granting of an order, the financial prospects of the licence holder, and the measures that the Secretary of State will have to pursue to fulfil his duties under section l and that the licence holder will have to pursue to fulfil his duties under section 8. The amendment is unnecessary, as the publication of such a report would be unlikely to add information to the public domain that was not already available.
<P>
In seeking to make an air traffic administration order the Secretary of State, must petition the court, setting out the grounds for seeking the order. The petition would provide the necessary information, as appropriate.
<P>
In insolvency cases, that information would clearly cover the financial circumstances of the company. If, however, the order was sought because of a failure by the company to meet its statutory duty or a licence condition, the financial circumstances of the company would be irrelevant and it would be inappropriate and actionable for the Secretary of State to report on such circumstances when they were not germane to the order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the amendment is unnecessary and could have some undesirable consequences.
<P>
The Secretary of State will try to ensure the maintenance of the air traffic control regime. The air traffic administration regime is effectively his means of achieving that by safeguarding the continuity of services and effecting the transfer to another company or companies of as much of the undertaking as is necessary to ensure that licence activities can be carried out properly.
<P>
Management of the licence company will be the responsibility of the air traffic administrator and, while an air traffic administration order is in force, the Secretary of State—or the CAA with his consent—may petition the court for an order if the air traffic administrator is exercising his powers in a manner that would either not best achieve the purposes of an air traffic administration order or would contravene the licence or a duty under clause 8(1) or any other requirement imposed on the company by virtue of its holding a licence. The court may give such order as it thinks fit for giving relief in respect of the matters complained of and may regulate future management by the administrator.
<P>
As for the time scale, at the early stage of the process—at most, 24 hours after the air traffic administrator is appointed—it would be unrealistic to expect the air traffic administrator to produce a detailed report setting out how he intended to discharge his responsibilities on all these issues.
<P>
Section 23 of the Insolvency Act 1986, as applied with modifications in this Bill, will require the air traffic administrator within three months of the order being made, or such longer time as the court may allow, to send a statement of his proposals for achieving the purposes of the order to the Secretary of State, the CAA, the creditors and to the Registrar of Companies. It is more appropriate to adopt that time scale for reporting on how the purposes of the order will be realised, not least because it will allow proper discussion with all interested parties, including the staff, as I mentioned in response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am greatly reassured and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 290, in page 21, line 7, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and protects the solvency of any relevant company pension fund.'<P>
</UL></FONT>.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 291, in page 21, line 7, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and
<P>
(c) in a manner compatible with the duties of a licence holder as set out in Section 8 and compatible with the promises and conditions of the licence.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The lance corporal does not take it easy on the Back Benches, but is going off elsewhere, so perhaps I should do my duty while I am here. In moving the amendment, I point out a typing error in the second line of amendment No. 291: the word ``promises'' should read ``provisions''.
<P>
The amendments are inspired by the people who work in NATS and also by those who may well become employees of the new company after the PPP has gone ahead. The hon. Gentleman might sympathise with some of what we have to say because almost all the employees who responded have expressed great concern about what would happen to their pension funds—in particular the surplus—in the event of the company becoming insolvent. There have been a number of worrying cases in recent years—most notably Mr. Maxwell. The papers tell us that some other hon. Members are apparently involved in a worrying series of court cases, which concern what happens to the surpluses from pension funds when a company goes into liquidation.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Members have real sympathies and concerns for the employees of NATS over how they will safeguard their pensions in the event of insolvency. It is reasonable that we should take up what would happen to pensions in similar circumstances on behalf of people who are not yet employed by the company. More than anything else, we want some assurance from the Minister that provisions in the Bill will cover these concerns. The amendments may not be the right way to do that, but we want to find some way to ensure that the rights and interests of employees, particularly in their pension fund, will be safeguarded.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> We all agree on the importance of the clause. Although one understands that the Minister hopes that a court will never have to grant an air traffic administration order and that an individual will never have to be appointed to take complete control of the company, it is obviously a possibility. There might be a slightly greater chance of it happening than the Minister says—who knows what lies ahead. We would be failing in our duty as administrators if we did not consider the Bill on the basis of ensuring that it can deal with unforeseen events.
<P>
A related issue stems from my genuine ignorance. The clause refers to the role of the person appointed by the court as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) for the achievement of the following two purposes, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) in a manner which protects the interests of the company's members and creditors.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I apologise for my ignorance, but who are the company's members? Are they the shareholders or the shareholders and employees? My concern is that they are the shareholders and not the employees. Of course, some employees will have shares in the company, but if one is an employee and has no holding in the company, does that mean that one is excluded?
<P>
Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that it would be helpful if the clause referred to protecting the interests of the company's members, employees and creditors? It is reasonable that if the administrator is asked to take into account the interests of the shareholder, he should include those of the employees.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) raised the future pension entitlement of workers in the industry. We must not forget that we are talking about dedicated public servants who have, over the years, provided the country with a superb service. They are rightly proud of that. Airline pilots acknowledge that internationally NATS is regarded as probably the best such service in the world. That is a tribute to the previous management of NATS, to the way we do things and to the air traffic controllers and support staff. We should remember that it is the individual air traffic controller who has our destiny in his or her hands when communicating with and bringing the pilot through our airspace or into one of our airports. The relationship between the pilot and the air traffic controller is crucially important. It is vital that the pilot has complete confidence in the controller and vice versa. We are talking about the sharp end—the legitimate concerns and interests of a staff, work force and management who have given this country great service and have provided us with an air traffic control system that is arguably the best in the world.
<P>
I am sure that that is the view of every member of the Committee and our function is to take the maximum steps to ensure that that happens. It is surely vital to ensure that the future pension entitlement of any employee is in no way adversely affected by the partial privatisation. There are three categories of employees. First, there are the past employees who clearly have a great interest in the matter. They have contributed to the pension fund. Secondly, there are the current employees, who clearly have a vital interest. Thirdly—and this should concern the Committee—there are the future employees. I strongly argue that the interests of those future employees should be on a par with the interests of past and existing employees. We should not wittingly or unwittingly put into place arrangements that could lead to a diminution in the pension entitlement and likely pension benefits of future employees.
<P>
Will the Minister who responds dwell on the issue at some length, because it is in some respects a major concern of the staff, some of whom have worked for the organisation for their whole life. We are asking for a clear explanation of the pension arrangements envisaged in the new regime, with a clear undertaking that the pensions of the work force, whether top management or the most lowly-paid support staff, will not be adversely affected in any way as a result of partial privatisation. Will the Minister confirm that the interests of all employees, past, present and future, will be more than fully safeguarded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We moved the amendment to obtain some reassurance from the Government about pensions. When the consultations were put out, the trade unions were concerned about what their rights would be. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh argued very persuasively. We are looking for reassurance. There is a concern that current and future employees may have different pension arrangements—two air traffic controllers might have different terms and conditions. I leave the Government to consider whether that makes for good management and organisation.
<P>
When the Government responded to the consultation in regard to employees' concerns, they said that the Treasury had issued new guidance for improving the protection of staff pensions in PPPs. If that is guidance, how are those protections built into the Bill or into any of the agreements so that those people who work in the organisation are fully protected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had a short but wide-ranging debate. I hope that I shall not disappoint my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh, but I should not be able to do justice to his request for a detailed examination of all the pension provision without incurring your wrath, Mr. Gale, for going far beyond the provisions of the clause and group of amendments which only tangentially relate to the issues raised by my right hon. Friend. I shall try to do justice to the broad principle, which I know governs his concerns and was also raised by the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire moved the amendment. I hope that he will not have a long delay at Heathrow tonight, that his Select Committee visit—wherever he is going—proves to be enjoyable, worthwhile and productive and that he will come back full of wisdom that he will be able to impart to the Committee, perhaps next week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Next month.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not think that he is travelling by rail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I would be surprised if the Committee hears the hon. Gentleman's wide-ranging knowledge in the next two weeks or so. I understand that the Select Committee will be giving the Australians the benefit of their expertise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Unless that knowledge is relevant and directly in order, the Committee will not have the benefit of it at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall rapidly return to order, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The amendments seek to make specific provision to protect the solvency of any relevant company pension fund and to manage the company in a manner compatible with the duties of a licence holder in clause 8 and the conditions of the licence.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the concern that the solvency of a company pension scheme should be safeguarded if it were in danger, but I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for North Wiltshire and all members of the Committee that that is not a problem. The NATS pension fund is held in a trust separately from the company and is protected by the provisions of the Pensions Act 1995. It would be inappropriate for an air traffic administrator or any other individual to seek to influence the trustees to use the pension fund for anything other than the benefit of its members. There can be no question of pension funds being used to pay creditors or members: it is simply not possible for the administrator to do that. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks.
<P>
Requiring the air traffic administrator to comply with section 8 duties and the provisions—not promises—and conditions of the licence is at best unnecessary but, at worst, poses a serious barrier to the administrator in restoring order when, for example, the company had breached section 8 requirements. Unless the administrator was able to wave a magic wand and transform the company overnight, that breach would, almost inevitably continue for a short period. It would be unfortunate if, as a result of the amendment, the administrator could not immediately rectify such a breach, even though he had an extremely good plan of remedial measures to put the company back on an even keel.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire recognises that the amendments are unnecessary because of the overriding obligation to comply with the requirements of the statute and the licence. Although there could be a breach when the administrator has been appointed, remedying it and putting things right will be the overriding priority.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Edingburgh, East and Musselburgh raised a question about members and shareholders. He will be aware of our intention that the employees of NATS should be able to acquire a shareholding interest; there is specific provision for shareholding by employees. We shall discuss later arrangements for the 5 per cent. of shares that will be available for them.

<P>

<B>Dr. Strang:</B> Am I right in thinking that the members of the company are the shareholders and that an employee who is not a shareholder will be excluded? If the requirement is related to the members, presumably the Bill is concerned only with protecting the shareholder interest of employees rather than their other conditions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My right hon. Friend is right to say that the reference to members, which is a normal companies law provision, refers to shareholders, but in this case we are making specific provision for employees to acquire a shareholding interest; they will therefore be on a par with other members. He will also be aware that the other provisions of the clause, such as the maintenance of a going concern, are designed to protect the interests of the company. That will protect the interests of its employees.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire will accept that the clause is appropriate as currently drafted and that there is no need for amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am greatly reassured that the Minister has safeguarded the pensioners, as they are protected by the 1995 Act. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
