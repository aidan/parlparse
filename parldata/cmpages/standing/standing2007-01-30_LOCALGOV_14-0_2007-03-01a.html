						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000432"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It is good to welcome you back to the Chair,
Mr.
Benton.</div>
					<a name="0703026000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Committee will agree that it is important that members of councils
should give a clear and transparent promise that they will abide by the
higher standards of behaviour. The amendments relate to how members of
councils will undertake to comply with the code of conduct. Such an
undertaking will,in effect, include the code&#146;s new
remit in respect of members&#146; behaviour. It is a long-standing
procedure that, when taking up office, members should give an
undertaking that they will comply with the code of conduct adopted by
the authority. We want that arrangement to continue so that members
will still make a commitment.</div>
					<a name="0703026000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">When authorities have not
formally adopted a code, the legislation provides that the mandatory
conditions of the model code of conduct issued by the Government should
apply to their councillors. There is currently no express requirement
for members whoare subject to the mandatory provisions of the
code to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>give a similar undertaking. The amendments, taken together, therefore
provide that councillors who are subject to the mandatory code should
be required to give the same undertaking to follow the code as the
legislation already provides for councillors whose authorities have
adopted a code.</div>
					<a name="0703026000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second amendment in the group is designed to enable authorities that
have not adopted their code to operate the rules relating to the
conduct of their members more effectively. An authority that has not
adopted a code of its own will be required to maintain a copy of the
mandatory model code as part of its constitution. Provision is also
made for the functions of standards committees to extend to the
assistance of members to follow the mandatory terms of the code in
cases when the authority has not adopted a code of its own. I commend
the amendments to the
Committee.</div>

						<a name="0703026000433"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Stunell</b> (Hazel Grove) (LD): Welcome back to the Chair,
Mr. Benton.</div>
					<a name="0703026000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we discussed this morning,
the Minister has clarified the Government&#146;s intentions in
respect of the clause and those clarifications are welcome. However, I
hope that he will take the opportunity when replying to this short
debate on the clause as a whole to colourin a little of the
detail that he set out this morning. During the break, I returned to
the consultation on amendments to the model code of conduct that he and
the Department issued in January, just to makesure
that&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I am asked,
&#147;What about lunch?&#148;. That is a very good question, which
I do not intend to
answer.</div>
					<a name="0703026000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was said
this morning that the limitation on the extension of the code beyond
nine to five to 24/7 would be restricted to places where a member had
received a criminal conviction. The Minister was tested quite a bit on
what that meant. I asked whether that referred to UK criminal
convictions, but he sensibly did not venture into that territory. I
draw his attention to his consultation document, particularly to the
final paragraph on page 9, which states:</div>
					<a name="0703026000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ministers are currently
minded to provide that only private behaviour for which a member has
been convicted by a court should be proscribed by the code of
conduct&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0703026000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
exactly the same as what he said this morning in relation to a criminal
conviction. We discussed that point&#151;about whether a conviction,
a recorded conviction or a criminal conviction was meant. I hope that
the Minister will say something about where that boundary lies and
whether he would consider introducing a Government amendment at a later
stage to make explicit on the face of the Bill the limited extent to
which private behaviour will be invaded by the code.</div>
					<a name="0703026000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a different point, I note
that at the bottom of page 10, the comment about paragraph 5 of the
draft code appears not to be controversial at all. It says that there
will be</div>
					<a name="0703026000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specific
reference to clarify the intention that an authority&#146;s resources
should not be used improperly for party political
purposes.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>
					<a name="0703026000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a common-sense provision and
mirrors closely what is said in this House.</div>
					<a name="0703026000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to the fact that, periodically, members of
a council&#151;particularly those in opposition parties&#151;are
highly discontented about the use of the council&#146;s PR machine in
the propagation of a ruling group&#146;s policies. It happens in this
place as well: we have concerns about the waythat the
Government use their machinery, althoughI appreciate that, by
definition, anything that the Government do could not possibly be
improper. On that specific provision, it would be helpful if the
Minister set out how he is minded to advise the Standards Board or how
he believes the code should be interpreted in that grey
area.</div>
					<a name="0703026000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome what
the Minister said this morning about seeking an opportunity for a
debate to take place when the statutory instrument comes before the
House. That is welcome as far as it goes, but I remind him, that will
be at the point at which the code is a statutory document brought to
the House for approval. He knows that when a statutory instrument is
debated, even if the whole Committee unanimously rejects it, it has no
effect in the terms of the procedure of this House. It is therefore not
a very powerful lock, or even a constraint, on how that code is
constructed and implemented. It would be helpful if he revisited that
point and helped Members to contribute on some of the nitty-gritty
issues in the code document. I am sure that you would not permit us to
do that in the context of this debate, Mr. Benton, and
anyway we have other important matters to deal with. There is a host of
other minor issues&#151;minor in the context of the Bill&#151;to do
with the shape of the statutory code to come. My colleagues and I
believe that they should have an airing before the door is shut and the
key thrown away.</div>
					<a name="0703026000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to comment on what the Minister said this morning about a
common code of conduct for all those in elected office&#151;Members
of Parliament and councillors. The outside world would expect a code of
conduct for Ministers, Members of Parliament, councillors and parish
councillors that reflects ethical values and proper levels of conduct.
If an ordinary member of the general public were asked which of those
groups should have the highest standards expected of them, they would
reply, in descending order, Ministers with Government responsibility,
Members of Parliament and, somewhere further down, councillors and
parish councillors. In this country, however, we have codes that have
the stiffest standards for the people at the bottom of the
pyramid.</div>
					<a name="0703026000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not make
any judgment about the performance of people at different levels. I
entirely agree with the Minister that the huge majority of councillors
do not just avoid ethical problems, but struggle desperately to provide
a proper service to their constituents and the last thing on their mind
is breaching those standards. It rubs hard with them to see a less
severe code applied to Members of Parliament than is applied to them. I
hope the Minister will be able to help us with that
issue.</div>
					<a name="0703026000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
return to what the Minister traded as one of his big concessions this
morning&#151;that in future councillors will be able to support their
local communities when contentious decisions are beforethe
council. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst raised the case of
his golf club&#151;sorry, not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>his golf club, but an adjacent one&#151;and the 500 houses. The
Minister explicitly said in his response to an intervention that in
future councillors would be able to participate in such
cases.</div>
					<a name="0703026000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I refer the
Minister to a letter which I think was sent to all members of the
Committee, but was certainly sent to me on January 23 by Mr.
David Prince, the chief executive of the Standards Board for England.
The letter contains a before-and-after checklist comparing the
requirements of the existing code with those of the new code. On page 3
of the letter there is
a</div>
					<a name="0703026000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;note on
predetermination and
bias&#148;,</div>
					<a name="0703026000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">which states
that</div>
					<a name="0703026000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Members
who will be voting on a planning and licensing matter and clearly
identify themselves with an outcome to an application which they will
be involved in considering make a decision open to legal
challenge.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
because of the code; it is because of the common law doctrine on
predetermination and predisposition. I am not a lawyer. I have had the
law on that point explained to me several times and I am still
struggling with it. That it exactly the sort of matteron which
monitoring officers make their money by providing interpretations.
According to the Standards Board, at least until January, members would
not be able to take part in decision making on issues such as houses on
a golf course in their ward. I would like the Minister to comment on
that.</div>
					<a name="0703026000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister consider tabling a Government amendment or look favourably on
an amendment from another quarter that would set aside the common law
doctrine on predetermination in respect of councillors performing their
duties on behalf of their local community? When I started as a
councillor, in 1979, nobody had discovered that doctrine. Councillors
from every party on the authorities that I served on took strong public
views about the progress of a planning application as a matter of
course, followed it through in committee and voted accordingly. The
doctrine has emerged over the past 20 years to the detriment of local
government, local democracy and strong local representation. I say to
the Minister that it should be overturned. If that requires an
amendment to the Bill, that is what should
happen.</div>
					<a name="0703026000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister understands that I am in no way failing to acknowledge the
progress that has been made and I appreciate what he said earlier.
However, the Committee may have got the impression that the Minister
has gone further than he has. I will welcome any clarification from him
on the points that Ihave raised and any help that he can give
us on howwe might proceed from now to the point of
implementation of the code, so that it is appropriate to the needs of
local democracy and fully secure against any subsequent mission
creep&#151;either from this place or from monitoring officers around
the
country.</div>

						<b class="B">Dr. Roberta
Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I, too, welcome you back to
the Chair, Mr.
Benton.</div>
					<a name="0703026000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pick
up one or two of the points made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. On
conduct that may be covered by the code, will the Minister consider
whether current regulations and the new draft code 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div>
						adequately cover material that councils might
placeon their websites? It appears that some councillors,
including in City of Durham council, which I know well, are using
websites inappropriately and that the Standards Board does not appear
to be clear about how it can prevent that, particularly when it
involves material from individual councillors passed through
officers&#151;for example, the relevant press officer. Such material
can be personally abusive or factually inaccurate, yet the Standards
Board appears to think that it has no jurisdiction over such matters.
Will the Minister consider that issue and, in particular, whether
current legislation is indeed inadequate to safeguard against political
bias or personal vindictiveness? If it is, will amendments be
considered on
Report?</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0703026000434"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): Personally, I have
always been sceptical of the value of the Standards Board. Serious
cases have always tended to be flushed out by the system anyway. My own
concern is that it is basically a snitch&#146;s charter for frivolous
and vexatious complaints. I have been a victim of those
myself.</div>
					<a name="0703026000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">They say that
an antisocial behaviour order is a badge of honour, but I have been
reported to the Standards Board for England on three occasions and no
action was taken on any of them. Such events cause a great deal of
concern and upset, and sometimes bad publicity when the press get hold
of the allegations. A person does not always have the opportunity to
put their side directly to the press until after the hearing when they
have been cleared. Having said that, I think that the Minister has
moved considerably in the course of today&#146;s debate.</div>
					<a name="0703026000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Hazel Grove
has raised real points about the inconsistencies between the different
tiers of government and the standards expected. For me, as a new Member
of this House, but having been a councillor for 11 years&#151;I still
am&#151;it has been a real eye-opener. Were this a local government
meeting, Mr. Benton, I would first have to declare an
interest as a member of Tameside metropolitan borough council. You
would determine that I would have to leave the proceedings; I certainly
would not be able to speak, let alone vote.</div>
					<a name="0703026000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put that into context, at the
Tameside council meeting about this time last year, when the
parliamentary boundary commission&#146;s proposals were being debated
by the local authorities, I was at a meeting of Tameside council,
where, as Member of Parliament for one of the three constituencies
being considered as part of the review, I had to declare an interest,
as did my wife, a cabinet member on Tameside council, because she is
the wife of that Member of Parliament. We then both had to leave the
council chamber and take no part in the debate or the vote that
followed. That highlights the inconsistencies between how things work
in local government and nationally.</div>
					<a name="0703026000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, planning is the major
issue. When I was21 and only just elected to Tameside council,
I had a baptism of fire. There was a controversial planning application
affecting my ward. It was a proposal to build not houses but an
industrial estate on an open green space, which happened to be a golf
course&#151;yes, we have golf courses in Denton. That was the
Kingswater Park development, and I was proud to be one of three Labour
councillors who&#151;I hope that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>Whip is not listening&#151;who defied the Labour group whip and voted
against the building of that major industrial estate in Denton.
Thankfully, the Deputy Prime Minister refused it planning permission on
three occasions. The point is that there was a massive 30,000-signature
local petition. People did not want to lose their piece of open space,
and as their councillor I spoke up for them and voted accordingly. I
would not have been able to do that if some of the present rules and
regulations had been in place in 1996. I might not have been one of the
Kingswater
three.</div>

						<a name="0703026000435"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I shall make a few remarks now
to save me from intervening on the Minister later. We appear to be
debating two distinct issues in connection with planning. One is the
role of local councillors. At one stage when I was on Sefton council,
we considered devolving a lot of planning decisions to the area
committees. Had the Standards Board made its subsequent ruling then,
the area committees would have been incapable of determining any of
them.</div>
					<a name="0703026000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fair case has
been made that local councillors have the right to express their views
on planning matters. However, that is separate from the question
whether councillors can express opinions prior to a planning meeting. A
different kind of ruling and adjudication is involved, and that rule
seems not to stem directly from anything that the Standards Board has
produced butto have grown over time. The distinction is partly
artificial. I can recall the days when many major planning committee
decisions were ratified in full council, and I do not remember people
absenting themselves on any ground to any great extent unless they had
a direct financial involvement.</div>
					<a name="0703026000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be interested to know
at what stage the natural history of planning committees changed and
planning councillors&#151;those who sat regularly on the planning
committee&#151;were forbidden to express an opinion prior to the
committee&#146;s determination. Was it identified as unlawful, or
simply as unwise? Clearly, if a planning committee member gives their
view before seeing all the facts and hearing the case made by the
applicant, there is a firm case for the applicant to register an
appeal, win and overrule the planning committee. Have the rules binding
planning committee members always been there? Has expressing a prior
view always been unlawful, or has practice
changed?</div>

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): Welcome back to the
Committee, Mr. Benton.</div>
					<a name="0703026000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the points that hon.
Members have made on the planning issue and predetermination. I
mentioned it at some length earlier today, but I think that it is
important for the Minister to help us. I am grateful to him for his
response about the Standards Board, and I appreciate the
Government&#146;s move on that, but like the hon. Member for Hazel
Grove and others, I should be concerned if the issue were to fall
between the two stools of the common law ruling and the Standards Board
regime. Either way, the current situation is nonsense; either way, it
is wrong.</div>
					<a name="0703026000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
hon. Member for Denton and Reddish that I too was elected to a council
at 21. I can only promise him that it gets better as one gets older. I
made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>my maiden speech in the council chamber opposingan industrial
development in my ward. There was no problem with that under the old
regime, but the common law on the matter has grown, more judge driven
than driven by any will of the House, which is troubling. We might need
to examine it.</div>
					<a name="0703026000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I served
for a time as a member of a planning committee back in the &#146;70s
and &#146;80s. The rules were not as rigid then as they are now. Our
problem now is that councillors feel gagged when dealing with key
issues. For many&#151;particularly in small authorities, although it
applies to London boroughs as well&#151;planning issues are the bread
and butter of their ward work, especially major issues involving
matters of principle, such as the cases that we have discussed, which
affect whole communities and not just individuals. It is important that
we do not allow&#151;for any reason, be it judge-made law or a gap in
the regulations&#151;an unreasonable fetter on elected
representatives carrying out their job and what the public perceive to
be their job. Any help that the Minister can give us will be much
appreciated by Members from all parties, because there is a consensus
that the current situation is not
acceptable.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0703026000437"></a>
							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): I rise as one who
had reached the comparatively ripe age of 24 before first being elected
to a local authority&#151;I was a late starter. That causes me to
reflect on the average age of councillors now&#151;the late 50s. In a
later debate we might discuss the fact that it is difficult for any
party to attract young people to become members of local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="0703026000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am more
sympathetic to the Standards Board than some of the other hon. Members
who have contributed to the debate, although I would be even more
sympathetic to a board that had a lighter touch than has been the case
of late. There is no doubt that both the board and the code have been
brought into disrepute for a number of reasons that include vexatious
complaints, high-profile cases such as that of the London Mayor, and
officers who have been over-zealous in their interpretation of the
code.</div>
					<a name="0703026000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
clause and the provisions that follow it because I have no doubt that
they will provide an appropriate balance between a national framework
and local discretion. I hope that the Committee will approve the clause
as amended. I am minded to referto the debate on Second
Reading, in which some Opposition Members expressed scepticism about
whether the Bill contained anything worth while. There is much else in
the Bill that is worth while. However, if there were there nothing else
worth while in the Bill, and there is much that is worth while, it
would be worth while for the clause and the following clauses
alone.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000438"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I suspect that the <i class="I">Hansard </i>report of the
last 26 minutes will be among the best read reports of a Standing
Committee that there has been for some time. Many thousands of
councillors are looking to us for guidance, so I shall be careful both
in answering the points and in my choice of words, in order to convey
the Government&#146;s policy intention accurately.</div>
					<a name="0703026000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the hon. Member for
Hazel Grove for giving up his lunch&#151;he and I were considering
the same matters. I gave the Committee the good news on local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>representations and the criteria that the Government are proposing, but
there is an important point on planning and licensing that enters the
equation. My remarks were outside of those two areas, but that is not
to say that the Government disagree with the hon. Gentleman. The tests
on planning and licensing that are being questioned are not based on
the same principle. A planning committee member must abide by planning
law, and must justify his or her decisions in planning terms; the fear
of being prejudicial is what causes the problem.</div>
					<a name="0703026000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Southport
made an important point&#151;he asked whether certain conduct was
unwise or unlawful. I am informed that the current position is largely
the result of case law and of the fear of appeals being contested on
case law grounds. The answer to his question is that the Government
undertake to consider the matter in a sympathetic light&#151;indeed,
we are discussing the issue in planning policy. The problem cannot be
solved directly through the code of conduct, however; we will have to
consider the case law on
planning.</div>
					<a name="0703026000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remit of
licensing committees has changed under the Licensing Act 2003, and it
is opportune for me to undertake to the Committee to discuss the
potential future period of development in the field of licensing with
my colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. If a
planning area can be contentious, the grant of a licence could be even
more so, and we do not want Parliament&#146;s will to be overtaken by
the case law that could develop in that
area.</div>
					<a name="0703026000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sincerely thank
the hon. Member for Hazel Grove for giving up his lunch. When we began
debating this part of the Bill, I said that I wanted to try to build a
consensus. If I am to be true to that commitment, I shall be obliged to
consider the points that he has made, and I shall do so with all
seriousness.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000397"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="0703026000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham and by
other hon. Members in relation to publicity and party political
propaganda. The code covers the behaviour of individual council
members. A decision by an individual councillor to misuse publicity for
party political purposes can be subject to the code as it is now and
the code as it will be, if it is implemented. There is a separate code,
a statutory code on publicity, that regulates the activities of an
authority&#151;either groups of councils or the authority itself. If
an authority uses funds in breach of that code, it is a matter for the
auditor and for me or my successors, with the advice of officials. My
hon. Friend has written to me on that point. Therefore, the behaviour
of individual councillors and the decisions of authorities are separate
issues.</div>
					<a name="0703026000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Hazel Grove made a very good point about the statutory instrument,
which is to be subject to the negative procedure. The same point had
occurred to me as a member of the former Whips&#146; club. It is
often not understood in the House that a negative statutory instrument
can be defeated, but that does not legally change anything. In my
earlier remarks, I added a second point that I would talk
to
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>the Leader of the House about it. I think it desirable to have a debate
on the code as well as on the legislation that is behind the code,
which we are debating now.</div>
					<a name="0703026000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman referred to
the Standards Board&#146;s consultation. It is perhaps not widely
understood&#151;certainly not by the journalists who report these
matters&#151;that the Standards Board itself is not the board that
takes decisions on conduct. The Standards Board, ably chaired by Sir
Anthony Holland and overseen by the chief executive, David Prince, runs
the Standards Board operation. It is the adjudication officer that
makes the decisions on conduct. However, the Bill provides that that
function be got rid of and that decisions be taken locally.</div>
					<a name="0703026000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that the change will
speed things up and cut the number of vexatious complaints, for the
simple reason&#151;I apologise if I use layperson&#146;s language
rather than legalistic language&#151;is that a headline in the local
paper saying, &#147;I have referred a fellow councillor to the
national Standards Board&#148; is a bigger headline than one saying,
&#147;I have referred him to the local standards
board&#148;. Hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee are nodding, showing that they recognise what I am saying.
The experience of elected members at council level is why I want to see
party political appointments on the local committees. I believe that
the committees should have experience. Of course they should be
balanced and have an independent chair, but they should also have
experience to be able to judge these matters.</div>
					<a name="0703026000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Denton and Reddish referred to the Kingswater three. He shocked me when
he said that it was 11 years ago. The first early-day motion that I
signed was about Kingswater. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman) told me to sign the piece of
paper and then told me what it was that I had signed. That resulted in
a phone call the following day from the leader of Tameside council, who
is still in his position. I realised then that politics was a tough old
game. I was damned if I did and damned if I didnot, so I never
signed an early-day motion affecting somebody else&#146;s
constituency after that.</div>
					<a name="0703026000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend made an important
point. For the record, he was referred to the Standards Board during
the course of the parliamentary selection procedure. I wondered at the
time, reading in <i class="I">Tameside Reporter</i>, whether that had anything to
do with it, but who knows. He was, of course, cleared. He makes a
serious point about these processes, in which some councillors have
described themselves as being gagged. I hope that I have answered his
point, which was also made by the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst and
others.</div>
					<a name="0703026000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of my
opening comments&#151;and in seeking strong support for the new
code&#151;I have undertaken to consider the important points on
planning and licensing made in the debate and those made in the
response to the consultation on the code of
conduct.</div>

approaching this matter. I am sure that he is right that the broader
the consensus that can be built, the more enduring the application of
the code can be. That consensus should extend beyond the Committee to
all our local government colleagues of all parties. Will his
reconsideration stretch as far as considering 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>whether, as well as reversing the judicial decisions in respect of the
Mayor of London, he might reverse those in respect of the
predetermination issue? That would be a major step forward for local

Government are considering planning policy. We have made a public
commitment to a planning White Paper. I confirm that the matter is
being debated. The hon. Gentleman will have gathered from the tone of
my remarks what the thinking is inside Government. There is a cautious
note to be struck on the other side of the debate, which is that one
has, quite rightly, to protect the planning procedure. It is often
forgotten that proposers have rights as well as objectors, as the
Kingswater case
proves.</div>

that where a standards committee receives an allegation under clause

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I support amendment No. 165.
Recently in my constituency, an independent councillor against whom a
series of complaints were made to the Standards Board was not aware
that a complaint had been made until the announcement of the result. As
it happens, the Liberal Democrat mayor of Bridgnorth made the
complaints. The matter caused considerable distress to the councillor
because it happened not once, but twice. It is entirely reasonable to
propose that individuals of whatever party or cause who are the subject
of a complaint be notified before a result is
determined.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000447"></a>Mr.

						</b> Our desire is to encourage the efficient working,
transparency, and fairness of the operation of a Standards
Board&#146;s role of assessing allegations. I accept the importance
of providing information to the person against whom a complaint of a
breach of the code has been made, so that he or she knows what the
accusation is and is able to defend him or herself.The
national Standards Board currently provides information to the person
whom is the subject of a complaint. In any event, I expect that the
guidance the board will give to standards committees will include a
requirement to inform and that they will follow that
practice.</div>
					<a name="0703026000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">By tabling
the amendment, the hon. Member for Poole has raised the question of
whether the measure should be in the Bill. I have a strong tendency to
agree with amendment No. 165, but I ask the Committee to give me some
time to ask the Standards Board for its view. I have a couple of
problems with the drafting of the amendment. I hope I am not being
pernickety but, for example, the amendment does not indicate when an
allegation must be copied to an individual. Should that be before a
standards committee meets to decide an outcome?</div>

						</b> The clause deals with the right to request the
review of a decision to take no action. As the Bill stands, a person
who puts in a complaint has a second go, because they are able to go
back to a committee. I would like the Minister to explain how that
would work. When a complaint is made, a committee decides either to
farm it out or not to act. The committee might then tell the individual
who has made the written complaint that it will take no action. On what
grounds within the 30 days that have to elapse can the complainant
write back? Can a complainant request more information from the
committee or the council? If a person simply reiterates the original
complaint, does the committee have to consider it or can they bin it? I
would like more information on those matters. If a committee decides
not to examine a complaint made by someone it has decided is absolutely
barking, it gives the complainant another 30 days to get more coverage
in, say, the &#147;Tameside Herald&#148;, and to go back to the
council for another go with their
complaint.</div>

fair to both those facing allegations and those who make them. It is
therefore important that provision should be made for those making
allegations to request a review of a decision to take no action. We are
talking about the gateway&#151;the prima facie decision, not the
investigation and decision itself. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that
point in his remarks. The provisions will allow the right to request a
review in that period, whereupon the standards committee must
reconsider the complaint
afresh.</div>

					<a name="0703026000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see where
the hon. Gentleman is coming from, and the provision sounds slightly
overzealous on the face of it. Apart from natural justice
considerations, my thinking is influenced partly by a pragmatic point.
We are talking about local standards committees in every council in the
country, so the issue relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for High Peak about consistency in decision making. The
provisions will be beneficial particularly in the early days.</div>
					<a name="0703026000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect that the guidance on
practice will be much quicker in dealing with prima facie allegations
than has been stated. For that reason, we and the Standards Board
wanted the assurance in the Bill so as to provide and be seen to
provide a guarantee. There have been examples of complaints being
knocked back, so the complainant will have the right to ask for that to
be reconsidered. Obviously, it must be done efficiently and
expediently. That was the thinking behind the
clause.</div>

amendments Nos. 190 to 192 will provide for regulations to amend the

the exercise of the board&#146;s direction-making powers and will
allow, for example, that, when the direction provides for the standards
committee of another authority to deal with misconduct allegations, the
Wales ombudsman can consult the committee rather than the board if he
considers an issue has arisen that may relate to a breach of the code
of conduct and which should be considered by the

Pugh:
						</b> The Minister, laudably, said that the whole thrust
of the Bill is to provide a level playing field between those who
accuse and those who are accused. If we consider how the process of a
complaint is handled, we must say that it will be judicious; it will be
balanced; it will be well evidenced and so on. As we all know, very few
charges actually stick, but much 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>publicity is attached to the process of making a charge. It often takes
place during a fevered electoral period. There does not seem to be
anything in the Bill or in what the Standards Board tells us that will
resolvethat difficulty. It is a simple expedient device used
regrettably by all parties from time to time to make an allegation in
the run-up to election time, the accused being exonerated afterwards.
Of course, during election time, it is rare to get a council committee
together because all the councillors are out campaigning for
re-election. Has the Minister or even the Standards Board given thought
to not only how the process can be balanced, but how the relating to
the public ofthe complaints process can be balanced, which is
something altogether
different?</div>

							<a name="0703026000461"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I welcome the proposal to devolve a lot of the
responsibility for investigating complaints to the local standards
committee, but I wish to raise a specific concern that was highlighted
by the Graham committee when it reported on resources in January 2005.
The Government so often impose obligations on local authorities and
expect them to fund obligations without providing additional help. In
this case, the Graham committee estimated that the Standards Board
would save &#163;9 million through such measures. That was fine for
the board, but it implies that a cost equivalent to that is imposed on
local authorities. Has the Minister given thought to providing
resources to the monitoring officers to fund the additional work that
they will have to undertake and to providing additional funding out of
the savings that will be made by the board to give additional
allowances to the independent panel members whose numbers will
inevitably increase if there is an increased work
load?</div>

[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Oh, the hon. Member for Lichfield is in the
minority with me. For my sins, I was regional officer for the Labour
party. I was there to encourage councillors and to assist them during
the election period. Has the Minister thought about the way in which
publicity is used as a weapon? It is almost a legitimate campaign tool
inasmuch as its use appears to be fair game. I did not realise that my
hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish had suffered from that

cases, the glare of publicity is basically a job done. We have had a
bit of a laugh about it, but it is really quite damaging to a
person&#146;s reputation and family. I know of cases where a
councillor&#146;s children at school have been upset and damaged by
the whole thing. I wonder whether taking the draw of publicity away
from it would assist us all.</div>

								Mr.

						</b> The hon. Member for Southport and my hon. Friend
the Member for Stourbridge have made similar points.</div>
					<a name="0703026000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Ludlow asked
a specific point and I should like to deal with that first. We
takethe new burdens policy seriously, not just in my
Department, but across government. That policy is about providing the
net cost of new burdens. Councillors often write to me about the gross
costs of new burdens, but never about the net costs. I am sure that, as
somebody who wants good use of public finances and to bear down on
inefficiencies, he will accept my point. In that regard, if the House
to agrees to the Bill, we will apply it in this instance. At the
moment, we estimate that the savings to the board are about &#163;2
million. That will be reflected in the revenue support
grant.</div>
					<a name="0703026000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our policy is
that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, money in the RSG
should not be ring-fenced. That is also the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
party&#146;s policy. However, if the budget is not ring-fenced, can
one guarantee, and be seen to be guaranteeing, the independence of the
function? Although I have thought about that matter, thankfully we have
not had to address it yet. If I did so, I would be jumping ahead of
Parliament&#151;and I would not do that. I will take on board soon
the points made by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
					<a name="0703026000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
the more general points, Mr. Benton, I do not think that you
want me to open up a general debate. I consulted informally a
cross-party group of councillors about what the solution to this
problem may be and it came up with the answer that my hon. Friend the
Member for Stourbridge gave, which is that if a law were passed saying
that a complaint could not be put it in the press until it is dealt
with, that would probably dry up the number of complaints made. My hon.
Friend the Member for High Peak will recognise that issue from his days
on the Standards and Privileges Committee. The Parliamentary
Commissioner for Standards has to take swift action in response to
press inquiries that have been generated by press releases that arise
often before the complaint itself has
arisen.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I was about to intervene when my
hon. Friend the Minister made exactly the point that I was going to
make, which was that even the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member
for Stourbridge would not work when people make complaints first to the
press and then to the formal body. As the Minister says, that happens
just as much in the House as it does in respect of the Standards
Board.</div>

							<a name="0703026000467"></a>Mr.

						</b> We considered whether there might be a mechanism
to close that down again, but we quickly came up against the pragmatic
problems that would result. The freedom of the press would probably
have been an issue as well. As elected representatives, we have to live
with the fact that these problems happen in an ethical regime. As we
all know, complaints are made in letters to the Speaker of the House
about Members of Parliament, and those complaints often have nothing to
do with the
Speaker.</div>
					<a name="0703026000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
thought behind the new framework and new strategy is that localising
the process will bear down on such problems for the reason that I gave
before. It is not as headline grabbing to go to a local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>committee as a national committee. The chemistry will have that effect
as well, because individuals are likely to be known, the chair of the
committee is likely to know individuals and the local newspapers will
know them too. Crying wolf might, in time, help the
situation.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Neil Turner</b> (Wigan) (Lab): Following our debate on
vexatious and politically motivated complaints, may I suggest that the
Minister talk to the Standards Board about a way in which we might tie
down some of the issues through the requirement for local authorities
to report on their work annually to the Standards Board? I believe that
Wigan is recognised as having one of the best councils in the
country&#151;I say &#147;one of the best&#148; in deference to my
hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. Perversely, however, it
has one of the highest numbers of complaints against its members. That
is largely because one party&#151;the main opposition, which is not
represented in this Committee&#151;uses complaints in the way that
other hon. Members have described.</div>
					<a name="0703026000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I read the comprehensive
performance assessment and the local standards report. The local
standards report quite properly made the point that such exercises are
not without cost. If a complaint is made to the local standards board,
the board has to take on board the complaint and consider it, and that
costs time to officers as well as real money, which has a real impact
on the services that a council can provide, because the money has to
come out of the council&#146;s coffers rather than going into
front-line services.</div>
					<a name="0703026000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder, therefore, whether we should not give the Standards Board for
England the opportunity to include in its report the number of
vexatious and politically motivated complaints that it receives, and
the cost of handling such complaints for local authorities. I wrote to
the board to request a list of the complainants in Wigan to find out
whether I could prove what I knew to be the case, but the board said
that it could not provide such a list. It could give me the number of
complaints made by councillors and by the general public, but it could
not give me a breakdown by
individuals.</div>
					<a name="0703026000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
particular party that makes the large number of complaints in Wigan is
called the Community Action party, although we know it in Wigan as the
no-community no-action non-party, on the basis that it proposes not
having community councils, has never 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>proposed any action, and its members fight like rats in sacks. It uses
its membership to make complaints as well, so most complaints come from
that one party. Dealing with the complaints will have a major impact on
the finances of the local authority in Wigan, despite the fact that the
motivation for them is
political.</div>
					<a name="0703026000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that we give the oxygen of publicity to that issue, so that we can say
which party is costing people money and how much, and tell the electors
that the money is coming out of the budget for teachers, social
services and street cleaning. That might make the complainants think
twice.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000469"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on a very good
point. There is no penalty for submitting a complaint that is vexatious
and a waste of time, and which is made merely in order to produce a
headline. There is nothing that we can do about the free press, and we
would not want to do anything, anyway. I wonder, however, whether when
local standards committees deal with complaints they should make a
judgment on whether those complaints&#151;even if not
upheld&#151;are either reasonable, or politically motivated or
vexatious. Why should they not be able to comment on
that?</div>
					<a name="0703026000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might be
individuals in a district who are always making complaints. One cannot
stop that, but if the committee considers five complaints from
Mr. or Miss X, and all of them are trivial, that should be
on the record so that people are aware of what that person is doing.
Then, the next time that he or she rings the press or sends in a press
release, the council can say that that person has complained on five
separate occasions and that each complaint was either vexatious or
unimportant. That would impose a test on those who used the system,
whereas at present there is no cost to making a complaint. I am not
sure whether it would be possible to do, but will the Minister consider
some way of allowing the people who judge the individuals who are
complained about to make some comment on the person who makes the
complaint?</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000470"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I said at the beginning that I
wantedto build strong support in the Committee for this
process. My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan and Opposition Members
have made the same point. I am obliged to try to achieve that, and I
certainly agree with it. I shall explain what the clause does, because
it goes some way to make the point, and then I will respond to the
specific questions.</div>
					<a name="0703026000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause enables the Standards
Board to direct an authority to provide it with periodic and ad hoc
information about the allegations of misconduct it has received, any
request to review a decision to take no action, and the exercise of any
of the functions bythe standards committee or the monitoring
officer.The authority must comply with the request for
information by the date that the Standards Board
specifies.</div>
					<a name="0703026000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
is quite tough and reflects the fact that we are creating a new regime
with 450 authorities in the country. It also covers the point that my
hon. Friend the Member for Wigan made. The Standards Board 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>
						can request information as it sees fit. The
information is primarily intended to be used by the Standards Board to
monitor the performance of the committees and the monitoring officers,
who often have an influential voice in the matter. The ability to
request information is needed to ensure that the board is able to
decide what further support and guidance it needs to provide to help
standards committees and monitoring officers. That is the purpose of
the clause, which covers the point being
made.</div>
					<a name="0703026000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bringing the
council into disrepute is a matter of conduct as well. In response to
the points made from both sides of the Committee, I shall write to the
Standards Board in relation to the types of information it provides to
see whether it has a view on that point. We discussed a sanction on
vexatious complaints and that is something that was consulted upon. The
example that my hon. Friend has given highlights the costs. I could
make the point that parliamentary questions are very expensive as well.
One estimate puts the cost of answering at &#163;1,500 per question,
which makes the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) a very
expensive Member indeed. However, I promise not to issue a press
release on that point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000471"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>On the question of vexatious of complaints,
will my hon. Friend make it clear&#151;either in legislation or in
subsequent guidance&#151;that the timeliness of the
committee&#146;s response to a complaint is also very important? In
particular, could the committee weed out the trivial and vexatious
complaints quickly? That means not waiting for an entire committee
cycle to go on before a complaint is deemed to be trivial or vexatious.
There needs to be a way for standards committees to meet on an ad hoc
basis to weed out vexatious and trivial complaints very quickly, so
that they are not given time to ferment in the media and
elsewhere.</div>

act to speed things up. That is one of the reasons why I am proposing
the idea of a strong independent chair. In other circumstances,
committees can delegate matters to the chair and I think that that
regime is correct in that respect. That will help to address the point
that my hon. Friend has made. If the chair is strong and independent
and the committee has confidence in him or her, and if the chair is
able to knock back complaints that are, in his or her view, clearly
mischievous, that could help to resolve the
problems.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>
					<a name="0703026000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I briefly recount the
experience in Enfield? We had one of the first standards
committees&#151;we had one before the guidance to do so, and before
much decision making was referred to the Standards Board. We in Enfield
determined a number of complaints involving councillors and others
locally, and the chairman dealt with vexatious complaints in the same
way that the Bill proposes. Enfield still has the same independent
chairman, Geoffrey Mills, who performs an excellent service and takes
his role very seriously.</div>
					<a name="0703026000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question is about the burden
on the chairman. Historically, Enfield had local determination powers,
which have been taken away from it over the years. When I was a member
of the committee, the chairman took his role seriously, but his burden
was considerable. To draw out the point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Ludlow about resources, in order to support good chairmen
such as Geoffrey Mills and to attract people to the role of chairing
standards committees, which authorities are now obliged to have, proper
resources will have to be provided to support the work of such offices.
I support the view that the Government need to look seriously at the
issue of resources, not only those provided for the monitoring officer,
but at the remuneration available to chairmen. Given the vital
importance of protecting the integrity of a standards committee by
having independent chairmen, remuneration should not be prescribed or
limited.</div>

							<a name="0703026000474"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
point, and for his support for having independent chairmen. The issue
of resources, which the hon. Member for Ludlow raised, is important and
will be dealt with after the deliberations of the Committee. There will
be consistency throughout the country. Via the training and guidance
that will be available, I am trying to create a superstructure and
framework of support for committees, chairmen and monitoring officers,
rather like those in place for returning officers, who are often
employees of a council, but who operate independently.</div>
					<a name="0703026000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">To briefly explain why I want
independent chairmen, I am trying to create a situation in which
members of standards committees have experience of local councils and
elected members from across the political spectrum. To make a
comparison, employment tribunals have an independent chair who has
knowledge of the tribunal and carries its respect. Often, although not
by prescription, the tribunal also has a retired trade unionist or
officer and a personnel officer or manager, both of whom have
experience at the front line&#151;at the chalk face. It is important
that standards committees have on them elected members and councillors
of different political persuasions, with the guarantee of an
independent chair and some independent members. That is the thinking
behind the measure.</div>
					<a name="0703026000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chair will receive
allowances according to a council&#146;s own scheme. Local
authorities set allowances having regard to the advice they receive
from their own independent panels. That is something that neither I nor
my predecessors got involved in. The consultation did not throw up a
problem with that, but it may come up in future. The clause deals with
independent chairs, but I note the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>

Government Act 2000. It will empower the Secretary of State to make
regulations under whichtwo or more local authorities may
establish a joint committee and arrange for functions that would
normally be carried out by a standards committee to be carried out
instead by the joint committee, so particular districts and groups of
councils can have the same committee. It may be difficult to recruit
enough people in counties with seven or more districts, for instance,
if seven committees are required. That isthe simple idea, and

							<a name="0703026000481"></a>Mr.
Syms:
						</b> Again, I shall be extremely brief. The amendments
deal with provisions on essentially confidential information
accumulated by the ethical standards officers. They pursue a theme in
one or two of our other amendments by providing that the person against
whom the complaint is made should also have access to some of the
documents that the ethical standards officers have, so that there is a
degree of equity and fairness in the process. Again, I should be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on the
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000482"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> My argument is that there arealready
arrangements by which members&#146; conduct is investigated by
ethical standards officers under the auspices of the Standards Board
and not by individual local authorities. In future, those officers will
deal with the most serious allegations and because it is vital that we
have a robust conduct regime that carries public confidence, it should
allow information about the allegation and the results of the
investigation to be circulated to those who have an interest, to
ensure, for example, that the subject of the investigation knows his
position.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div>
					<a name="0703026000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">In principle, making reports
available to interested parties may be beneficial for various reasons,
including informing complainants about the allegations, as well as
encouraging the spread of information and experience on the operation
of the conduct regime. However, I am concerned about the implications
of the amendments. In particular, there are issues about the timing of
any such information being made available, the fear that we would be
cutting off our nose to spite our face, in line with the debate that we
had about mischievous allegations, and the balance between making
information available to the right people and ensuring that genuinely
sensitive information is treated appropriately. I worry that that
balance is not quite right.</div>
					<a name="0703026000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lead amendment would seem to
preventthe disclosure of information that has already been
disclosed lawfully to the public. The second amendment, which would
allow confidential information to be disclosed to the subject of the
investigation, seems likely to cause difficulties for investigators as
a result of the timing of the disclosure and not as a result of the
disclosure itself. Of course, it is vital that, when an investigation
is under way, witness testimonies are not passed to the subject of an
investigation until after he or she has been interviewed, in order to
avoid their memory of events being polluted. I think that that point
will be understood.</div>
					<a name="0703026000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing provision, whereby the ethical standards officer is required
to give the subject of the information the opportunity to comment on
any allegation, adequately allows for appropriate information about the
allegation to be given to the subject at the appropriate
time.</div>
					<a name="0703026000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
157 would provide for the standards officer to discontinue his
investigation following a notice by the Secretary of State preventing
the disclosure of a document&#151;that is an existing
power&#151;but I believe that it is flawed. That is because the
prevention of the onward disclosure of a document by the officer is not
likely to prevent him from completing his investigation, as the
amendment could imply. The notice would prevent the officer from
passing the document to another person, but it would not prevent him
from undertaking his investigation.</div>
					<a name="0703026000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remaining amendments in the
group would require that reports by ethical standards officers be
published and copies sent to everyone mentioned in them. I am slightly
concerned that that would be unnecessarily bureaucratic. On occasion,
the number of people mentioned in a report exceeds 20. I therefore
believe that it would impose a disproportionate burden to require
copies to be provided for everyone mentioned, many of whom will not
have a particular interest in the issue.</div>
					<a name="0703026000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other amendments relate to
the disclosure of information by the monitoring officer, and we
consider that the proposals in the Bill make the provision that the
hon. Gentleman is seeking in his amendment for the information received
by the monitoring officer to be disclosed to interested
parties.</div>
					<a name="0703026000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short,
although I recognise the good intent of the amendments, we believe that
their aims are either already covered, or that they would cause
unintended consequences that would take us down the path that we
discussed before.</div>

if the national adjudicator is abolished, it must be replaced. In the
spirit of decisions being taken locally, I am trying to ensure that
committees will have regard to the advice. Of course there is limited
room for a committee to operate in respect of politically restricted
posts, but it seems to me common sense to allow some leeway. The idea
is that the Secretary of State&#146;s advice will have to be given
regard to by the local committee. Sorry, Mr.

						</b> Never has so much time and effort been taken by
political activists in this country over one simple clause as it has
been over clause 150 of this Bill. It relates to political
assistants&#146; pay and has been the subject of intense lobbying in
the past. I found myself in the unusual position 10 years ago of
representing political assistants, and it is a delight in regard of
that history to bring the clause to the House. It will be even more of
a delight for me as the Minister for Local Government for the clause to
be accepted. I plead with the Committee not to oppose
it.</div>

							<a name="0703026000493"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It does, but there is cross-party support for the
clause. If members of the Committee are interested, I shall explain
what it does. It amends section 9 of the Local Government and Housing
Act 1989 to enable the Secretary of State, in making an order under
that section, to specify the maximum pay that political assistants are
to receive, by reference to a point on a relevant pay scale. It gives
the political assistant the advantage of being linked to a point on a
pay scale rather than to a whim. It also means that the Secretary of
State does not determine the pay rate of political assistants in
councils throughout the country, which has been the case indirectly
until
now.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000494"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> Will the Minister clarify whether my reading of the
clause is at fault? It suggests to me that it provides a fog over the
pay of political assistants rather than the transparency that his
opening remarks suggested was the Government&#146;s aim. By referring
to points rather than amounts, surely the system would make it even
more difficult for those who are interested in establishing how much
political assistants actually
earn.</div>

							<a name="0703026000495"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but the clause will not do that. At the moment, the Secretary of State
is required to lay a new order each time the maximum rate of pay for
political assistants is to be uprated. Their pay was essentially frozen
for several years. It was illegal for councils to increase the pay of
political assistants unless the Secretary of State introduced an order,
which would have meant that, say, the pay of the political assistant to
the leader of Birmingham council would be determined by my right hon.
Friend the Deputy Prime Minister or the current Secretary of State. The
system was very bureaucratic. It meant that we were being asked to
determine someone&#146;s pay, which we did not consider was the right
way round.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>
					<a name="0703026000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Under the
clause, the maximum pay of political assistants will be linked to a
point on the local government pay scale. That will allow any increases
in that pay point as a result of increases to the scale to be automatic
for the political assistant. The council will determine where on the
pay scale the political assistant should be appointed, and any
subsequent increases will be within the general rules and linked to the
scale.</div>

provisions for pay scales that aresubject to discussions and
agreements between local government employers and trade union
representatives, often over and above those provisions. That
information is public. Similarly, it is not often known that a Member
of Parliament&#146;s pay, as discussed by the Senior Salaries Review
Body, is linked to the pay of the superintendent or deputy head teacher
of a large secondary school. One would not know that from the press

						</b> I rise to make the point that the
Minister&#146;s work load and mailbag for the provisions would have
been lessened if many authorities had followed the model in Enfield,
where we have nothad political assistants since the
Conservative administration came to office. We have three stars for
improvements made for the taxpayers of Enfield, who have not had the
burden of political assistants imposed on them. We do not seem to have
lost anything from it in terms of improvement. I am not sure whether
the Minister is aware how many other authorities have followed
Enfield&#146;s good

a speech, an intervention or the reply to an intervention, but I
seriously advise the hon. Gentleman not to go down that route, in light
of the political composition of political assistants. Although he makes
a point on behalf of his authority, I shall not write to the
Conservative leader of Birmingham to point out the issue that the hon.
Gentleman raised. That would be a cheap party political point, and I
would not make one in this Committee unless urged strongly to do so by
my hon.

						</b> For the avoidance of doubt, and despite my
earlier intervention, I must make it clear that the Liberal Democrats
support the clause. There are a number of serious anomalies in the way
that the existing legislation applies, with the question as to whether
somebody is or is not deemed to be a political assistant somewhat in
doubt. It is not in doubt in individual cases, but different
determinations have been made in different authorities, leaving some
people at a serious disadvantage. The clause is to be

has also had the undesirable effect of placing policy officers, who are
officials and sometimes administrative staff, in a difficult position.
A council leader may be the leader of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column464" />Column number: 464</div>
						an organisation with hundreds of millions of pounds
of expenditure and a wide range of responsibilities. If, in practice,
councils have not been appointing political assistants&#151;despite
the fact that they previously did so with all-party
agreement&#151;but have relied on policy officers, who are council
officials, it has placed those people in a difficult situation. That
was part of my reasoning for introducing the clause. I thank the hon.

amendment is designed to test exactly what the Minister is up to in the
clause. At the moment the valuation tribunals throughout England are
many and have the advantage of local knowledge and local experience.
The proposal is for a single valuation tribunal for England. Our
amendment says, &#147;Hang on a minute, if we are going to bring them
together, let&#146;s have one for each region of the country.&#148;
For thesake of simplicity, we have suggested one for each
Government region. I want the Minister to say exactly what he is doing
and why he is doing
it.</div>
					<a name="0703026000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it happens, not
only was my lunch time disrupted, but my late-night reading last night
was disrupted, because I received a communication from the Council of
Valuation Tribunal Members for England. I presume that the Minister has
also seen that document, which sets out a large range of possible
changes to the Bill that that body would like to see and that it says
would lead to amendments to the Local Government Act 2003 that would
make the situation better. I should like to know whether he has seen
what that body is saying and whether he accepts its line of
reasoning.</div>
					<a name="0703026000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of my amendment is to test the Minister on what we are doing and why we
are doing it. It would be of further benefit if he responded to some of
the criticisms and suggestions made by the Council of Valuation
Tribunal Members. It is fair to say that valuation tribunals do not
appear very often on the political radar of Members of Parliament, but
we might enter into a whole new realm if we ever get around to the
revaluation of council tax and various other things. The tribunals
could suddenly become much more important. It is therefore appropriate
for the Secretary of State to give good justification for what, on the
face of it, appears to be anything but a devolutionary
measure&#151;if the Government get rid of individual tribunals around
England and consolidates them into one
body.</div>
					<a name="0703026000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to

Government&#146;s
thinking.</div>
					<a name="0703026000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that the work of valuation tribunals rarely
appears on a Member of Parliament&#146;s radar screen. That indicates
that they are doing a good job. The Government&#146;s view is that
they do a good job, which prompts the question, &#147;Why are you
changing them?&#148; I want to explain why. Conservative Members, if
they are true to their philosophy, would object to change for
change&#146;s sake&#151;although not all Conservative Members would
do so, of course. We are adopting a devolutionary approach, consistent
with the Government&#146;s wider policy on tribunals, which ensures
their independence and&#151;I was going to say
&#147;modernise&#148;, but I suspect that Conservative
Members&#146; ears would prick up and it would prompt them to oppose
me, so let me say instead, &#147;To bring them more up to
date&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0703026000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, there are 56 tribunals in England, with chairs and presidents
nominated from their local areas, and with members who serve on them.
We should be grateful to them. They do not often get the headlines, and
we might ask how much work they do in light of the fact that there has
not been a valuation of domestic properties since 1991-92. Of course,
they also deal with appeals on new houses; anomalies resulting from
cases in which houses have been wrongly valued or in which that has
been alleged; and non-domestic rates.</div>

					<a name="0703026000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
revaluation of non-domestic rates every five years, and one took place
two years ago. Those have nothing to do with the future of domestic
property revaluations; members of the valuation tribunal services get
on and do their jobs. The Government&#146;s policy on tribunals in
general is to bring them under the remit of the judicial appointments
process, so that they are independent and seen to be
independent.</div>
					<a name="0703026000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asks whether this is not a centralising measure, given that
there are 56 local tribunals at the moment. It is not our intention,
nor will it be the consequence of this proposal, that those local
tribunals will cease to sit. There will still be local tribunals. They
are needed in order to give the public confidence, to bring local
knowledge to the job and for the sake of administrative efficiency. At
the moment, the Valuation Tribunal Service, the national body, services
the tribunals but does not take judicial or quasi-judicial decisions
relating to valuations&#151;that is the work of the tribunals, and
that will remain the case. That is the crucial point and answers the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</div>
					<a name="0703026000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 151 establishes a
valuation tribunal for England by giving effect to schedule 12 to the
Bill. It also abolishes the separate legal entity of the 56 valuation
tribunals that were created by the Local Government Finance Act 1988
and provides for the transfer of the jurisdiction of those tribunals to
the valuation tribunal for England. Schedule 12 amends schedule 11 to
the 1988 Act.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>
					<a name="0703026000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s view is
that it is not sustainableto continue with 56 separately
constituted valuation tribunals in England, and that variations from
modern tribunal practice in place in the valuation tribunals must be
addressed. Importantly, that view found support in the consultation
that we undertook. Although it has been the cause of some
contentionin the valuation tribunal world, the consultation
supported these moves, the responses to which emphasise that the local
culture of the valuation tribunals should be preserved, as the hon.
Gentleman suggested. That is why we have designed the framework for the
VTS in the way that we have.</div>
					<a name="0703026000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s aim in
bringing forward these legislative amendments is to provide for good
tribunal practice and to encourage the efficient and effective running
of the valuation tribunals for the user and all interested parties
while continuing to sustain their judicial independence. I must
emphasise that it is not our intention, in making these changes, to
lose the local connection, nor do we believe that implementing the
proposals would alter or affect the local nature of the service
provided.</div>

still have the same chairs, the same participants and the same office

where we are going to be? Although we are making a change, he is

						</b> Of course, the remit and the administration of the
tribunals have evolved in recent years in any event. A number of
administrative centres have come together to ensure greater efficiency
and,in administrative terms, I see this measure as a
consequence of that move. It is not efficient to have 56 different
administrative centres, let alone tribunals.</div>
					<a name="0703026000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case of Manchester,
tribunals made up of Manchester members will sit and consider decisions
that relate to the area, so the local nature of tribunals will not be
lost. What will change is that the single legal entity of a national
valuation tribunal for England will have at its head a person appointed
by the Commission for Judicial Appointments through the Secretary of
State for Constitutional Affairs, as is the case for other tribunals.
The employment tribunals that sit in Manchester and are made up of
Manchester people to discuss Manchester cases are part of a national
tribunal service, albeit locally implemented. We are putting forward
the proposals to bring about a greater guarantee of judicial
independence, a more sensible arrangement of administration and a
greater chance of consistency. The measures were contained in policy
documents and, I think, in the manifesto, and they were supported on
the whole, although not unanimously, by the consultation.</div>
					<a name="0703026000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman might ask why
the Department for Communities and Local Government
willmaintain its role as the sponsoring Department of the
valuation tribunal, rather than the Department for Constitutional
Affairs taking it on. The answer is that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div>wish to pursue an evolutionary approach. I do not want to create
unnecessary turmoil or turbulence within the service; there is no point
in fixing something that ain&#146;t broke. In making my improvements,
I am taking a gradual, Fabian-like approach. I hope that hon. Members
will support the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="0703026000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
amendments, I mentioned that there are56 separate tribunals.
By establishing a single tribunal for England with a national
president, we seek to provide judicial independence. We envisage that
that will result&#151;this comes out of conversations with the
service as constituted&#151;in the creation of a regional dimension,
to go along with the local dimension that exists at the moment. We do
not think that to prescribe what that structure should be is the
correct approach, although we envisage that, in practice, that which
the hon. Gentleman seeks will be implemented. The consultation
underlined to many tribunal members the importance of preserving the
local culture of the valuation tribunals. The policy that we have put
in place will preserve
it.</div>

						</b> I shall probably need carefully to look at
<i class="I">Hansard</i>, but I think that I heard the Minister say that the
practical outcome of the reorganisation that he proposes will probably
be that there will be regional units or sub-units of the
administration. Was that the point that he made or did I misunderstand
him?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000507"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> That is, indeed, what the hon. Gentleman heard.
There are already sub-regional arrangements between the tribunals. One
has to maintain the judicial independence of the tribunal members,
particularly the chair, so that decisions are taken free from the
administration of the tribunals. There is a members&#146; committee,
which operates on a national basis, outside the formal constitution of
the Valuation Tribunal
Service.</div>
					<a name="0703026000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
envisaged that, in order to best service the tribunals at a local
level, the office servicing it will not be a national, but a regional
or, often in practice, a sub-regional one. Greater Manchester is a case
in point&#151;there is a tribunal service for Manchester south and
for Manchester north. It is envisaged and expected that that will be
the case. That is the advice of Anne Galbraith, the chair of the
Valuation Tribunal Service, and of her board. Although I agree with the
intention of the amendment, I object to it because I do not think that
we should prescribe in the Bill in advance of the creation of the
tribunal.</div>
					<a name="0703026000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving aside
the question of whether the structure of the regions is suitable, I do
not think that it is appropriate to set out in the legislation the
internal structure of the VTE. Organisational arrangements will be
first and foremost matters for the president of the single tribunal,
who will, of course, be appointed through the independent judicial
process. It would be contradictory to suggest that the head of the
organisation should be independent, but to tell him how he should do
his job.</div>
					<a name="0703026000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can reassure the hon. Gentlemanby, again, emphasising that our

single tribunal for England and of the new position of VTE president to
be appointed through that judicial process. The consultation also
received support for the idea of vice-presidents in order to maintain
communication between the national tribunal for England and the local
tribunals that, in practice, do all the work. Again, I commend that
policy to the Committee.</div>
					<a name="0703026000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We received support during the
consultation that took place in the summer of 2006. Some 80 per cent.
of responses to the consultation came from tribunal members. I
emphasise to the Committee that the proposal for the creation of a
single valuation tribunal for England, with a national president
supported by a number of vice-presidents, received widespread support.
I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing the amendment on the
grounds that it would prescribe in advance what an independent
president might want. I assure him on his point about the local nature
and, more importantly, on the judicial independence of the valuation
tribunal for
England.</div>

						</b> I shall not detain the Committee for long. I
referred before to a briefing provided to the Committee by the
Valuation Tribunal Service. Bearing in mind the reference that the
Minister made to its chairman, Anne Galbraith, I thought that I should
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to its briefing which says that
she has stated on several occasions that she considers the appropriate
sections of the existing Act,&#151;that is the Local Government Act
2003&#151;to be flawed but neither she nor the Department has
attempted to rectify the problem as it would require primary
legislation. The new Bill offers that opportunity. The briefing goes on
to say:</div>
					<a name="0703026000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
present Bill should change the composition of the VTS board by removing
judicial members and replacing them, if that is considered necessary,
with persons of administrative
experience.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister tell us whether he has had the opportunity to consider the
briefing that has been provided, what his analysis of that briefing is
and whether he will give consideration to the matters raised there
about the necessity for further adjustments to this clause at some
later stage to take account of their
concerns.</div>

							<a name="0703026000510"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I have not had sight of the particular document to
which the hon. Gentleman refers. I amof course familiar with
many of the issues that have been raised and I think the points reflect
a very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>understandable anxiety among members of tribunals who hold their
independence, quite rightly, very preciously. The members of the
tribunals are asked to take decisions about people&#146;s level of
council tax and the placing of the council tax band. That is an
important decision and the tribunal members do take that independence
very seriously indeed.</div>
					<a name="0703026000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman has said,
reflecting the views in the document, the Valuation Tribunal Service is
there to facilitate the running of the tribunals. The idea of the
president being appointed through the Judicial Appointments Commission
would be that we had somebody of high standing who would have
experience of the administrative functions of an organisation and the
areas of decisions of the tribunal service itself. That president would
be subject to appointment through recommendation of the Judicial
Appointments Commission, subject to the ratification of the Secretary
of State for Constitutional Affairs. Indeed, ratification by the Lord
Chancellor is the correct procedure.</div>
					<a name="0703026000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">My dealings with the tribunal
service have not been as high on the political barometer as the
political assistants pay issue has&#151;in fact, it has been in the
bottom decile compared with that issue&#151;but it is nevertheless a
serious issue that is subject to much intense debate. I would certainly
want to ensure that the model that would be created would serve for the
purposes of ensuring that
independence.</div>

							<a name="0703026000511"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Given all the matters that are making blips on
the Minister&#146;s radar screen, it is quite understandable that
this one has not. However, I would appreciate it if he could take the
time to catch up with this particular bit of
paperwork.</div>
					<a name="0703026000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that this particular council of tribunal members, if my briefing is
correct, currently represents two thirds of the presidents of the
existing tribunals. Clearly it is a body that has measured its words
carefully, and if it is appropriate for further adjustments to be made
I would ask the Minister to give the Committee an assurance that he has
not closed his mind to that possibility when he has had the opportunity
to digest its
words.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000512"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am more than happy to do that. The members
committee has indeed a judge as its chair to advise and help them. My
officials have met with that person and I have received representations
over the years on these matters. I understand there is currently a
request for a meeting with me on these matters. I undertake to follow
the course of action that the hon. Gentleman has urged on me.</div>
					<a name="0703026000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give the hon. Gentleman
further reassurance by pointing out to him that many of the members of
the tribunals are prominent councillors of all political persuasions. I
have been surprised to learn just how many councillors are on the
tribunals. They bring with them knowledge and expertise. These are not
just the warm words of a Minister in a Committee giving an undertaking
on behalf of his officials who will, as ever, diligently carry out the
work; it is something that comes not on the political radar screen but
on the policy radar screen.</div>

amendment No. 196, in clause 153, page 109, line 26, at end

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa) monitoring the
quality of the delivery of care
services;&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0703026000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Benton. I apologise to
the Committee for being absent for the last couple of sittings. I was
in the holy land of Israel, once memorably described by David Vine, the
BBC sports commentator, as a Mecca for tourists. Sadly, I have to
report to the Committee that the seriousness of the issues being dealt
with over there and the stubbornness of the sides involved make a
return to the bonhomie and the present discussions of this Committee
very welcome. It puts all our deliberations in this country into some
sort of perspective. It is nice to be back and good to see
colleagues.</div>
					<a name="0703026000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment begins the discussion on part 11of the Bill which
deals with patient and public involvement in health and social care.
Members of the Committee have received a great deal of information
about this from various bodies. They all have specialist knowledge in
this area and have been generous with their time and expertise in
briefing us for this part of the Bill. I shall ask for your generosity,
Mr. Benton, in dealing with this amendment. I will not
discuss all aspects of the concerns that members of patients forums
have about the Bill, but if I could include one or two general remarks
it would save repetition when we debate later
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0703026000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have all
been a little taken aback by the vehemence of the concerns expressed by
those involved in patients forums and the concern with which they have
approached us in relation to this part of the Bill, which does away
with patients forums and substitutes for them a new creation called
LINKs. Part of the reason for their concern is that there is some
history here which is relevant to the amendment and the power of
patients forums to monitor the activity for which they are given
responsibility. Part of the history of that concern is related to the
way in which patients&#146; representatives feel they have been
treated over a period of
time.</div>
					<a name="0703026000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will remember the evidence given to it at the beginning of the witness
sessions by Elizabeth Manero and Sally Brearley of the social
enterprise body, Health Link, and the worries that they expressed
during the course of their evidence. I shall quote, as I have quoted
before, from Elizabeth Manero, because she puts it very clearly and
sets down a marker that we should take into account and that will guide
us through these discussions. She said:</div>
					<a name="0703026000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The other day, I met
someone from my local patient and public involvement forum who was
involved in mental health and who talked about the despair and
disillusionment of the forum members, many of whom are mental health
service users. They had found, yet again, that they were told,
&#145;You are really great; you are doing a great job, but we are
going to get rid of you.&#146; The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>message that comes across from that is, &#145;We are going to get rid
of you&#146;, not &#145;You are an excellent resource.&#146;
Actions are judged more than words, and all the other reassurances
about the quality of the forums, which I thoroughly endorse, are
undermined entirely by abolition.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Public Bill
Committee, </i>30 January 2007; c.
56.]</div>
					<a name="0703026000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elizabeth was moved to quote
from Brecht&#146;s poem &#147;The Solution&#148;, in which he
raises the possibility of a Government, disappointed with its people,
abolishing the people and electing another. That was an ironic
statement if ever there was one&#151;a statement that we would all
agree was a strong one to refer to in the present
context.</div>
					<a name="0703026000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patient
representatives have not been alone, however. A number of hon. Members
of all parties spoke on Second Reading, and made clear during the
witness sittings their own concerns about abolition of forums and the
manner of that abolition. As I have said, there is history in all this.
The guide to the Bill prepared by the Library includes, on page 91, a
quote from Melanie Johnson, who was then Under-Secretary of State for
Health. In July 2004, she said that forums were the cornerstone of
patient and public involvement
and:</div>
					<a name="0703026000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They will
not be abolished, nor will their independence be
undermined.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
if it has not been done before, this is an appropriate time to pay
tribute to the Library staff for their excellent work in producing the
entirely bipartisan and neutral research papers that help us so
much.</div>
					<a name="0703026000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same changes
have happened before, when community health councils were abolished
some years ago. Patient representatives feel marginalised by processes
whereby they are first involved in the health service, and then let go;
by situations being adjusted without proper consultation; and by not
being involved in the decisions that are made about them. It is clear
from all their submissions to us that they strongly believe that the
measures in the Bill, and the first amendments, justify concern. I
shall elucidate the nature of that concern as we proceed through the
clauses and amendments. However, the patient representatives believe
that there will be a dilution of the powers and expertise that they
have and that they would like to bring to the service of those involved
in health care provision in future.</div>

						</b> Pausing only to point out that Jerusalem contains
the third most holy shrine in Islam, may I point the hon. Gentleman to
the questions put to the Minister of State, Department of Health, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central(Ms
Winterton), in the fourth scrutiny sitting? In that sitting, I raised
the use of the term &#147;abolition&#148;, because it is a term
that causes alarm and concern despite being merely the necessary legal
description of a process of change. In her reply to my question, my
right hon. Friend said that there was no reason why that process could
not be seamless. The only reason that the change is necessary is
because of integration with the now well-established scrutiny powers of
local authorities.I agree that it is unfortunate to have had
two fundamental changes in a relatively short time, but I hope that the
changes that will take place during the next 12 months or so can be
regarded as part of a process, rather than as abolition and as starting
from scratch, because they do not amount to
that.</div>

Burt:
						</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. In fairness,
however, he made exactly those points in questioning Elizabeth Manero
and Sally Brearley in the witness statement sitting, and we are now
some three weeks beyond that stage. I have not noticed that we have
received, in answer to the requests for reassurance sought by the hon.
Gentleman from the Minister, information from those who previously
lobbied us that their fears have been dealt with and that they regard
everything as okay. On the contrary, they have continued to express
their concerns about the way the measure is being progressed,
specifically on a number of particular powers and offices that they
expect to carry out.</div>
					<a name="0703026000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is entitled
to make his point. However, if the matter had been dealt with to the
satisfaction of those who are lobbying us, if they regarded the
transition as seamless, and if they accepted the Minister&#146;s
assurances at face value, we would not have had the continuing
representations that many of us have had.</div>

						</b> Surely, like me, the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire must find slightly implausible the suggestion that all we
have is an existing organisation given a new function&#151;a seamless

abolition.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made his own point and one
with which I thoroughly agree. That is the point. It is not the
seamless carrying on of the existing forums. They have been turned into
something quite different. It is those very differences that lead to
the amendments and the concerns, which we will be
discussing.</div>

							<a name="0703026000518"></a>Tom

						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the way in
which local authorities are organised means that there is a bigger area
of grey between the fields of health and social care than ever before.
Is it not therefore right that the method of scrutiny and patient
intervention and involvement should reflect that huge area of overlap
between local authority and health service
responsibilities?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000519"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is taking us into the substance
of part 11 as a whole. I do not want to get into the general discussion
because, rather like an onion, the various layers will unpeel as we go
on. To make the point, if what he said held water with those who are
most closely involved, we would not be engaged in the discussion of the
clauses that we are going to be engaged in. He is entitled to put his
point, one that I have no doubt the Minister and his loyal colleagues
will be making equally strongly. However, to judge from some of the
amendments tabled and from previous comments, I suspect that not all
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues share his belief that all is
sorted.</div>
					<a name="0703026000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will make
one response to the general point the hon. Gentleman has raised about
the expansion of LINKs theoretically encompassing a very large number 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>
						of people and thus diluting the very special patient
voice which exists through the forums. The forums maintain that they
are patient representatives, not collections of organisations with
connections to the health service. They are not diluted by having a
number of health professionals sit on their bodies. They are patient
representatives, which is what has given them the voice which they
believe provides such an important point of reference in the monitoring
of health services. The central point of their concern is whether that
will be lost. Notwithstanding the different provision of health
services, a distinctive voice is going to be lost in some manner. It is
for the Minister to convince us all, during the discussion on the next
few clauses both today and next week, that that is acceptable. However,
I maintain that the views expressed to us suggest that there is doubt
about that.</div>
					<a name="0703026000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
turn, if we may, directly to amendment No. 196 which seeks to add the
phrase</div>
					<a name="0703026000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;monitoring the
quality of the delivery of care
services&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0703026000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim is to
ensure that a particular type of expertise will not be lost. Forums
have told us that they clearly regard their function not as
cheerleaders for services, people eliciting views about services or
making private reports for service providers&#151;we will come onto
that in a moment&#151;but as people who monitor the quality of
services. By their presence, they make service providers think
carefully about what they are doing because they are dealing with those
who directly represent service users. The concern is that the power to
monitor has been taken away. This amendment seeks to put that back
in.</div>
					<a name="0703026000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also believe
that monitoring is a proactive role, not simply a passive one. Without
the remit to monitor, the power of entry&#151;we will discuss later
whether it should be one of entry or to inspect&#151;will be just
that: the ability to enter premises and gather views rather than take a
more proactive role, one which the term &#147;monitoring&#148;
implies. Monitoring also gives substance to what members are to do. As
we will hear later, it is difficult enough for forums to attract
members at present; they will maintain that they have been messed about
in the past and that they need a dedicated core of people who build up
expertise in order to be able to do their job. People must have
something positive to do. It is not a matter of getting a group of
well-meaning volunteers to sit around, be told things about the health
service, nod knowledgeably and go away; these are people who want to do
something.</div>
					<a name="0703026000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
discussion has been about what councillors feel now. The argument is
that because the nature of councils has changed and their powers are
different, it has become more difficult to recruit councillors because
some feel that they do not have a proper job to do any more. That is
something that every member of the Committee
understands.</div>
					<a name="0703026000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
point is made about the forums: members must be given something proper
to do. They must not be seen by the public, the press and health
services as well-intentioned, well-informed patsies who go around
masquerading as people who can take a serious part in the provision of
health care services. That is the gist of their concerns. The amendment
would ensure that monitoring the quality of services would become a
distinctive part of what LINKs will be about in
future.</div>

							<a name="0703026000520"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Clause 153 will create a strange beast, which we do
not yet recognise as it does not exist, and it will apparently have the
potential to morph into all sorts of exciting things that the
Government hope will serve patients and the NHS ever better. That is
the rationale for the change, which is not expressly said to be to
negate the work of an already troublesome body that is a thorn in their
side. It is said not to be a reflection in any way on the performance
of that body; it is thought to be a progressive development. However,
it is very difficult to grasp what it will look like and how it will
function. Trying to get one&#146;s hands on exactly what the new
institution will be like is a bit like knitting fog.</div>
					<a name="0703026000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was grateful for the policy
document that was sent to us prior to this sitting, which endeavoured
to spell out further what was involved. It does not altogether pre-empt
all my criticism, most of which I will save for the stand part debate,
neither does it give the reassurance that would completely reassure the
critics on Second
Reading.</div>
					<a name="0703026000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a lot
to be said for amendment No. 196, which endeavours to flesh out what is
very ill defined; I could think of many other areas in which such
fleshing out is required. The clause talks about
&#147;involvement&#148;, but it does not specify what that might
itself involve. Monitoring is something that we would want such a body
to do. Most health services are very well monitored already in a
professional capacity by a variety of different inspectors and service
deliverers. We are talking about monitoring in respect of the
patients&#146; experience.</div>

							<a name="0703026000521"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> We can expect to hear from the Minister that the
very nature of monitoring means that he wants to reduce it in some way
to reduce the pressure. Is not the whole point that this is monitoring
by those who represent the users of the services, so it is unlike any
other monitoring or auditing? That is why it should remain as a
distinctive part of what people are asked to
do.</div>

							<a name="0703026000522"></a>Dr.

						</b> I thoroughly agree with the hon. Gentleman, who
cited the example of mental health services, where the experience of
users and of people delivering the service can differ markedly. We
could all figure out if we were medical practitioners what the
experience of a patient might be in an operating environment or a
hospital bed, but to have a concept of what it is like for the user of
a mental health service is not easy to establish. It can be done
effectively only by a group that can monitor effectively. I support the

							<a name="0703026000525"></a>Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I understand, as do other hon. Members, the
concerns expressed by patients forums and their members. Such people
see the word &#147;abolition&#148; in the Bill and understandably
fear that their experience, expertise and commitment will be lost as
part of that process. Many of those people feel undervalued and to some
extent marginalised by the process that has led to the measures in the
Bill. They feel that there is no guarantee, despite the reassurances
given, that they will be able to continue the work they have done, or
that they will be engaged in the work of the new LINKs. As other hon.
Members have reminded us, those people will have in mind the abolition
of community health councils and all the fears attached to
that.</div>
					<a name="0703026000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
issues about which I hope the Government will reassure us. The first is
about the powers and responsibilities of the new LINKs and whether they
will be as effective as the Government intend. The second issue is
about the arrangements for existing forum members and their ability to
continue their work, and whether they will have opportunities to
undertake the work they do on behalf of users of health services within
the new LINKs structures.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000526"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I begin by expressing my condolences to the
Minister for having to incorporate these measures within his Bill.
Clearly, the measures extend beyond the remit of the Department for
Communities and Local Government into that of the Department of Health.
Given the consensual approach that he has taken to the Bill, it behoves
us to act reasonably when we come to making criticisms of certain
aspects of it. The clauses we are coming to clearly give rise to
criticism, and the Minister will have to take responsibility for them
even though they are not his responsibility in the first place. I am
sorry that he has been put in that position.</div>
					<a name="0703026000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, it is clear
that what we have before us is a dog&#146;s breakfast, to put it as
politely as I possibly can. I had the opportunity to consult an
existing forum on reconfiguration in my own area and so have some
experience of the difficulties that forums face in representing
patients and other health service users. I therefore have some sympathy
with the Government&#146;s objective of trying to make the forums
work better. However, the Government&#146;s set of proposals is so
ill thought through that I see little prospect of LINKs consultation
groups achieving the objectives that the last groups, which were set up
in December 2003, signally failed to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="0703026000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same
time, the proposals will serve to alienate some 4,500 individuals who
gave of their own time to help and support the forums. From the
conversations that I have had with those currently involved with
patients forums, it is highly unlikely that they will wish to volunteer
to help out with the formation of LINKs, given the way in which they
have been treated and the way in which the Government still are
changing the rules about the involvement of forums in, as it were, an
interregnum period. My understanding is that every time the Government
think about the matter, they decide to extend the period over which the
forums will continue to exist in the hope that some forum members will
remain and that they will then volunteer to join LINKs as and when they
are established. The proposals are muddled from start to
finish.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>
					<a name="0703026000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">An issue that I would wish to
raise as part of my stand part contribution is that of governance.
There will be powers, which we shall go on to discuss, that are
different from the current powers residing with the overview and
scrutiny committees, not least thepower to enter and inspect.
That power is probably appropriate, but it is a statutory
responsibility. The way in which LINKs will be established and
supervised appears to be a complete free-for-all. I am sure that the
Government will argue that it is yet another example of their attempt
to devolve power to local communities and that it will be up to local
communities to decide how they want to do
things.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000528"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> The Minister nods his assent. In some respects, he
has my sympathy but we are dealing with statutory powers, so there must
be some kind of oversight or control over how LINKs will operate. The
Bill is virtually silent on the governance of the new bodies. Will he
give some amplification on how that governance will work? For example,
if someone is established as a director, or whatever they choose to be
called, and is a responsible officer for a LINK, where will the powers
reside to remove that individual in the event of some impropriety or
conflict of interest?</div>
					<a name="0703026000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take the example of a
private health provider putting forward one of its directors to be an
officer of a LINK and there being seen to be a financial relationship
between the primary care trust and that provider, which is now
supervised by the LINK. Will that be permitted, and what will happen if
it is discovered after the event? There is a whole host of issues on
the governance of LINKS that we do not have time to go into now but
that I do not believe the Government have thought about at
all.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000529"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I endorse what my hon. Friend has said. I was
recently in discussion with the local patients forums in my borough of
Bromley. I am sure that all other Members have had the same experience:
they are excellent people who do an awful lot of hard work, but they
were thoroughly disillusioned and demoralised by the way in which this
change has happened. It is very sad that we run the risk of some of
those good people walking away. I hope that they will not, but at the
moment there is not much to give them
comfort.</div>
					<a name="0703026000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Minister has stated that the Department of Health talked about making
the transition seamless, which I accept, that is not the way it comes
across to the people who are involved on the ground. It is fascinating
to examine the written and oral evidence that we have been given and
the evidence that we have picked up from small organisations in our
constituencies. The overwhelming consensus among the thousands of
people involved at the grass-roots level is that the Department of
Health&#151;let us put the blame where it belongs, rather than with
the Minister&#151;has got it wrong. I am sorry to say that I am
inclined to think that those thousands of people are more likely to be
right than the Department of Health. Despite the draft that is
promised, nothing that has come forward so far will reassure those
people. Another concern is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div>that the folk involved, often in a voluntary capacity, have valuable
links with other organisations in the community. If they walk away,
some of those informal networks, which help to oil the wheels, will
tend to be lost.</div>
					<a name="0703026000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
wished to make a point on the clause stand part debate about the
involvement of local councillors. I appreciate the point about the
desire to strengthen working between patient involvement on the one
hand and the overview and scrutiny committees on the other. None of us
would dispute the fact that that is perfectly sensible. However, I fear
that there is a missed opportunity. Although there is useful work in
the Bill on the involvement of the overview and scrutiny
committees&#151;in other words of councils as a whole&#151;an
opportunity has been lost to involve ward councillors by giving them a
right to consultation on changes in health service provision in their
areas.</div>
					<a name="0703026000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Commission
on London Governance made a recommendation on a cross-party
basis&#151;all three principal parties on the London assembly and in
London Councils supported it&#151;that harps back to our earlier
discussions. It recommended that if we were to strengthen the role of
councillors as local champions, one way in which that could usefully be
done would be if they were entitled to be consulted about
changes&#151;for example, in local GP or dental provision. Armed with
the benefit of a democratic mandate, they could be empowered to take up
the cudgels on behalf of their communities and, because of their local
LINKs, they would be able to work well with exactly those volunteers
that we are in danger of losing at the moment. I think that it is a
shame that we do not have more about that in the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000530"></a>Tom
Levitt:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Let us think<b class="B"> </b>back to earlier clauses
and the importance of local strategic partnerships and other such
bodies in which councillors&#151;presumably consulting and being
informed by their constituents on an ongoing basis&#151;are involved
directly with health authorities. Is that not where the level of input
comes from councillors in that respect?</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000531"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> That is one level of the input. However, we have
discussed the fact that some health trusts are not included on the list
of bodies and that they should be. The process would be strengthened if
they were. I still stick with that point. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am
grateful to the Minister for that. That works at a strategic level. The
point that I am making is that there is also a lower, more local level
in which the ward councillor could have a very useful and legitimate
input into what happens below the strategic partnership
level.</div>
					<a name="0703026000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I have
suggested does not rule out what the hon. Member for High Peak is
suggesting. I take that on board, but I think that we could usefully go
a step further and that is what the Commission on London Governance was
suggesting. As part of that broader strengthening of the existing
democratic process with local councillors, we could give them a right
to consultation on a number of the issues about health service
provision in their wards and communities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000532"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting an additional tier?
I understand that there are health overview and scrutiny committees on
nearly every major council and there is an obligation to consult them
on a whole range of health issues in that area. Is he suggesting that
something needs to be done in addition to that, a further process of
consultation managed or
otherwise?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000533"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I would be very reluctant to create other
tiers, but I would have hoped that, with a bit of good will, it would
not be impossible to achieve my aim. If local councils are given that
right, that could be built into the existing tiers. I understand the
desire to have the local area agreements and the local strategic
partnerships looking at the strategic level. There is nothing wrong
with feeding into that process. For example, the councillors in the
Chislehurst ward in the London borough of Bromley would be consulted
about local changes. They would then be able to feed in their
suggestions. This is not intended to be a large or bureaucratic
process, but it comes as part of the package that we would argue is
desirable in strengthening local councillors as community champions. I
am asking the Minister to consider how the current structure could
accommodate that being taken on board, without, I accept, the need for
us to create yet a further tier of
bureaucracy.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000534"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I believe that historically local councils had to be
consulted on the distribution of pharmacy services. Therefore, the hon.
Gentleman is asking for something similar to apply in the case of
health services.</div>
					
					<a name="0703026000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000535"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>That is a very useful analogy. I think that
it could be done with a fairly light touch. The key thing is the right
to be involved. When the Greater London Authority Bill was discussed, a
number ofus raised concerns about the way that local ward
councillors are sometimes, perhaps more by accident than design, kept
out of the loop in the developmentof safer neighbourhood
powers. That would be undesirable if it was to become entrenched.
Similarly, it would be desirable if we could get into a culture that
gets local councillors into the loop over local community health
facilities because they would have a great deal to contribute. That is
the point that I was raising. I hope that the Minister will be able to
give us some reassurance.</div>

						</b> Before my hon. Friend ends his speech, and bearing
in mind that he was making remarks that would have formed part of a
stand part debate, would he be good enough to ask the Minister to
consider the fundamental question of why this is being done? We tried
to get an answer from the Minister of State, Department of Health, the
right hon. Member for Doncaster, Central, and we asked the witnesses
who came before us and they could not give us an answer. I asked the
Minister twice and I am not certain that I got an answer. As he now has
the bridge in relation to this particular matter&#151;I do not know
during which amendment it will come up or during which part of the
debate&#151;I would be grateful if he could be asked the question so
that he can enlighten us now.</div>

hon. Friend&#146;s question in his direction, but it was exactly the
same question that the people raised with me on the patients forum in
Bromley&#151;why? When the London assembly&#146;s health committee
scrutinised the proposal, people asked, &#147;Well why?&#148;

December, because that was my birthday&#151;I was proud that although
it does not have the snappiest of short titles, it is a hugely
important landmark for local government. As far as I have been able to
establish, it is the first Bill in 50 years to bring the health service
and local government closer together again in legislation. The Bill is
a local government reform Bill, a public involvement in health Bill,
and a local government involvement in health
Bill.</div>

obligation to put in place local involvement networks for health

							<a name="0703026000542"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It is the job of the Opposition to ask intelligent
questions and that is a very intelligent question, which I am going to
answer&#151;not in one word, which could in fact be the three words:
&#147;Because we can&#148;. That would irresponsible and dishonest,
too. The background to the policy proposal in part 11 should be seen in
the context of our earlier debates, particularly on the provisions
dealing with the local area agreements, the duty to co-operate and the
best value duty to inform, involve and consult. The clause brings
together local service provision.</div>
					<a name="0703026000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The judgment that the Government
take is as follows. We have representative democracy. We agree with the
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that elected councillors should
be the fulcrum of local policy making and local scrutiny, and we wish
to ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div>that through the Bill. We are strengthening overview and scrutiny, so
that those councillors can scrutinise health and social care policies
and services. The community call for action that we discussed
previously will empower an individual back-bench councillor to refer a
matter to overview and scrutiny, which includes the provision of health
and care services in their
area.</div>
				
					
					<a name="0703026000406"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0703026000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have talked
about representative democracy through elected representatives, but we
now need to talk about participative democracy. The reconnection of
politics and public services to the citizen requires participative
democracy, which must always be subservient to representative
democracy, but is important none the less. The Government are trying to
provide a model for the public, including patients, to participate in
making health services accountable and helping them to improve by
making suggestions. It will then join up that participation and the
scrutiny that follows from it with health and social care. Why?
Because, as we heard from evidence, patients do not distinguish between
providers of services. People do not care whether it is social services
or the health service that provides care.</div>
					<a name="0703026000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must look at the matter in
the round. Through LINKs, we want to provide an interface between
participative democracy in the monitoring, scrutiny and improvement of
health and social care, and representative democracy in the form of
elected councillors. The crucial point is that the interface is
provided through the ability of LINKs and the people in those
organisations to refer those matters to the overview and scrutiny
committee. That will empower the public&#151;patients and users of
the service&#151;to have access to representative democracy as well
as adding to the power they have through LINKs. Hon. Members rightly
have questions, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford has tabled a
series of amendments that he believes would improve the set-up, as have
Opposition Members. However, that is our policy on
LINKs.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanations
and for his generosity in giving way. I want to expand on the question
&#147;why?&#148;. The follow-up question is: what is it in the
composition of the forums or their conduct that did not allow them to
be expanded to take on a new role in the provision of services through
local authorities? Why did they have to go and why did they have to be
subsumed in the manner proposed by the LINKs? What was so wrong about
what they did that they could not continue to exist with new
powers?</div>

							<a name="0703026000544"></a>Mr.

						</b> As a parent, I have always found the question
&#147;what for?&#148; more difficult than the question
&#147;why?&#148; In practice, the former often requires a
convincing answer, whereas the latter often requires a philosophical
one&#151;normally, &#147;Because I say so&#148;. In logic, that
is what is called the 16th law of the imperative. In response to the
question &#147;what for?&#148;, I say to the hon.
Gentleman&#151;I am really pushing you here, Mr.
Benton&#151;that there are three components to part 11: the
establishment of LINKs; the abolition of the Commission for Patient and
Public Involvement of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>
						Health and the patient forums that flowed from it,
and a strengthening of the requirement to consult patients and the
public. About &#163;28 million is being provided to the commission
this year, and the budget three years ago was about &#163;32 million.
We believe that there is a resource there that can respond to the
changes taking place in the landscape of health and social services,
such as the creation of trusts through the Children Act 2004 and the
creation of a greater local concentration through local area agreements
that will be in place at the end of this month in every local authority
area in England. It is that change in framework and those changes in
the evolution of health and social care that justify the
reconfiguration.</div>
					<a name="0703026000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of my answer is that we can look at change in two ways. We
can keep the name and evolve it, which is a broadly conservative view,
or we can change the name and evolve it, which is the view of the
radical. I try to examine the content and say, &#147;If it
isn&#146;t broken, why are you fixing it?&#148; The question that
the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire is really asking is,
&#147;Is it broken?&#148; The system is not broken in the sense
that it is not fulfilling the purpose for which it was set up; however,
it needs, and can now have, a broader purpose. The original legislation
was tightly defined and inflexible.</div>
					<a name="0703026000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">One hears frustration from
patients forums, and hon. Members have talked about demoralisation. We
know that any change in infrastructure can lead to demoralisation but
my positive message is that the broadening of the role, because of the
change in the architecture of health and social care, gives greater
power and freedoms and a greater remit to the same people.</div>
					<a name="0703026000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge the point that we
need to carry people with us. Part of the way in which one does that is
to ensure that functions are properly resourced. The hon. Member for
Ludlow raised the net new burdens policy, which applies in this area.
That is an important commitment to
give.</div>

							<a name="0703026000545"></a>Andrew

						</b> The Minister mentioned two ways: the conservative
and the radical. I think that he might be following a third way, which

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0703026000546"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am not going to repeat my conspiracy and cock-up
theory. The approach taken in the Bill provides real substance to the
idea that local people can hold local health and social care services
to account. Hon. Members should be honest and ask themselves this
question: if, when they get back to their constituencies tonight or in
the morning, they were to carry out a random survey of how people could
be involved in influencing the services of their local hospital and
social care services, what is the most common answer that they would
get? I guess that it would be, &#147;I&#146;d ask my
councillor&#148;. The provisions allow for the role of the councillor
and the specialisms and knowledge of the LINKs forums.</div>
					<a name="0703026000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give an example of what
is best about patient involvement from my own research. There was a
survey of people in the north-west who used wheelchairs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>provided by local health services. They were asked what type of
wheelchairs they would like, where they would like them, how long they
should have them for and how the process should operate. The health
service responded positively to the suggestions the wheelchair users
made, so we were able to make a huge saving in the expenditure on
wheelchairs because fewer were damaged, lost or not returned, and there
was a huge increase in the satisfaction of the wheelchair users. We had
our cake and ate it. Through LINKs and the changes we are making, we
are trying to provide a model that is much more likely to facilitate
that process.</div>
					<a name="0703026000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make
one other point, which is very important, before I come to the
specifics. The model of involvement and participation that has been
described in the architecture carries great optimism for the future in
other service delivery areas. What I have said about public
participation in shaping services and advocating them apply equally to
not only health and social care, but transport, education and other
services. I am suggesting quite radical policy to the
Committee.</div>

						</b> The Minister is right to say that LINKs have an
additional power that patients forums did not have, which is that of
mandatory referral to the overview and scrutiny committee, but I do not
think that there will be dancing in the streets as a result of the
concession of the new power. Essentially, there are many examples
throughout the country of patients forums voicing strong views about,
for example, hospital reconfiguration; they have referred the matter to
the overview and scrutiny committee, which has thoroughly agreed with
the forum and endorsed its criticisms; the views have then gone to the
Minister and that was the end of it. In other words, the process has
not stopped frustration. It is just conned people into thinking that
they could do
something.</div>

							<a name="0703026000548"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I note the point made by the hon. Gentleman, as
well as the passion with which he spoke on Second Reading when the
issue was raised. No form of participative democracy can replace the
fact that a decision must be taken. We can certainly improve services
and we can change decisions, but a decision has to be taken. There is
an analogy with petitions, but I shall not go down that railway line
because time is running out, and my Whip and the Chairman are frowning
at me.</div>
					<a name="0703026000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall answer
the specific point. We believe that the new organisations will enable
genuine involvement ofa greater number of people than is
currently the case. They will ensure that there is a stronger voice in
commissioning, and the provision of health and social care in the local
area. They will take a crucial step beyond the existing powers defined
in legislation of the patients forums by enabling people to have a
greater say over social care as well as health services. I understand
the points that have been made, but we see the provision as a
development of the work of forums in a much wider range of ways than is
currently available to ensure that people have the stronger voice to
which I have
referred.</div>
					<a name="0703026000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explicit
relationship between LINKs and overview and scrutiny joins up the
processes and the local authority will have a duty to make contractual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>arrangements, with the involvement of people in commissioning, in
provision and in scrutiny of health services and social care services.
The amendment relates to subsection (2) and monitoring and</div>
					<a name="0703026000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting, and supporting, the
involvement of people in commissioning, provision and scrutiny of local
care services&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">covers the
point made in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0703026000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arrangement that follows allows the funding stream&#151;the money
that is currently made available and will be transferred over&#151;to
go straight to the local level. It will ensure that as much money as
possible is available to fund the front-line activity, the local
activity. The abolition of the Commission for Patient and Public
Involvement in Health is one element of the drive to reduce the
arm&#146;s length nature of the sector and release centralised
funding.</div>
					<a name="0703026000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 11
clarifies and strengthens the current legislation on health service
consultation, which gives NHS organisations a requirement to involve
and consult. That is a similar point to that made by the hon. Member
for Bromley and Chislehurst. We intend to give PCTs a new statutory
duty to respond to local people by explaining the activities that they
are undertaking as a result of what people have said throughout the
year. There will be a structured process whereby commissioners publish
regular reports about what they have done differently as a result of
what they have heard and why they might not have been able to take
forward some suggestions. The process relates to the point that the
hon. Member for Southport made, and to his fear that one might lead
somebody up the hill, and then take them straight back down
again.</div>
					<a name="0703026000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">The requirement
to respond facilitates the solution to that problem. It recognises that
of course not everybody will be happy all the time. That is an
unachievable objective. I am trying to remember who coined that phrase,
but it was not a Liberal Democrat. It was Abraham Lincoln, was it not?
I think that Committee members are falling asleep, so I shall get on
with it. We intend to provide the primary care trust with the new
statutory duty to respond and the structured process to show, through
reports, what has been done as a result of the process under
discussion.</div>
					<a name="0703026000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 11 is
also an important step towardsrealising the ambition to
empower local people. The requirement on local authorities to make
contractual arrangements to ensure that there are means by which local
involvement network functions can be carried out, defines those
functions. Clause 153(2)(a) describes
</div>
					<a name="0703026000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting, and
supporting, the involvement of people in the commissioning, provision
and scrutiny of local care
services&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0703026000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subsection
also defines the functions as,</div>
					<a name="0703026000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;obtaining the views of people
about their needs for, and their experiences
of&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">health and social care
services; making those views known to
people</div>
					<a name="0703026000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;responsible for
commissioning, providing, managing or
scrutinising&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
services; and making</div>
					<a name="0703026000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reports and recommendations about
how&#148;</div>
					<a name="0703026000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">health and social
care services might be improved for those same people. The Bill
includes a regulation-making power, which will allow the Secretary of
State 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>to amend, add to or delete the activities to which I have just referred.
That provision will be subject to a later amendment.</div>
					<a name="0703026000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government believe that it
is vital to promote user involvement in health and social care, because
only by seeking out the views and experiences of those who use the
services will we improve them and make them more focused on the
individual. That is why the clause requires local authorities with
social services responsibility in England to make those contractual
arrangements to ensure that there are means by which LINKs can be set
out. In a two-tier area, it is an obligation not on the district
council, but on theupper tier.</div>
					<a name="0703026000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">LINKs will provide a flexible
vehicle for individuals and groups, including the voluntary and
community sectors&#151;an important point to which my hon. Friend the
Member for Bedford referred. They will promote public accountability
through open communication with the commissioners and
providers.</div>
					<a name="0703026000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 196 is unnecessary. I support the idea of monitoring the quality
and delivery of care services, but subsections (1) and (2) already
cover it.</div>
					<a name="0703026000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Benton, I am very
grateful to you for giving me such latitude. It is important that the
Committee is aware of the Government&#146;s
intentions.</div>

do it that way. On that point, I ask the hon. Member for North-East

the Minister has referred, and which you have generously allowed us to
debate, Mr. Benton, during the course of the Committee and
on Report. I am not sure that I accept that monitoring quality is
covered specifically, and I think that those involved in the forums
will be disappointed that the Government cannot make that
concession.</div>

technical problem with lines 26 and 27 of the amendment. I do not want
to be pernickety. We support the point about monitoring, and maybe
there is a way for us to incorporate it.</div>
