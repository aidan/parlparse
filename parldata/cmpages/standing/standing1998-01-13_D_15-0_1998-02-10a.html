<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 27, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that in the circumstances it seems just and fair to him to be so deemed.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 235, in page 27, line 39, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that any fines imposed under section 28 are shared proportionately among the persons involved, if they are judged by the tribunal to have the same level of culpability.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As we move to the part of the Bill entitled ``Miscellaneous and supplementary provisions'', my ears sharpen, my eyes light up and my tail metaphorically wags because it is in the Bill's implementation, not its overall concept, that the greatest dangers lie. The Minister will no doubt be relieved to hear that I will not use the amendment as a platform for yet another economic debate about the impact of the Bill. However, if the Bill is to work properly, it must properly be conceived. We do not want lightly to concede any errors in it that may have been caused by undue hurry or by the copying in or reading across of other legislation without proper scrutiny.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) confirmed a frightful fact that had already occurred to me about the amendment. As has happened once or twice in the small hours of the night, when the amendment factory has been at work, amendment No. 235 has been--I do not seek to blame anyone, let alone the House staff--tacked to the wrong subsection. It relates to subsection (2), not (3).
<P>
On about my fifth reading of the clause, I detected a potential reading across of legislation that may cause difficulty. There is a danger that Ministers will take existing legislation and simply reproduce it. They have a remarkable affection for the Wages Act 1986, which, as it was a piece of Conservative legislation, I cannot challenge, except to say that it may not always work as intended.
<P>
I understand from reading the clause and from the helpful explanatory notes that it addresses a situation that I can explain by sharing with the Committee a piece of doggerel, which goes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Little fleas have smaller fleas and so ad infinitum.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It relates to a situation where a worker, person A, has an employer, person B, in situ, who is in turn employed by person C. Person C is, therefore, the employer of both person B and, indirectly, person A. It is possible to create, as the doggerel does, a process of infinite regress, in which there could be a series of superior employers. They would not be superior in the sense in which Lord Curzon was once memorably described as a very superior person, but they would be different grades of employer.
<P>
The only constraint to that process of regress is subsection (1)(b), which requires that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the worker is employed on the premises of that other person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I set that out because it is important for the Minister to say a little more about his appreciation of the scale of the situation when he explains the clause to the Committee. I suspect that the situation will apply in what I might loosely call the home worker context, although we are not talking strictly about home working. It may apply in the textile, garment and similar trades. Will the Minister say a little more about the scale of the situation with which the clause deals? In which industries will the clause apply?
<P>
The Committee needs to consider which situations will be dealt with and how we will deal with them. First--and I steer with an eye closely on our probing amendments--will the Minister explain whether the provisions in earlier clauses on enforcement and penalty notices still operate? The clause does not deal with them; it is about offences and penalties, rather than the pre-offence situation.
<P>
My second question relates to amendment No. 250. Will the Minister explain in which circumstances an enforcement officer--we are hardly likely to be dealing with self-referrals from individuals who go down the civil route--will ultimately prosecute one person and not another? In amendment No. 250, Conservative Members have set out their concern that proceedings should be fair and not driven by partiality. I do not suggest for a moment that partiality is intended, but it is important to prevent that from being seen to be the case. Even if there is only a chain of three persons--from employee, to employer, to superior employer--it is important that there is no invidiousness or partiality in the way in which the measures are carried out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Does my hon. Friend foresee circumstances in which the worker, at the behest of the proximate employer, could work on several different premises? Each of the employers on those premises might be regarded as a superior employer for the purposes of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a possibility, and my hon. Friend is right to draw the Minister's attention to it. As I read the clause, that situation would be circumscribed by subsection (1), which requires the employment to take place on the premises of the other person. In other words, it is not a general provision for chains of employment that involve different places, although I may be wrong about that. It is, however, important that we get the measure right.
<P>
I was going to mention the issue of deeming persons to be employers jointly with an immediate or, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) calls him, proximate employer. I do not like deeming things in law without good reason. I am sure that the Minister will pray in aid the Wages Act 1986, but he may have evidence, which he may want to bring to the Committee, of the potential for evasion or monkey business and for people to set up long chains to evade responsibility. We do not want that.
<P>
On my second point of substance, will the Minister say a little more about why an enforcement officer could not simply proceed against a single employer? Presumably, the argument would be that the single employer was put under undue constraint by his superior employer. He may have been put in a position in which he felt that no questions could be asked and that he had to behave in the way that he did. That would hardly happen through his employment contract, but it might happen in other circumstances--money could have been loaned or he might have been told that his job would disappear if he questioned the matter, though I suspect that that would fall foul of other legislation. Life could be made more difficult for enforcement officers and innocent employer chains if the enforcement officer can look back from the proximate employer to a further employer.
<P>
Concern about the defence of due diligence provided in subsection (4) arises from those points. Due diligence could refer to the proximate employer being able to show that he had instructed that things were to be done in a certain way, even though he may not have been on the premises to see that they were. That may have been copied from health and safety concepts, but I am concerned that due diligence--my colleagues who are more involved with City matters than I may have something to say--may simply be a matter of the right pieces of paper showing that superior employers have enjoined proximate employers to comply with the Bill's provisions. Perhaps that is reasonable--a superior employer would probably think so--but, if that is all that is required, I am concerned that a defensive paper chain is being created.
<P>
In a collusive arrangement, such pieces of paper may be accompanied by a nudge and a wink, or a tap on the side of the nose, which means, ``I'm giving you this. It's all rubbish. Don't take it too seriously. You know what to do with your employees.'' That is not what we want. Will the Minister give us a flavour of what will happen in practice?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I want to get some clarification. The hon. Gentleman agrees in principle that there should be no capacity for an employer to use a chain of command to exclude him from his responsibilities. There is no issue of substance between us. Therefore, the debate is about making the clause effective so that that capacity does not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is indeed the case. I have no objection in principle and Conservative Members are not trying to manufacture a way round the provision--the Government have a mandate for the national minimum wage. I am, as a lay person, rehearsing what might happen within the current industrial structure; how the provision might be contrived by other persons as a way round the Bill; and how to use the provision sensibly. We do not want a remedy to a perceived problem that creates more trouble than it is worth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is equally important to ensure that the clause does not catch innocent employers who have perfectly legitimate arrangements? We do not want them to fall foul of an anti-avoidance provision that is aimed at other practices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend puts it more eloquently. We share a common objective as legislators--getting the Bill right within the framework of Government policy. The occasional question about how the clause will work should not be taken as subversion of Government policy. I am not suggesting that the Minister was implying that.
<P>
We do not want innocent people up the chain of employment to stumble into trouble and be subject to penalties when they have done their best. Nor, equally, do we want malicious people to say, ``We don't care what the Act says. We'll find a way round this. If we make a long enough chain we'll throw them off the scent, and they won't do anything about it.'' We are exploring how to make the Bill practical. I am sure that the Minister has wrestled with the matter; the Committee should do so as well.
<P>
In the spirit of remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), I should say that amendment No. 235 seeks to invite the Minister to comment on the issue of culpability.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Culpability will presumably be dealt with under the offence clause, under which it will be shared between employers. As the Committee discussed when considering clause 28, the fine for an offence might be extremely high. We expressed our anxiety about the problem of whether offences should be regarded as being committed by a series of people or by individuals. The fines imposed, even at level 5 of the standard scale, could be penal. We want to probe the total level of such fines, and the question of how a superior employer who is only slightly involved might find himself or herself walking into a minefield and facing a huge and disproportionate penalty for an offence that was at worst minor and technical.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Is my hon. Friend worried that the premise of the clause is that superior and immediate employers will be regarded--initially, at least--as equally responsible? Is that premise the reason for his having tabled the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That point is one of my reasons for tabling the amendment. The word used in the clause is ``jointly''--the immediate and the superior employer are joined together. The proportions of culpability are not clear; the Bill does not state whether they will be determined arithmetically, or whether the persons involved will be linked into having taken the same action or be regarded as having taken separate actions.
<P>
Those points are complicated. In the back of my mind when I conceived the amendment was the fact that, however many employers are involved, there is only one offence to deal with. The nature of that offence may be expressed with reference to a number of pay reference periods or to a number of employees, but there is only one offence. I hope that the fines will not be multiplied by the number of employers involved.
<P>
Those issues are all serious and concern the credibility of the offence provisions. Will the Minister speak more about them?
<P>
One worries about legislation and rereads it many times. Eventually a problem arises that one has not noticed before. The Minister will see that line 44 of subsection (4) refers to the ``provisions of this Part''. I checked this morning and realised that the Bill has no parts. I suspect that the provision has been read across from the Wages Act 1986 and has not been corrected. Will the Minister consider that point? It is not a hanging offence for Ministers to make such a mistake, but I hope that they will correct it.
<P>
The amendments do not seek to subvert the intended purpose of the Bill, or to give employers a green light to create artificial arrangements to subvert that intention. They are intended to invite the Minister to comment on circumstances in which the long-chain employment arrangements in the Bill are likely to apply, and to speak about how they will be operated and regulated.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can satisfy the Opposition that the clause will be enforced sensibly and proportionately. If he can, we will readily withdraw the amendments. I hope that he will assure us that the clause will not mean that an innocent employer who happens to be caught in such a chain can stumble into an enforcement minefield--to borrow the phrase that I used earlier--because of matters with which he or she has very little connection.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Holland--[Interruption.] I am sorry. I mean Mr. Hammond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I sympathise, Mrs. Dunwoody, if your thoughts are slightly less than clear this morning. However, I think that I am right in saying that you were not at the Conservative winter ball last night, so perhaps you do not have the same excuse as Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct in that assumption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to try to ensure that the clause operates fairly and equitably. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) suggested that the most likely area of application for the clause was in relation to home workers. With respect, I suspect that that is not the case and that perhaps the most likely areas of application are agriculture and the construction industry, where it is common practice for chains of labour-only employment to operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I just want to correct my hon. Friend before the Committee thinks that we are at odds on the matter. I said that the clause could possibly apply to home working, particularly as it is key to a single place of employment, but on the other hand, I would not like to imply that that is necessarily the typical situation--we need the Minister to tell us more about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Absolutely. I thank my hon. Friend for clarifying that point. I mentioned agriculture and construction specifically. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is knowledgeable about the agricultural industry, and I have a little knowledge of practices in the construction industry.
<P>
Before I develop my argument, I want to draw attention to a small problem to which my hon. Friend inadvertently alluded in his intervention. He mentioned the place of employment, but subsection (1)(b) specifically refers to the worker being employed on the other person's ``premises''. I have looked in vain for a definition of ``premises'' in the Bill. I wonder whether the use of that word inadvertently excludes instances when, for example, agricultural gangmasters employ subordinate workers in the field. I have no idea whether the legal definition of premises would embrace an open field; I suspect that in ordinary, everyday language, it may not. Will the Minister clarify that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good, useful point. As far as I can see, the requirements for employers to keep records in relation to the national minimum wage do not include a requirement for them to keep a record of the premises where a person is employed to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I suspect that ultimate employers may have some difficulty in keeping the records that the proximate employer--if we may stick with that term--is required to keep. That is just one of the difficulties that the clause creates. As I understand it, it would make the ultimate employer responsible with the proximate employer if those records were not kept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way again--I hope that this will be the last time. Will he comment on the fact that gangmasters typically do not operate on their own premises? The premises of the superior employer may well be on the farm or in the business of some third party, who has nothing to do with the employment chain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. As I said, I defer always to his vastly superior knowledge of agricultural practices, a subject of which I have no particular understanding.
<P>
Conservative Members accept the reasons for the inclusion of the clause--it will mean that unscrupulous employers cannot develop practices that will effectively inject into the chain of command phantom employers and phantom relationships designed to assist the employers in avoiding their obligations. We do not object to provisions seeking to prevent unscrupulous employers from getting around the Bill's intentions. There is, however, a risk of serious unfairness in unintended outcomes from the clause as it stands, which the amendments are designed to tackle.
<P>
I should like to focus my argument on a particular example of a breach of the minimum wage regulations requirements. I refer to an employer who fails to pay the wages due to his employees. My point is particularly relevant to the clause, which deals with chains of employment, but also has a general relevance to the Bill as a whole. Is it the Government's conscious intention that this law will be an additional weapon available to employees whose employer has not paid them at all? That is clearly a situation in which the minimum wage has not been paid, but I do not think that that is the focus of the Bill's purpose.
<P>
Before the Minister leaps to his feet and accuses Conservative Members of condoning the non payment of wages, let me say that that is not my intention. I have had some constituency experience of pursuing a foreign airline which, for months on end, failed to pay wages due to its employees at Heathrow--an extraordinary frustrating experience. The Government may intend the national minimum wage legislation to be available to employees as a weapon to pursue employers who fail to pay wages, but that will have considerable implications for the resources that need to be made available to the officers appointed under the Act. It will open up a whole new legal area, injecting this statutory provision into what would have normally been a contractual dispute between an employee who has not had his wages paid and his employer.
<P>
I raise that issue in relation to this clause because there is a real risk of a genuine intermediate employer being in dispute with the superior employer. For example, an intermediate employer may undertake that work will be carried out and engages subordinate employees for that purpose. The work may be done unsatisfactorily or not at all, and the superior employer may withhold payment to the intermediate employer, who is thus unable--perhaps even unwilling--to pay his subordinate employees. Surely it is not intended that in a genuine contractual dispute, the superior employer, as a contracting party, will find himself unable to exercise his legitimate right to withhold payment under the contract if the result of such action is that the intermediate employer is thus unable to pay his employees. It would be unfair if the superior employer were then placed in jeopardy and put at risk of action under the terms of this legislation.
<P>
The issue becomes more important because of the Bill's definition of employment. Subsection (1)(a) deals with a situation in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the immediate employer of a worker is himself in the employment of some other person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That might appear to exclude circumstances in which the immediate employer was a labour-only subcontractor to the ultimate employer. However, a subcontractor who genuinely believed himself to be a self-employed subcontractor, hiring subordinate employees to work for him, could find himself regarded as being in employment under the Bill's definition.
<P>
I have a little knowledge of, and have already declared an interest in, the construction industry. I will probably win the annual prize for understatement if I say that it would not be uncommon for disputes to occur between superior employers and subcontractors. It is, sadly, one of the industry's features. It would be unintended, inefficient in the way in which the sector operates, and unfair, if the superior employer were directly liable for paying the minimum wage to the employees of a labour-only subcontractor when wages were not paid because of a genuine dispute.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is a narrowly focused point, but it is important because it represents the greatest risk of unfairness. The amendments would go some way to allowing flexibility in dealing with such a situation. They would create the test of providing that action could be taken only if, in the circumstances, it was just and fair.
<P>
The whole area will become additionally complicated when the superior contract--that between the ultimate and the intermediate employer--is expressed in some form other than an hourly rate of pay. To use the building industry as an example, the master of a bricklaying gang may be contracted to be paid a certain amount of money per 1,000 bricks laid. What would happen if the intermediate employer was unable to pay his subordinate employees because, for example, no bricks had been laid due to bad weather? The superior employer might not know how many men were employed on that job, and for how many hours they had been sitting around unable to work. It would not, in the ordinary course of events, be his business.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry that I had to leave the Room during my hon. Friend's speech. Has he addressed himself to the position in which there could be different pay reference periods for the two employments, which could create further complications?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend made the point during his speech that as one rereads the clause, more and more problem areas present themselves. My hon. Friend has just drawn attention to another one.
<P>
In a chain of employment, the superior employer will almost always be a person of more substance than the intermediate employer. He will be easier to sue and to take proceedings against. The clause will not create a joint responsibility; it will throw the responsibility on to the shoulders of the superior employer. In a civil action, the employee or the officer appointed by the Secretary of State will almost always choose to proceed against the superior employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am following the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument. Will he agree, for the sake of fairness, that the fact that the superior employer is the person against whom proceedings will be taken does not mean that he is in every case the more responsible? In most cases, he probably will be, but not in every case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. In many cases, the superior employer will not be, in any lay sense of the term, the person most responsible. It is for that reason that the amendments are appropriate, as they would inject a concept of fairness and justice into the operation of the clause.
<P>
I was speaking about the process that an employee or an officer appointed by the Secretary of State suing for underpayment or--the more difficult case--non-payment of wages will undergo. They will consider a person's ability to pay fines or damages. As is the case across our legal system, the most substantial will be pursued, because they are the most effectively pursued. There could be an unintended but unfair outcome to making the superior and proximate employers jointly responsible: the burden would be thrown on to the shoulders of the superior employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I have been following carefully my hon. Friend's remarks about which of two defendants the plaintiff would choose. He has analysed that correctly; in fact, he brings to my mind the old term of art which casts the question in this form: which of them is worth the powder and shot? Is that what he is asking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend will have experienced that situation many times when practising the law: it might be just and fair to proceed against a given individual or company, but the plaintiff--the wronged party--has logically to conclude that there is no hope of recompense and no point in pursuing a man of straw.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I listened carefully to the hon. Members for Daventry and for Runnymede and Weybridge. They are trying to be helpful, but the amendment drives a coach and horses through the clause, the key element of which is responsibility. For it to be effective, employees must be clear that the employer is responsible for paying their minimum wage. The amendment would destroy that responsibility.
<P>
Not all employer-employee relationships are straightforward. The debate has not addressed who employees would turn to if the amendment, which contains the words ``just and fair'', were accepted. The clause is just and fair, but accepting the amendment would make it unjust and unfair. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that all employees know who is responsible for paying their minimum wage. Employers, contractors and subcontractors must be conscious of their responsibilities, and only effective enforcement will allow that.
<P>
The amendment provides a further defence--a get-out--that would weaken or wreck the clause. For example, home workers in Ontario, Canada, receive a minimum wage which was introduced because they are often subcontracted and have superior and immediate employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me develop my point. I am halfway through and I am sure that he would not want to destroy my train of thought.
<P>
The home worker's problem was that when she was due to be paid by her immediate employer, he often said, ``I haven't been paid by my employer yet, therefore, I can't pay you.'' If the amendment were accepted, she would not know who to claim her minimum wage from, nor who was legally responsible for paying it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Lady gave an interesting example, but the clause would not help at all. As drafted, the clause would require that the lady in question was employed on the premises of the superior employer, so as I understand it, it would not apply to home workers in such a situation.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> In fact, it would. The employer, whether a superior or an immediate employer, has to have responsibility.
<P>
If it helps the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, another example is that of a caretaker for a large company, who had been told by his employer--the company--that as the caretaker, he is responsible for employing cleaning and other ancillary staff on the premises. He is responsible for those staff, but if he receives the money to pay them and does not pass it on, who is responsible then? To whom do employees turn to ensure that they are paid?
<P>
The only way round that problem is to ensure that the employers are jointly and severally liable to pay the minimum wage to their employees. There has to be a key relationship and a line of responsibility so that the employee knows who to turn to.
<P>
I suggest that the provision would also provide protection to employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Lady said that there should be joint and several responsibility. Is she certain that that is what she means? If it were clear that the superior employer were principally culpable but he or she could not be traced or brought to account, is she seriously suggesting that the immediate employer--much the less culpable of the two--should nevertheless bear the full brunt of any action?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> The hon. Member for Buckingham is unusually helpful. I meant that they were to be jointly liable, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
<P>
As I was saying, the provision is also helpful to employers. The superior employer who pays the contractor will know that they both have a joint responsibility to pass on the minimum wage to the employee. It also means that the contractor will not find himself in the position--as in the example that I gave earlier--of paying the immediate employer without any knowledge of whether his money is being passed on to the employee. It makes good business sense for them both to be jointly responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I am coming to a conclusion, and I have given way twice already.
<P>
There is a duty on legislators to strive for clarity in law. If the amendment were accepted, we could tie the courts up for days or weeks on every single case while they decide whether something is just and fair. The amendment is not just or fair--[Laughter]. Conservative Members may laugh, but I think that they tabled the amendment in the hope of weakening the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): Will the hon. Lady give way? I could explain why we are laughing.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I will not give way because I am about to conclude. Conservative Members have often laughed perhaps because the principle of the Bill is not to their liking. Labour Members, however, will not accept amendments that will weaken the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> I should like to make several points to the Minister. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge touched on them in his speech. What was said, almost in passing, about gangmasters and agricultural workers and construction workers may have ramifications that go to the heart of the clause and the amendment, and I should be grateful to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
We all know of the appalling practices in the agricultural sector, which have been going on for some years now. Gangmasters use workers who have perhaps fallen through, deliberately or otherwise, the usual employment nets. Consequently, their labour is exploited. Can the Minister shed some light on how the Bill would improve conditions for those unfortunate people who operate outside employment law and its general protection?
<P>
My second point, which relates to construction workers, is more complicated. For many years, tradesmen and their labouring assistants in the construction industry have been paid on a piece-work basis, which we have covered in other clauses.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having heard the contribution of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), I am exercising my mind on how we can link that culture of being paid by results, and of being a victim of the weather for a day or a week--I know from experience that weather seriously affects construction progress--with making employers responsible for paying a minimum wage in such a variable and unpredictable climate.
<P>
My final point relates to the definitions of ``employer'' and ``employee'' in self-employment. Much work has been done recently to try to tighten the law regarding people in the construction industry who are deemed, or have deemed themselves, to be self-employed for the purposes of making their tax affairs simpler and, possibly, a little more advantageous to them. Measures taken in recent years, and some currently in process, mean that people who previously were able to claim that they were self employed, but who had worked for the same employer for several years, admittedly on a contract basis, and for no one else, now have to be recognised as employees of that employer.
<P>
My points are wider in scope than the amendment, but I should appreciate it if the Minister could say how the Bill would relate to people in those situations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We have had a useful debate. Issues have arisen that had not occurred to me when I was reading and thinking about the clause. That only illustrates how helpful the debates can be. I hope that the Minister will tell us that he also regards the debate as helpful and set out minds at rest on the issues that were raised.
<P>
There were two points on which the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) expressed views and on which I will briefly take her to task. She criticised amendment No. 250 because courts would have to exercise their judgment under subsections (1)(a) and (b) as to whether a superior employer should be treated as liable under the offences. That the courts should be asked to conclude whether that is just or fair in normal circumstances seems to me not an onerous task. It is in the nature of courts to have to make such judgments.
<P>
The courts will not be caught up for days, since they would deal only with those persons who are able to present a reasonable case, such as that instanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, where an employer was able to argue that it would not be just or fair to be treated as a superior employer and as liable. If they can present such a case, it is inherently desirable that courts are able to entertain it, rather than resting solely upon the facts as presented in relation to clause 45(1).
<P>
The second point made by the hon. Member for Basildon was a general one that causes me considerable concern. She did not refer to a superior employer for the purposes of the clause as being the employer of the immediate employer of the worker in question. The hon. Lady spoke of treating the superior employer as the person who contracts with the immediate employer. There is a world of difference between the two interpretations.
<P>
The nature of discussion on a Bill is that we are discussing clause 45, not clause 51, but it is in clause 51 that we will come on to discuss the definition of ``employer'' for these purposes. In so far as the definition stretches beyond the employment contract, it does not stretch so far that everybody who contracts for services with somebody else is automatically treated as the employer. The implications of the hon. Lady's remarks are dangerous. We may end up in a situation in which every worker who is looking for somebody to sue under the provisions would look beyond his immediate employer to those persons who had contracted with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend heard differently, but I understood the hon. Member for Basildon to be saying in her example that the caretaker of a premises who engaged staff in that capacity would become jointly liable with the employer to ensure that those staff were paid the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed, I should tell hon. Members that they are slipping. First, they should address the Chairman; secondly, their interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. My hon. Friend's intervention was helpful, if not as brief as it might have been. It illustrated the difficulties that we might encounter. It would help the debate if we focused on the employer, rather than straying on to the question of who are contractors. My hon. Friend's example showed that we also have to be clear about who has the legal responsibility as employer and who establishes the contract with the persons involved. It seems unlikely that the caretaker would contract with other persons. He may be responsible within the business for the appointment of persons, but the contract will be between those individuals and the corporate body, not the person who takes them on. Responsibility is not delegated away from the corporate body in such a way that it is not responsible.
<P>
Clause 29 has been included in the Bill precisely so that corporate bodies will be responsible. I see no reason in the structure of the clause to think that corporate bodies are any less of an employer for the purposes of the clause than are individuals--they are corporate persons in the same way as individuals might be.
<P>
When I read the clause, I was a little surprised to find that it was necessary for Ministers to seek an additional power to determine that superior employers would be employers of workers for the purposes of the Bill. We will debate that question on clause 51, but my reading of that clause suggests that it would give the Minister ample scope to treat as employers a range of persons who may or may not have entered directly into an employment contract. On what basis, therefore, did the Minister feel that it was necessary to seek an additional provision in clause 45 to specify that a superior employer would be legally liable? Given the structure of the Bill, that person may in any case have an employment contract with the worker in question--either directly or through another person.
<P>
My next point concerns subsection (3), and the hon. Member for Basildon briefly referred to it when my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham intervened on her. At the end of subsection (1), the proximate or immediate employer and the superior employer are deemed jointly to be the employer. When we move on to subsection (3), we find that those persons may be separated for the purpose of suing for an offence. I am no lawyer but I can well understand that a legal impediment might arise if one required both persons who were jointly liable to be brought before a court but could not find one of them. We have established that those persons are jointly deemed to be the employer under subsection (1), but saying that they be sued separately in subsection (3) runs counter to that.
<P>
On subsection (4)--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not stopped the hon. Gentleman because I want to disrupt his line of thought, but if he continues to discuss anything other than the amendment he may affect my attitude to a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am entirely with you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall leave aside subsection (4), as neither amendment relates directly to it. I was a little confused when my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to the structure of amendment No. 235. He gave me the impression that it related to subsection (4), but--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chair has many problems, but the confusion of individual minds is luckily not one of my responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I give way to my hon. Friend, who will relieve me of any confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, my hon. Friend will be pleased that whatever was said or implied, amendment No. 235 does not hang on subsection (4), about which, Mrs. Dunwoody, I made an unrelated and skilfully under-your-net comment. I do not need to repeat it later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Lansley, in a clarified position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am clarified just as butter might be. I shall leave aside subsection (4)--we may refer to it briefly on clause stand part, with your indulgence, Mrs. Dunwoody--and discuss amendment No. 235.
<P>
I reiterate that I am no lawyer, but there may be a problem with apportioning the tariff arising on the standard scale of offences between persons who are jointly liable according to their degree of culpability. I am not sure whether courts can undertake that exercise. None the less, amendment No. 235 makes a useful point and should relate not just to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``fines imposed under section 28''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but to penalties arising under clause 19. It is strange that the clause does not provide for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that blame or financial burden as a result of blame should not be apportioned unless a superior or an immediate employer has presented his or her case to a tribunal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a useful point, but I shall not pursue it because you will raise your eyebrows, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Anyone sued under section 28 has the right to a court hearing and people served with enforcement and penalty notices should have the chance to present their case to the relevant authorities before proceedings are taken forward. A danger relates to subsection (1): officers could pursue cases in isolation from an employer's representation of the circumstances at a hearing. A balance must be struck between officers acting on behalf of workers to enforce the Bill, and ensuring that employers can explain the many and varied circumstances in which these issues arise. Why have penalty notices under clause 19 not been included in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall speak to amendment No. 235.
<P>
Is the clause proportionate and fair? My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry quoted a piece of doggerel and mentioned Lord Curzon. I should point out that Lord Curzon would have been one of the politicians least sympathetic to the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As is the hon. Gentleman who moved the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Lord Curzon was himself the subject of doggerel, as my hon. Friend pointed out. He was not only a most superior person:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``His cheek was pink, his hair was sleek, he dined at Blenheim twice a week.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He would not have been a national minimum wage sort of person.
<P>
The problem with the clause is its lack of balance. The Minister, who himself is pink of cheek and sleek of hair, although I am not sure that he dines at Blenheim that often--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> New Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Very new Labour. I worry that, in their desire to tie the net so tightly that no cowboy employer can slip through it, the Government may be in danger of catching innocent employers. The Minister may say that that is a price that he is prepared to pay and that it is better that none of the guilty should escape, even if one or two of the innocent are caught. If that is his view, I would be grateful if he would make it explicit.
<P>
Like some of my hon. Friends, I am worried about the relationship between subcontractors and superior employers. We have heard several examples that show that an employee wishing to sue will naturally aim at the person at the other end of the chain: the employer with the deepest pockets. That might be a rational course, even if the employer at the top of the hierarchy were not principally guilty of the offences set out in the clause.
<P>
Many of my hon. Friends have more experience of the construction industry than I have. I put it to them that there may be other circumstances in which other unfairnesses would come to light. I am particularly worried about the possibility of a subcontractor, who is under enormous pressure from superior forces on whom he depends for contracts, being forced to take actions that he would not normally take. In the Minister's terminology, the cowboys are further up the chain and there are relatively innocent people lower down who are pressured into not paying their employees proper wages.
<P>
The clause creates the possibility that the relatively innocent subcontractor will end up along in the dock. That would be a perverse response, which I am sure that the Government do not intend. Amendment No. 235 would give the courts power, not to recompense, but to decide between the different levels of guilt of the various employers and to identify the most guilty. The hon. Member for Basildon made the point that that would tie up the courts' time, but that is what the court system is for. We have an inquirer court system precisely to search for justice in such cases.
<P>
The clause is too blunt an instrument. It assumes guilt all the way up the chain and makes no attempt to seek to assign guilt. That would not be a sufficiently skilful use of the various powers to assign the proper degree of guilt which will be available to the enforcement agencies and, ultimately, to the courts.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will my hon. Friend confirm for the Committee's benefit that the problem in the clause is not the assumption of guilt, but the fact that no attempt is made to assign responsibility? It is clear that non-payment means that a guilty party must exist. The clause should deal with the question of who is responsible, or, between two people, who is more responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a helpful point. The obvious analogy is that the clause is a blunderbuss. The clause states that somebody is guilty, and that he or she should be made liable, and that it will be decided who will be in the dock at some stage in the process. That approach is not sensible or fair. Circumstances can easily be envisaged in which, for ease of access to a subcontractor, or because of a search for the deepest pockets to sue, the wrong person will end up as the guilty party, and will have to pay the relevant fines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause also has an extraordinary twist, in that officers appointed by the Secretary of State may become involved in supporting employees in taking action on what is essentially breach of contract?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I suspect that he is inviting me to pursue a train of thought that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, would not wish me to pursue at any length.
<P>
Will the Minister address the issue of balance and accuracy? If he thinks that the clause is balanced, will he say why? Does he agree that the amendments would improve the clause by ensuring that the right people would be more likely to end up in the dock? I assume that he intends to make the Bill as fair as is possible, and to ensure, not least by example, that the worst employers are caught, and not simply employers who were standing by at the scene of the crime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I support amendment No. 235, which has great merit. I should state at the outset that the Opposition do not object to the main purpose of the clause. Indeedd, I should like to put on record my belief that the thinking behind the clause is eminently sensible. There would be no purpose in introducing a national minimum wage if no provision were made for taking action against people who wilfully seek to evade the provisions. Moreover, I would wager that superior employers will probably be responsible for most attempts to avoid responsibility. It would be quite wrong for such people to be able to get out of their responsibilities, and to be able to shovel them off on to an immediate employer. I understand where the Government are coming from, and I do not object to that reasoning.
<P>
My view is the same as that of my hon. Friend hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). The amendments would improve the clause. Amendment No. 235 requires that any fines imposed on a person who is charged and convicted of an offence under subsection (2) should be imposed on the basis of proportionality. That is reasonable. The danger otherwise is that someone could be brought before a tribunal and end up bearing a burden of responsibility and a level of cost that is quite disproportionate to his involvement in the case.
<P>
The Minister is shaking his head. He is welcome to correct me and to explain why I am wrong. It would be deplorable if an immediate employer were hauled before a tribunal if it could be shown that he had only a fairly small share of responsibility. It would be deplorable if the immediate employer were to bear either a greater share of responsibility than he should, or even the absolute share of responsibility, because an ultimate employer was not traceable and could not be brought before a tribunal. That is the danger of the clause, and it is the only point that I wish to make. If the Minister can assure me that the clause is adequate in that respect, I shall be highly delighted. Until the Opposition receive such an assurance, the motivation for tabling the amendment seems very sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I shall deal with this by giving the Government's reasons for resisting the amendments and then responding to the range of technical questions and comments of substance on the concept in principle of what we are trying to do. I hope that by proceeding in that way, I shall take the Committee through the issue logically to a conclusion that will satisfy all hon. Members as to the Government's intentions.
<P>
First, I apologise to hon. Members for the typing error in the notes on clauses on clause 45, where schedule 3 is mentioned. I have had the mistake amended and new copies are available to the Committee with your good grace, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am sorry if that has caused hon. Members any inconvenience. I am surprised that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire has not raised it before--he is not here, so I am getting my retaliation in first.
<P>
The word ``Part'' in clause 45, to which the hon. Member for Daventry drew attention, is a typing error which will be resolved in any republication of the Bill.
<P>
The clause is useful, sensible and not particularly controversial, although some of the issues that hon. Members have raised, which went somewhat wider than the amendment, were controversial. I hope that my responses will stay within the context of the amendment.
<P>
The clause is derived from the former Wages Act 1986. Subsection (1) covers the particular and not very common situation where employers are themselves employees of a higher employer and all the work is carried out on the premises of that higher employer. That is an odd arrangement, but it exists, particularly in the textiles, construction and agricultural industries, and we need to address it. The provision is borrowed from section 22 of the former Wages Act 1986 and ensures that no employer in the chain can evade his responsibility for paying the minimum wage: the responsibility falls on each of them. This is one of the raft of measures that we have taken to ensure that no one slips through the minimum wage net because of their unusual working arrangements.
<P>
Amendment No. 250 would interfere with the sensible working of subsection (1). It would water it down by deeming a superior employer jointly responsible only if it seemed ``fair and just'' in the circumstances. Those rather woolly words seem like an invitation for employers to wriggle out of their responsibilities. The enforcement officers, courts and tribunals will of course be expected to behave fairly and justly in each case. If there is any doubt, a rigorous appeals mechanism exists to offer protection to those who are wrongly accused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister might not want to reply to my question immediately, but perhaps he will do so later in his remarks. While the courts may intervene on the justice of the particular involvement of the employer, will he confirm that they might be able to--and would have to--come to a true and fair view on the quantum of fine or penalty to attach to the various employers in the chain?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The court--for a criminal proceeding--or the tribunal--for a civil proceeding--has the duty to determine in every case whether someone is culpable and if so, who is more culpable under a joint and several arrangement. It is not for us to set that down in tablets of stone. The purpose of the process is to ensure an independence of investigation and the independence of the appeals system, as well as the independence of the ultimate decision-making bodies as they consider the facts.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 is an attempt to give a tribunal responsibility for sharing out fines proportionately between persons in the case of offences that are committed under clause 28. The amendment does not make sense, because the clause deals with criminal offences, in which the tribunal has no role to play. If an employer is guilty of a criminal offence, the court will punish him or her. If more than one person is found guilty of the same or a related offence, it will punish them according to their relative culpability. That is how the law works and that is what I said in response to the intervention of the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
Why should the Bill or any other legislation allow a guilty person to share out a fine, whether with another guilty party or someone else entirely? The court will charge and convict a person, whether or not proceedings are taken against any other person. That is what the Bill says, and that is how the law will work. If the hon. Gentleman presses the amendment, I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist it.
<P>
A number of points have been made. Some were technical, and some were comments on the Government's intentions. The hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) raised points on wider issues about the construction industry and its employment practices. I do not intend to get involved in a general debate on them, but they have to be addressed if I am to respond adequately to the hon. Gentlemen.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems of employment status in the industry are the sole responsibility of the industry and its decision to go for a total deregulation of its employment practices, by introducing arrangements under 714s, and other arrangements. Bogus self-employment is rife in the industry and continues to be so to get round current tax and benefit practices introduced by the previous Government. Agencies employ individual workers, and individual workers may be deemed as agents on behalf of themselves. The situation is indeed complex, and has come about entirely because of the industry's attempts to get round many of the basic employment rights that its employees enjoyed. Even major employers in the industry realise that the 10 years or so of activity have led to serious problems for the industry in terms of standards, recruitment, training and relationships between the industry with its employees and with the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency.
<P>
I do not think that the many issues raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge were intended to be a defence of such practices. I imagine that he is at one with me in being opposed to such arrangements, which undermine the industry and its capacity to operate effectively. Such methods included the introduction on a regular basis of superior employment arrangements. The site manager, on behalf of the company, would employ a bricklayer; he or she would be instructed to carry out the job and would be responsible for employing those who assist in the labouring processes, such as plasterers and electricians. There is no job in construction that does not have the capacity to use superior employers in a way which undermines the potential for employees to gain access to proper wages and conditions of employment.
<P>
The Bill seeks to address that problem, but addresses it narrowly in relation to rights and the minimum wage. The Bill is not about addressing other major issues that impact on conditions of employment in the building, textiles or agricultural industries. It is simply about defining people's right to a national minimum wage and ensuring that there is a clear set of proposals which gives a command structure for responsibility for employment and employees' access to a national minimum wage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept much of what the Minister has said. There are still unacceptable practices in the building industry. Does he accept that it is essential that any reform of working practice in the building industry continues to give the flexibility which makes building costs in the United Kingdom very much lower than in continental European countries?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is why the industry is going to invest in health and safety to reduce accidents. Only this week there has been an announcement about a major investment in upskilling, reskilling and training, and in introducing new apprenticeship practices. That is why major employers are now going to co-operate with the Inland Revenue and the national insurance Contributions Agency to get rid of the practices that I have mentioned. This has been a long time coming, but we all welcome it, and will work together to achieve it. In the context of this Bill, we want to ensure that our contribution will provide certainty regarding the right to access to a minimum wage. I hope that I have kept to the amendment by saying that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also raised the issue of individuals who did not receive a payment at all. That is a general point and does not concern the minimum wage; it is covered by the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Wages Act 1986. The Bill is about people's right to a minimum wage and the processes that are involved in that. The rights of those who are excluded because they receive more than the minimum wage but who have not been paid, are enshrined in the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation. Is it not the case that officers who are appointed under the Bill will have the power to take action on behalf of employees who have not been paid at all? That would become employees' route of choice.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have tried hard not to limit debate because there will be no clause stand part debate--I give notice of that now. Hon. Members have chosen to range widely and have discussed the amendments in that light. The Minister should bear in mind that we shall be wildly out of line if we deal again with the theory of employment law.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes the general point that he made earlier. The issues are covered by different legislation. The Bill deals with people's entitlement to a minimum wage. I am, however, sure that some lawyers and barristers will try to stretch the interpretation on occasion. That is their life blood and how they make their income. Once an Act leaves this place, they try to get around it, subjugate it, stretch it and squeeze it. When they leave this place, this and every other Bill will be crawled over by solicitors who want to gain an advantage in relation to the proposals. The point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised about people's rights is well made, but I cannot give a fuller answer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh mentioned the grey areas of employment and the relationship between employment and self-employment. I do not want to stray, so I shoud say that that is an issue for clause 51. We have, however, already debated it under clause 26 in relation to the burden of proof. The Bill transforms the employment relationship, although I do not know whether the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire would accept that phrase. The duty is on the employer to prove that the individual is not an employee. That is important and helps to reduce the grey areas about which the hon. Member for Eastleigh is concerned.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the issue of due diligence. Due diligence is part of the general defence on which a person can rely against prosecution for offences under clause 28(1) and (2). Those offences relate to the wilful neglect to pay the national minimum wage and the failure to keep records for the purposes of paying the national minimum wage. It would be for the courts to decide whether the individual had exercised due diligence. The intentions behind the Bill are clearly and specifically set out, and the Bill establishes processes. Maintaining records and a proper administrative system will greatly assist employers with allegations--true or false--against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> You have kindly told us that we are not going to have a clause stand part debate, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I have not had an opportunity to deal with this point, so I will intervene on the Minister. There is a difference between due diligence and wilful neglect--there is a big gap between them. There is scope for a category of neglect which is not wilful but which would fall short of due diligence and perhaps even of reasonable precautions. Is the Minister confident that he has brought those two terms together so that they are coterminous?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I can only give the hon. Gentleman a lay person's view. The Government are fair to employers and have set a high test. For an offence to be wilful, an employer would, after all the processes of inspection, advice, reconsideration and appeals, have to refuse absolutely to meet his obligations. If he did so, he would be found guilty of the offence. That is the issue as it relates to the offence. Due diligence is part of the defence. There are two separate issues; one relates to the offence and the other to the defence mechanisms.
<P>
The clauses that I mentioned set out clearly and specifically what processes employers are expected to follow. If they do so, they will be protected, first, against a false or fallacious allegation and, secondly, against a minor error that was not intended to be wilful failure to meet their obligations. The Bill meets the needs of both employers and employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The position is becoming clearer. Would a superior employer have exercised due diligence and taken all reasonable precautions if he could show that he had set out in writing to the immediate employer precisely what the pay reference period was, exactly when the minimum wage was to be paid, and every obligation on that employer? Would that be considered a reasonable defence?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It is a hypothetical case, but I will try to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman. In almost all instances, unless he is genuinely self-employed, the intermediate employer is an employee of, and acting on behalf of, a superior employer, albeit without the normal contractual arrangement that exists between an employer and an employee. The measures set out in previous clauses require the superior employer to maintain good records and a system to ensure that, whatever the payment arrangements are, they do not wilfully disregard the entitlement to the minimum wage of the worker at the end of the chain.
<P>
The process is clear, not complicated. We should consider the commonsense arrangements between employers and employees that operate at the coalface. Unless the immediate employer is genuinely self-employed and employs someone else, a superio employer will have an overall responsibility for employment practices in the workplace, whether they relate to health and safety, general employment standards or, in this case, the minimum wage. That is why the clause is a sensible arrangement to protect the employee and ensure that the employer understands the good employment practices that he must deploy to ensure that he does not inadvertently fall foul of the terms of the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned circumstances where one employer was prosecuted rather than another. The clause deals with that in two separate ways, as its heading implies. Subsection (1) deals with superior employers. Subsections (2) and (4) deal with the liability of all employers, not only superior employers. If more than one person is found guilty of the same or related offences, they will be punished according to their relative culpability.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about the case for an immediate employer who was unable to pay his employees, where a superior employer was also involved. That relates to a point that I made earlier. The superior employer would be responsible, in the limited circumstances of the clause: for example, when the immediate employer is employed by a superior employer, as I said earlier in reply to the hon. Member for Buckingham. I confirm that a genuinely self-employed individual will not be liable under the clause. The clause is not relevant to such people.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that superior employers would attract the attention of the suing worker because they would have more money, but that they may not be the most culpable. We have dealt with that specifically: the tribunal in civil proceedings and the court in criminal proceedings will, on the facts of the case, determine the responsibilities of the superior and the other employer. It is for the courts to decide where two or more people may be jointly responsible. That is where the responsibility should remain. It is the duty of the courts to deal with individual complaints and the clause ensures that that will happen.
<P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked a good question. He had me thinking for a minute--[Interruption.] I do think, on occasion. Rab C. Nesbit went to a very good school.
<P>
My advice from the legal beagles is that the term ``premises'' has a wide and natural meaning. It would cover a farm or even a field if work was being carried out within its confines. There is no definition because one is not needed: ``When you see it, you know it''; that is a good definition.
<P>
We have taken a commonsense view. If a farmer has fields A, B, C and D, and a gangmaster controls workers in fields A and B, the arrangement is one with a superior employer--the farmer. Clauses 43 and 44 take account of the relationship between gangworkers and gangmasters to ensure interface between the minimum wage and agricultural wages so that gangworkers do not fall below the minimum wage in all circumstances.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister advised that fields would be part of the premises. Subsection (1)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The premises of that other person''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Presumably, they are not owned by the gangmaster, but are being used under contract. Will the Minister clarify that matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will look at it, but I am clear about that issue. The matter would be thrown into doubt only when an inspector visited field C and when the gate closed found that the only thing there was a large bull. In those circumstances, the inspector's report might be--
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Rather short.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Yes. The point--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am fascinated by all this, but it would help if we moved on.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Rather less bull. I was genuinely trying to help--the point was worth raising.
<P>
The hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Eastleigh asked about gangmasters and premises. Gangmasters' relationships with employees were discussed almost to destruction under clauses 43 and 44, but if the hon. Gentlemen are unhappy after having read Hansard, I will write them a note on the matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, God bless his cotton socks, has good technique. When he speaks, he reads from the Bill. He is good at mixing up the relationships between clauses. I admit that, for a moment, he caused panic. I sit behind this Red Box to hide the beads of sweat. After a moment, I calm down and think in a commonsense way about what has been said. The hon. Gentleman asked about subsections (2) and (3). All employers, not just superior ones, are covered. The prosecution of a person who is not an employer is allowed where that person is the cause of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an offence under section 28(1) or (2)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a failure to pay the national minimum wage or to keep records.
<P>
That is a sensible arrangement for a person who wilfully refuses to meet his obligations, prevents proper evidence being brought forward, frustrates the investigation or deliberately ensures that employees are not paid the minimum wage. Thus, the provision will ensure that protection is given in all those circumstances.
<P>
Without going on for too long or leaving the confines of the amendment, I have attempted to answer fairly all the points that hon. Members have raised. I hope, therefore, that Conservative Members will feel able to withdraw the amendment. If they do not, I ask my hon. Friends to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I echo what the Minister says. He has made a fair attempt to answer some of the important questions that have been asked in this debate. I ought initially to put him out of his misery by saying that we are not imposing on him a double jeopardy. I might well advise my hon. Friends to press our amendment, but I will not urge them to vote against the clause, whatever happens to the amendment. All members of the Committee agree, with the principle of seeking to avoid any artificial arrangements for evasion of the minimum wage, on which the Government are bent.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's correction of the word ``Part''. On rereading the clause, I notice not one but two misprints. No doubt they will be attended to. It might be appropriate to echo, on behalf of Conservative Members, some of what the Minister said about the importance of the improved skills and upgrading of the building industry. Our former colleague, Sir Michael Latham, has been a friend of mine for many years and I took an interest in the Construction Industry Training Board when I was a Minister. It is important that we get that right. It should not be seen as derogatory to the intentions of the clause and we want to associate ourselves with what the Minister said on that.
<P>
I have three outstanding micro points to make and one of slightly greater substance. First, the Minister did not quite do justice to the points that I made about enforcement and the penalty operations under clauses 17 and 20 respectively. I am conscious of the comments that have been made about to-ing and fro-ing to other clauses, but if a superior employer is to be joined in one of these actions, which eventually centres around an offence, it is only reasonable that there should have been some process prior to that, unless there is a good reason for there not being one.
<P>
The Minister might like to give some more thought to the service by an officer of notices in connection with enforcement and penalty proceedings before it could get to a superior employer wilfully failing to comply with the Act and being guilty of an offence under clauses 28 and 45, the latter of which gives teeth to the measure. That is an area of some confusion. The Minister might consider, for example, whether he needs to make provision for mutual notification of enforcement notices. I am sure that he does not intend the superior employer to know nothing about the matter until a letter bids him to court. That may be securable through terms in the contract, but they probably do not exist in prior contracts and need to be thought about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Of course that would be a lamentable state of affairs. Would not it be even worse if a superior employer found himself or herself declared guilty and facing a particular burden without having had the opportunity to present his or her case in front of the tribunal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not think that it would be a tribunal because it would be a criminal proceeding. However, it would obviously be a breach of natural justice if that were to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Again, I am not a lawyer but as a lay person, I cannot think of any situation where a court would proceed without the defendant having the opportunity to be there. Whether someone attends either a tribunal or the court is another matter, but I cannot think of any circumstances in UK law where that would occur or be allowed to occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification. The same point had occurred to me but it is nice when he administers the reproof to the enthusiasm of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. I suspect that that is not a serious problem but it is right that the Minister should reflect on it.
<P>
My second concern--ever mindful of your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody--relates to the interaction of clauses 45 and 46. Clause 45 provides for a person acting in two capacities, as an employer and as an employee of a superior employer. Given that clause 46 largely precludes arrangements on behalf of an employer to be involved in giving advice or otherwise, clause 45 might disable its use in such cases. Will the minister reflect on that?
<P>
A specific point that has not emerged in the Committee's discussion is that persons can be employed simultaneously in two employments. I know that this point is something of a King Charles's head of mine. An employer or a superior employer could have a relationship with such an employee that concerns more than one employment, even on the same premises. A problem could arise under subsection (1), if somebody were to stumble into a relationship relevant to culpability because of another relationship that had nothing to do with non-payment of the national minimum wage.
<P>
I rest my remarks on those made by the hon. Member for Basildon, on the basis of which the opposition wish to press the amendment to a vote. She asked who is responsible, and rightly said that somebody should be responsible. Of course, under the general concept of the Bill, employers are responsible. The clause is an exception, designed to bring additional employers in the chain of employment under the Bill, to strengthen enforcement provisions. A responsible person still exists, however.
<P>
About a month ago, the Committee debated the question of who is an employer, on the very first amendment that we considered. It is commendable to bring in other employers in the interests of better enforcement and of avoiding phoney procedures designed to subvert the purpose of the Bill. There is a danger that an employer who employs the employer of an individual worker may find himself or herself liable to action in the courts, and to face penalties and fines. Such employers may not have known much about the circumstances of the case, which may have been nothing to do with them. The main attraction for them of joining in action may be that they are fat cats and able to withstand legal costs and fines.
<P>
That point is a potential danger. The Minister spoke quite eloquently and with sensitivity about the need to safeguard the idea that the courts will do the job. Persons should not be deemed employers when they are not, and when an employer already exists who has the prime responsibility for paying the national minimum wage. It is in that spirit, and by a short head, that I advise my hon. Friends to persist in their support of the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 28, line 24, leave out `complaint' and insert `proceedings'.
<P>
This is a technical, drafting amendment, which amends the wording of clause 46(4)(b) to reflect a change that is to be made to the Employment Rights Act 1996 by the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill, which is currently before the House.
<P>
The amendment alters the Bill to provide that, for a compromise agreement that is made under clause 46(3) to be valid, the agreement must relate to the particular proceedings rather than complaint. It is a purely drafting amendment and does not change the substantive effect of the provisions. However, it will ensure not only that the language that is used throughout the clause is consistent, but that the Bill is consistent with other employment legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister may rest assured that I am not seeking to be difficult about his proposal because I have no problem with it. I want, however, to raise a point that is probably germane to the amendment and to the disputes resolution legislation to which he referred.
<P>
The Minister will remember the constructive debates that we had on clause 27 about the role of conciliation. I am not sure whether this is a technical term, but I said that what I called mediation--the friendly or informal discussion of disputes before they get to proceedings--was important. That is not to derogate from clause 46(2), which is about proceedings before industrial tribunals. I am, however, anxious for the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service or other mediators to act as soon and as informally as possible and with the least formal commitment required before they go in to bat in the formal conciliation process at the employment tribunal.
<P>
I am concerned that it will be necessary for what used to be called an IT1 to be served. There has to be formal complaint to generate the involvement of ACAS, the conciliation procedure and, following that, the possibility of reaching an agreement as part of the resolution of the dispute. I am sure that the Minister will not wish to dissent, but my concern is that it should be possible to get matters into gear and, if possible, to produce an agreement at the earliest stage, before people's views are set in concrete.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I could not be more supportive of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry--I have supported him throughout our proceedings--but on this point I feel very strongly. The previous Government responded to a pronounced public mood, and I hope that the current Government will respond in the same say. For too long, this country has resolved disputes in the most contentious ways possible. The mood of the day is in favour of what are commonly called alternative dispute resolutions. That brings us to the concepts of mediation, arbitration and conciliation. I think that I have made my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has indeed made his point in his own distinctive way and in no sense would I dissent from it. I do not think that the Minister would, either.
<P>
For some reason I forgot to mention a phrase on clause 27 and to refer, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham so often does, to the late Sir Winston Churchill, who remarked that jaw jaw is better than war war. It is better to get these matters sorted out by agreement. That is the purpose of the parallel legislation with which the hon. Member for Wentworth is much concerned. It is important to get in early and, above all, to do it as informally as possible.
<P>
My only slight cavil regarding the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is that he said that for a long time we have had an adversarial approach to industrial relations. That has already changed substantially. As he said, the mood of the times has changed. Everyone on both sides of the Committee wants to promote good industrial relations, with disputes being sorted out early and in the least obtrusive way possible. I notice that the hon. Member for Wentworth is nodding. I am anxious that we should not have to create a formal complaint, and then have to find a way round it by conciliation that does not get us into difficulties with the contract law set out in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): The Government amendments ensure that the compromise agreements that might be reached when disputes on the minimum wage are being dealt with by industrial tribunals are done so under the same conditions that regulate disputes and compromise agreements under other measures. To that extent, they bring in, as the hon. Member for Daventry mentioned, content from clauses 9 and 10 and schedule 1 of the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill. That is a private Member's bill that the hon. Gentleman has been kind enough to say that I am responsible for steering through this House and that Lord Archer of Sandwell introduced and led--skilfully and with great patience--through the upper House. The aims of that Bill are the same as the general aims of this clause and the amendments to it. It may be helpful to the Committee if I explain those because they set the context for the amendments.
<P>
In the spirit of the comments of the hon. Members for Solihull and for Daventry, the Bill aims to encourage the use of internal company procedures in dealing with problems that arise. Secondly, it aims to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution, such as a new arbitration scheme under ACAS's remit. Thirdly, it aims to streamline existing industrial tribunal procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument closely. He is clearly well briefed in these matters, and he has mentioned something that no one else has mentioned so far. It is very important, and I wish that I had mentioned it. He said that best practice means that first, an internal dispute mechanism is available to the employer. That is a vital point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> I think that we are at one on that point, and I hope that the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill will help to ensure that such practices are in place. The final purpose of that Bill, and the general aim of the amendments to the clause before us, is to streamline the industrial tribunal procedures and, in this case, to streamline and make simpler the process of reaching compromise agreements.
<P>
The substantial amendments that we are considering in this group are amendments Nos. 135, 137 and 138.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry, but we are debating amendment No. 134. Members of the Committee must learn to stick to the amendments that we are discussing on the amendment paper. This is not a general debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> Thank you for that correction, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I skip quickly to compromise agreements and emphasise that they are usually private financial agreements reached by the parties in a dispute. To date, a qualified lawyer must have signed off such an agreement. The individual concerned must have information about the terms of the agreement and--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that it is difficult, but if amendments are narrowly drawn hon. Members must debate the words on the amendment paper. We can debate other aspects on clause stand part. Hon. Members whose speeches wander all over the place are frequently allowed to continue if I am feeling amiable, but we must stick to the rule: discuss the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. Having been uncertain at the outset as to whether we would have a fuller debate on the next group of amendments, I shall reserve the remarks I had wanted to make for the appropriate point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I think that I can put the Committee's mind at rest. Section 203(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 and clause 46(3) of the Bill provide that an agreement to refrain from instituting or continuing proceedings can be made providing that the conditions regulating such a compromise agreement are satisfied. The amendment simply provides processes for which hon. Members asked in a previous debate. We have brought the Bill into line with the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 28, line 25, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`independent legal advice from a qualified lawyer'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`advice from a relevant independent adviser'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following Government amendments: No. 137, No. 138, No. 139, No. 144, No. 145, No. 146, No. 52, No. 53, No. 147, No. 54, No. 148, No. 149, No. 55, No. 56, No. 260, No. 153.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was going to propose the amendments formally, but perhaps we should have a debate.
<P>
The majority of the amendments, except for amendments Nos. 54, 55 and 56, are consequential upon changes to the compromise agreement provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996. The Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill is also relevant.
<P>
I seek your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. You read out a list of amendments. Did you mention amendments Nos. 140 to 143? I understood that they were a separate group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, they are to be dealt with separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> If not, I would have referred to them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I read out amendments Nos. 144 to 146.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise, I cannot add up. Perhaps I should get a job as an Education Minister.
<P>
The Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill enjoys all-party support; indeed, my noble Friend Lord Archer of Sandwell has done a brilliant job, bringing together parties from all parts of the House to amend and improve the Bill. When it reaches this place, its reaching the statute book should be only a matter of procedure. The Bill is supported by all sides of industry, so I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments without great debate.
<P>
A compromise agreement, as provided for in clause 46 and in section 203 of the 1996 Act, is a means by which a claim may be settled between worker and employer by means of a proper procedure and without involving a hearing before a tribunal. To be valid, a compromise agreement must satisfy certain conditions, including the requirements that the agreement must be in writing and that the worker must have received advice from a relevant independent adviser.
<P>
I shall turn first to the amendments that are consequential on the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill, which extends the qualifying sources of advice on compromise agreements to cover persons other than qualified lawyers. It specifies four categories of person who will be able to provide advice: qualified lawyers; accredited officials, officers, employees or members of independent trade unions; accredited employees, officers or volunteers giving free advice in advice or law centres; and persons of a description specified in an order made by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill also includes three added safeguards. First, in each case the advice would need to be covered by an appropriate indemnity or insurance cover. Secondly, in the case of union officials and advice centre workers, the advice giver must have been certified in writing as competent and authorised by the union or centre to provide advice on its behalf. Thirdly, in the case of advice centres, all advice in respect of the complaint to which the agreement relates must be given free.
<P>
The following amendments therefore make similar provision for the National Minimum Wage Bill. Amendment No. 135 provides that for a compromise agreement to be valid, the applicant must have received advice from a ``relevant independent adviser''. Amendment No. 138 goes on to define that term, and specifies who does and who does not qualify. Amendments Nos. 139 and 144 are consequential on amendment No. 138.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 provides that for the advice given to be valid, the advice giver must be covered by a contract of insurance or an indemnity provided for members of a professional body or profession covering the risk of the advice given.
<P>
Amendment No. 145 ensures that the amended provisions relating to compromise agreements do not apply to Northern Ireland and that instead the existing provisions will apply there. The provisions of the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill do not extend to Northern Ireland, but equivalent provision may be made for the Province by an Order in Council. If such an order is made, the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Bill as they apply to Northern Ireland will have to be amended accordingly. Amendment No. 145 therefore also gives the Secretary of State the power to repeal the existing provisions by order, thus enabling the provisions to be changed without the need for further primary legislation. Amendments Nos. 146 to 149, 52, 53, 260--which ensures that the power to make such an order is specified in the commencement provisions in clause 53--and 153 are consequential on amendment No. 145. I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
The common thread of Government amendments Nos. 54, 55 and 56, which are technical amendments, is to ensure procedural correctness and completeness. They correct minor technical details in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 54 adds subsection (2A) to clause 48, which, among other things, specifies the procedure for parliamentary handling of regulations made under the Bill. It does not, however, currently specify the procedures for handling Orders in Council made under the Bill. Any such orders would be made under clause 39 to introduce or modify the Bill's provisions in relation to offshore employment. The amendment ensures that that point of detail is covered and specifies that any such Orders in Council are subject to the affirmative resolution. That is consistent with what we are proposing for the majority of the regulations made under the Bill in view of the significance of the power to extend the Bill to offshore employment.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 clarifies the meaning of ``regulations'' in clause 52, which deals with interpretation. The text currently refers only to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulations made by the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, regulations that change agricultural wages legislation in England and Wales, made under the power in clause 44(2) or (4), would of course be made jointly by the Secretary of State and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The amendment clarifies that point of detail.
<P>
Amendment No. 56 is consequential on amendment No. 54. It adds, in clause 53, which deals with commencement, a reference to the entry into force of powers to make an Order in Council as well as regulations.
<P>
Those are all technical changes and I ask the Committee to accept them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister had to work particularly hard with this group of amendments. I concede that their appearance is perhaps more daunting than their substance. They are certainly not objectionable to us in principle.
<P>
One specific point, which has nothing to do with my other remarks but which relates to the group, is that as I understand it, the Minister has provided that the Secretary of State--that is, the President of the Board of Trade--and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food may act jointly in relation to amendments to the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 and the related order. As the Secretary of State for Wales is also cut in on these procedures, the Minister might want to consider whether there is any need to extend the provisions to Wales. I shall not press him on that now, however.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Is not it true that the Secretary of State for Scotland has some locus in the matter, too?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Rightly, but in relation to other orders. We may be able to catch your eye, Mrs. Dunwoody, when we reach the relevant clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> On a point of clarification. ``The Secretary of State'' refers to all Secretaries of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thought that that might be the answer.
<P>
A pretty clear consensus has already emerged in our earlier exchanges on the necessity of clause 46, and I do not want to challenge that. My late father was not a lawyer but he had a clear lay sense of the law. One of the earliest concepts I ever learned from him was that one cannot contract out of the law. That must be a sound principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I would not wish to correct my hon. Friend, but this is an interesting turning point and it is relevant to the clause. In fact, some aspects of the general law can be contracted out of. A statute must say that it may not be contracted out of. That is an issue that clause 46 brings to the fore. The classic case, which affects every consumer, is the Sale of Goods Act 1983, which could be contracted out of. Every single guarantee offered by an appliance salesman was usually a contracting out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I have a feeling that if my hon. Friend were an appliance salesman, I would readily accept his guarantees. My father had latched on to the general principle, though as my hon. Friend rightly said, there are derogations from that principle. So, too, derogations are set out and slightly further extended by the clause.
<P>
There is a certain asymmetry in the clause, because while it enables advice to be given by trade union representatives and other independent people on behalf of the worker, employers and their advisers do not get a look in. That is not quite as asymmetric as it seems, because we are concerned here with the rights of workers. I am also prepared to make the point that given the nature of the average employee-employer relationship, the individual worker, if not represented by a trade union, is likely to be in a weaker position in the employment chain as against the collective strength of employers, whether one or more than one. It is important that workers should have their rights and that nobody should put a piece of paper in front of them and say, ``Sign here. You don't need to worry about your legal rights--we'll look after you.'' That is what the clause is about.
<P>
I do not intend to advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendments. It is worth recording that when we discussed at a late hour the sit-alone procedures in relation to clause 25, the Government were anxious to point out that it was all lawyers' stuff and very complex. Pay remuneration was difficult and lay persons on tribunals might not be able to understand--I caricature slightly, but not unfairly.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I know that it was early in the morning but that it not merely a caricature. I cannot remember either my hon. Friends or me saying that lay members of the tribunal system were incapable of dealing with the cases before them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I hope that we will not generate heat on the matter. Ministers said that there were many lawyerly issues in the Bill and used that to justify the sit-alone procedure at tribunals. For reasons to which I will not object, they now seek to extend the range of persons who can give workers advice on conciliation agreements--as opposed to industrial tribunal procedures--from qualified legal persons to others. It is difficult to argue both views simultaneously. The Government's judgment is, however, right and it is right to provide for wider responsibilities. I have to be careful about what I say because my hon. Friends, one of the Ministers and others are involved in the legal profession. I would not wish to be seen too overtly to be diluting the best trade union of all--the legal profession. In this case, however, we might have a good reason to make an exception, because the provision would provide for the involvement of other persons and, on balance, that is right.
<P>
I want to make a few specific points. First, there is the question of indemnity. The advice may blow up and the individual worker may--with good reason--get nasty. He may say, ``You gave me pretty duff advice''--not you, Mrs. Dunwoody, but the worker's adviser--``and I don't like it. I am going to sue you for giving me wrong advice.'' That is unlikely to happen most of the time, but it is important for a policy of insurance or indemnity to provide a degree of protection.
<P>
I want to be a little clearer about payment for the advice. The hon. Member for Wentworth may be able to help us with this. The Minister said something about it, but I did not note it at the time. I think that I heard him say that advice was to be free or that the worker was not to be charged for it. He may, however, have said that there are circumstances in which the worker will be charged for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was referring to advice from an advice centre, such as citizens advice centre or an unemployed workers centre. Those are free services; they are not charged for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There is no condition in the Minister's amendment that prescribes that such advice must be free. He is saying--I am familiar with this situation from my constituency--that it probably will be free, which is different.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> They have to be free.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull is also confirming that they have to be free. He has reassured me on the point. In the case of a trade union, one is obviously a member of the union and is not likely to be charged for advice, unless I have completely misunderstood the position.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify that there is no question of ACAS or anyone else indemnifying for the cost of the advice that they give? Advice may be free to the worker, and rightly so. When trade unions and independent advice centres give advice, however, they incur costs, even if the individual does not. Will the Minister clarify whether those costs, as part of the conciliation procedure, are likely to be refundable from public funds?
<P>
My only other point relates to the advice that is given. One word is missing from the amendment and I wonder whether it should be there. The Minister talked about the trade union certifying that an individual is competent to give advice. There is a parallel provision for persons who work for an advice centre, who should be certified as competent to give advice and authorised to do so. My only concern about the Minister's wording is that he does not tie it to advice that is relevant to the case in point.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> In relation to that point, general standards of competence apply. In every case, the person concerned has to have the competence to deal with the relevant matters. That is quite clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am reassured. The matter is probably clear. I was anxious that a perfectly worthy individual who does not know anything about the law would be allowed by a looseness in wording to give advice that might cause recrimination.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> If I went into an advice centre as a low-paid worker and the hon. Member for Buckingham were there, unless he could give me in writing--perhaps in blood--the assurance that he was competent enough to deal with my case, I would not allow him to deal with it. The procedures in the Bill have been worked over mercilessly by the House of Lords. A great deal of legal work has gone into ensuring that the definition meets the requirements of the people who need advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry that the Minister has injected that note into the debate. In the Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham has been a doughty and perceptive defender of workers' rights in a number of specific cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that in any event the Minister would be mistaken, because provided that the policy of indemnity insurance were in place, the Minister would have nothing to fear, whoever gave the advice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have a feeling that the Committee might leave these exchanges, except to say in response to my hon. Friend that incompetent persons should not go around giving advice, which would give rise to recrimination, and to litigation to recover the damages caused to the worker. It would be much better if the advice were right in the first place. In his constituency surgeries, for example, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham would give admirable advice, and would have the wisdom of the non-lawyer, and not give advice if he did not know the answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that I have in the past successfully advised fellow employees of companies to their great advantage? I have received their gratitude.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee has now established the excellent qualities of the hon. Member for Buckingham. Perhaps it can move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If the circumstances of the electoral timetable ever cast my hon. Friend away from the House, he would clearly have an alternative career in disputes resolution.
<P>
The Committee has had some useful exchanges. One or two points have not been answered, but I have a favourable basic attitude to the provisions that the Minister is bringing forward, rather late in the Bill. As he rightly said, distinguished lawyers in another place have crawled over the Bill, as have experts from all parties. The Opposition do not wish to subvert their conclusions. It is not, however, impertinent for the Committee to occasionally make observations and to ask its own simple questions, even about matters that have been through such a refining sieve as their Lordships provide. The Committee should do that by questioning, but broadly by taking a positive attitude to the Minister's amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Healey:</B> I am learning the procedures of the House quickly, in the same way as a good joke. Everything is a question of timing, so I rise now, as it is perhaps the right time to make the points that I wanted to make before.
<P>
I wish to commend amendments Nos. 135, 137 and 138, which draw from the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill and which will introduce the same measures for dealing with national minimum wage disputes as those that deal with other employment rights.
<P>
I shall not go into the details, as the Minister has covered them, but I shall pick up two points that were raised by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
First is the issue of whether advice must be free, rather than normally being free, in order to qualify. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister could elaborate on that. Amendment No. 138, in proposed subsection (4B)(c), suggests that if a fee is charged for advice, the person giving that advice would no longer qualify as a relevant independent adviser.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am sharing this with the hon. Gentleman, and I think that he would agree with me that proposed subsection (4B)(c) excludes someone in receipt of payment, be they first from an organisation described in proposed subsection (4A)(c). For example, if the person came from a citizens advice bureau, payment would be precluded, but if the person was as described in proposed subsection (4A)(a)--a qualified lawyer--contracting to pay for legal services would not be anathema to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. As the Minister explained earlier, there are several categories, of people competent to give the sign off, as it were, to compromise agreements. We are talking here about one category--the independent adviser.
<P>
I return to the question of the hon. Member for Buckingham as an advice giver. To do that under the provisions of the clause, with the amendments, he would need to be certified--[Laughter]--certified as a competent adviser by the organisation under whose auspices he was giving that advice. The second condition would be that the organisation would need to have insurance against the risk of negligence cases. It would not be in the interest of such an organisation, be it trade union or advice centre, to allow an incompetent advice giver to give advice because they would lay themselves open to more claims against their negligence insurance. That would not, as the hon. Member for Solihull asked, be a drain on the finances of the state, because such insurance would be taken out by the organisations concerned.
<P>
In conclusion, the amendments, together with clause 46, mean that we will be able to use people to sign off compromise agreements who are already involved in the case and have relevant expertise. We will not need to drag into the case lawyers who charge a fee simply for ratifying the compromise agreement. It also means that we will be offering a less legal, lengthy and confrontational way of resolving disputes, which builds on established practice. The amendments, together with the clause, will make it simpler to sort out disputes that will arise over the payment of the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> From this large group of amendments, I should like to address very briefly a couple of questions on amendments Nos. 137 and 138. I am not surprised that the trade unions have hit back at the original drafting of the Bill, which would have meant that they could not directly provide advice to their members in the work place or would have to engage expensive legally qualified advice. I am sure that the trade unions have many people within their organisations whom they believe to be adequately competent and qualified to give this advice but who may not be qualified lawyers. Thus, amendment No. 138 makes perfect sense.
<P>
I had rather hoped that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull might be on one of his occasional absences from the Room when I made this next comment. I am in general all in favour of anything that reduces the amount of work pushed in the direction of lawyers, if that is possible. That is not intended to be derogatory in any way to my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I have to advise my hon. Friend that I went straight a very long time ago--I have not held a practising certificate these last 10 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am relieved indeed to be reassured on that point.
<P>
My points on amendments No. 138 are specific and minute. Proposed section (4A)(c) talks about an adviser who works at an advice centre who is competent to give advice and is authorised to do so on behalf of the centre. In comparison with the tight drafting and definitions in the rest of the Bill, the definition of advice centre is rather woolly. I can see no explicit definition, though there may be one in the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill. Can ``advice centre'' be interpreted as a citizens advice bureau or similar organisation which regularly provides legal advice? The Minister does not want it to be possible, but, without the definition being tighter, could the constituency advice surgery of an hon. Member be regarded as an advice centre?
<P>
Amendment No. 138 provides that no payment may be made for advice provided by an advice centre, but that does not apply to trade unions. I cannot see the logic in a competent person who is not a qualified lawyer but who works in a citizens advice bureau being unable to make a nominal charge when a person of similar calibre working for a trade union can do so. There may be a reason for that, but it is not immediately apparent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Amendment No. 138 talks of people acting for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the employer or an associated employer''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which strikes me as equally woolly. Can people be ``associated'' simply by belonging to the same chamber of commerce or the CBI? The term ``associated employer'' requires better definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree. There may be useful definitions in the Companies Act 1989. The amendment's definition of terms is less precise than the Bill's.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 relates to indemnity insurance. To provide that advice must be given free, without even a nominal charge to cover expenses, is harsh when the organisation providing advice must have a costly indemnity insurance policy. Has the Minister considered the implications of that? Regarding the tightness of drafting, lawyers will pore over the Bill looking for loopholes as the Minister has said. Amendment No. 137 does not refer to an amount of or limit to indemnity insurance. Nominal insurance would be valueless to employees. The legal contracts that I have seen usually refer to minimum indemnity provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is a stickler for drafting. Has he noticed that, whereas the term ``worker'', which includes employees, is used elsewhere in the Bill, amendment No. 138 suddenly refers to ``employee or worker'', as if they were distinct categories?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. The Minister is better placed to respond than I, but I suspect that the terms cover the same ground.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will deal with the points that I have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I speak for myself on my first point. I would prefer statutes to permit citizens to contract out of them, but that will not run in this case. I shall not oppose the clause. I see the Government's point: any breach of the principle--a precedent for contracting out--would become wholesale. There would be an avalanche and the Government's purposes would be defeated.
<P>
My remarks concern indemnity. Does the Minister--
