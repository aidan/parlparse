<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000448"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Claire
Ward):</b> It is good to have you back in the Chair, Ms
Walley.</div><a name="10031888000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
return to the defence provided under clause 13, and specifically the
application of that defence to the functions of the intelligence
services. As hon. Members will be aware, Parliament has conferred
statutory functions on the Security Service relating to national
security, economic well-being and acting in support of law enforcement
agencies in the prevention and detection of serious crime. In the case
of Government Communications Headquarters and the Secret Intelligence
Service, Parliament has determined that their respective functions
should be exercisable for the purposes of national security, in the
interest of the economic well-being of the nation, and for the
prevention and detection of serious crime.</div>
<a name="10031888000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridge set out alternative
approaches. Amendments 23 and 24 would limit the application
of the defence to the intelligence services&#146; functions relating
to national security and the prevention and detection of serious
crime by excluding those relating to economic well-being.
Amendment 20 would amend clause 13(1) to limit the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>defence only to the intelligence services&#146; functions relating to
national security. Either approach, in our view, would be extremely
detrimental, because it would undermine the ability of the intelligence
services to combat all relevant threats to the United
Kingdom.</div>
<a name="10031888000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defence
has been the subject of two reports by the Constitution Committee in
the other place. The first report, which was published in December last
year, expressed doubt about extending the defence to the
services&#146; statutory function to safeguard the economic
well-being of the UK. However, paragraph 10 of the report appeared to
accept that</div>
<a name="10031888000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there may be a
case for such a defence in the context of the Security and Secret
Intelligence Services&#146; statutory functions in connection with
national security and with the prevention and detection of serious
crime&#148;.</div><a name="10031888000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its second report, published in February, the Committee seemed to have
accepted, or at least not disputed, the Government&#146;s explanation
for including economic well-being with regard to the intelligence
services and extending the defence to GCHQ.</div>
<a name="10031888000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We remain
firmly of the view that the intelligence services must be able to carry
out their full range of functions without falling foul of the criminal
law when it proves necessary, for those purposes, to commit a relevant
bribery offence. The range of functions conferred on the intelligence
services is intended to cover matters that are of significant national
importance, but not necessarily matters that relate simply to national
security. In some operations, there might be considerable overlap
between the functions, but that will not always be the case.
Safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK might require the
intelligence services to take action to monitor events and trends that
might have a serious effect on the UK economy as a whole. That could
include monitoring states that seek to undermine this country&#146;s
economy or to use economic levers as hostile policy tools. It might
also involve identifying threats posed to the supply of energy and
similar commodities&#151;the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire
made that point in an intervention&#151;that are vital to the UK
economy, or threats to undermine the stability of financial markets.
Those issues should not be underestimated.</div>
<a name="10031888000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
suggested that the inclusion of economic well-being in the ambit of
clause 13 would mean that the defence would fall foul of our
international obligations. Let me assure the hon. Member
for Cambridge that that is not the case. We are concerned to
respect our international obligations to combat bribery, and we are
confident that the defence as drafted is fully consistent with those
obligations and, in particular, with the OECD convention on combating
bribery of foreign public officials in international business
transactions. It is for that reason that we have specifically excluded
from the definition of a &#147;relevant bribery offence&#148; in
clause 13(2) conduct that would amount to an offence under
clause 6, which is bribing a foreign public official with
the
intention</div><a name="10031888000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
obtain or retain...business, or...an advantage in the conduct
of
business.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth reminding the Committee that the Government amendments to
clause 13, which we have already debated, will provide a further
safeguard. Those amendments will require the heads of the intelligence
services to ensure that they have arrangements in place so that conduct
amounting to a relevant bribery offence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>will take place only when the defence would apply, and those
arrangements must be considered satisfactory by the relevant Secretary
of
State.</div><a name="10031888000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an operational need for the defence to cover the full range of
statutory functions, including economic well-being and the prevention
and detection of serious crime. The defence would exist only when such
conduct was assessed as necessary in accordance with the
services&#146; respective statutory functions. We firmly believe that
it would be wrong to criminalise the activities of the intelligence
services in such circumstances, so I urge  the hon. Member for
Cambridge to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10031888000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031888000449"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): As I understand it, the
Government&#146;s argument is that compliance with the OECD
convention on bribery requires them only to avoid a situation in which
they authorise the corruption of foreign officials, and that any
corruption involving the private sector in another state&#151;or in
Britain&#151;is okay. I am not sure that that is the case, but I am
willing to take the Minister&#146;s word for it.</div>
<a name="10031888000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, I am still bothered by the notion that functions beyond
national security, which I accept is difficult to define for the
purpose of this statute, justify the use of the weapon of giving
bribes. If we look at the basic problem of the national economic
interest, it seems difficult to argue that causing corruption is in
that interest. One of the fundamental arguments in support of the Bill
is that corruption is contrary to the economic interest of
everyone.</div><a name="10031888000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hear what the Minister says, and I suspect that it would be very
difficult to adjust the clause to make it better. That
drives me further towards the view that it would be better not have the
clause at all, but with that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="10031888000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Ward:</b> I beg to move amendment 31, in
clause 13, page 9, line 7, at

purposes of this section, the circumstances in which a person&#146;s

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000451"></a>The
Chair:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 21, in
clause 13, page 9, line 22, leave
out paragraph (b).</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0"><i class="I">This removes
offences relating to being bribed from the scope of the offence, so
that it could only be used as a defence to offering
bribes.</i></div><a name="10031888000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000452"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The amendments address the question of whether the
offence under clause 2 of requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting
a bribe should be a relevant bribery offence for the purpose of clause
13 and therefore come within the scope of the defence. We believe that
it should, but I accept that there is a need to clarify the matter. To
that end, I have tabled amendment 31. In explaining why we
need to include the offence, I shall also deal with amendment 21, which
I assume that the hon. Member for Cambridge tabled as a probing
amendment.</div>
<a name="10031888000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
included the clause 2 offence to cater for bribes paid to members of
the intelligence services or armed forces. We do not envisage that
there would ever be a situation in which a member of the intelligence
services or armed forces accepting a bribe to induce or reward improper
performance of their official functions would be covered by the
defence. We intend that the clause 13 defence will provide protection
for not only members of the intelligence services and armed forces who
might need to pay a bribe in furtherance of a function of the agency
concerned, but the recipient of such a bribe.</div>
<a name="10031888000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the other
place, Lord Thomas of Gresford raised the case of two people finding
themselves in the dock charged with an offence under the Bill: an
officer of an intelligence service who had paid a bribe, and an agent
who had received the bribe. Lord Thomas suggested that it would be
grossly unfair that the first person could avail themselves of the
defence but the second person could not. Although such a scenario
strikes me as highly improbable&#151;because it would be highly
improbable that the case would come to trial&#151;I agree with the
premise that such a situation would be grossly unfair. If it was
necessary for the bribe to be paid in pursuit of a function of the
intelligence services, that should be sufficient to trigger the defence
for the recipient of the bribe. I recognise that there is uncertainty
about whether the clause as drafted fully delivers that policy intent,
so the Government amendment will put the matter beyond doubt. I am
grateful to the hon. Member for Cambridge for highlighting the
issue.</div><a name="10031888000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000453"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I thank the Government for tabling amendment 31,
although I would be grateful if the Under-Secretary would explain in
more detail how it works technically, as it is a difficult amendment to
follow. She is right that my amendment 21 is probing. It occurred to me
that the circumstances under which one might want to authorise
intelligence officers to receive bribes were rather obscure. The hon.
Member for Poole has suggested a case involving double agents, but I
worry about that, because the question would arise under clause 3 of
whether a double agent was performing his or her function in
&#147;good faith&#148; or &#147;impartially&#148;&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>last people in the world expected to operate in good faith are double
agents. I am grateful to the Government for taking the issue seriously,
but I ask the Under-Secretary to explain the amendment in more
detail.</div><a name="10031888000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031888000454"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I share the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concern about the wording of the Government
amendment. I have read it several times and find it very dense. I would
welcome extra explanation from the Under-Secretary on how it works, and
it would be helpful if she took us through the route it
takes.</div>
<a name="10031888000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000456"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Exactly. Who takes a bribe to ingratiate himself
or herself with the enemy as part of a cover operation. In line with my
comments about his amendments in the previous group, although amendment
21 is worthy of debate, it would narrow the clause to an extent that
would be unsuitable for the purposes of the exemption.</div>
<a name="10031888000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000457"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> As I have said, the Government amendment makes it
clear that when a person receives a payment from a member of one of the
intelligence services&#151;amounting to an offence under clause
1&#151;and the payment is in pursuit of any of their statutory
functions, provided that the defence is available to the officer making
the payment, it will also be available to the individual receiving the
payment. That seems only just and equitable, given that many
individuals already provide invaluable assistance to the intelligence
services at considerable personal risk to themselves and their
families. In response to legitimate requests by members of the
services, the amendment will provide additional and important
reassurance for those individuals who receive a financial or other
advantage for their efforts that they will not be
criminalised.</div><a name="10031888000414"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="10031888000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000458"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I can see what the Under-Secretary is getting at
but the way it is done seems a bit obscure. Proposed new subsection
(1D) says that those circumstances are to be treated as circumstances
in which the activity is necessary. However, that seems to be
additional to the general coverage of clause 2, rather than defining
it.</div><a name="10031888000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000459"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I am seeking to make the policy behind the amendment
as clear as possible. As the hon. Gentleman will know, it is always
helpful not just for Members of the House but, in due course, for
prosecuting authorities and courts if we are absolutely clear about the
intention behind any such
amendments.</div><a name="10031888000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031888000460"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I may be
wrong, but I had understood the reason for the inclusion of clause
13(1) was that paragraphs (a) and (b) both discuss the fact that the
conduct was necessary for &#147;the proper exercise&#148; of the
function. The concern might have been that it could not be the proper
exercise  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>of the function if it was an act which is made illegal under clauses 1
or 2. Clause 13(1) is therefore needed to make it clear that it can be
proper, despite the fact that it is
illegal.</div><a name="10031888000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000461"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Essentially, someone has the defence if their
conduct is necessary. If it is necessary for them to pay a bribe the
clause provides that it is treated as necessary for the receiver to
receive the bribe. That is the intention behind the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10031888000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I am sure
Opposition Members will know, the recruitment of agents in highly
sensitive positions is not assisted where there is no assurance that
they will not face investigation and possible prosecution by doing what
they are asked to do. Equally, criminalising their behaviour would is
likely to act as a significant disincentive for the majority of members
of the public who would instinctively want to respond positively to a
request from one of the services for assistance, thus significantly
undermining the good will and support of public on which the services
rely.</div><a name="10031888000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is one further, technical reason why the clause 2 offence
needs to be included in the definition of a relevant bribery offence. A
member of the intelligence services offering, promising or giving a
bribe would, in addition to committing the clause 1 offence,
technically be aiding and abetting the commission of a clause 2 offence
and committing the inchoate offence of assisting or encouraging the
commissioning of the clause 2 offence. It is therefore necessary that

the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s ongoing
concerns.</div><a name="10031888000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
examples I have given relate to the intelligence services, but the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000462"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I beg to move amendment 22, in
clause 13, page 9, line 7, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">&#145;, provided that the
defence shall not apply in any case where the intention or the effect
of the bribe is to induce the purchase of weapons or other defence
equipment&#146;.</div><a name="10031888000377"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">This
is a probing amendment, but it was prompted by remarks made by the hon.
Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) on Second Reading. He was
concerned that exemption given to the armed forces might somehow be
used as cover for arms sales. He rightly raised that problem, so do the
Government envisage any circumstances in which it would be proper for
the armed services to bribe someone during active operations? I remind
hon. Members that it cannot be bribing a foreign official; it can only
be bribing a foreign private sector actor in relation to arms sales. I
must admit, having listened to the hon. Member for City of York, I
could not imagine what those circumstances might be. The underlying
point comes back to what the Under-Secretary said previously, that the
clause 6 offence of bribing a foreign official is not covered by this
defence. The amendment is therefore simply a way of inviting the
Under-Secretary to comment on the point raised by the hon. Member for
City of York and now raised by me.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000463"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Again, I have been trying to think of
circumstances where the amendment would apply and, generally speaking,
I hold the same view that it would not be appropriate to limit the
scope of the clause. I suppose it could be a very basic situation of
someone on the battlefield running out of bullets and bribing a local
tribesman to buy some, or it could be something very convoluted like
the Iran-Contra arms deal. Either of those could be slipped into the
clause.</div>
<a name="10031888000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031888000464"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I rather suspect it would be in
a police action, in which one is dealing with militias or various
groups such as in Bosnia, where one might not wish to shoot them; one
would rather give them a bit of money so that they would do something
of benefit to the UK Government.</div>
<a name="10031888000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000465"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There we have a third instance, and perhaps the
most useful of the three. In any event, we will not support the
amendment. It is too specific for the clause and no doubt will be
brought into the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments when we reach the
stand part debate.</div>
<a name="10031888000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000466"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Through this amendment, the hon. Member for
Cambridge is seeking an assurance that the defence in clause 13,
particularly as it applies to the armed forces, cannot be used to
sanction bribery in the context of defence contracts for
weapons or other military equipment. I can indeed give him the
assurance that he seeks.</div>
<a name="10031888000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
point to make is that a relevant bribery offence for the purpose of
clause 13 does not include an offence under clause 6. Consequently, any
bribery of a foreign public official with the intention of obtaining or
retaining a business or business advantage is not covered by the
defence. Accordingly, no one could mount the clause 13 defence in any
case involving the bribery of a foreign public official to induce that
official to place a contract with a particular company for the supply
of
arms.</div><a name="10031888000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it is important that the Committee understands the way the defence will
work. A person may only plead the defence where their
conduct&#151;the giving or taking of a bribe&#151;was necessary for
the proper exercise of any function of the armed forces when engaged on
active service. The necessity test is critical. It is not a question of
whether the briber thought that the armed forces would ultimately
benefit in some way. We can think of no circumstances where the
relevant conduct&#151;namely, the payment of a bribe to induce the
purchase of defence equipment&#151;could be necessary for the proper
exercise of any function of our armed forces when engaged on active
service.</div><a name="10031888000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would equally be the case if the person engaged in the conduct
concerned was an employee or agent of a defence equipment manufacturer,
as it would be with any other person. As I have said, we do not see on
what possible basis such a person could successfully argue that a bribe
to induce someone to purchase their company&#146;s equipment, as
opposed to the equipment of a rival company, meets the necessity test
in clause
13(1).</div><a name="10031888000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would be true if the bribe was being paid to, say, a Ministry of
Defence official to secure a contract in this country, but the
proposition that the defence might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>apply is even more far-fetched where the bribe is being paid to secure a
contract in another country. The defence applies to the proper exercise
of any function of the armed forces of the United Kingdom and not of
any other country. The focus of the clause 13 defence as it applies to
the armed forces is to afford protection to members of the armed
forces, and civilians working in their support, who may have to engage
in conduct that would amount to an offence under clause 1 or clause 2.
It is not a licence for the defence industry to commit bribery. There
will be no creep in the scope of the defence, as was feared by my hon.
Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) when he spoke on
Second Reading, and also by the hon. Member for Cambridge. In short,
the amendment is simply not necessary, and I therefore invite the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw
it.</div><a name="10031888000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000467"></a>David

proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10031888000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000468"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question now is whether clause 13
is necessary and desirable. As I said when we debated clause 10, there
are a number of ways of dealing with situations in which important UK
Government officials might have to engage in illegal activity, in the
kind of circumstances that the Under-Secretary mentioned earlier. I do
not want to go through those examples one by one. One way of dealing
with the problem is provided by the prime authorisation system, which
the Government have rejected. Another way is to define the offence more
tightly, so that such activities are not illegal in the first place.
The difficulty with that, however, is the knock-on effect on other
cases, and there is also the problem of international
obligation.</div><a name="10031888000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth solution, which I know from previous debates is not popular with
Conservative members of the Committee, is to use prosecutorial
discretion and to say that we do not want to declare that kind of
activity lawful because by doing so we undermine the principle that we
are trying to uphold&#151;that bribery is wrong. We want to maintain
clearly that condoning bribery in any way in our own law would have
deleterious effects more generally. For example, it would be more
difficult for us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>to complain about other people who had similar get-out clauses, and the
general corrosive effect of a culture of bribery would, at that stage,
be in play. It is a similar argument to that which the Government and I
both make about the exemption from the so-called facilitation payments
which, as the Under-Secretary of State said, are simply bribes. Should
we have that sort of exemption in the Bill? The argument against
prosecutorial discretion is clear: we should not allow the criminal law
to become a tool in the hands of the prosecutors to pick and choose who
is to be subject to criminal law. However, discretion cannot be
avoided. Prosecutors need that sort of discretion to make the system
workable, and I come down in favour of it as the solution. It seems
that the Government have also accepted that argument, given the way in
which the clause
works.</div><a name="10031888000415"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="10031888000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031888000469"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): As for prosecutorial
discretion, is not the difference under the clause the fact that we
would be asking prosecutors in such circumstances to take into account
factors that they are not used to taking into account? Issues of
national security and the like are not things that, in the ordinary
course of events, we invite prosecutors to take into account when
making what, I accept, are regular judgments of
discretion.</div><a name="10031888000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000470"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an important point, but I do not accept
it because of precisely what happened in the al-Yamamah case when the
director of the Serious Fraud Office took the decision not to proceed
with that investigation on the grounds of national security as put to
him by Ministers. It is important to remember that part of the
Government&#146;s defence of their position in that case was, in the
end, that the Attorney-General did not instruct the director of the SFO
to call off the investigation or use the power of superintendence. The
Government always say&#151;it is technically true&#151;that the
director himself took into account national security considerations and
called off the investigation. Although it is unusual, the Government
cannot say that things cannot be done, because they also say that such
things have been
done.</div><a name="10031888000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000471"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Is not the important difference the fact that
clause 13 deals with a situation in which the state, not a commercial
interest, is making payments? For example, after a conflict, it might
be necessary as an interim measure to make some payments. Our forces
might make them in good faith to re-establish government and good order
in a country. Those circumstances are different from what the hon.
Gentleman has been talking
about.</div><a name="10031888000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000472"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Matters are different, but they are not different
enough to justify a different approach. Why should there be a specific
defence in statute as opposed to using the same
technique&#151;prosecutorial discretion&#151;because what is said
could be taken into account by a
prosecutor?</div><a name="10031888000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000473"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> That is not good enough. If the state decides that,
in the process of pacifying an area which has been a conflict zone, it
is necessary to make some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>payments and our armed forces do so, they should not be subject to the
whim of the prosecutor&#151;they should be not
guilty.</div><a name="10031888000078"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000474"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The armed forces should have the defence
available, because the idea that they should not have been guilty in
the first place is the fourth solution that most people have now
rejected. Should we maintain the possibility of a prosecution if the
armed forces or the intelligence services had abused their position in
some way? We cannot tell in advance whether that will be the case. The
point about discretion is that it leaves the law to be used in an
appropriate case. To have a defence creates a problem, as it risks
undermining the importance of the crime
itself.</div><a name="10031888000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the situation under clause 13 in respect of the clause 6 offence of
bribing a foreign official? In such cases, prosecutorial discretion is
in place because nothing under clause 13 covers it. What is the
situation with regard to law enforcement officials, as opposed to the
armed forces and intelligence services? The relevant part of what was
clause 12, now clause 13, was by general consent removed from the Bill.
The position for law enforcement agencies is, again, one of
prosecutorial discretion. If prosecutorial discretion works in those
two instances, I cannot see why the principle should not be applied to
all relevant cases, so I oppose clause 13 standing part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10031888000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000475"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We feel that the outcome achieved in the other
place on the clause and on clause 10 remains broadly correct. However,
inherent in the debate is the question of where we draw the balance
between ministerial accountability for what are operational decisions
by the armed forces and intelligence services, and the need to maintain
a Bill that is fit for purpose and that will not jeopardise the
operational effectiveness of troops on the ground. A proud tradition of
the British forces has been that command decisions are, within the
remit of orders, taken by the man on the ground. We are therefore
reluctant to accept the position offered by the hon. Member for
Cambridge.</div><a name="10031888000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
exclude altogether a defence for the armed forces and intelligence
services would leave the Bill in disarray and, ironically, as the hon.
Gentleman explained, it would force us back to the Government&#146;s
great cure-all for the potential pitfalls of the Bill, namely
prosecutorial discretion. If we do away with, or significantly weaken,
the defence provided for in the clause, we would do just that. Relying
solely on prosecutorial discretion so as not to criminalise those
individuals defending the nation&#146;s security would, we accept,
place an unnecessary burden on those exceptional individuals, without
giving them the certainty that they need in order to act. In addition,
as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire rightly said,
a non-commercial issue is different, when it is in defence of our
country.</div><a name="10031888000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Member for Cambridge can suggest a series of carve-outs from
the basic defence, why can he not accept the concept of a carve-out
from prosecutorial discretion? We accept that there are situations in
which it is in the national interest for state agents to act outside
the normal parameters of the Bill, but we are firm in our opinion that
the Committee must ensure that acts of bribery are carried out on
behalf of the state only when necessary, and that officers of the state

<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>are given as much assistance as possible in advance so that they know
when it is permissible to carry out such acts. In doing away with the
other place&#146;s amendments to clause 10, we feel that the
Government may have undermined that principle by putting the emphasis
back on clause 13, which Lord Pannick described
as</div><a name="10031888000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;deficient
in relying on a criminal prosecution after the event, with the onus of
proof on the defendant as sufficient protection of the public
interest.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
8 February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
482.]</div><a name="10031888000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said on Tuesday, I have returned to my hon. and noble Friends to
discuss the Government&#146;s position, and we still find the
provisions
deficient.</div><a name="10031888000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of prior authorisation is a vexed one, and it has been raised in
Committee and in the debates in the other place. Concerns focus on how
such a requirement gives rise to the drawbacks attributable to
over-reliance on prosecutorial discretion; there would be no certainty
at the point at which the offence was committed that the defence would
operate. Lord Bach noted, in a very long speech in response to the
stand part debate in Committee in the other place, that the insertion
of an authorised
mechanism</div><a name="10031888000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
be an unwelcome and ill-advised development in our criminal process for
a Minister of the Crown to decide whether a statutory defence should be
available to an individual charged with an offence in a particular
case.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 13
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
104.]</div><a name="10031888000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have based their amendments to clause 10 on that premise,
but we fear that it is flawed. The authorisation procedure proposed in
clause 10 would have a protective effect, as it would exempt the
individual from the offence before it was committed. As Lord Pannick
said of the Government&#146;s reliance on a clause 13 defence alone
that
he</div><a name="10031888000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
be surprised if officers would be willing to conduct acts of bribery
and to take the risk of later
prosecution.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have misinterpreted the amendment,
which</div><a name="10031888000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not require prior authorisation; it simply recognises that where the
Secretary of State gives prior authorisation, a prosecution should not
take place thereafter.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i> 8 February 2010; Vol. 717, c.
482.]</div><a name="10031888000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, the act of bribery is not criminalised and no defence is
required. That means that the individual does not have to raise a
defence. It seems that the Government may have put the cart before the
horse in relation to their amendments to clause 10, because they have
criminalised all such actions and require individuals who are subject
to clause 13 to raise a defence in a court of
law.</div><a name="10031888000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall draw out that point because it impacts on clause 13. In so doing,
I reiterate concerns raised by Lord Thomas in another place. In the
Bill as drafted, the burden of proving the defence is on the person
charged. That is no mere evidential burden; he actually has to prove
his innocence. In doing so, he must prove that he has properly
exercised his function as a member of the relevant body. How does he do
so, and how do those who are acting on his behalf have access to the
documentation necessary for him to give that proof? In addition, how
can he go into a court and raise those issues before a jury, except in
the most exceptional circumstance of secret hearings? It could be
extremely difficult to prove these matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div><a name="10031888000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there are
secret matters to be conveyed, that should not be done to the court,
jury or defence team, but to the person who takes the decision to
prosecute&#151; the Director of Public Prosecutions, the
director of the SFO, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, or the
Attorney-General. Those are the people to whom representations could be
made under the provisions of clause 10, but that is not the case under
clause 13. We seek to carve out protection for such individuals in
relation to clause 13. The defence should cut in when charging somebody
who has in effect just been doing his job and on whom all the burden of
defending himself would
fall.</div><a name="10031888000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
functions of the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service and
GCHQ are defined in statute. It is right that the Bill should mirror
those and not take a selective approach, which the Liberal
Democrat amendments to the clause would have done. Such an approach
could undermine the ability of the services to discharge their
legitimate purposes. To over-concentrate the defence on particular
functions would be to allow for uncertainty. All those services have
three core functions&#151;national security, the economic well-being
of the nation, and the prevention or detection of serious
crime&#151;enshrined in statutory provisions. As one would expect,
there is considerable overlap between those three functions, which is
why a broad defence is needed in the form of clause
13.</div><a name="10031888000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would not require too great a leap of the imagination for members of
the Committee to surmise that the UK intelligence and security services
may seek to indentify, recruit and run sources in a manner that
sometimes involves conduct that may amount to the definition of bribery
in the Bill. Likewise, to maintain a strategic interception capability
and to continue to provide intelligence on certain targets that are
critical to our national security, GCHQ may need to provide equipment
or assistance to individuals who are in a position to support its
interception mission in challenging environments.</div>
<a name="10031888000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The functions
of the armed forces are perhaps the most visible ones referred to in
clause 13, not least because of the ongoing operations in Afghanistan.
The purpose of the extension of the defence to them is self-evident. We
should not criminalise conduct that would amount to bribery by the
military, where it is necessary during active service. Although the
Conservatives agree with the Government on that stance, I shall
reiterate the point made by Lord Pannick in the other place, as an
answer was not forthcoming then. Will the Under-Secretary tell us
whether there are any examples in recent years where prosecution
authorities have been asked to consider prosecution of a member of the
armed forces for alleged bribery during the course of performing a
function of the armed forces? The offences created by the Bill will
capture instances where members of the three services recruit and
reward agents and contacts in the UK and abroad. In the absence of the
defence under clause 13, service staff and those acting on their behalf
will be exposed to potential liability when carrying out functions
bestowed on them by Parliament in pursuit of the requirements set by
Government.</div><a name="10031888000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
feel that the other place has struck the right balance and that the
Government&#146;s removal of the prior-authorisation mechanism in
clause 10 is wrong. There is a need to strike a balance between defence
from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>the criminal law on the one side, and catering for the needs of those
who undertake important functions on behalf of the public on the other.
There will be times when the protection of national security or the
safety of our armed forces justifies certain organs of state committing
acts of bribery. We accept that. However, we must ensure that such
actions are taken on the basis of sure legal
footing.</div><a name="10031888000416"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000476"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> After listening to the hon. Gentleman, never have I
thought the phrase &#147;Johnny-come-lately&#148; was more apt and
appropriate. He is telling the Committee his views on the amendment to
clause 10, which we debated on Tuesday evening, because he has had the
opportunity&#151;some seven days later&#151;to discuss the matter
with his colleagues in the Lords. It seems that, despite the view that
he came to very late, he has still got it wrong, because it is not an
exemption that is created. Clause 13 simply provides a defence, and
extra measures are provided by the amendment in clause 10 to ensure
that the heads of the intelligence services and the head of the armed
forces defence council have in place procedures that the Secretary of
State considers
satisfactory.</div><a name="10031888000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
real problem, as I explained on Tuesday night&#151;the hon. Gentleman
had not quite got to grips with the issue then&#151;is that the
clause that came to this House as a result of amendment in the other
place, created a hybrid, which allows for an authorisation scheme in
addition to the defence, and is not satisfactory for those who work in
intelligence services or defence. In practice, those who are conducting
activities that would be bribery without the defence that is available
to them, would have to seek advance authorisation. That is the reality
of the clause that came from the
Lords.</div><a name="10031888000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
prosecution would put the case to court or consider it before it went
to court, and would want to know why, if an authorisation could be
available, it was not given. That could muddy the waters rather than
give a clear and precise explanation of a defence that would be
available to those who had, in effect, committed an offence under the
other
clauses.</div><a name="10031888000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000477"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Under-Secretary should go back to a stage
before that. In most circumstances it would not be relevant because one
would have thought that before that later stage, the prosecution would
have taken a view on whether it wanted to prosecute. It may have made
some inquiries at the earlier stage, so I hope that it would not even
have got to that
point.</div><a name="10031888000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000478"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Of course, prosecutors would have considered
carefully before deciding whether to proceed with the case, but the
fact that an authorisation could have been made available, but was not,
would not make the case any clearer. In fact, it would make it much
more difficult. Why would they proceed with the activity that was, in
effect, bribery when they could have had an authorisation, but did not,
and are simply trying to rely on that defence? That is not a clear and
precise method to expect our intelligence and defence services to rely
on when there is a simple and much clearer way&#151;relying on the
defence in clause 13. I am sorry that the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>Gentleman is seeking to reopen the debate from Tuesday night. Frankly,
he has still not managed to get to grips with the issue.</div>
<a name="10031888000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defence
in clause 13 addresses matters of national importance relating to the
operations of intelligence services and armed forces, and has proved to
be one of the more contentious parts of the Bill. I understand that,
but the clause under consideration now is not the one that was in the
Bill when it was introduced in the other place in November last year.
The House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution produced two
reports on the clause and, as the hon. Member for Cambridge made clear,
it was extensively debated in the other place.</div>
<a name="10031888000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken
note of the comments made, and considered the clause carefully. We have
improved it and the Bill significantly as a result of those
discussions. We listened to the views expressed about the much broader
inclusion of law-enforcement authorities, and we have significantly
narrowed the application of the defence. We disagreed with the approach
taken in the amendments made in the other place to augment
the defence with the ministerial authorisation scheme, but we have
since responded positively to Lord Pannick&#146;s argument for some
form of ministerial
oversight.</div><a name="10031888000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the amended clause, the Secretary of State will be required to approve
the arrangements put in place by the heads of the intelligence services
and the defence council designed to ensure that bribery takes place
only in the circumstances covered by the defence. That is a much
simpler and clearer way to express it than the form in which it came
from the other place. We remain convinced that the clause is required
to protect the legitimate functions of the intelligence services and
the armed forces.</div>
<a name="10031888000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 13
will ensure that a defence exists where conduct amounting to an offence
under the Bill is necessary for the proper exercise of a function of
the intelligence services or armed forces when engaged on active
service. That may be the case where it is necessary to secure critical
intelligence or assistance or to ensure the safety of military
personnel. It is important that the individuals who carry out these
vital functions know that this legal protection has been conferred by
Parliament. We believe that the defence as amended represents the best
balance between providing legal certainty and ministerial
accountability and the need to maintain operational flexibility and
effectiveness.</div>
<a name="10031888000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already explained why to require prior ministerial authorisation for
such conduct would not be practical in these circumstances. Likewise,
relying on prosecutorial discretion not to bring charges against those
carrying out these important functions would not provide sufficient
legal certainty. To ask someone to offer a bribe in the knowledge and
belief that their actions were unlawful would place that person in an
invidious position, even if no prosecution followed.</div>
<a name="10031888000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The defence
makes it clear to anyone concerned that, should a person be required to
use a financial or other advantage to secure intelligence or
assistance, they would have a defence that could be put before the
court. This does not mean that the defence will be of use only to those
who are charged and prosecuted. It will also assist prosecutors in
deciding whether a prosecution should  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>be brought in the first place. I cannot emphasise more strongly how
important that is in a practical sense for prosecutors and those
engaged on behalf of the intelligence
services.</div><a name="10031888000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
can expect that, where prosecutors are satisfied that the defence
applies, no prosecution will result. If, on the other hand, they are
not satisfied as to the circumstances, the matter will go to court and
it would be for the defendant to persuade the jury, on the balance of
probabilities, that the defence applies. There is precedent for such a
defence in section 1B of the Protection of Children Act 1978, which
relates to the offence of taking, distributing, possessing or
publishing indecent images of children, and the courts are capable of
dealing with these sensitive matters in accordance with existing
procedures and
practice.</div><a name="10031888000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not the case that including economic well-being in the defence would
put us in breach of our international obligations and, in particular,
the OECD convention. The clause specifically excludes from the
definition of a &#147;relevant bribery offence&#148; in subsection
(2) conduct which would amount to an offence under clause 6, that is
conduct that would amount to the bribing of a foreign public official
with the intention to obtain or retain business or an advantage in the
conduct of business. We are therefore confident that it is fully
consistent with the OECD convention, as I have already told the hon.
Member for
Cambridge.</div><a name="10031888000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
remain firmly committed to protecting from criminal liability those
carrying out the legitimate functions of the intelligence services and
armed forces. These individuals are faced with difficult operational
circumstances which can necessitate the use of financial or other
inducements to achieve their objectives.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000479"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Clearly, if troops are on active service somewhere
and a bribe or a facilitation payment or whatever was needed, the money
would have to come from somewhere. Unless our troops are extremely well
paid, someone would have to authorise the money, the goods, the food or
whatever was used. It is highly unlikely that a captain, a major or a
sergeant would have sufficient funds to go round bribing people on
behalf of Her Majesty&#146;s Government. Authorisation would have to
be given at some
point.</div><a name="10031888000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000480"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman misunderstands the
concept of authorisation in relation to the security services. He is
right in a sense, that there would need to be procedures in place for
such an activity under the amendments that we made to clause 10 in
relation to the use of the defence. The Secretary of State will need to
be of the view that those procedures are satisfactory. But that is
quite different from an authorisation scheme and from the
authorisations that were included in the original clause as it came
from the other place. Of course, people who serve this
country&#151;whether in the armed forces, on active duty or in our
intelligence services&#151;protect us from real threats to our
society and to our well-being. They should not be exposed to the risk
of prosecution when it is evident that their conduct is legitimate. To
do so would have significant operational implication for both the
intelligence services and our brave armed forces in the sort of
circumstances described by the hon. Member for Poole; for example,
those on active duty in Afghanistan.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000495"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause ties in senior officers of
companies&#151;or perhaps I should say bodies corporate&#151;to
clause 1, 2 or 6 offences. It works by saying that if a senior officer
commits an offence, the underlying offence is</div>
<a name="10031888000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;proved to have
been committed with the consent or connivance&#148;
</div><a name="10031888000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">of that
senior officer. We have been asked whether the Under-Secretary could
explain, or rather clarify, the meaning of connivance in that context.
It is, of course, an extremely important matter
that&#151;</div><a name="10031888000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000496"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Who has asked the hon. Gentleman to seek clarity on
the
matter?</div><a name="10031888000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000497"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Let me change that to say that I am asking. It
is an extremely important matter that an employee or officer could also
be prosecuted for a clause 1, 2 or 6 offence with very serious
consequences. To clarify those circumstances is also, therefore, very
important.</div><a name="10031888000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000498"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Just to follow up on that point very briefly,
clearly if a senior officer has given consent, that is something that
would happen in advance of an offence occurring. If, on the other hand,
a senior officer finds out that an employee has done something and
covered it up, then, to an extent, that might be connivance. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>Presumably, both would be covered by that particular aspect. I would be
grateful for further clarification from the
Under-Secretary.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000499"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Clause 14 recognises that it is individuals who
undertake bribery, even where a body corporate is held responsible. The
clause provides that where a body corporate or a Scottish partnership
has been found guilty of bribery under the general or foreign public
official offences, a director, partner or similar senior officer of the
body or partnership is guilty of the same offence if he or she has
consented to or connived at the commission of the offence. It does not
apply to the failure by commercial organisations to prevent bribery
offence in clause
7.</div><a name="10031888000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consent or connivance provision follows the model of section 12 of the
Fraud Act 2006 and, previously, section 18 of the Theft Act 1968, among
others&#151;it is a relatively common provision. I am sure the hon.
Member for Huntingdon, as a solicitor, will be well versed
in such things. The Law Commission report, paragraph 6.132,
noted
that</div><a name="10031888000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is a compelling case to extend the &#145;consent and
connivance&#146; regime applicable in fraud cases to bribery
offenses&#148;.</div><a name="10031888000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause does not create a second offence of consent or connivance;
rather, the body corporate and senior officer are guilty of the main
bribery offence. If that is not a sufficient explanation for the hon.
Gentleman on the details of connivance as set out in other legislation,
I am more than happy to write to him.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000501"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause deals with offences under clause 7 by
partnerships and states that the proceedings must be brought in the
name of the partnership. However, subsection (3) states that any fine
imposed on the partnership is to be paid out of the partnership assets.
I have two questions. First, why is the Bill going away from the
standard position that partners are personally responsible for the
debts of the partnership? Secondly, if a clause 7 offence were
prosecuted, could the partners be pulled into the prosecution through
clause 14? If they cannot be pulled in by that means, why is it fair
that individuals doing business as a company can be personally
prosecuted under clause 14, but individuals doing business as a
partnership cannot?</div>
<a name="10031888000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000502"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Clause 15 includes technical provisions to deal with
proceedings for an offence under clause 7 against a partnership. Under
subsection (1), such proceedings must be brought in the name of the
partnership 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>and not the partners. Subsection (2) provides that certain provisions
have effect for a partnership, as they do for a body corporate: namely,
the rules of court relating to the service of documents and the
procedure on charge of an offence against a corporation. Subsection (3)
provides that any fine imposed on the partnership on conviction must be
paid out of the partnership assets; it is another provision found
regularly in legislation. A recent example, of which the hon. Gentleman
may be aware, is the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act
2007, in which there are similar provisions. If that is not sufficient
detail for the hon. Gentleman, I am more than happy to write to him
with more information about other
legislation.</div><a name="10031888000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000503"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Could the Minister address my second question? I
shall repeat it for her benefit. If a clause 7 offence were prosecuted,
could the partners be pulled into the prosecution through clause 14? If
they cannot be pulled in by that means, why is it fair that individuals
doing business acting within a company can be personally prosecuted
under clause 14, but individuals doing business as a partnership
cannot?</div><a name="1003193000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000504"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> My understanding is that they

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000506"></a>Claire

<a name="10031888000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000507"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The fact that they cannot be prosecuted is in
the Bill. My question is, why is there a seeming differentiation
between a partnership and a company?</div>
<a name="10031888000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000508"></a>Claire

clarification on whether partners can be brought in under clause
14.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000509"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000511"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> May I just clarify the point? I could start a
business by setting up either a company or a partnership. The
Under-Secretary&#146;s answer suggests that it would make sense to
set up a business under a partnership, because I would not then be
liable as an individual under the terms of the legislation. Were I to
set up a business by using a company, however, I could be personally
liable under the provisions of clause 14. That is the point I am trying
to make. It seems to be an anomaly and it needs
clarification.</div><a name="10031888000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000512"></a>Claire

clarification at this stage. Should any further information be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000513"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> On the partnership assets in clause 15(3), a call
can normally be made on the partners if the partnership owes a debt.
Subsection (3), however, seems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>to suggest instead that the assets of the partnership as constituted at
the time of conviction would be subject to the fine. If so, is there
not a danger of avoidance measures being
taken?</div><a name="10031888000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000514"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I think
the Under-Secretary said in her opening remarks that the standard
position is that partners cannot be held personally liable, and she
cited legislation in which that is the case. I agree with my hon.
Friend, however, that the starting position in a partnership is that
partners are personally liable. The proposal is unusual, so why are we
going down that
route?</div><a name="10031888000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000515"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> It would be worth the Under-Secretary addressing
the question of whether the provision runs any risks of avoidance. If
it does not, that would be all to the
good.</div><a name="10031888000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000516"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> We are discussing the difference between debts and
criminal liability in relation to a partnership. Regarding subsection

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000518"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The reform of the law on bribery and the
commencement is a devolved matter in Scotland. Accordingly, the
extension of the Bill to that jurisdiction is subject to the Scottish
Parliament passing the necessary legislative consent motion. I
understand that the Scottish Justice Minister tabled such a motion on
11 February, and it has subsequently been
passed.</div><a name="10031888000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
19 covers commencement and the Bill&#146;s substantive provisions.
The new criminal offences will be brought into force by a commencement
order by the Secretary of State. As I have indicated, we will not
commence the new offence of the failure on the part of a commercial
organisation to prevent bribery until we have published the relevant
guidance for commercial organisations, as required by clause 9. Such
guidance will be available well in advance of the legislation coming
into force&#151;an assurance that I gave to hon. Members and the
Committee earlier this week. That being the case, we do not envisage
bringing that offence into force before 1 October 2010 at the
earliest.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000519"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10031888000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause deals with an annual strategy report. It asks the Secretary
of State to make provision for the publication of an annual report to
be issued by the Government. The report would have a minimum of four
strands, including the Government&#146;s anti-bribery objectives and
strategies for the coming year, as well as the milestones to be used to
assess the success of such strategies, and an assessment of the success
of the preceding year&#146;s strategies and objectives by way of
measurement against pre-determined milestones as expressed in the
preceding year&#146;s report. There are two further provisions
relating to advisory services that are covered by a separate new
clause, which I will not go into at this
stage.</div><a name="10031888000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause draws on two strands for inspiration. First, there is the
recommendation from the Joint Committee on securing compliance with the
Bill. Secondly, there is the Government&#146;s strategy paper,
published in January 2010, called &#147;UK Foreign Bribery
Strategy&#148;. We feel that as things stand, there is a need for a
more effective system to monitor the Bill&#146;s implementation.
Parliamentary oversight and putting it into the context of an overall
anti-corruption strategy will be important. The new clause would be a
step in the right direction to ensure that such oversight is
maintained.</div>
<a name="10031888000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of note is
Transparency International&#146;s general agreement with the
principle of parliamentary oversight. However, it raises an interesting
point in its briefing paper published in the run-up to the Committee
sittings. It
asks:</div><a name="10031888000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
other criminal offence requires statutory
monitoring?&#148;</div><a name="10031888000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response, we would point to the prosecution rate for bribery&#151;I
will come to that&#151;and the inherent difficulty with monitoring
the crime.</div>
<a name="10031888000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bribery, more
so than any other crime, often takes place in the shadows. Collecting
the evidence to prosecute is intrinsically difficult. A change in
corporate culture has been the watchword throughout the pre-legislative
process, and it has come to the fore on a number of occasions during
the debate in
Parliament.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div><a name="10031888000418"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10031888000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inherent intangibility of such goals is often not seen with other
crimes or criminal statutes. For example, it is far easier to quantify
a fall in violent crime or an increase in burglaries. We are attempting
to legislate through the Bill for a change in attitude, and that calls
for a new system of monitoring.</div>
<a name="10031888000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will first
examine the recommendation that came from the Joint Committee on that
point. We have discussed at some length the long-overdue nature of the
Bill and the amount of time that it has taken to get to this point.
However, leaving the present aside to look at the future, we are keen
to ensure that the Bill can be implemented successfully and in a manner
that is practical for those caught within its remit.</div>
<a name="10031888000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
enable the UK to meet its international obligations and we believe that
it will have a strong deterrent effect on companies and individuals who
might otherwise have paid bribes. Assessing the deterrent effect on the
basis of the number of additional prosecutions per year for bribery
offences is a flawed approach. Significantly, the partial impact
assessment produced by the Government to accompany the draft Bill
suggested, as we discussed this morning, that only 1.3 additional
prosecutions a year would result from the Bill. We are slightly
perplexed and intrigued about how that number was reached. Perhaps the
Under-Secretary will give us more information about the basis for the
calculations.</div><a name="10031888000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000520"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I explained earlier today how the 1.3 was reached.
It was based on one contested SFO case and one contested CPS case over
three years. That is how we get to
1.3.</div><a name="10031888000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000521"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for that
explanation, but as I said this morning, the target seems to be pretty
low.</div>
<a name="10031888000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Monitoring
the deterrent effect of legislation is inherently problematic. Its
intangible nature makes any assessment that is based on quantitative
evaluation methods inadequate, so we need to devise new strategies to
assess the effectiveness of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10031888000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint
Committee report commented on the anticipated need for additional
resources to be allocated to prosecuting bodies for enforcement actions
or prosecutions under the Bill. For instance, the Director of Public
Prosecutions told the Joint Committee that</div>
<a name="10031888000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there would be
an additional need for resources if there were significantly more
investigations undertaken by the police as a result of these
proposals&#148;.</div><a name="10031888000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
the City of London police overseas anti-corruption unit
stated:</div><a name="10031888000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
level of resource, currently available, has been sufficient to obtain
the results identified thus
far&#148;</div><a name="10031888000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
noted that an intelligence assessment would be required to identify the
level of additional resources needed to combat corruption
overseas.</div><a name="10031888000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not necessarily agree with those comments. They might be partly
true, but there might be the possibility of working more efficiently or
pushing cases forward more quickly. However, we believe there is a need
to track properly how money has been spent and how successfully funds
are being employed. An annual report would provide a good opportunity
to measure expenditure and evaluate cost-effectiveness.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div><a name="10031888000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is crucial
that there is a focus on more than just the deterrent effect. Although
there is a real argument that the focus should be on deterrence, there
needs to be equal emphasis on changing corporate culture. At the most
basic level, that will mean generating sufficient publicity to make
companies aware of their new
responsibilities.</div><a name="10031888000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000522"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that what he describes
would assist the Government&#146;s desire&#151;as expressed quite
rightly by the Under-Secretary throughout&#151;to set a gold standard
for the rest of the world to admire and, it is hoped,
emulate?</div><a name="10031888000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000523"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I certainly do. My hon. Friend makes an
important point. It is one thing to put in place the gold standard in
terms of legislation, but that is quite different from achieving
prosecutions, a change of corporate culture and a change of attitude
throughout the world by getting Governments to buy into what we are
doing. I agree, however, that the new clause would do much towards
promoting such
change.</div><a name="10031888000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reynolds
Porter Chamberlain stated in evidence to the Joint Committee that an
Act arising from the draft Bill would need to be given wide
publicity</div>
<a name="10031888000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure that
all UK businesses are aware of the need to prevent bribery and meet
this regulatory
burden&#148;.</div><a name="10031888000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Compliance
then needs to be monitored, but one of the most surprising elements of
the Joint Committee&#146;s report is the apparent acceptance by many
that there will be no compliance monitoring. The Government&#146;s
impact assessment noted that there would be no compliance monitoring
process, and the CPS noted that there was unlikely to be an increase in
prosecutions because of the difficulty in obtaining evidence in the
first
place.</div><a name="10031888000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
difficulties in obtaining evidence are the main barrier to prosecution,
it seems odd that the Government do not intend to monitor compliance
with the law, since that would be one of the primary means by which
offences could be identified, as well as systems corrected, before any
breach in the law occurred. Global Witness said that the lack of
monitoring meant:</div>
<a name="10031888000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no obligation on companies to report bribes by their employees and
no onus on the authorities to monitor whether or not companies&#146;
anti-bribery mechanisms are &#145;adequate&#146; or not. Once again
it seems that there is little incentive for
compliance.&#148;</div>
<a name="10031888000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are unsettled by the
apparent uncertainty regarding the deterrent effect of the Bill and the
ability to monitor compliance with it. Is the aim of the Bill simply to
satisfy the OECD that we have put in place the law, or are we aiming to
produce workable legislation that is a practical response to the
serious problem of international bribery?</div>
<a name="10031888000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We appreciate
that tracking prosecution rates is not necessarily indicative of the
success of the legislation, especially as one of the Bill&#146;s
purported aims is to bring about a change in corporate
culture&#151;an objective as intangible as it is
aspirational.</div><a name="10031888000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that an annual statement of strategy that highlights core areas
for the Government and business to work on, as well as discrete
milestones for the achievement of such objectives, would permit a more
informed assessment of the impact and success of the Bill in the years
following its enactment. It would allow trends to be tracked and
initiatives implemented that could ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>that the UK continued to comply with its obligations under the OECD
convention. It would also allow for a benchmark to be created that
could be utilised by future Parliaments to judge whether the
Bill&#146;s provisions needed to be amended. Ultimately, that is what
we would hope that our proposal could
encourage.</div><a name="10031888000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee applauded the Government&#146;s suggestion that a
review of the impact of the legislation would be conducted after three
to five years of its enactment, but recommended thatany revised impact
assessment generated by the Government should set out
a</div><a name="10031888000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;comprehensive
set of performance indicators so that the criteria against which the
legislation is being assessed are clearly
understood.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Annexe
1 of the Joint Committee&#146;s report included a review of the draft
Bribery Bill impact assessment by the House of Commons Scrutiny Unit.
It was quite critical of the Government&#146;s partial impact
assessment, which, as with everything else surrounding the Bill, was
somewhat rushed and altogether last minute. Some of its recommendations
would be ideally suited as the basis for an annual strategy report. The
review
asked:</div><a name="10031888000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
what basis the net cost to the private sector has been
calculated...Whether the cost estimates are subject to any
sensitivities/margins of error...How was the one-off cost of
&#163;50,000 for &#145;awareness raising&#146; calculated, and
will this be sufficient to inform all UK companies of the implications
associated with the new legislation? How will this money be used?...In
relation to the new discrete corporate offence, what evidence is there
for the IA&#146;s assertion that in &#145;most cases&#146; the
activities of SMEs will not fall within the main focus of enforcement
activity?...Has the MoJ made any estimates of the cost to the criminal
justice system of failed prosecutions under the new discrete corporate
offence?&#148;</div>
<a name="10031888000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not an
exhaustive list of the issues that we would like to see addressed in an
annual strategy paper, but it is a good pointer. Given that no full
impact assessment has been concluded on the Bill, there is a need for
an ongoing assessment of its impact on business to be maintained from
the point of
enactment.</div><a name="10031888000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
January, after many delays and no little prodding, the Government
produced what we hope will be the first annual report on anti-bribery.
The report could form the blueprint for what we envisage under the new
clause. Paragraph 1.4 of the report sets out how the
Government</div><a name="10031888000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
address and manage the evolving challenges and establish a clear legal,
regulatory and policy framework for action against foreign
bribery.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
state:</div><a name="10031888000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Law
reform through the new Bribery Bill will be the keystone of this
approach&#148;</div><a name="10031888000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
that the anti-bribery
strategy</div><a name="10031888000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;also
reinforces links to the wider international anti-corruption
agenda&#151;reflecting our commitment to focus on the causal drivers
of foreign bribery and deepen our collaboration with international
partners.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report sets out four strategic objectives and the strategy for
achieving those objectives. Most interesting of all is the
Government&#146;s self-monitoring formula, which states that they
will</div>
<a name="10031888000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;measure success
through the delivery of specific pieces of work and our performance in
international anti-corruption surveys and corporate
studies&#148;.</div>
<a name="10031888000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most surprising of all
is the fact that the entire piece of work has been condensed into just
nine pages.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="10031888000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, I
note that, in paragraph 1.7, the Government commit to reviewing the
strategy set out in the document in two year&#146;s time, stating
that they will</div>
<a name="10031888000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;review this
strategy in 2012 in the light of progress updates to
Parliament&#148;.</div><a name="10031888000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
therefore do not believe that we are seeking a huge concession from the
Government&#151;a reduction from a two-year review to an annual
review, and codification in statute that the guidance will be
produced.</div><a name="10031888000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000524"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Despite the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, I
think that the proposal is quite a good idea, and I shall briefly
explain the two reasons why. First, I am afraid that our
country&#146;s international reputation for anti-corruption and
anti-bribery efforts has suffered because of the events of the past few
years, especially the calling off of the SFO&#146;s Saudi Arabian
investigation. We need to do more than just pass the Bill, so it would
be a good idea to have an annual report so that minds could be focused
on the importance of anti-corruption into the future.</div>
<a name="10031888000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
reason relates to money. It is not enough to improve the law, although
the Bill will be a vast improvement in the law, because we must have
the necessary enforcement effort to bring that into reality. The
Solicitor-General seemed to concede during the most recent Question
Time that the SFO had received no specific funding for its
anti-corruption work for more than a year. The SFO seems to be
transferring funding internally from its anti-fraud work to its
anti-corruption work, which is not satisfactory. The Solicitor-General
said that specific funding could be provided for big cases, but that is
an unsatisfactory way of proceeding. If funding depends on going back
to the Government for grants for specific cases, it puts a political
block on the prosecution of particular big cases, which is not an
entirely proper way for the system to run. As the hon. Member for
Huntingdon said, one function of an annual report would be to examine
whether the resources devoted were adequate, and I think that that is a
question that we all must ask.</div>
<a name="10031888000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10031888000525"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I feel a sense of elation, as for
the first time in the Committee&#146;s proceedings we have moved away
from a subject that is the prerogative of lawyers to one that is the
prerogative of management consultants&#151;at last I can come into my
own.</div><a name="10031888000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause deals with the important point of the continuing monitoring
of the Bill. This is something that we need to sort out&#151;it would
be helpful to hear the Minister&#146;s comments&#151;because one
can monitor in the future only if one has set out at the beginning a
clear benchmark to measure the success of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10031888000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 244
of the Joint Committee&#146;s report set out the following
concern:</div>
<a name="10031888000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the Government's lack of emphasis on increasing the prosecution rate
for bribery, it is difficult for us to assess what success would look
like.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee went on to look at the need for a comprehensive set of
performance indicators. I am not sure that I like that idea because it
suggests a very bureaucratic
approach.</div><a name="10031888000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are really two choices. One indicator that is immediately measurable is
the number of cases brought each year, but the Government do not favour
that, as we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>discussed at length earlier. The other, which my hon. Friend the Member
for Huntingdon raised, is culture change. The difficulty with measuring
culture change, however, is that it falls into measuring either outcome
or process. A general criticism of the Government over the past 13
years is that measuring process has come ahead of measuring outcomes.
It is difficult to see how the outcomes can be measured in this case.
Process can be measured easily, such as by monitoring how many leaflets
a company has given its employees to highlight the concerns raised in
the Bill and to outline what employees have to do to comply. That is
important, but it tells us nothing about the outcome we are seeking to
measure. The proxy of a questionnaire about companies&#146; and
business people&#146;s activities and approaches has little ability
to measure outcomes and would be very partial. That highlights the
difficulty the Government will face when deciding what outcomes they
will measure and monitor over subsequent years to draw contrasts and
make
comparisons.</div><a name="10031888000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is crucial that we have such measuring and monitoring. As with all such
things, I think Parliament should be given oversight of how the
strategy is working. It is important to monitor both sides of the cost
element: the cost to the Government of implementation and the cost to
businesses of complying. That tangible element could be introduced as a
parameter for the Bill. I urge the Under-Secretary to say more about
the likely performance indicators and the way in which she will
identify outcomes that can be measured over a series of
years.</div><a name="10031888000419"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000526"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I want to ask a couple of questions on how the
Government intend to fund the strategy objectives and the enforcement
of the new law, and on what the best way of monitoring that might
be.</div><a name="10031888000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the City of London police will play an important role
in looking at overseas bribery. It is recognised as being expert in
financial fraud&#151;stopping it, that is. That is partly because the
City of London has so many financial institutions and so many people
working in them. I find it surprising that the Department for
International Development has been funding its work on overseas
bribery. I am not sure how long that funding is for and would be
grateful if the Under-Secretary told us. The City police force seems to
work closely with the Serious Fraud Office, the major prosecutor for
large frauds. Apparently, 17 cases are currently being dealt with. A
lot of work has been done by the City police, Transparency
International and the Government on the proposed
guidance.</div><a name="10031888000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
how we monitor what happens beyond the first year, it would be helpful
if the Under-Secretary told us whether we will rely on DFID to fund the
investigations and, if so, why. Is the City force, acting with the SFO,
seen as the main pipeline for prosecutions? One reason for that
question is that some substantial fraud cases have ended up with rather
surprising prosecutors. The classic example is the Jubilee line case,
which ended up being prosecuted by British Transport police. It would
be worrying if DFID funded an investigation by an authority other than
the City of London police&#151;perhaps the British Transport police
looking at a bribery aspect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>of an overseas transport contract&#151;and the expertise of the SFO
was not engaged. What assurances can she give us that a nice, robust
package is being put together for the implementation of this important
Bill and how is it to be
monitored?</div><a name="10031888000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000527"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> There is a good case for an annual report, because
the whole thrust of the Bill is to increase public awareness of the
problem of ensuring best corporate governance and high standards. We
have discussed the OECD, the European Community and various third-world
countries a great deal, and we ought to be publishing a report so that
not only Parliament but those abroad can measure and monitor our
contribution in this
field.</div><a name="10031888000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that it will not be easy and that there are problems. One of
the Under-Secretary&#146;s strongest arguments was that deterrence
has to be an important part of the Bill. Deterrence is difficult to
measure, although we can measure prosecution&#151;I might disagree
with my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon here&#151;so if
prosecutions go up, the deterrence and the Bill are not working. There
are arguments both
ways.</div><a name="10031888000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
annual report would be useful, because we are all busy people in
Parliament and often focus on what is in front of us. An annual report
would build more pressure for debates in Westminster Hall and questions
on the Floor of the House, and allow hon. Members to track progress.
The suggestion is a good and reasonable one. A report would be more
valued as the years pass and we get better at measuring
progress.</div><a name="10031888000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000528"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> As the Committee is aware, the Bill does not create
a scheme of regulatory rules with which individuals and businesses need
to comply. The suggestion from the Opposition appears to be that we
should have regulatory rules, with compliance monitoring of business.
The business community will read the Opposition&#146;s views
carefully and will bear in mind the additional burdens that it might
need to look at if we were ever, unfortunately, to have a Conservative
Government.</div><a name="10031888000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000529"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The Under-Secretary might have that imposed on her
quicker than she would
like.</div><a name="10031888000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
suggestion was that we should know who will investigate such crimes and
who will prosecute, that we should be reassured about the proper
funding and that the situation be looked at annually. Why would that
impose any burden at all on
businesses?</div><a name="10031888000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000530"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Because the hon. Member for Huntingdon sought to
suggest earlier that businesses should be in compliance with the
legislation, with some monitoring of their compliance. That is what I
understood him to say. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Perhaps he
wishes to set the record
straight.</div><a name="10031888000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000531"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I explained the Government&#146;s current
thinking as envisaged in their own report, and said that it should be
used in considering what we do in the future. I did not in any way
intend to imply that it should be used as a way of increasing
regulation on business. That is not the intention at all; rather, this
is a way of monitoring the Government&#146;s approach to an
anti-fraud and anti-corruption policy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="10031888000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000532"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The Committee should be aware that the Government
have an anti-bribery champion in the form of my right hon. Friend the
Justice Secretary, who launched the foreign bribery strategy on 19
January. The overarching aim of that strategy is to reduce the
involvement of UK nationals and companies in foreign bribery and the
harm that that
causes.</div><a name="10031888000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strategy sets out four strategic objectives: strengthening the law,
supporting ethical business, enforcing the law, and international
capacity building. The strategy builds on the Government&#146;s
earlier anti-corruption action plans, which were formulated in response
to calls for more joined-up work across government to deliver the
commitments from the 2005 Gleneagles G8 summit and the Commission for
Africa. The strategy also complements existing demand-side strategies
on anti-money laundering, the repatriation of looted assets and support
for good governance. According to the World Bank, it has put the UK at
the forefront of efforts to recover the proceeds of international
corruption.</div><a name="10031888000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000533"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> If the Government have a strategy very much along
the lines described by hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, what on
earth is the objection to an annual report to assess how it is
doing?</div><a name="10031888000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000534"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make some
progress, I shall explain. The foreign bribery strategy is based on the
solid foundation of effective co-operation over a number of years
between more than 20 Government Departments, agencies and law
enforcement bodies. It is also being developed through a series of
soundings with stakeholders, including round-table meetings of leading
UK companies, civil society representatives and enforcement
authorities. The strategy sets out a plan for addressing and managing
the challenge of foreign bribery, establishing a clear legal regulatory
and policy framework. It recognises that we cannot stand still, and
that additional work is required to keep pace with the evolving
challenges. In addition to the reform of the law via the Bribery Bill,
the strategy sets out a number of measures: for example, to support
ethical UK businesses through additional training for staff in overseas
missions, and reducing demands for bribes by supporting local law
enforcement and good
governance.</div><a name="10031888000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will measure success by reference to specific objectives set out in the
strategy, such as the provision of online training for staff in
overseas missions, increased inter-agency co-ordination on overseas
capacity building and technical assistance, and the bringing into force
of the Bill. We will also look at the UK&#146;s performance in
international anti-corruption surveys such as Transparency
International&#146;s corruption perceptions and bribe-payers indices,
and in the light of the next OECD evaluation of the
UK.</div><a name="10031888000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000535"></a>John
Howell:</b> I am sure the Under-Secretary is not saying this,
but perhaps she will confirm that she will not now measure success by
the number of meetings that Ministers and officials have, and the
number of training courses they go on. If she relies on businesses
filling out surveys, she will find that the compliance costs of that
are greater than any of the other compliance costs likely to be imposed
on businesses by the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div><a name="10031888000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000536"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> I was simply suggesting that there is a whole range
of ways in which we will measure the success of the foreign bribery
strategy that I and my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary are
championing.</div><a name="10031888000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members will note that this is a &#147;foreign&#148; bribery
strategy. That does not mean we are complacent about the maintenance of
high ethical standards in public life and business transactions in the
UK. We are, of course, intent on ensuring full awareness of the
domestic dimension of the new criminal law as part of the Bill&#146;s
implementation. In addition, the Committee knows that the Government
have been active in the public sphere, passing, for example, the
Parliamentary Standards Act 2009, which has been augmented by
provisions in the current Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill.
That Bill will implement those recommendations of the report on
MPs&#146; expenses by the Committee on Standards in Public Life that
require primary legislation, and will also put the civil service code
on a statutory footing. Those were some of the issues raised by
Transparency
International.</div><a name="10031888000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the proposed new clause, my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary
made it clear when the foreign bribery strategy was launched that we
would provide annual progress updates to Parliament, and review the
strategy in 2012. We do not believe that anything substantive would be
gained by turning that commitment into a statutory requirement, as
proposed in requirements (a) and (b) of the new clause. The Government
already intend to report to Parliament on progress towards achieving
the key anti-bribery measures set out in the strategy, as well as on
the strategy&#146;s future
development.</div><a name="10031888000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will come on shortly to discuss the hon. Member for Huntingdon&#146;s
new clause on advisory services, but proposed new clause 1 also
provides for the Government&#146;s annual report to include details
on the advisory services available to commercial organisations, and the
fees to be paid. We have made it clear, as has the Joint Committee on
the Bill, that we are not persuaded of the case for an advisory service
to advise commercial organisations on the adequacy of particular
measures to combat bribery. We take the view that there are fundamental
problems with a Department seeking to provide advice of that sort to a
commercial organisation. We do not, therefore, support requirements (c)
and (d) of the proposed new clause, which would, in effect, bring such
a service into
existence.</div><a name="10031888000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point raised about funding for the City of London police and
enforcement issues, the Government established a dedicated
investigatory capacity in the City of London&#146;s overseas
anti-corruption unit in 2006, which they expanded through additional
funding in 2008 and new intelligence assessment work in 2009. The SFO
is devoting an increasing amount of its resources to international
commercial corruption, and about one third of its resources is now
devoted to overseas corruption allegations involving up to 100
investigators. In addition, the MOD police have a role investigating
overseas corruption in MOD defence
contracts.</div><a name="10031888000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Enforcing
the law on foreign bribery is of course a strategic objective in the UK
foreign bribery strategy. Both DFID and the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills provide funding for the overseas anti-corruption
unit. The arrangements, which are part of the National Fraud
Intelligence Bureau, support 12 investigators and an overseas
corruption intelligence team of five
people.</div>

pm</div><a name="10031888000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000537"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> It is welcome that the City of London police and
the MOD police will be the lead enforcement agencies. Will they be the
only ones or is it possible that other police or enforcement agencies
will end up becoming involved without having the specialist knowledge?
We want such work carried out properly by people who have been trained
properly.</div><a name="10031888000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000538"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Without doubt, the City of London police, the
Serious Fraud Office and, when appropriate, the MOD are the authorities
that have the support, resources and expertise available within their
organisations to deal with such complaints and concerns. We expect
those authorities to undertake the work. The Crown Prosecution Service
will prosecute cases potentially when police forces in England and
Wales bring such matters to its attention. On that basis, I encourage
the hon. Member for Huntingdon to withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="10031888000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000539"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> While listening to the Under-Secretary, I
thought, &#147;That&#146;s all right then.&#148; It all seemed so
perfect. But is it? Both my hon. Friends the Members for Henley and for
North-East Hertfordshire made some important points to explain how the
provision of such a report would help best practice, enforcement and
the monitoring of the Government&#146;s anti-corruption strategy.
Many good things would come from it. My hon. Friend the Member for
Poole identified the fact that it would be a good format for
parliamentary engagement in anti-corruption strategy, which is perhaps
too much the preserve of Ministers under the Government&#146;s
current
format.</div><a name="10031888000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
reading of what the Under-Secretary said is that the monitoring of
anti-corruption is essentially something that should be kept within the
Department, with a rather vague nine-page report published every two
years. She presented a picture of well-connected Government action with
all Departments and directors moving smoothly in line with a strategy
that was well co-ordinated. Wearing my shadow Solicitor-General hat, I
must say that that is a different picture from what we are picking up
on the
ground.</div><a name="10031888000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually,
we have a serious problem at the moment with the need to have a
coherent policy of deciding who leads on particular types of
prosecutions and to what extent prosecuting agencies should be unified.
Admittedly, it is a difficult issue, but it has been left for too long
and will need to be a priority of an incoming Conservative Government.
It is of concern to us, and a good start would be a statutory annual
report, which is why I shall press the Committee to a
Division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000556"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> These new clauses are tabled in an attempt to
plug some of the gaps that we feel have come out of debates on the
Bill. We have already touched on the difficulty businesses face in
complying with the clauses relating to corporate responsibility and
adequate procedures, the problems of ongoing compliance monitoring and
the need for a system that changes current attitudes and in so doing
encourages companies to come forward and report
corruption.</div><a name="10031888000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Plans
to update and rework this patchwork of antiquated laws have been mooted
since the mid 1970s with the Salmon Commission reporting in 1976. The
Nolan Committee followed in 1995 and ushered in an era characterised by
international pressure to reform and rationalise the UK&#146;s
corruption laws. International obligations arising from agreements with
the OECD, the EU and the UN have increased pressure on the UK to
develop common standards at an international level for its
anti-corruption
measures.</div><a name="10031888000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over
recent years the UK, as has been mentioned by many hon. Members, has
seen its international reputation on matters of bribery diminished as a
consequence of criticism of the robustness of our domestic procedures
and processes on corruption, not to mention the publicity generated by
the crimes of some companies. British business has traditionally been a
bastion of fairness and propriety in its dealings overseas.</div>
<a name="10031888000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
required changes to the law in practice it is also important to
recognise the good practice in British business and the desire of most
British business men to do the right thing. However, we need to
recognise that the OECD in particular has been forthright in its
criticism of the UK stating in October 2008 that it was</div>
<a name="10031888000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disappointed
and seriously concerned about the UK&#146;s continued failure to
address deficiencies in its laws on bribery&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="10031888000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to make some comparisons with other jurisdictions on this specific
point. One aspect that I want to discuss is how some other
jurisdictions have been faster on the uptake when it has come to
amending their bribery laws. One facet of those laws has been the
provisions of independent bodies to assist bodies on matters pertaining
to bribery laws. Hong Kong, for instance, has the Independent
Commission Against Corruption and the Corruption Prevention
Department&#146;s advisory services group, which was created in
1986.</div>
<a name="10031888000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since its
inception, the group has advised some 3,000 private companies. It
provides tailor-made corruption prevention advice on systems or
internal control. It also assists companies in drawing up staff codes
of conduct and in particular a policy on solicitation and acceptance of
advantages, a policy on acceptance of entertainment, guidelines on
declarations of conflicts of interests and guidelines on handling
confidential information. Any company can go along to the advisory
services group and seek its free advice on the adequacy of the systems
and procedures that it has drawn up.</div>
<a name="10031888000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">This advisory
services group also formulates and distributes codes of industry best
practice and organises talks and seminars to promote them. Lord Thomas
in the other place was a vociferous exponent of the ICAC quoting two
impressive sources. The first was the chairman of the Hong Kong
Institute of Directors, Mr Herbert Hui, who said:</div>
<a name="10031888000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Directors
are entrusted with the execution of corporate governance standards
within each corporation, listed company, SME or NGO. The Advisory
Services Group of the Corruption Prevention Department assists
corporations to enhance corporate governance standards from a
corruption prevention point of view. We highly recommend directors of
corporations to make use of the Group's free and professional
consultancy
services&#148;.</div><a name="10031888000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
director and chief executive of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, Mr
Philip Chen,
said:</div><a name="10031888000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
its establishment in 1985, the Advisory Services Group of the
Corruption Prevention Department has been conscientiously assisting
private sector companies in enhancing system controls and promoting to
staff the importance of corruption prevention. In the past, we had
sought advice from the Group on various parts of our operation. I
highly value the Group's work and contributions to the
community&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC62.]</div><a name="10031888000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
Lord Mackay and the Earl of Onslow joined Lord Thomas in supporting the
provision for an advisory
service.</div><a name="10031888000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the United States, the US Attorney-General is required under the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 to provide an advisory service whose
remit is to respond to requests about whether a proposed action will be
lawful. In the US, there is a rebuttable presumption that acting in
accordance with the advice of the service will mean that no offence has
been
committed.</div><a name="10031888000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have heard a number of mixed views on the issue of an advisory service
for the UK. On the whole, business was very much in favour of having
such a service, no doubt deriving from its experience of the operations
of the Takeover Panel and the Competition Commission, which provide a
similar service in other corporate spheres. For instance, Philip
Bramwell of BAE Systems said of an advisory
service:</div><a name="10031888000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is of immense value to companies looking for certainty about how
conduct would be treated and about the efficacy of their proposed
approach to compliance. It is especially useful around mergers and
acquisitions and new businesses that may have an uncertain
history.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div><a name="10031888000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000557"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> An important point is that if someone in the middle
of a corporate structure was worried about what their company was
doing, they could use an independent advisory service to persuade their
senior management that there was a problem. I think that one of the
greatest uses of an outside advisory service would be to change
corporate
culture.</div><a name="10031888000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000558"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend gives a practical application of
how the provision would be of benefit to corporate Britain. In its
brief on the Bill, the International Chamber of Commerce stated that it
was vital that there should be a formal reference and clearance
procedure, operated with express Government sanction equivalent to that
offered by the US Department of Justice. It thought that mere informal
and private guidance by the SFO or any other prosecuting authorities
would be insufficient. A formal procedure to refer doubtful cases to a
prosecuting authority would place the UK on an equal footing with the
US.</div><a name="10031888000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000559"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> When they read the Government&#146;s guidance
after it is finally published, small and medium-sized enterprises might
wonder whether they come under the light-touch regulation category or
whether they will be slightly further up the scale in terms of
measures. Would not another advantage of the provision be that they
would be able to check that out by talking it through with
somebody?</div><a name="10031888000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000560"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. Smaller
companies that move up the scale and start trading in developing
countries will have to take a big leap of faith and look for advice.
Huge costs are often involved in small companies doing their first
deal, so an advisory service could be very helpful to them. The ICC
differentiates between informal and formal advice, but I will return to
that topic
later.</div><a name="10031888000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ICC highlighted the ancillary benefits that such a service would bring.
It stated that the inevitable preliminary discussions that could lead
to an application for advice would enhance the dialogue between
companies and the authorities, increase efficiency and usefully provide
for an accessible body of jurisprudence. As the ICC notes, such a
system operates successfully in the US, where the provision of clear
and responsive rulings enables US businesses to compete in
international markets. Is that not the exact environment that we wish
to create for British
business?</div><a name="10031888000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor
Horder expressed support for the idea in his evidence to the Joint
Committee,
saying:</div><a name="10031888000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
I could start from a slightly different view, were we to have in this
country an anti-bribery body, a commission, a semi-official body of
some sort, charged with giving this kind of advice I could well see as
being appropriate...Were we to have somebody charged with giving
advice of this kind I think that would be very much of benefit both
publicly and to companies and would give them
reassurance.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
distinction must be drawn out at this stage. The new clause provides
for a service that is focused on compliance procedures and is aimed at
minimising the risk of corruption, rather than the risk of prosecution
arising from a particular action. One thinks of the takeover panels
&#147;no names&#148; advisory service, of which I have a great deal
of first-hand experience and which can prove exceptionally useful to
all parties concerned in commercial
transactions.</div>

pm</div><a name="10031888000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept that the US system is inherently different from the UK&#146;s
and that, as noted in the Joint Committee report, there are concerns
about the independence of prosecutors. With the new clauses, we are
calling for more thought to be given to the provision of a British
version of the US system that is sympathetic to the aims of the Bill
and the intricacies of the UK&#146;s justice system. Much has been
said about the need to change corporate culture and the general
attitude to bribery. Much has also been said about the inherent problem
of prosecuting crimes of corruption because of the lack of sufficient
evidence to bring a case. Lord Thomas of Gresford made that point
concisely in the other place when dealing with Lord
Tunnicliffe&#146;s response on the Government&#146;s position,
which relies heavily on the prosecutorial concerns put forward by the
Director of Public Prosecutions and the Serious Fraud Office. Lord
Thomas
said:</div><a name="10031888000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
want the Government to take a different view, and to step back and look
again at the benefits that the Joint Committee did not have time to
investigate. I want them to consider whether this is an idea that they
should take up and provide the sort of advice to companies that they
clearly want.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>7
January 2010; Vol. 716, c.
GC65.]</div><a name="10031888000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see
the advisory service as an amalgamation of all the aims of the Bill and
a response to all the inherent difficulties that we have outlined in
the Committee. Such an organisation could monitor compliance, ensure
adherence, guide businesses through the potential minefield of offences
and encourage early disclosure of suspect practices.</div>
<a name="10031888000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">To critics
such as Professor Wells, who thought that the service would be an
unnecessary public expense, I point to the possibility of fee charging,
which is suggested in new clause 3. We do not necessarily want that,
but it should be considered as an alternative if the only argument is
that the service is a good idea but will cost too much money. If the
companies had the opportunity to pay for advice, perhaps that would be
better than them not having advice at
all.</div><a name="10031888000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000561"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it might, in fact,
be better even than that from taxpayers&#146; point of view? If
companies had to pay for the advice that they received and, as a result
of receiving the advice, decided not to take a course of action that
might otherwise have led to a prosecution, the taxpayer would be saved
the expense of that prosecution into the
bargain.</div><a name="10031888000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000562"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point about the
net cost implication, rather than just immediate cost. If business
wants the service and the comfort of knowing that they are complying
with legislation, perhaps they should have the right to pay. If the
appropriate balance could be struck, the fee could be set at a level
that ensured that companies would not abuse the service as a clearance
system for every action, however small, and that the service would be
self-sustaining in the long run.</div>
<a name="10031888000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
behind our proposals is to ensure that a company can rely on any advice
from the advisory service as an evidential matter in a trial. The
burden of proof will be on a company to say that it has adequate
procedures. When proceedings were brought, if a company had gone to
such a service and obtained advice, and was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>relying on the advice that it received, it would be quickly apparent
whether any offence had been committed. If a company could say in a
letter to the prosecuting authority, &#147;We asked for advice; we
got it and we followed it,&#148; I imagine, save in the most
exceptional cases, that that would prevent a prosecution.</div>
<a name="10031888000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would seem
that the Government, or rather Ministers in the other place, overlooked
what already exists in the UK to advise business. During various
debates in the other place, they said that this was not our way of
doing things. However, I refer the Under-Secretary to the SFO guidance
entitled &#147;Approach of the SFO to dealing with overseas
corruption&#148;, which came out only a few months ago. I am sure
that she has read it&#151;it is a good read. It is not only helpful,
but important to the debate, because it takes a slightly different
approach&#151;an informal one rather than a formal one&#151;and
contains the exact same idea that a company should have someone whom it
can
approach.</div><a name="10031888000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance
states:</div><a name="10031888000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
number of corporates and professional advisers have told us that it
would be very helpful to them if we were able to offer an opinion
procedure concerning future enforcement activity along the lines
offered by the US Department of Justice. We are sympathetic to
this.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
document came out well before the debates in the other place. However,
it was not mentioned there, which was a staggering omission. It
continues:</div><a name="10031888000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
circumstances in which this procedure will be appropriate will need to
be discussed but we are ready to offer assistance in one type of case
which corporates have mentioned to us. This is where a group (A) is
proposing to take over another group (B) and, during due diligence,
discovers overseas corruption issues in (B). (A) is committed to a
modern ethical corporate culture and, if the transaction goes ahead,
would take the necessary remedial action in respect of what has
happened. (A) wishes to know what our approach would
be.</div><a name="10031888000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">We
appreciate the need for help in the circumstances and will give (A)
assurances about our action. These assurances could be that no action
will take place provided that (A) takes the remedial action it has told
us that it will take if the takeover goes ahead. Alternatively, if we
find that the corruption is long lasting and systemic, we might say
that we would consider a criminal investigation whether at the
corporate or individual
level.</div><a name="10031888000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">We
appreciate that these issues are often likely to be very confidential
and price sensitive. We would anticipate that professional advisers
would want to discuss a possible approach with the SFO before it was
actually
made.</div><a name="10031888000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">Corporates
have also asked for guidance on how we would apply the offence in the
Bribery Bill of negligently failing to prevent bribery. We welcome the
opportunity to discuss our approach with corporates. We can discuss our
general approach, which is to focus very much on changes of behaviour
so far as possible in order to promote a modern corporate culture. Our
emphasis is on helping corporates to develop this culture and to use
enforcement action only where this is necessary and
proportionate.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is helpful, and I am pleased to be able to put it on record. The
document
continues:</div><a name="10031888000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
any discussions about procedures within the corporate we shall be
looking to find evidence of adequate procedures to assess how
successful the corporate has been in mitigating risk. We shall also be
looking closely at the culture within the corporate to see how well the
processes really reflect what is happening in the corporate. For
example, we shall look for the
following.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000291"></a>

<a name="10031888000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether there

the effect of any remedial

is the end of the quotation. I make no apologies for putting it on the
record, because it is important. However, it is unofficial, and is not
on the face of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10031888000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000567"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> It would be helpful to know whether the Ministry of
Justice and the Home Office have had discussions about the matter. I
think the SFO is guided by the Home Office, or possibly the
Attorney-General, whereas the Ministry of Justice looks at policy.
Perhaps there simply has not been an opportunity to work it all
out.</div><a name="10031888000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000568"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That might well be the case. I was going to ask
the Under-Secretary to put on record her Department&#146;s approach
on the SFO guidance, which it has not discussed to date. However, that
is the approach of only one of the prosecuting authorities, and others
might have their own approaches.</div>
<a name="10031888000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could ask
why the SFO is shooting off on its own, without going through the
Government or other prosecuting authorities, but I will certainly not
do that because that approach is exactly the type of proactive, helpful
and forward-thinking initiative that we want from our prosecutors, and
I have personally congratulated the SFO director on it. How does that
fit with the narrow-minded approach on advice that, so far as we have
heard, the Government have taken? They refuse to deal with any aspect
of advice&#151;formal, as proposed in our new clause, or informal, as
the prosecuting authorities quite sensibly seem to be putting in place.
Those are serious issues, so I look forward to the
Under-Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="10031888000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000569"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My noble Friend Lord Thomas of Gresford made some
fascinating remarks in the other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>place about the Hong Kong system during an interesting debate that also
covered the US. There is something there to be investigated and thought
about carefully.</div>
<a name="10031888000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">What came out
of the debate in the other place was that there were also disadvantages
in other systems, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon was good enough to
mention. One is the difference in attitude towards the independence of
prosecutors here and elsewhere. There are problems with prosecutors
being seen to commit themselves in advance, with legal consequences
that can be complicated and difficult.</div>
<a name="10031888000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for cost,
I am not sure that simply charging a fee is a way round the problem.
The cost has to lie somewhere, as such a system is expensive to set up.
In addition, the advisory service in Hong Kong is part of a very
different system of dealing with corruption, which includes ferocious
procedural rules about what will happen to people who fall foul of the
system. I suspect that the deterrent effect of those rules explains
some of the success in Hong Kong.</div>
<a name="10031888000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view is
that new clause 2 is very good apart from its use of the word
&#147;shall&#148;. It would make a lot more sense if that word were
&#147;may&#148;. That would mean that a service could be put in
place if the relevant Government Department chose to go down that route
because, after further study, it was decided on balance that that was
the right thing to do. There is a lot more work to do, however,
especially on the detail of how the system would work procedurally and
constitutionally, and not just on
cost.</div><a name="10031888000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000570"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> This is a slightly mischievous way to look at
things, but the new clause does not say how helpful the response shall
be. One could argue that a varying range of responses might be offered,
and some might be more helpful for the businesses concerned than
others, depending on how freely the prosecutors felt able to answer
them.</div><a name="10031888000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000571"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That interesting interpretation of the word
&#147;service&#148; might not be very helpful in such
circumstances.</div><a name="10031888000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the details can be worked out in a way that fits into our system, it
might be worth empowering the Government to do such a thing, but I do
not think that can be achieved simply with different versions of
particular guidance or advice. The problems are procedural and legal,
and they also relate to cost, and they will require detailed work.
Given the particular wording of new clause 2, I do not think that I
could support it, but I would support further work in this
area.</div><a name="10031888000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="10031888000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000572"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I have one or two things that I want to say in
support of the new clauses, which are worth while and worth adding to
the Bill. The first is the general point that this is an important area
of new law. We are breaking new ground, as we have said, and it is
reasonable to expect some assistance for those companies that will be
affected. I will not revisit our earlier argument ant guidance but, to
some extent, it overlaps with this
issue.</div><a name="10031888000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments that the Under-Secretary made on guidance were that the
Government do not wish to catch companies out and do not intend to
increase the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>number of prosecutions. They wish to send out the right messages and
ensure that companies avoid bribery so that cases do not reach the
prosecution stage, which is entirely the right approach. The guidance
is there to offer businesses what assistance the Government can to
understand what they should, and should not, do and avoid the
possibility of prosecution.</div>
<a name="10031888000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary made the perfectly reasonable point that, in guidance,
we cannot anticipate every conceivable circumstance and outline every
conceivable case. That is reasonable, but the answer is not necessarily
to fall back, as we know, on prosecutorial discretion without other
assistance. However, if we cannot assume that we know the circumstances
of every conceivable case, the answer might be to ask, why not
supplement the guidance with the offer of specific assistance? A
company could go to the advisory service and say, &#147;Please assist
in the specific circumstances that I face and explain what I should do
in these circumstances&#148;. We recognise that the guidance cannot
cover every eventuality, so we should supplement it with specific
assistance when it is requested. There is therefore a good case for
offering clarity to those likely to be affected by the legislation,
partly with guidance and partly by supplementing that guidance with
specific advice on the facts of the case.</div>
<a name="10031888000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point I
made to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon in an intervention is
also relevant. Although I accept the point made by the hon. Member for
Cambridge that there will inevitably be a cost in setting up any such
advisory agency, over time that will be offset by the avoidance of
prosecutions, I hope, in a great many cases. Businesses could say,
&#147;I do not understand what I should do and whether I will lay
myself open prosecution if I take a particular course of action, so I
will seek advice and, having taken that advice, avoid that
prosecution.&#148; In such circumstances, the taxpayer will make a
significant saving through the prosecution not occurring in the first
place, and the basic running costs of the advisory agency will be
covered by the fee set out in new clause 3.</div>
<a name="10031888000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only
would the service be financially neutral, but it would be potentially
advantageous, certainly in the longer term. In the end, this is a
question of fulfilling the objective that the Government have set out
for the legislation, which is not necessarily to prosecute more people
but to ensure that those involved in businesses that may come into
contact with bribery of various kinds understand what they have to do,
can get the information they need to take the right course of action
and, therefore, avoid being prosecuted. The clarity that the advisory
service could offer will assist in that objective.</div>
<a name="10031888000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000573"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> Advisory services are always extremely useful. The
Government had a scheme to help people with mortgage difficulties. It
was not successful in terms of the number of people who were helped
but, when I talked to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, I realised that
it was successful in that it put people in touch with their mortgage
lender because they got help from them after they asked about the
scheme.</div><a name="10031888000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
people who are going to do business abroad contact their chamber of
commerce and the various exporting organisations, and are given a
checklist or a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>list of organisations that can help on a range of things to do with
credit, banking and so on. An advisory organisation from which they
would get some advice about the pitfalls of bribery and about the
culture in certain areas would be very useful, simply because it would
be on the checklist of organisations that a firm or partnership would
want to talk to before they went abroad. Problems often occur when
people do not understand the culture of a country and they find that
they are manoeuvred into a situation that they did not
expect.</div><a name="10031888000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the point of the Bill is deterrence, to ensure that people do not go
down a particular route, an advisory service would be very useful for
the Government. If there were several hundred companies going to a
particular part of the world to sell their products, and they were all
asking questions about certain practices or concerns, that would be an
important pointer for that organisation to feed intelligence back to
the prosecuting agencies about particular things that they ought to be
very much aware of. Indeed, they would get a lot of people phoning and
raising concerns that would be helpful in advising companies and also
the Government and agencies. I think that that would be
useful.</div><a name="10031888000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure about charging for advice. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon pointed out, there will be substantial savings if companies
are kept on the straight and narrow and not pulled into the ambit of
legal problems. Moreover, the success of some advice services does not
come in response to formal queries in which, as he pointed out, someone
says, &#147;I&#146;m Mr. Smith from Warwick, Leamington
Spa or wherever and I have a particular problem.&#148; It arises when
people phone up without saying who they are, and raise a concern at the
first point of contact. Someone can phone an organisation such as ACAS
and not have to say who they are; they can ask a general question about
employment and it will provide guidance. If someone wants more specific
advice, they have to say who they are, which is a good thing.</div>
<a name="10031888000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to get
back to the point I made in an intervention on my hon. Friend. If
someone who is a cog in a business machine is worried about their job,
their pension, their future, and they are being pressured or bullied to
pursue a particular course of action by a manager, the fact that they
can go to an independent advisory service to ask for advice, then
perhaps pray in aid that advice within their corporate structure, is
useful. It may be a useful tool for that individual to change the
culture of the company or to be able to say to their managers,
&#147;I&#146;ve got advice; it is contrary to what we are being
told and I am very worried about it.&#148; My hon. Friend made a good
point, which deserves serious consideration by the
Government.</div>
<a name="10031888000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000574"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I have just two or three points to make. First, I
welcome self-cleansing, as I mentioned earlier. It is a good thing that
the SFO is the sort of guidance that my hon. Friend read out. Its offer
of guidance is welcome and should be encouraged. Secondly, we must look
at the position of small and medium-sized enterprises and the problem
of defining them. If we look at a range of employment laws&#151;the
Government&#146;s gender pay audits apply where a business has 250
employees or more; there are other provisions where it is 50&#151;it
is not entirely clear what an SME is. The guidance that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>Government will produce for clause 9 needs to consider that. The draft
that has been produced says that further work is required, but I hope
that it will be possible to provide guidance for individuals and
individual companies so that they can simply ring up and get an answer
or informal
advice.</div><a name="10031888000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be a great pity if SMEs find that there is not enough information
in the written guidance and have to go to the type of agencies that my
hon. Friend the Member for Poole mentioned, which give advice about
bribery. However, there is always a danger with consultants and bodies
of that type that people end up getting advice that is very cautious
and requires a small business to do far more than is really necessary.
We have seen that in the disability field on adaptations. Consultants
suggest that walls be knocked down and great ramps put in, when in fact
a small adaptation would be adequate. We have seen it happen with
health and safety. It is important for small businesses that they have
light-touch regulation and that they can discuss, with a proper
Government source, exactly what it means so that they have an
authoritative place to
go.</div><a name="10031888000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the position of the three directors, the SFO is happy to give
advice, but is there a problem for the DPP and the director of Revenue
and Customs Prosecution? Perhaps there is, because there are different
cultures within the organisations. For example, HM Revenue and Customs
has a different approach from that of the DPP in how it negotiates with
taxpayers. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can give us an idea of whether
there is a problem between the three directors. If not, why not just
say that the Serious Fraud Office will be the department that gives the
advice? We would then have a willing department that knows what it is
doing offering the advice. The others can say that it is the lead, just
as it is in the investigation of the offences; in a way, problem
solved. Whichever organisation is the advisory body, is its role to be
involved in trade missions and say, along with the Under-Secretary and
businesses, &#147;This is what we do in respect of
anti-bribery&#148;?</div><a name="10031888000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000575"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon would augment the generic guidance that we intend to provide
under clause 9 with an advisory service that would provide bespoke
advice to individual commercial organisations on a fee-paying basis.
However, the nature of the proposed guidance is fundamentally different
from that envisaged under clause 9, which will cover
procedures that commercial organisations can put in place to prevent
bribery. The advisory service envisaged by new clause 2 would enable
commercial organisations to seek an official view on the adequacy of
their procedures for the purposes of clause
7(2).</div><a name="10031888000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an important and, indeed, fundamental difference between the two
approaches. It is one thing for the Government to issue generic
guidance about procedures that may be adopted to prevent bribery, but
it is quite another to offer advice in individual cases on whether the
procedures put in place are adequate. It is for the courts&#151;not a
Department&#151;in the context of individual criminal proceedings to
determine whether any given procedures are adequate for the purposes of
clause
7(2).</div><a name="10031888000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon made extensive reference to the SFO
guidance, but that advice is limited to the narrow situation described
in the guidance. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>reality, it is similar to the self-referral mechanisms that I mentioned
earlier&#151;it does not amount to a general advisory service. The
SFO director made it clear in his evidence to the Joint Committee that
a wider advisory service on a corporate offence would be unmanageable,
because corporate organisations would want to obtain clearance for each
transaction that took place about which they were worried to prevent
further action. That would be
unmanageable.</div><a name="10031888000323"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000576"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My understanding&#151;the hon. Lady might want
to put me right&#151;is that, in the US, which has the system without
a fee, the number of referrals is limited. I think that it is fewer
than 10 a year, so she is not correct that, just because we do not have
to pay, there will be a lot of
referrals.</div><a name="10031888000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000577"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that the number of
referrals under the US system is low. It is about five cases a year.
However, he is comparing the US system of justice with the UK system,
but there is a completely different set of circumstances in how such
issues are dealt with and what is acceptable. On that basis, the US
legislation allows for certain types of activities to take place, but
the UK system does
not.</div><a name="10031888000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000578"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is an obvious point, but given that the US
has only five referrals a year, why would there be so many more in this
country?</div>
<a name="10031888000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000579"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> As I have just explained, the basis on which
referral and advice takes place is quite different, because of the way
in which US legislation on bribery and corruption is set up and because
what is acceptable is quite different from the UK system. It is not
appropriate to make the comparisons. The advisory system that the hon.
Gentleman proposes is quite similar to that of the US Department of
Justice and the system that operates in Hong Kong.</div>
<a name="10031888000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those schemes
were considered by the Joint Committee on the draft Bribery Bill and
while I am aware that several witnesses from the business community
indicated that they would like to see such an advisory service, that
was not the view of the Joint Committee. It acknowledged that it might
have some benefit, but it rejected the idea, noting that such schemes
might prejudice the independence of prosecutors and were generally
incompatible with our criminal justice system. That is the main point.
Our criminal justice system is not the same as the US system, so it is
wrong to make comparisons and to assume that one form of advisory
service in the US would be appropriate to overlay on the UK justice
system.</div><a name="10031888000423"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10031888000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000580"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Leaving aside the comparisons with the US for a
moment, may I make slightly more seriously the point that I made rather
frivolously to the hon. Member for Cambridge? If the Under-Secretary is
right and there are circumstances in which prosecutors would be
extremely uncomfortable in giving specific advice to a company, nothing
in the new clause prevents the prosecutor from simply refusing to give
the advice. But where the answer was rather more simple and helpful,
it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>could be given. It does not mean that a prosecutor or anyone else
working in such an agency would have to give the kind of assistance
about which she is concerned.
</div><a name="10031888000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000581"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Let us be absolutely clear about the
practical consequences of doing so. A company would seek
advice from the advisory organisation and if a prosecutor
wished to pursue a case against it, the company would understandably
wave in front of the prosecutor the advice from the advisory
body, and argue that it must be clear. That limits right from the very
start the prosecution&#146;s ability to look at all the matters and
all the facts.</div>
<a name="10031888000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The big
difference is that unless the advisory service is given every essential
fact and detail when it gives the advice, it is difficult and therefore
inappropriate to tie the hands of the prosecutor. That was the main
objection that was raised with the Joint Committee, on which the hon.
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth and the hon. Member for Huntingdon both
served, and it was the main reason why it would not want to see an
advisory service in
place.</div><a name="10031888000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000582"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Surely the advice that would come out of the
advisory service would be based purely on the facts presented to it. If
facts were not presented to it, surely the prosecutor would not have to
take note of the
advice.</div><a name="10031888000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000583"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> The opportunities for muddying the waters in this
matter are huge. It is not clear cut. That is why we argue that the
right way to do this is to provide guidance to companies under clause 9
that they must have adequate procedures, giving them the full
information on the basis of that guidance and allowing them to make
that judgment. Therefore, the Government believe that to have in place,
running alongside, the opportunities for self-referral and to allow the
prosecution to decide what is appropriate in the circumstances is a far
better and more appropriate way to
proceed.</div><a name="10031888000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000584"></a>John
Howell:</b> I am struggling to understand why the advice that
will be given by this advisory group when used in a court would be any
different from the opinion that I might seek from a
QC.</div><a name="10031888000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000585"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> It would be official advice from a Government agency
and so it could not possibly be compared to that which a company might
seek from counsel or any other legal
source.</div><a name="10031888000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000586"></a>John
Howell:</b> In that case, can the Under-Secretary assure me
that she will go through every piece of advice provided by the
Government, in particular concerning companies and SMEs doing business
overseas, to excise anything that might prejudice an action under the
Bill? Plenty of advice has been given by other organisations during the
debate on the Bill&#151;I have mentioned what TIUK provided. It is
important to make the
distinction.</div><a name="10031888000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000587"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> That is not a relevant point at all. We are talking
about a specific advisory service&#151;designed by an Opposition
thought process&#151;which would have a role to advise in such
circumstances. That is not the same as the advice that TIUK or any
other agency might provide about doing business abroad&#151;that is
quite different. The purpose of the advisory service would be simply to
avoid the companies being prosecuted. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div><i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Of course it
would&#151;in practical terms, that it is exactly what the companies
would hope to achieve. If not, I am not sure what the purpose of the
new clause is. The hon. Member for Huntingdon is saying that the
advisory service would give advice. Companies would expect to be able
to follow that advice. However, they could still be prosecuted in such
circumstances. In practice, that would be very
difficult.</div><a name="10031888000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000588"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> There are two points to make. First, new clause 2
clearly sets out that any advice would be given without prejudice. In
other words, a prosecution could still follow and everyone would have
to understand that. Secondly, if a company seeks advice on what it
should do, and it is given advice that it follows, yes, of course the
point is to avoid prosecution. That was entirely in tune with
everything the Under-Secretary has been saying in Committee. The
objective is not necessarily to drag companies through the courts, but
to ensure that they do what they should do to avoid bribery. The
proposal is simply an extension of
that.</div><a name="10031888000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000589"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> We have made it absolutely clear that our intention
is not to drag through the courts well-run companies with adequate
procedures in place. We hope that the Bill will be an effective
deterrent and will encourage
companies&#151;</div><a name="10031888000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000590"></a>Mr.
Djanogly</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="10031888000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000591"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me
finish.</div><a name="10031888000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
hope the Bill will encourage companies to have good and adequate
procedures in place. It is all well and good saying in new clause 2
that the advice should be without prejudice, but in practice specific
advice by such a service would inevitably have to be taken into account
by the prosecuting authorities, therefore constraining those
authorities. That is the reality of what the hon. Gentleman and his
colleagues are
proposing.</div><a name="10031888000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000592"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister paints a black and white picture,
whereas the reality is often more confused. Let us say, for instance,
that the company goes to the advisory service with a transaction that
has a series of commissions involved. Some might be proper commissions
and some might stretch into what would constitute bribery. The advisory
service could give guidance as to what would be appropriate. Such
things are not always black and white; what is right can differ in the
circumstances. For a smaller company in particular, the service could
be a valuable one, helping it to weave its way through what could be
tricky
matters.</div><a name="10031888000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000593"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> If what the companies are seeking is guidance, it
will be provided under clause 9. It is not a tick box and simply about
adhering to every aspect&#151;it is guidance. As much as the hon.
Gentleman might like to think that that is how it would work, in
practice it simply would not. A prosecutor or court considering the
adequacy of procedures in any individual case will look at all the
circumstances, including the particular facts that constitute the
original offence committed by the person associated with the
organisation. Consequently, it would not be possible, even if
appropriate, to offer a definitive assessment of the adequacy of any
particular procedures in isolation from specific facts. In such
circumstances, any advice offered would be of doubtful utility to those
whom it is intended to
benefit.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="10031888000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000594"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Is there not a tension between the desire of the
prosecuting authorities not to give up a scrap or iota of their
discretion, and the desperate desire of commerce and business to have a
clear answer? Is the Under-Secretary, as a Justice Minister, perhaps
straying from the true path by not being prepared to give up an iota of
prosecutorial discretion? That is her job&#151;she is a Minister of
Justice. However, is it not in the country&#146;s interest for
business men, and particularly small business men, to have a clear
answer on which they can
rely?</div><a name="10031888000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000595"></a>Claire
Ward:</b> It is in the interest of this country and of
business globally that we stamp out bribery, which is what we are doing
through the Bill. By providing guidance under clause 9, we recognise
that it is important that businesses have an opportunity to consider
what they need to do to put in place adequate procedures. That is why
we are establishing the detail of the guidance, and we hope that
businesses will take note of
it.</div><a name="10031888000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be wrong, however, for us to tie the hands of the prosecution
authorities in the Bill and remove their discretion to look at all the
facts of a case and decide what is appropriate. That goes hand in hand
with the other clear message that we are sending as a result of the
Bill: the need for self-referral. That is the right way to proceed.
While Opposition Members have expressed strong views and businesses
have expressed an opinion, I do not believe that the new clause
represents the right approach, so I trust that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon will withdraw
it.</div><a name="10031888000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000596"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> There is an inconsistency between what the
Under-Secretary is saying and what the Government have said. There is
all the talk about small businesses and how we want them to succeed as
part of an export-led recovery. The SFO, being helpful, says,
&#147;Yes, if people come to us, we&#146;re prepared to give them
advice and not prosecute them. If people are trying to self-cleanse, we
will give them a nice, positive attitude to try to help businesses in
good quality new
managements.&#148;</div><a name="10031888000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary, however, is not prepared to give guidance that a small
business can rely on, or to allow people to ring up or go and see
someone to whom they can explain their circumstances and have a deal
done. As a Justice Minister, she wants to stand up strongly for the
right of the prosecutor never to be fettered and to be able to look at
every scrap of evidence when he is deciding whether to prosecute. There
is a tension there, so I ask her to consider at this late stage whether
she has got this
right.</div><a name="10031888000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000597"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> This helpful debate has, in some ways, raised as
many questions as answers. The hon. Member for Cambridge said that the
Hong Kong system was different and that it had strict penalties.
However, once the Bill is in force, we will also have strict
penalties.</div>
<a name="10031888000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000598"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It is not just the penalties, but what happens to
a person if they are accused.</div>
<a name="10031888000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000599"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> When the legislation is in place, it will be
down to prosecutorial discretion here as well. I note the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s acknowledgment that the new clause is worthy of
further work, and I take that on board.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div><a name="10031888000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth made a good and
important point about new clause 3 when he said that the cost of the
advisory service could be recouped from the savings made from
non-prosecutions and from the process not being followed up at a later
time.</div><a name="10031888000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Poole talked about how the service would be
useful for companies that did not understand what they might be letting
themselves in for. He also made the interesting point that it could be
used as a weather vane for corruption activity around the world and
that that could be fed back to the
administrator.</div><a name="10031888000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire spoke about the
benefits of self-cleansing that would be made available. He also
forcefully made the point that the interests of the country, the
judicial system and business needed to be balanced. He made his case
very well that the Under-Secretary&#146;s interpretation might be
rather
rigid.</div><a name="10031888000424"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="10031888000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary made some cursory remarks about the SFO guidance. She
did not analyse the guidance, which I think is making a move towards
providing informal&#151;I might have incorrectly used the word
&#147;unofficial&#148; earlier&#151;advice. That is moving the
debate forward, but she did not recognise that. She then said that, to
the extent that the guidance is helpful, it was limited to specific
circumstances. I have read out the specific circumstances, which were
cases of bribery, so the guidance is very specific, and specific to
what we are discussing. The Under-Secretary, however, is almost
ignoring the implications of
that.</div><a name="10031888000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary&#146;s differentiation between the US system and ours
was also unconvincing. She spoke about how a service could muddy the
waters, but it cuts both ways&#151;in many cases, the waters can be
pretty muddied anyway. We are not talking about the black and white
situations that I felt she dipped into at various points. The waters
will often be muddy. The proposal could, in certain situations, provide
a mechanism that would allow companies to get some clarity,
particularly those that cannot afford the expensive legal advice
required at an early stage before securing a contract. To that extent,
it would be particularly helpful for SMEs working in developing areas,
which we hope will happen more often if our economy is to pick
up.</div><a name="10031888000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000600"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> While my hon. Friend is talking about the way in
which the Under-Secretary has approached the issue, does he agree that
she has not recognised the fundamental difference between companies
that wish to do the right thing and are seeking advice about how they
might do that, and those that are clearly seeking to find a way around
the law so that they can do the wrong thing? Surely new clause 2 would
mean that companies in the latter category would not be given the
advice that they were looking for by the advisory
agency.</div><a name="10031888000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10031888000601"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that point. I think
that the Under-Secretary is making the opposite point, so I am pleased
that he has put that right. I tabled the new clause as a probing
amendment, but after hearing the debate, I feel more confident that we
should have some sort of service. I am not sure whether we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>should adopt the exact wording proposed in the new clause, but my hon.
