<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000349"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> Thank
you very much, Mr. Hood. It is a real pleasure to be once
again, if somewhat surprisingly, serving under your chairmanship in my
third consecutive year on the Finance Bill. I have learnt one thing in
the last 24 hours, which is that there are Finance Bill gods. It seems
that they are slightly vengeful and playful gods, because roughly 24
hours ago I was, I confess, teasing one of my hon. Friends, who shall
remain nameless, for saying that their entire life had, yet again, been
taken over by the Finance Bill. I was glorying in the fact that,
although I served on it in the last two years, I was not required to
serve this year. So there are Finance Bill gods and they are
vengeful&#151;only one swift phone call later, I found myself here
again. However, the pleasure is no less diminished for serving under
your chairmanship, Mr.
Hood.</div><a name="090609124000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have risen to speak on clause 30, although there are no amendments to
it, because it introduces schedule 11, and I thought it might be
helpful to the Committee to have an explanation of what we are trying
to achieve. We are comprehensively reforming the rules on tax relief
for business expenditure on cars. There are two incentives for change.
The first incentive is simplification, on which we have responded to
lobbying from the industry. Secondly, we wish to ensure that the rules
on tax relief for business expenditure on cars also help us to achieve
our environmental
objectives.</div><a name="090609124000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current rules require capital expenditure on cars costing more than
&#163;12,000 to be accountable for in single asset pools&#151;that
means one asset pool per car so that the writing-down allowances can be
capped. Businesses that hire, rather than buy, cars costing more than
&#163;12,000 are also restricted in the amount of hire expenses that
may be deducted from their profits. Businesses therefore need to track
expenditure on those more expensive cars on an individual basis for the
purposes of their tax computations, but for larger businesses, the
number of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>such car pools can run into hundreds&#151;in some automotive sectors,
thousands. Stakeholders consider that the rules are outdated and impose
a disproportionate compliance burden, and we agree.</div>
<a name="090609124000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is,
however, important that any reform is consistent with our environmental
objectives. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas
contributing to climate change, and road transport is one of its major
producers. The reform aims to contribute towards our targeted reduction
in CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions. Following extensive consultation, an
outline of the reform was announced at Budget 2008; further detail was
published in December 2008. The Government have considered
stakeholders&#146; responses in designing a new regime that will not
only reduce compliance costs, but help to meet the UK&#146;s targets
for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
<a name="090609124000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The generous
100 per cent. first year allowances for expenditure on cars with very
low CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions are unchanged. They were made available
for a further five years until 2013 in the Finance Act 2008. Consistent
with that, under the new rules, the rate of writing down allowances
that businesses can claim in respect of all cars will depend on the
car&#146;s CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions. Expenditure on cars will
generally be pooled in one of two plant and machinery pools. Where the
car&#146;s emissions are 160 g/km or less, the expenditure
will be allocated to the main capital allowances pool and will attract
the same rate of 20 per cent. per annum of writing down allowances, as
applies to most other plant and machinery. However, expenditure on cars
with emissions above 160 g/km will be allocated to the special rate
pool and attract a lower writing down allowance of 10 per cent. per
annum. There will therefore be a clear incentive to buy a lower
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-emitting car.</div>
<a name="090609124000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rules
restricting the deductions from profits that businesses may claim in
respect of car hire costs are also being reformed to act as a
disincentive to using high CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#151;emitting vehicles. For
leases that commence after April 2009, there will be a restriction of
allowable expenses only where the hired car has CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
emissions exceeding 160 g/km. In addition, and as a simplification
measure rather than an environmental one, the proposed rules ensure
that only one lessee in a chain of leases for a car will be subject to
the lease rental restrictions. Respondents have agreed that the
reduction in the proportion of cars in a single asset capital allowance
pool and the application of the lease rental restriction to a smaller
population of leases will achieve a welcome reduction in compliance
costs. As an additional simplification, motorcycles will no longer be
treated as cars for capital allowances purposes. That change, too, has
been welcomed by business.</div>
<a name="090609124000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think
that the move to a CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions basis for capital
allowances will act as an additional fiscal measure to motivate
business to redesign their car policies and actively select lower
emitting cars. While the new rules deliver the reform that businesses
pressed for, in order to ensure fairness, the provision introduces
transitional rules to guarantee that there is no change to the
treatment of cars owned before the date of introduction of the new
rules. The old rules are being retained for those vehicles for five
years.</div>
<a name="090609124000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said at
the outset, these provisions have been the subject of considerable
consultation and are broadly welcomed by
stakeholders.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000351"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is it a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Hood. May I congratulate the hon. Member for
Burnley on her return to the Treasury team? There is potentially one
more Finance Bill left in this Parliament. She might decide whether to
put some odds on serving on that too, having done three so far. I
should also like to congratulate, in her absence, the hon. Member for
Wallasey (Angela Eagle) on her promotion. Clearly, the prospect of my
hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham making another speech
about white label cigarettes manufactured in eastern European states
led to her to put in a transfer bid. I am sure she will enjoy her work
in the Department for Work and
Pensions.</div><a name="090609124000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
19 is very much a probing amendment. We want to understand why in
schedule 11 the Government use a different definition for a car with
low carbon emissions from that used in section 45D of the Capital
Allowances Act 2001, which defines cars with low CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
emissions as those falling below a CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emission threshold of
110 g/km, whereas the schedule&#146;s threshold is 160g/km. The
amendment would increase the threshold in section 45D(4) from 110g/km
to 160g/km. We are not arguing that that is the right threshold, We
simply want to understand why one rate is used in one area and a
different rate is used in the schedule for exactly the same definition.
We are concerned that it might lead to some confusion among advisers
about the definition of a car with low carbon emissions. That is the
purpose behind this probing
amendment.</div><a name="090609124000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000352"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The answer is quite simple. We have 100
per cent. capital allowance for cars with emissions at or below 110
g/km; then, we propose a 20 per cent. allowance for cars with emissions
up to 160 g/km and a 10 per cent. allowance for cars with emissions in
excess of that. The legal definition is extremely clear. The purpose of
our legislation is to encourage companies to purchase cars that are
progressively more environmentally friendly. If they want to go
straight away for cars emitting 110 g/km or less, that is fantastic and
they will reap a reward for doing so. We are trying to shift the bell
curve all the way down to encourage the use of lower emitting
vehicles.</div><a name="090609124000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000353"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a slightly unfair question to ask the
Minister, given her recent arrival in the Treasury, but was any thought
given to using a different term? That is where the confusion arises.
The 2001 Act uses the term to describe a car with emissions of 110 g/km
or less; the same term is used in the Bill in reference to a 160 g/km
threshold. To give clarity to taxpayers and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>their advisers, it would have been sensible to use a slightly different
definition in schedule 11 to avoid confusion in the
future.</div><a name="090609124000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000354"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I can safely say that, as far as I am aware, no
consideration was given to that. I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman is
confused, but we think the intention is
clear.</div><a name="090609124000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000355"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> As I said, the amendment is probing. It would have
been better for clarity if the Government had come up with a different
term, to prevent confusion and to ensure that taxpayers understand the
Government&#146;s aim exactly. Given that the Government do not wish
to move on this, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="090609124000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="090609124000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000356"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 20, in
schedule 11, page 109, line 32, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5A) An order
under subsection (5) may not be made until 2 years after
this Act has passed and any subsequent change will be subject to a 2
year notice
period.&#146;.</div><a name="090609124000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is straightforward. We want to ensure some
certainty for taxpayers and that, where an amendment is made to the
thresholds, businesses are given some notice, so that changes are not
simply made overnight. We want to ensure that businesses can plan how
to meet the downward trend of emissions&#151;shifting the bell curve
down, as the Minister described it earlier. The amendment introduces a
two-year waiting period for any changes made under new section 104AA(5)
of the Capital Allowances Act 2001, inserted by the schedule, so that
businesses can properly
prepare.</div><a name="090609124000045"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000357"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> In a sense, I accept the spirit behind the
amendment. We try to give businesses as much notice as possible. We
understand that is important and we have no plans not to do that.
However, as I said in my remarks on clause 30, the proposals have been
consulted on extensively&#151;indeed the first consultation took
place more than three years ago, which is a longer period than the two
years&#146; notice proposed in the amendment.</div>
<a name="090609124000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept
that planning and certainty are important to business, but we do not
accept that a statutory requirement to wait for two years and always
give two years&#146; notice is necessary or always desirable. I can
think of circumstances where, for example, our policy proves to be more
effective than we expected, leaving us with a policy that has achieved
its design, but which we are unable to ratchet further for
environmental purposes because of a provision such as this in the Bill.
At the same time, I do not want to send a signal that we intend to
change the capital allowances system arbitrarily. We think it important
to consult properly, and the Government benefit from that.</div>
<a name="090609124000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
Committee that we have no secret plan to change anything and that we
are always committed to good consultation. However, I do not think it
right to tie the Government&#146;s hands&#151;I am sure that the
hon. Gentleman would agree&#151;in case different external factors
come into play, such that government and policy would be better served
by not being tied down in that way. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>The Government recognise the need to give business time to
plan for changes, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000358"></a>Mr.

that there is no secret plan to make changes. It would not have been a

<a name="090609124000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the

seems to be suffusing the Government right from the very top in
relation to consultation and discussion&#151;not that we have not
heard that before&#151;the Minister will ensure that, where there are
changes, proper consultation is conducted. I beg to ask leave to

Incomes Tax Reform Group, which has done a good job of examining how
the Bill&#146;s provisions will affect vulnerable people.</div>
<a name="090609124000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question the group has drawn to my attention is whether an impact
assessment has been undertaken for the schedule addressing the impact
on people with disability. A feature of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs&#146; disability equality scheme is that there should
always be an assessment of the impact on people with disability. The
Low Incomes Tax Reform Group&#146;s point is that disabled drivers
might need to purchase larger and generally less
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-efficient vehicles to accommodate their needs. They are
not only faced with a potentially higher cost for the vehicle itself,
but might receive only the lower special capital allowance rate of 10
per cent. Given the costs that many people with disability face, the
group is concerned that the low capital allowance rate would put them
in a worse position than they are in now, so it has asked the Minister
to consult on the issue to see whether an exemption could be
made.</div>
<a name="090609124000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
group&#146;s second point relates to the change in treatment of
exempt hire cars for disabled people. The previous regime allowed hire
companies to claim the writing down allowance on the full cost of those
cars, rather than on the limited &#163;12,000. It was believed that
the Government were going to provide a similar exemption by allowing
cars hired to disabled people to qualify for the higher 20 per cent.
rate of capital allowances, regardless of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions, but
a technical note produced last year suggests that the Government have
reached an agreement with the main UK supplier of such cars to disabled
people whereby they will defer an application under state aid rules and
look at other initiatives to increase the availability of cars with
lower emissions for  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>leasing to disabled people. Although the intention might be to increase
the availability of those lease cars to people with disability, the
concern is that, in the short term, hire companies might face higher
costs, taking into account the loss of tax relief, and that those costs
will be passed on to people with disability.</div>
<a name="090609124000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
comment relates to a definition in paragraph 22 of schedule
11, which, in proposed new section 268D(2) of the 2001 Act, sets out
four criteria people can use to determine whether they qualify as
disabled people in relation to hire cars. Those criteria are quite
complex, and I was asked why they cannot be simplified to include
someone who is a disabled badge holder, rather than seeking to assess
whether someone is a disabled person by reference to several different
allowances.</div><a name="090609124000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090609124000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, and I welcome
the hon. Member for Burnley to her new ministerial role.</div>
<a name="090609124000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basic issue dealt with by the schedule, if I understand it
correctly, there is a low emission rate of 100 per cent. capital
allowance. I wonder if the Minister knows to what cars that rate
applies and how many of those cars are actually bought. I also wonder
if the change to a 10 per cent. allowance for cars with high emissions
and 20 per cent. for those with lower emissions is revenue-neutral,
given the abolition of the separate pool.</div>
<a name="090609124000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
we are dealing with a timing difference. It is not a case of money
being given away. Capital allowances are recouped when the vehicle is
sold, so there is either the balancing charge or the balancing
allowance. What I would have expected to see in the schedule, given the
state of the car industry, is the Government bringing forward 100 per
cent. relief for fleet cars to encourage the purchase of new vehicles.
After all, it is only a timing difference. That change to 100 per cent.
relief would encourage companies to spend money. At the end of the day,
the Government would get their money back when the vehicle was sold.
That change would be an incentive that would help car manufacturing in
this country. I wonder why the Government rejected that
approach.</div><a name="090609124000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000361"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I will take the questions in the order in which
they were put. Yes, there is an impact assessment that specifically
considers the impact on disabled people. I am sure that the hon. Member
for Fareham will have that impact assessment in his papers. Although
the Finance Bill can achieve many things, the policy intention behind
the measure was to simplify the arrangements and ensure that they are
consistent with environmental objectives, not to widen the scope of the
policy. We wanted to ensure that the provisions and exemptions that are
available for disabled drivers are replicated in the new legislation.
As he rightly said, and as we have made clear several times, it is our
intention, subject to state aid rules, to ensure that the exemptions
are carried over into the new system. That remains our intention. The
timing has been agreed with all the
players.</div><a name="090609124000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman then asked specifically why in paragraph 22 we do not
simply use the qualification criterion of a person holding a disabled
badge. The answer quite simply is that the power to award a badge is
devolved to local authorities and we wanted to
ensure  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>that we had a comprehensible and tighter set of criteria, so that the
system and the resources are properly targeted on those people who need
our
support.</div><a name="090609124000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000362"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> On the point about the blue badge, does the hon.
Lady accept the argument that the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group made
that, as a consequence of these changes, high costs may be imposed on
people with disability who need larger
cars?</div><a name="090609124000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000363"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am not entirely sure that the evidence points
towards that conclusion, although I think that the Low Incomes Tax
Reform Group is an effective lobby group and I commend it on the work
that it does. The market is sufficiently dynamic that there is a large
number of models available to suit people&#146;s needs, so I do not
think that these measures will create an extra cadre of people who will
face additional financial hurdles. We are just seeking to replicate the
current criteria in a new system that is simpler and that has greater
environmental incentives for those who are leasing and purchasing
cars.</div><a name="090609124000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure to serve again on the same Committee as the hon. Member
for Wellingborough. To his question whether the policy is
revenue-neutral, the answer is no. The impact assessment shows that,
assuming that there is no change in behaviour, which is the crucial
point, the policy would yield revenue to the Treasury of
&#163;485 million over five years. That figure is broken
down year by year in the impact assessment.</div>
<a name="090609124000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman then suggested that we could have used the policy to boost
the automotive industry. In his previous ministerial incarnation, my
hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has been extremely closely involved
in measures designed to have that effect. We hope very much that the
effect of the policy will be a change in behaviour, precisely because
of the new financial incentives that we are putting in place that will
cause large companies with large fleets in particular to purchase more
environmentally efficient vehicles, and thus to avoid paying the
revenue that would otherwise accrue to us. That will provide precisely
the spur for the green technology and green automotive industry that we
want.</div><a name="090609124000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000364"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My point was more that we have missed an opportunity
to have an incentive. Yes, there is the stick to encourage us to switch
to more environmentally friendly cars, but we then get only the
standard writing down allowance. If we extended the allowance to
100 per cent., more cars would be bought and that would be
better for our manufacturing
industry.</div><a name="090609124000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000365"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> We could use the policy simply to pass over cash
to the manufacturing industry. The Government do that in various ways,
but it is more appropriate to have a targeted policy that seeks
simultaneously to simplify the system, which is what business wants,
and to provide a spur for investment in environmentally efficient
vehicles. There will also be a third effect, which is to boost the
development of those vehicles. In a sense, therefore, the hon.
Gentleman and I
agree.</div><a name="090609124000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

&#146;.</div><a name="090609124000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a real pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Hood. At the 2007 pre-Budget report the Chancellor launched three
reviews involving the Treasury and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs working in partnership with business to evaluate how a range of
tax legislation could be simplified. Clause 31 and schedule 12 deliver
the first simplification measure from one strand of that project, which
deals with the capital gains of groups of companies.</div>
<a name="090609124000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
corporation tax system allows limited offsetting of the capital losses
of one company against the gains of another when calculating their
taxable profits. In the Finance Act 2000 that procedure was
liberalised, so that an asset could be deemed to have been transferred
within the group before an onward sale. That saved the administrative
burden and expense of making an actual intra-group transfer. However,
those rules do not allow all gains and losses to be deemed as
transferred within a group; they only apply to the sale of an asset to
a third party. That means that the rules do not apply when a gain or
loss results from the liquidation of a group company or when a loss
arises on the making of a negligible value claim. Losses on assets that
have been destroyed, or gains from insurance receipts in such a
situation, are also outside the scope of this otherwise useful tax
measure.</div>
<a name="090609124000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CBI in
particular highlighted in its recent Budget representations that those
restrictions can be administratively burdensome. Schedule 12 provides
groups of companies with a simpler procedure to offset chargeable gains
with allowable losses by removing those restrictions. Rather than
deeming assets to be transferred intra-group prior to a third-party
sale, companies will be able to elect for a capital gain or
loss to be reallocated to another group company that is within the
charge to corporation
tax.</div><a name="090609124000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
18 addresses one area in which we have received representations that,
because of a technical defect in the schedule, the policy aim might not
be achieved. The issue only affects groups that wish to transfer a gain
or loss to a non-resident company in a group that trades in the UK
through a permanent establishment&#151;a branch or agency here. Since
2000, non-resident companies have been treated as part of the capital
gains group. Tax-neutral transfers of assets can be made to a
non-resident company if it has a permanent establishment in the UK and
the assets are used for the business of that establishment. That rule
ensures that the treatment applies only to those assets on which the
non-resident company will be chargeable to corporation tax on gains
made from their disposal. That same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>condition is imported into the rules in schedule 12, but we have
received representations from the Law Society that the new rule needs
to be adapted further to operate properly when a non-resident company
is
involved.</div><a name="090609124000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="090609124000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
an election is made to transfer a gain or loss from the disposal of an
asset to a non-resident company, the schedule already has a rule to
ensure that a gain or loss on the asset will be a chargeable gain or an
allowable loss to the non-resident company. That applies even where the
asset would not otherwise be a chargeable asset for the non-resident
company. However, the representations that we have received point out
that one condition to be satisfied before an election can be made is
that the asset is used in the UK trade of the permanent establishment,
which is unnecessary in this context. Amendment 18, therefore, adapts
the rule about when companies can make an election, to remove any doubt
that non-resident companies with UK permanent establishments can always
fulfil the conditions. I am grateful for the Law Society&#146;s
representation, which is one that the Government are happy to act
on.</div>
<a name="090609124000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
made by the schedule sweep away some restrictions that have prevented
the full matching of capital gains and losses within groups and
simplify the complex rules that deal with group relationships. That is
the kind of simplifying change that the CBI and other representative
bodies have long sought. I commend the amendment to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000367"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have a couple of quick questions for the Minister
about the schedule, which arise from representations made by outside
bodies. The first is about capital gains and losses that arise as a
consequence of the operation of foreign exchange matching rules. The
Institute of Chartered Accountants has expressed the concern that these
seem to fall outside the scope of the schedule. It believes that they
should fall within it, as those gains and losses accrue as a result of
the operation of statutory provisions. Can the Minister comment on
that?</div>
<a name="090609124000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
concern about the drafting of new sections 171A(5) and 179A(5) to the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 inserted by schedule 12. We have
received comments that they would totally negate an election. We would
have thought that the correct result would be that they would negate an
election to the extent that it took the total amount over the actual
gain or loss. There would be a difficulty if there were two or more
simultaneous elections that transferred parts of the same gain or loss
to two or more different companies, so there would be a choice as to
which election to negate, but where there is no choice, surely the
election should be reduced rather then simply
negated.</div>
<a name="090609124000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000368"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> On the question of foreign exchange, the
reference in the schedule to &#147;in respect of an asset&#148;
will exclude chargeable gains or losses in respect of liabilities such
as those arising from forex hedging from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>provision. The treatment of such gains and losses within the Exchange
Gains and Losses (Bringing into Account Gains or Losses) Regulations is
already under consideration in the forex matching discussions that are
ongoing between HMRC and business representatives, and we have talked
to business representatives about this. We intend to address that point
in the next round of forex matching changes later in the year.
Proceeding in that way will ensure that the whole regime is considered,
rather than that one item being taken out of context. The industry is
satisfied with the approach that we are taking.</div>
<a name="090609124000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second question was on multiple elections. It is
correct that where two or more elections are made simultaneously that
specify more than the gain or loss, none of those elections has effect,
as a result of the new wording of new section 179A(5). The main issue
that the new subsection addresses is the possibility of simultaneous
elections where a subsequent election is made in respect of the same
gain or loss. HMRC expects that it will be very rare for a group to
make such an oversight. On the rare occasions that an oversight may
happen, it is right that the group is able to submit correct elections
that specify where it wants the gain or loss to go, rather than be
subject to a statutory rule that may not achieve the best result on a
case-by-case basis.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000371"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The new rules in schedule 13 provide that, to the
extent that collateral is inadequate to replace all the lent securities
lost in the event of a borrower&#146;s insolvency, the lender is
treated as making a disposal but receiving no consideration so that,
effectively, a capital loss arises. The borrower then has a debt to the
lender for the remaining value of the securities at the time of the
insolvency, but because of that insolvency the debt is likely to be
bad. In certain circumstances, it is possible that, in addition to the
capital loss provided for by the schedule, a life insurance
company&#146;s profits might be reduced by the amount of that bad
debt, which results from the interaction of special rules for computing
the profits of life insurance companies and the rules relating to the
debts of companies, which are known as the loan relationships rules.
The schedule contains a provision that intends to stop a debt being
classed as a loan relationship if it results from the insolvency of a
stock borrower and an inadequacy of collateral to fully replace stock.
The effect is to prevent an unintentional double allowance for life
insurance companies as a capital loss and as a bad debt.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div><a name="090609124000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
in the Bill as drafted contains an error. The drafting provides a
formula for arriving at the amount of the debt that is not to be
treated as a loan relationship, but unfortunately the formula does not
produce the correct result. The cross-references to the rest of the
provision do not work as they should. Government amendments 90 and 91
correct that error. Government amendment 90 adds a cross-reference to
clarify the effect of another part of the change made to the capital
gains rules. Government amendment 91 replaces the incorrect formula for
arriving at the debt in question with a reference to a description of
that debt elsewhere in the new legislation. The amendments do not
change the legislation&#146;s intended effect; they merely correct a
drafting

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000372"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have a quick question. I understand the
clause&#146;s intentions; the Minister and I have discussed the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme in other arenas on more
occasions than I care to remember.</div>
<a name="090609124000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
centres on the tax treatment of interest and assumes that a depositor
will get back their funds in full from the FSCS, which is the way in
which the scheme has operated during the current financial crisis; in
effect, the Government have issued an unlimited guarantee where the
scheme has been called upon for retail depositors. However, the
scheme&#146;s rules, as outlined in the Financial Services
Authority&#146;s handbook, actually limit compensation to
&#163;50,000. If we return to a more stable financial climate and the
&#163;50,000 rule applies, a depositor with a deposit of
&#163;60,000 will only get &#163;50,000 back, but will earn some
interest on that money from the date that the scheme comes into force,
in respect of their institution, and the date that the money is paid to
the depositor. Will the interest they receive be treated as
compensation, and therefore free of tax, or as interest and be
taxable?</div><a name="090609124000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000373"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This clause deals with one aftermath of the
default of a number of banks. Because of these bank failures the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme has paid out more than &#163;3
billion of compensation to bank customers. The hon. Gentleman is
correct. We have discussed a number of the general principles
surrounding this on many occasions. The compensation paid included not
only the principal on the accounts but also a sum representing interest
that the customers would have received had the bank not defaulted. The
sum representing interest is the subject of this clause.</div>
<a name="090609124000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure
that customers are in the same position as they would have been in had
the bank not defaulted, it is necessary to tax the sum representing
interest as if it were interest for tax purposes. Without this clause
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>sum representing interest paid by the FSCS would not be taxed in the
same way as interest paid by the banks is taxed. This would lead to
unfairness between those customers of the defaulted bank whose accounts
had been transferred to another bank or building society and those who
receive FSCS compensation. The customers whose accounts were
transferred would still be taxed on interest received from their new
bank or building society but the customers receiving compensation from
the FSCS would not be taxed on the sum relating to interest.</div>
<a name="090609124000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSCS has
rightly calculated the compensation it has paid by taking into account
whether or not the customer was a taxpayer. If they were, then it
deducted from the amount equivalent to interest, a sum equivalent to
income tax, just as tax is deducted from interest paid by the bank.
Without this clause non-taxpayers will not be able to claim repayment
of the amount deducted by the FSCS, and customers of the defaulted
bank, who are liable to higher rate tax, cannot be charged that higher
rate tax. That is why the clause is
needed.</div><a name="090609124000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked whether, if an FSCS payment is less than
the original capital, any part of that payment will be treated as
interest. Whether the original capital has been repaid is an issue that
falls outside the scope of the clause. The amount and nature of the
compensation paid by the FSCS is a matter for the rules of the FSCS. He
will be well aware of
that.</div><a name="090609124000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000374"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The clause affects the tax treatment of payments
made by the FSCS. While the amount of compensation is a matter for the
FSCS, where the payment received by the depositor is less than the
amount they originally deposited, is it possible to treat the interest
payable as being effectively not subject to tax because they have lost
so much money? Should not the interest be seen as a form of

defaulted. There is obviously a technical definition of compensation
and how it applies. It is right to say that when the FSCS pays interest
it is taxable, just as interest is. We are simply trying to bring
people back to the circumstances that they would have been in. It is
for the FSCS to determine the rules of its own compensation scheme and
whether there should be a &#163;50,000 limit or a higher one, as the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000376"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I add my welcome to you, Mr. Hood, as
Chair of the Committee&#146;s deliberations this morning.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div><a name="090609124000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 34 to
37 introduce a significant package that modernises corporate tax rules
for foreign profits. It will make the UK a more attractive headquarters
location for multinational businesses by enabling a group&#146;s
worldwide profits to be repatriated to the UK without tax being charged
and without need for complex double taxation relief calculations. It is
a major change to a more territorial system of business taxation in
which we are essentially concerned with applying tax to profits earned
in the UK and not to profits earned overseas. The key element of the
package offers generous dividend exemptions compared with competitor
jurisdictions, available to all companies regardless of the level of
shareholding.</div>
<a name="090609124000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The package
comprises four linked parts with one in each of the four clauses:
first, a broad exemption for company distribution; secondly, a
reasonable restriction on our generous interest-relief rules in the UK;
thirdly, consequential changes to the controlled foreign company rules,
and fourthly, the replacement of the Treasury consent rules with a much
simpler reporting requirement. These have all been subject to
substantial widespread consultation which has shaped what is before the
Committee.</div>
<a name="090609124000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall say
a little more about each of the four elements. Clause 34 introduces
schedule 14, which provides exemption from tax for foreign profits. It
reduces administrative costs and it meets business&#146;s call for
exemption in the Finance Bill. The result of these rules is that the
great majority of distributions for small, medium and large companies
will be exempt from corporation tax. That change has been widely
welcomed, as has the fact that we have been able to deliver it in
this Bill.</div>
<a name="090609124000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35
introduces schedule 15, which prevents excessive advantage being taken
of our interest-relief rules, particularly in the context of dividend
exemption. This debt cap applies only where groups put more debt in the
UK than they borrowed for their entire worldwide business. It is a
reasonable restriction and will allow generous tax deductions for
interest, notwithstanding the move to dividend exemption.</div>
<a name="090609124000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 36
introduces schedule 16, which makes three consequential changes to the
controlled foreign company rules. The first two relate to introduction
of dividend exemption and remove some of the exemptions within the
controlled foreign company regime, which will no longer be appropriate.
Part 3 of the schedule includes a provision to ensure that the debt cap
cannot interact with the controlled foreign company rules in a way as
to cause double taxation.</div>
<a name="090609124000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 37, introducing
schedule 17, removes existing Treasury consent legislation and replaces
it with a modernised, post-transaction reporting requirement targeted
at transactions where there is a substantial risk of tax avoidance
activity. The old rules have been replaced because they are out of date
and are not in line with modern practice. The new requirement will
apply to material transactions that pose significant risk of tax
avoidance, reducing the administrative burden on business but ensuring
that HMRC can focus on serious avoidance. We have also committed to
examine the controlled foreign company rules in more detail separately.
The review aims to modernise the current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>rules. It will be consistent with the move that I have described towards
a more territorial approach of taxing foreign subsidiaries.</div>
<a name="090609124000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">This package
represents the outcome of nearly two years of extensive and
constructive consultation. I want to thank all those who have
contributed in the past couple of years. Businesses have consistently
said to us that it is important for the UK to have dividend exemption.
They have asked for it to be included in this Finance Bill rather than
being delayed any further, to enhance the competitiveness of the UK tax
system. I am very glad that we have been able to do
that.</div><a name="090609124000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090609124000377"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): This is a very important part
of the Bill, as the Minister has underlined; it is very technical but
also very important. I want to congratulate him on having introduced
this package of measures. It is a crucial package, as it is an attempt
to show how a modern taxation system can cope with the global nature of
modern
commerce.</div><a name="090609124000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to start by being wholly positive, because I am afraid that I will
have to be just a little bit critical later on. Schedule 14 immediately
follows and I will make a few general remarks about it. It is
definitional and loophole-closing; it is based on a study of real-time
transactions, and it definitely has an eye on preventing further abuses
of similar ilk.</div>
<a name="090609124000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effectiveness of this type of legislation depends on the post-hoc
scrutiny, the retrospective examination by people within the Treasury
who must have adequate skills and abilities to do so. I am a little
encouraged, not only by what the Minister has said but by the
endeavours of HMRC to recruit appropriate people to police the type of
activity that we are discussing on a more regular
basis.</div><a name="090609124000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
one way, we are looking at a game of chess. On the companies&#146;
side there are very clever people trying to make the best of the
exemptions that are available and on the Government&#146;s side there
are people trying to close every conceivable loophole. Life has been
made enormously more difficult for those people who want to avoid tax
by the Government&#146;s imposition of an obligation on businesses
that insists that they must declare any tax schemes well in advance.
However, the real test of the Bill is whether or not adequate ground
rules are laid down to prevent further abuse and further misuse of tax
exemptions. We will have to judge whether the Bill has passed that test
when we look at the next
clauses.</div><a name="090609124000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000378"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> As the Financial Secretary said, the Government
have undertaken quite a thorough consultation process on this issue in
the past couple of years. As a consequence of that consultation
process, there have been a number of changes of tack by the Government
on the taxation of foreign profits. I just wanted to explore that issue
a little further.</div>
<a name="090609124000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Government published their consultation in 2007, they produced a fair
summary of the issue that we face when they
said:</div><a name="090609124000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
current system of taxing foreign dividends and relieving double
taxation through crediting foreign tax produces only a modest amount of
direct tax yield, but together with the Controlled Foreign Companies
(CFC) regime, provides safeguards to ensure that profits from economic
activity are properly taxed in the UK.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div><a name="090609124000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a question of
getting that balance right, which provides a link to some of the later
thoughts that the Government had. The document went on to
say:</div><a name="090609124000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
case for change rests largely on supporting large and medium business
operating in rapidly growing global markets by simplifying and
modernising the current
regime&#148;.</div><a name="090609124000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
challenge that the Government had to face was that a number of
multinationals were taking the view that the UK was not a good place
for them to be based and they were exploring whether or not they could
move to other jurisdictions where there was a better regime for the
treatment of foreign dividends.</div>
<a name="090609124000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation process also hit upon the issue of ensuring that profits
from economic activity were properly taxed in the UK. That led the
Government to consider the issue of a proposed controlled companies
regime to avoid the potential mischief of companies seeking to shift
income streams offshore, particularly what were described as mobile
income streams, which are financing income and royalties. When the
Government floated that idea, however, there was a significant outcry
from industry about the consequences, certainly about the
administrative cost, and it triggered a further wave of concern from
companies that look to redomicile overseas. The further concern was
about whether the rules that the clause seeks to change led to a
sub-optimal allocation of capital in an international group&#151;that
when it was not necessary for an overseas subsidiary to pay a dividend
to its UK parent for the purpose of making a dividend, those dividends
and that capital would be trapped in an offshore location. There was
concern that the Government&#146;s rules got in the way of the
efficient use of capital in businesses because businesses felt that it
would be better to keep profits in a low-tax jurisdiction rather than
repatriate them to the
UK.</div><a name="090609124000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the issues that has most exercised the Government, and on which I
would be grateful for further clarification from the Minister, is cost.
Cost was a feature of the technical note published in July last year by
the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the right hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), who expressed concern that the potential cost
of the dividend exemption would act as a barrier to taking it forward.
That technical note, published at the conclusion of our deliberations
on the Finance Bill 2008, set out that in 2005-06
&#163;200 million was collected in corporation tax paid on
foreign dividends, &#163;100 million was paid on portfolio dividends
and &#163;100 million was paid on direct dividends. The
assessment was that by 2012 the yield on foreign dividends would be
about &#163;300 million. However, the technical note suggested that
the tax loss to the Exchequer that could arise from introducing the
dividend exemption had a central estimate of about &#163;600 million,
within a range of &#163;200 million to &#163;1.1 billion, depending
on the behavioural responses. There was a suggestion that the tax take
could increase because of the repatriation of cash to the UK, which
would then be used to reduce indebtedness. The Government were
sceptical that that was an issue, and felt that there were ways in
which companies could repatriate those profits without incurring a
corporation tax
charge.</div><a name="090609124000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cost
was clearly a barrier at that point, but it no longer appears to be a
barrier to the Government&#146;s changes. The impact assessment
published after last year&#146;s pre-Budget report suggested that the
package of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>measures would cost about &#163;275 million. That is a significant
shift from the estimate that the Government produced in July last year,
and I shall be grateful if the Minister can provide a breakdown of the
figures, to explain the sources of revenue. I suspect that the cost of
the dividend exemption remains broadly unchanged but that the changes
the Minister referred to in his opening remarks to things such as the
debt cap and Treasury consent may be yielding more income. It is
important that there be greater clarity about how the Government were
able produce a revised estimate that made the dividend exemption more
affordable.</div><a name="090609124000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="090609124000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned earlier, the proposals set out in 2007 looked at a move to
an income-based regime, to ensure that businesses did not use the
opportunity of the dividend exemption to restructure their operations
and move various sources of income overseas for tax purposes, rather
than as a consequence of how their businesses operated. That led to a
significant outcry from businesses. Deloitte stated
that</div><a name="090609124000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
our view, this could significantly detract from the UK&#146;s
competitiveness, both from a financial and an administrative point of
view, and could dissuade companies from locating holding companies
here&#148;.</div>
<a name="090609124000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ernst and Young
commented on the potential compliance burden that would arise from
that, stating that the proposals would</div>
<a name="090609124000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;neither
improve clarity and transparency, nor make the rules more certain and
straightforward in application&#151;they are in fact a significant
move in the opposite
direction&#148;.</div><a name="090609124000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
outcry prompted the Government to move, as there was a big concern that
moving from an entity-based stream to an income-based stream would
require businesses to rework the basis on which they submit information
to the Treasury. Companies currently account on an entity basis and so
would have to revisit how they structure their reporting to deal with
it on an income basis. Clearly, the concern that businesses will seek
to move certain income streams offshore to lower-tax jurisdictions
still exists, as there might be a particular incentive in relation, for
example, to intellectual property rights or to finance income. Is the
Minister content that the anti-avoidance measures in schedule 14 are
sufficient to tackle those issues relating to mobile income streams, or
is that still a potential gap that will need to be addressed
later?</div>
<a name="090609124000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point I want to raise relates to the structure of the exemption and the
way in which it is given. Schedule 14 starts with the premise, as set
out in proposed new section 930A, that all distributions received will
be subject to tax. The existing legislation is framed differently: the
assumption is that all distributions received in relation to UK shares
are not taxed, but those in relation to overseas shares are taxed. We
have now moved to a basis on which all dividends and distributions are
taxed unless there is an exemption. Could the Minister explain why that
change has been made? It has been suggested to me that, given the
increased importance of the European Union in matters of direct
taxation, because of issues relating to the freedom to establish and
freedom of movement, that means it is difficult to distinguish the
dividends and distributions of UK companies from those of non-UK
companies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="090609124000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, we
have made the regime more challenging for UK companies than it was
before, and I shall be grateful if the Minister can provide some
clarification on that. Will that change, which we will debate in
greater detail when we come to schedule 14, increase the compliance
cost to UK business as a consequence? There is a concern about how the
legislation has been structured, so it would be helpful if the Minister
would explain why that move from a distinction between UK and non-UK
distributions has been changed, because I think that that will have a
knock-on effect, as we will debate later.</div>
<a name="090609124000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are broadly content with the concept to which the Government have
moved: that there should be a dividend exemption for foreign dividends.
I think that that will help to address the issues of competitiveness
that the UK faces as a location for holding companies. It has taken a
long time to get that&#151;two years&#151;and at one stage last
year I thought we might never see it. It is good that the exemption
will make it on to the statute book, but an understanding of how the
Government&#146;s objections on the grounds of cost have been
overcome would be
helpful.</div><a name="090609124000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000379"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to both Opposition spokesmen for
their support for the principle of what we are doing and the approach
we have taken. Consultation has been broad, and as the hon. Member for
Fareham pointed out, the proposals have been substantially modified in
the light of our discussions. As we go through this part of the Bill
there will be several technical discussions on the details, which will
be important, but I am glad that the principle has been so strongly
supported. The hon. Member for Southport was right to highlight the
importance of our ability to continue to bear down on avoidance, and we
will debate the issue later.</div>
<a name="090609124000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham asked about the costs involved. He is right to say
that our initial intention was to make the change in a fiscally neutral
way. As he indicated, there is a degree of uncertainty about precisely
how companies will react to the changed framework introduced by the
clause, so one cannot be too definitive about exactly what the fiscal
impacts will be. However, as discussions have developed and as we have
listened to the concerns that have been raised, we have relaxed the
requirement that the change should be fiscally neutral. Consequently,
while the initial intention was for the package to be revenue-neutral,
it now has a
cost.</div><a name="090609124000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
next year&#146;s expectation, dividend exemption will lead to a tax
reduction of &#163;500 million and we expect that to be offset by
&#163;200 million from the impact of the debt cap, which we will
discuss in relation to the changes to the controlled foreign companies
rules in clause 36. We also expect a loss of revenue of &#163;50
million as a result of the abolition of the Treasury consents rule. All
of those changes mean that we expect an overall loss of revenue of
&#163;150 million, which will grow as time goes by and companies
increasingly reorganise their activities in the light of the
changes.</div><a name="090609124000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
big difference is that, whereas we initially envisaged the debt cap as
centring on a company&#146;s net debt, it now centres on gross debt.
That is the big change both in the structure of our proposals and in
the fiscal
impact.</div><a name="090609124000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000380"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The right hon. Gentleman says he expects the cost
of the package to increase over time. I assume that there will be a tax
loss as companies restructure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>their activities and repatriate profits. Does he anticipate that
businesses will also look at the way in which they structure their
financing to reduce the additional tax, or will they pay the
consequence of the introduction of the debt
cap?</div><a name="090609124000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000381"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is
thinking about a particular kind of change, but I am certain that, with
a substantial change of this kind, companies will want to look at
potential opportunities for them to change the way in which they
organise themselves in order to take advantage of the provision. That
is perfectly appropriate. He was right to raise concerns about
potential avoidance opportunities and we will debate a general
anti-avoidance rule later in relation to a Government amendment. We
certainly need to keep a close eye on avoidance activity, but in
response to an earlier question of his, I believe that the measures
under consideration will do the
job.</div><a name="090609124000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked why some UK to UK dividends will be taxed for the
first time. We need to provide equality of treatment for UK and non-UK
dividends, as the previous inequality was not appropriate. In fact, the
impact of the proposals on UK dividends will be pretty minor. We need
to be certain that there is no risk of a challenge under EU law,
because challenges of that kind lead to damaging uncertainty that is in
nobody&#146;s interest. The legislation&#146;s structure gives us a
helpful guarantee on that front.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000384"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I shall speak to amendment 43 first. This touches
on a point I raised in the clause stand part debate about the treatment
of UK to UK dividends. Under existing rules all distributions from UK
companies are non-taxable, but new section 930A presumes that they are
taxable unless they are exempt. The Minister acknowledged that it was
the threat of challenge under EU rules that gave rise to that equality
of treatment between UK and non-UK distributions. That is a topic that
I will come back to under the next clause as
well.</div><a name="090609124000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
established that all distributions are taxable, there is then a series
of exemptions from that tax. If an exemption is met, no tax is payable
on those dividends.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>That is very straightforward. Where the problem arises is that in some
cases there is a difference in treatment between distributions and
dividends. The titles of the five exempt classes demonstrate that.
There are three related distributions, which relate to controlled
companies, non-redeemable ordinary shares and portfolio holdings, but
also limited dividends from transactions not designed to reduce tax and
dividends in respect of shares accounted for as liabilities.</div>
<a name="090609124000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
stems from the exclusion, in new section 930A(2), of a distribution of
a capital nature. The feedback I have received is that the principles
for that exclusion are relatively untested. To determine whether a
distribution is of a capital nature, they would have to be tested
against some very unclear case law. There are certainly some cases
where distributions that were previously exempt will no longer be so
under the new provisions and that will increase uncertainty in some
fairly common transactions. Amendment 43 says that all distributions
currently falling under section 209 of the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988 should continue to be exempt, so that there is a continuity of
treatment between the old regime and the current regime.</div>
<a name="090609124000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
48, which I have also tabled in this group, deals with a small
companies exemption. Schedule 14 provides for two regimes:
one for small companies and one for medium and large companies.
Schedule 14 provides a definition of a small company in new section
930R. However, it creates a degree of uncertainty as to whether a small
company is a small company in the year of the dividend accounting
period. My amendment seeks to create some certainty by referring back
to the accounts of the previous accounting period to determine whether
a small company is a small company. Rather than the uncertainty of new
section 930R inserted by the schedule, which looks at the current
accounting period, amendment 48 refers to the previous accounting
period to give the taxpayer greater
certainty.</div><a name="090609124000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000385"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Schedule 14 provides the new exemption, which we
have been discussing, from corporation tax for dividends and other
distributions from foreign companies. It amends the rules on taxation
of distributions received from UK companies. The exemption will remove
the need for groups to make complex double tax relief calculations and
will allow profits to be repatriated, even in circumstances in which
there would not have been enough double tax relief to eliminate a UK
tax liability. Until now, when there was insufficient credit for
foreign tax, overseas profits would typically stay offshore, with cash
possibly being returned in the form of an upstream loan. Alternatively,
groups might have adopted complicated, artificial ways of repatriating
such profits other than through a dividend. Exemption will sweep all
that away and allow for immediate repatriation of profits and the
return of cash by dividend. That will enhance the attractiveness of the
UK as a location for the headquarters of multinational
businesses.</div><a name="090609124000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rules will apply to distributions received by all companies in the UK,
including small companies, which was not part of the original proposal.
The rules for small companies are distinct from the rules for medium
and large companies, but, in each case, the vast majority of all
dividends and other distributions will benefit from the exemption. That
protection, alongside that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>contained in clause 40 and schedule 19, which deal with personal
dividend taxation, are a proportionate response to the risk of abuse of
the exemption by small companies&#151;the protection set out in the
schedule. However, we will keep a close eye on the matter and take
immediate action if any avoidance activity is
identified.</div><a name="090609124000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham moved amendment 43 on capital distribution.
Schedule 14 applies only to distributions of an income nature. The
amendment would increase its scope so that it applied to most capital
distributions as well. However, schedule 14 is concerned only with the
taxation of distributions that represent income. Nothing in the
schedule will cause any capital distribution that is currently exempt
to become taxable, so there is no reason to extend the scope of the
exemption as suggested. The legislation does nothing to alter the
taxation of capital distributions that are excluded from the scope of
proposed new part 9A of the Corporation Tax Act 2009. There is already
an exemption for capital distributions, known as the substantial
shareholdings exemption. It is not part of this Bill to change in any
way the scope of that exemption, so I hope that he will accept that the
amendment is not
appropriate.</div><a name="090609124000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman explained, amendment 48 would alter the definition
of a small company. However, in doing so, it would change the standard
definition used to determine whether exemption follows the small
company rules or the rules applicable to larger companies. The
legislation uses the standard European Commission definition of a small
company, which includes a time lag whereby a company that changes from
small to medium sized retains the status of &#147;small&#148; in
the transition year but becomes a medium company the following year. A
similar rule applies if a company moves down in size from medium to
small. The amendment would delay the change of status by a further full
year. That would be an additional complication and make it less likely
that the appropriate legislation for that size of company was applied.
I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is an unhelpful
additional complication.</div>
<a name="090609124000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
Government amendments in this group are concerned with a rule that
denies exemption if a foreign tax deduction is given for the
distribution, on the basis that a distribution that is tax deductible
represents a deduction from taxable profits rather than distribution of
those profits. Therefore, it is closer to an interest receipt than a
distribution and would be expected to give rise to a taxable receipt
for the recipient. The rule denying exemption is extended to cases
where amounts determined by reference to a distribution are tax
deductible. That ensures that the rule cannot be side-stepped by the
use of indirect tax deductions obtained through avoidance schemes. The
change will also enable some simplification of the manufactured
dividend rules, which no longer require a specific exception. I
therefore recommend that Government amendments 92, 93, 99,101 and 102
to schedule 14 be accepted. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not
press amendments 43 and 48.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000389"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The amendments cover several issues. Amendment 44
deals with the exemptions in proposed new section
930E&#151;&#147;Distributions from controlled companies&#148;. I
am concerned that in introducing this measure the Government have
omitted some of the existing tests for controlled companies. It refers
to holdings which, for a variety of reasons, may be split between
various groups of companies but in aggregate mean that the company has
control.</div><a name="090609124000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing tests
read:</div><a name="090609124000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(c)
if the person is resident in the United Kingdom, rights and powers of
any person who is resident in the United Kingdom and connected with the
person;
and</div><a name="090609124000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d)
if the person is resident in the United Kingdom, rights and powers
which for the purposes of subsection (5) above would be attributed to a
person who is resident in the United Kingdom and connected with the
person (a &#145;UK connected person&#146;) if the UK connected
person were himself the
person.&#148;</div><a name="090609124000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation here is that the ownership of subsidiaries may be split so
that neither of the owners have control within the basic provisions of
controlled foreign companies legislation, but taken together they would
have control. If we do not replicate this in subsections 6(c) and (d),
those dividends would fall outside the exemption and would therefore be
taxable. It is not clear why the change has taken place. The
explanatory notes suggest that the definitions replicate the CFC rules,
but this exclusion for indirect ownerships suggests that that is not
the case. The amendments try to address that by enabling shareholdings
held through non-resident affiliates to be aggregated
together.</div>
<a name="090609124000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 49
refers to the issue of redeemable shares. In the UK ordinary shares are
assumed not to be redeemable. One concern is that the law in other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>jurisdictions is not as clear as in the UK, so there would be a risk
that a distribution might be taxable when it should not be. My
amendments seek to clarify that point and I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments. If there is an issue about people using
redeemable ordinary shares, is it not better to tackle it through an
anti-avoidance route rather than the provisions in proposed new section
930F?</div>
<a name="090609124000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
170 is a drafting amendment that seeks alignment: subsection (1) of
proposed new section 930H refers to a dividend only, whereas subsection
(1) of proposed new section 930G refers to a &#147;dividend or other
distribution&#148;. Assuming that there is no reason for this
difference, the amendment would simply correct a drafting
error.</div><a name="090609124000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000390"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I wish to speak against amendment 44. I understand
that it replaces reference to Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
provisions with the words,
</div><a name="090609124000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
resident in the United Kingdom&#148;</div>
<a name="090609124000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">and &#147;person
who&#148;. This is undesirable because the vagueness of UK residency
requirements can lead to individuals exploiting distributions from
controlled foreign companies and achieving tax advantages. The
legislation is best left as it stands. I understand that there are
difficulties at the moment in equating certain well-known Tory
donors&#146; residency with their tax situation, and bringing
residency into this is
unsatisfactory.</div><a name="090609124000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000391"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Chapter 3 of the schedule introduces a set of
exempt classes, and the amendments in this group, as we have heard, all
act to increase the scope of the exempt classes in various ways. The
idea of the exempt classes is to give exemption in circumstances where
the risk of avoidance is low. The benefit is that the anti-avoidance
rules can be targeted at narrow situations rather than being of general
application. That is a significant benefit and I am cautious about
extending exempt classes because of the risk of losing some of that
benefit.</div>
<a name="090609124000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 44
would increase the scope of the exempt class for controlled companies
in a way that would allow a distribution to fall within an exempt class
even if the payer of the distribution was not within the scope of the
CFC legislation. That exempt class gives exemption to more than 90 per
cent. of dividends by value. It takes a simple and direct route to
exemption for controlled companies, which is possible because the CFC
rules protect against artificial diversion of profits. The protection
reduces the risk that this exempt class might be abused by avoidance
schemes and allows it to be free of any other conditions for
exemption.</div>
<a name="090609124000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect
of the amendment would be to allow the rights and powers of a connected
foreign company to be taken into account in determining whether the
payer of a distribution is a controlled company. Therefore, a
distribution paid by a company controlled outside the UK&#151;and
therefore outside the scope of CFC defences&#151;could be brought
within this exempt class, so there is a potential danger of an
unacceptable fiscal risk. The attribution was limited to UK companies,
and that brought the risk of another EU legal challenge. The extension
of that to all companies would have brought unacceptable risks and
hence we removed it
altogether.</div>

noon</div><a name="090609124000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000392"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is the Minister certain that a significant risk is
attached? I understand that the rules were in place under the existing
regime. They allowed non-UK affiliates to be taken into account in
determining whether the basic control rules were met. We seem to have
shifted away from that. I am concerned that the Minister is taking a
potential threat and using it in support of the changes, rather than
recognising that the rules currently permit that aggregation to assess
whether control has been in place. He has not justified as robustly as
we would expect why we should move away from that
position.</div><a name="090609124000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000393"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> What I understand the hon. Gentleman to be asking
is whether there is a real risk of EU challenge from the arrangement as
it was. We have been very careful throughout the exercise to ensure
that we are absolutely secure from any challenge under EU law, because
such a challenge would create uncertainty which would be in
nobody&#146;s interest. I am not aware of anyone proposing to mount a
challenge, but the way in which we have arranged this now means that we
can be absolutely certain that there will not be a challenge. That is
an important bolstering of the confidence with which people will be
able to operate once the arrangements are in place, and is a worthwhile
protection against
challenge.</div><a name="090609124000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
45 and 49 would remove one of the two conditions required for exemption
in the second class, which applies to distributions paid on
non-redeemable ordinary shares. This class is relevant where the first
class is unavailable because the CFC rules do not apply. An ordinary
share is one that carries no preferential rights. The reason for the
restriction is that in the absence of CFC defences, preferential rights
attached to shares may be used to allow distribution exemption to be
used to convert what would otherwise be taxable profits into exempt
dividends. We need that when ordinary shares are not redeemable, since
the right to redeem share capital might otherwise be used to provide an
alternative form of preference for the shareholders, and we think that
that would represent an unacceptable fiscal
risk.</div><a name="090609124000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should remind the Committee that a dividend that does not fall into the
exempt class can still qualify for exemption. A dividend will always be
exempt if it is not derived from transactions designed to reduce UK
tax. That is the effect of the later part of chapter 3. The exempt
class provides a simple route to exemption for many dividends, but it
is not the only route&#151;there is also a fall-back. I suggest that
the amendments are not necessary and would create a significant
avoidance
risk.</div><a name="090609124000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
turning to amendment 170, I should say again that there is a fall-back
exempt class that ensures that dividends paid in wholly commercial
circumstances are always exempt. The exempt class is based on a test of
the profits out of which a dividend is paid. Exemption is given,
provided that the profits do not derive from transactions designed to
reduce UK tax. A dividend is necessarily paid out of profits, but the
same cannot be said for other types of distribution. Since the class is
a test of profits and not directly a test of the distribution, it is
limited to
dividends.</div><a name="090609124000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am satisfied that amendment 170 is not necessary to enable all
commercially derived profits to be repatriated in a tax-free form,
which is our aim. The extension to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>non-dividend distribution would create risks because of the lack of a
necessary link between the distribution and the profits. I hope that on
that basis the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="090609124000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000394"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The areas that we are seeking to legislate on are
obviously complex. The Financial Secretary has said that there are
fall-backs that would allow distributions to be exempt in particular
circumstances. It would have been helpful, where possible, to have
drawn together on that. I do not understand why he objects to amendment
170; if a distribution is not designed to reduce tax, why is that not
part of the clause? There is a danger that the dividing line that the
Minister is seeking to draw between what should and should not be
exempt will become quite
complex.</div><a name="090609124000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary is yet to give a robust explanation for why it is
not appropriate, in relation to amendment 44 for example, to repeat the
foreign affiliates rules in the existing CFC legislation, but we will
not dwell on that. Part of the challenge with schedules 14 and 15 is
that they have been heavily amended in the past few days, and I think
that people need more time to think through some of the consequences. I
am sure that that will be one of the themes that will emerge in later
consideration. We are in danger of giving outside bodies insufficient
time to think about the consequences of those changes and the knock-on
effects. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

speechlessness by the acceptance of the amendments. I just wish that
they were of a more substantive nature, as that would have shown that
the time of change had come after all. They correct drafting errors
where the Government have inappropriately used the word
&#147;dividend&#148; instead of &#147;distribution.&#148;
Proposed new section 930P refers to distributions in the context of
diversion of trade income, but the drafting refers intermittently to
&#147;dividends&#148; and &#147;distributions&#148;, and we
have already discussed circumstances in which either

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000403"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Amendments 50 and 100 centre on the way in which
double taxation relief is given in the rare cases in which a dividend
is taxable. Government amendment 100 deals with the interaction between
the rules in part 9A that apply to taxable dividends and the double
taxation relief rules. If a dividend is paid out of profits that have
been subject to foreign tax, the double taxation relief rules allow the
foreign tax to be given as a credit against the UK tax due on the
dividend to ensure that the same income is not taxed twice. The rules
currently allow a large amount of choice in the specification of the
profits out of which the dividend is paid, which is important because
the foreign tax paid on the specified profits determines the amount of
foreign tax credit available. The distribution exemption schedule
includes an anti-avoidance rule that considers the source of the
profits out of which a dividend is paid. If those profits result from
transactions designed to reduce UK tax, the dividend will be taxable in
the
UK.</div><a name="090609124000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the Bill was published, it has been brought to our attention that there
is a risk that avoidance schemes might exploit the mismatch between how
profits are specified for the purpose of the anti-avoidance rule and
how they are specified for the purpose of double tax relief rules. The
amendment therefore overrules the usual choice available in the double
tax relief rules. It will ensure that, where a dividend is taxable in
the UK because it is paid out of the profits of tax avoidance, double
tax relief available on that dividend will be calculated by reference
to those same profits. The amendment will remove a significant risk of
tax avoidance exploiting a mismatch whereby a dividend intended to be
taxed would escape any effective taxation.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div><a name="090609124000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps if
the hon. Member for Fareham speaks to amendment 50, I will be able to
respond
later.</div><a name="090609124000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000404"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Amendment 50 deals with new section 930Q, which
allows a company to make an election that a particular distribution
that would otherwise be exempt should instead be taxable. The
explanatory notes state that the two reasons why a company might wish
to make such an exemption are
that</div><a name="090609124000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;dividends
can only be taken into account for the purposes of the CFC acceptable
distribution policy (ADP) exemption if they are subject to
tax&#148;</div><a name="090609124000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="090609124000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is possible that exemption could lead to an increased rate of
withholding
tax.&#148;</div><a name="090609124000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
9 of schedule 14 amends the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to
delete the onshore pooling rules and the rules that allow for relief in
relation to eligible unrelieved foreign tax. The provisions are an
integral part of the credit system of taxation and it is appropriate
that they should no longer apply to dividends following the
introduction of the exemption regime; there is logic in that.</div>
<a name="090609124000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a
taxpayer may elect for dividends to fall outside the exemption regime.
Therefore, a corporate taxpayer may elect for a dividend to be taxable
in the UK if it is paid by a company resident in a territory with which
the UK has a double tax treaty. The provisions that reduce or eliminate
foreign withholding tax apply only if the dividend is subject to tax in
the UK&#151;the sort of scheme where one might want to have a taxable
rather than an exempt dividend. The expectation is that where people
take advantage of that election, they should also be able to take
advantage of the existing rules on onshore pooling and the use of
eligible unrelieved foreign tax. Amendment 50 would enable people who
take the election under new section 930Q to take advantage of the rules
on onshore pooling and the use of unrelieved foreign
tax.</div>
<a name="090609124000307"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000405"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> A principal purpose of the legislation is to
simplify the process of paying dividends to the UK. Amendment 50 would
retain a significant body of complicated legislation on onshore pooling
rules. I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that it would do
so with little, or possibly no, benefit. It would retain the onshore
pooling rules solely for the benefit of those dividends that a company
elects to be taxable. Why would a company do that? The two most likely
reasons are to obtain lower rates of foreign withholding tax and,
during a transitional period, to allow dividends to qualify for the ADP
exemption from controlled foreign company legislation, which we will
come to
later.</div><a name="090609124000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the onshore pooling rules can apply to withholding tax, by far their
main application is in connection with underlying tax. It is rare that
dividends that qualify for underlying tax credit also suffer
withholding tax, because intra-group dividends are generally exempt
from such taxes. ADP dividends are in all cases excluded from onshore
pooling. It is not justified to retain onshore pooling and the
significant amount of legislation on that for that very limited
purpose. The rules were introduced in 2001 to balance the introduction
of the so-called  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>mixer cap. That need has been removed by dividend exemption, so the
rationale for the onshore pooling rules will end as well. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman feels that he can withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="090609124000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000406"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister has given a satisfactory explanation
and his point about the change to the mixer cap arrangements suggests
that the onshore pooling arrangements are no longer necessary. Although
I have not moved amendment 50, when the time comes I will not press it
to a Division.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000407"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want clarification on some of the technical
aspects of the schedule that we have not touched on. The schedule comes
into effect on 1 July 2009, which is slightly odd. It will be difficult
to do given that the Bill will not receive Royal Assent until after
that date, but that is how we are making tax policy. There have been
concerns about the impact of that date. Does the commencement date make
it more difficult for foreign companies to meet the acceptable
distribution policy?</div>
<a name="090609124000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
changes to the Corporation Tax Act 2009 mean that from 1
July 2009, dividends can only be specified as being paid from the
profits of the current period. When no profits are specified, the
dividend will be treated as having been paid from the profits of the
last period for which accounts were drawn up. That suggests that it be
difficult for companies to qualify for the acceptable distribution
exemption. In addition, a company accounting period that straddles 1
July 2009 will be, as a whole, under the controlled foreign companies
rules. That may end up with CFCs trying to run other exemptions to get
their dividends through.</div>
<a name="090609124000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">PricewaterhouseCoopers
suggested that a straddled period should be treated as split only in
cases when a company pursues an acceptable distribution policy in
respect of the first period, or for which an exempt activity holding
company is claimed in the first period but not thereafter. Will the
Minister clarify how the commencement date impacts on companies seeking
to use the existing rules?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div><a name="090609124000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
disconnect between the sourcing rules in part 2 and other rules on the
treatment of dividends. Are the rules consistent with the acceptable
distribution policy? Will the Minister comment on the taxation of
foreign permanent establishments, which has not yet been fully
addressed? Where are the Government in that
process?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000408"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We have had a helpful discussion on the schedule
and the amendments. The new exemption from corporation tax for
dividends and other distributions received from foreign companies which
is introduced by the schedule is a key element of the package to
enhance the attractiveness of the UK as a location for multinational
businesses. As the hon. Gentleman said, it takes effect from 1 July
2009.</div><a name="090609124000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say in passing that we have thought very carefully about the
implementation dates of the various parts of the package. Therefore, as
we will discuss shortly, we are introducing the debt cap for an
accounting period which will begin on or after 1 January 2010, so that
businesses have time to prepare. That the measure is being introduced
later than the dividend exemption has been widely welcomed.</div>
<a name="090609124000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked about transitional arrangements. Any profits accrued in
a foreign subsidiary before the package comes into force can be paid
out as an ADP dividend and remain subject to the current rules, which
may be a helpful
clarification.</div><a name="090609124000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Considering
the tax treatment of branches would have raised more issues and
diverted attention away from the main point, which is the taxation of
foreign dividends. We will bear branches in mind when we look at future
options for controlled foreign companies, but we will not consider the
treatment of foreign branches in detail until after the consideration
and reform of the CFC
rules.</div><a name="090609124000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one further point to make about the interaction with the ADP
exemption. Amendment 100 removes the restriction on double taxation
relief. Amendment to the CFC changes in schedule 16, which we will come
to, will allow the split period to also be treated as split for the
purpose of double taxation relief. There was indeed a problem in the
area highlighted by the hon. Gentleman when the Bill was initially
drafted, but I think that that has been solved by the various changes
that we will debate
today.</div><a name="090609124000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000409"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is an important clause. A number of issues
have emerged since it was tabled, including the number of Government
amendments to it. The extensive nature of the new rules on
anti-avoidance and financial services groups is also important and
needs to be addressed.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>However, I want to say something more broadly about the debt cap,
because it is has given rise to some concern about what sort of
behaviour it will incentivise. Is it the best way to tackle the issue
that concerns the Government? Are we at risk of introducing a
cumbersome process that will add to the compliance cost of business?
Let me talk through some of those issues.</div>
<a name="090609124000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister indicated in the debate on clause 34 stand part, some of the
cost of the dividend exemption has been offset by the introduction of
the debt cap. That leads to interesting issues as to whether those
reforms are linked, in the sense that if clause 34 is introduced, does
clause 35 have to be introduced, or are the reforms taking place in
parallel, with one raising revenue and one leading to a loss of revenue
just a matter of convenience rather than a matter of planning how the
tax structure will work? Clearly, when the debate about the taxation of
foreign profits started in 2007, the Government had other ideas about
how to tackle some of the behavioural challenges that arose from it. It
was only when the original ideas on the control of companies ran into a
degree of flak that they then moved on to the debt
cap.</div><a name="090609124000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the worldwide debt cap is to target situations in which a UK
group bears more debt than is required to finance the worldwide group.
In addition, the measure could provide an effective means of targeting
many upstream loans to the UK that are used to repatriate overseas
cash. However, in order to protect those groups that are temporarily
cash rich, the Government intend to allow the worldwide debt cap
measure to be set aside where the group is in a short-term cash-rich
position. Of course, that stems from the point that has been quite
widely debated over several years that the UK has a very generous
regime for interest expense&#151;it is fully deductible. It is one of
the issues that has perhaps led to an increase in leverage among a
number of companies over the course of recent years and has certainly
led to concern about whether it has incentivised a particular type of
behaviour.</div>
<a name="090609124000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Government flagged up last year that that is what they wanted to do,
there is still concern about the workability of the proposals. Deloitte
said:</div><a name="090609124000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Unfortunately
the provisions remain very complex and represent a major compliance
burden for groups even if they will have no ultimate disallowance of
interest.&#148;</div><a name="090609124000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Adding
32 pages of tax codes could make the risk overly burdensome. The
Institute of Chartered Accountants believes this matter could have been
addressed in other
ways:</div><a name="090609124000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that the same policy objectives, which are to prevent the
&#145;dumping&#146; of debt into the UK part of worldwide
operations and the penalisation of upstream loans to the UK, could
equally well be achieved by tightening up the existing thin
capitalisation regime and introducing targeted rules against upstream
loans.&#148;</div><a name="090609124000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="090609124000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could
other policy routes have been used to tackle unnecessary upstreaming
that would not have added to the compliance burden on businesses? In
the brief stand part debate, the Minister referred to the different
commencement date for the debt cap arrangements. Will the gap between
commencement dates be used for further consultation and to explore the
alternative solutions, or are the Government determined to take this
route?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div><a name="090609124000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
original proposals were published in draft last year, there has been
movement by the Government and some of the complexity has been ironed
out. However, UK-only groups will still be caught by the measure and
will have to go through some compliance steps, which is regrettable.
The proposals are meant to deal with debt that is incurred outside the
UK by international groups, yet it appears from the drafting that UK
companies will have to pay unnecessary additional
taxes.</div><a name="090609124000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debt cap places restrictions on the relief given to UK companies that
form part of a worldwide group relating to the interest and finance
expenses on transactions with related companies. The extent of that
restriction on the intra-group interest and finance costs will depend
on the external financing costs of the worldwide group. The Chartered
Institute of Taxation questions why those restrictions are required,
saying
that</div><a name="090609124000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not clear to us why these provisions are required at all in addition
to the many existing rules which are intended to restrict interest
relief in certain situations, including transfer pricing, arbitrage
provisions
and&#148;</div><a name="090609124000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">provisions
of the Finance Act 1996. Both CIOT and ICAEW have concerns about the
Government&#146;s
approach.</div><a name="090609124000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister suggested that the proposal was a move towards a more
territorial system of taxation, and he is right: it is only a move
towards that. It has not been fully articulated as the end point. Will
he clarify whether we should move to a territorial system of taxation
and whether the proposal is a staging post along that route or the end
of such movement? If it is a staging post, what does he think the next
moves should
be?</div><a name="090609124000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a more fundamental concern about the impact of the measures on
businesses. I have talked about compliance costs and about whether
there are other ways to tackle the concern about loading UK-based
companies with high levels of debt. There have been a number of
comments from business and outside advisers about how the proposal will
affect the way in which companies are structured and
financed.</div><a name="090609124000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Society has suggested that the proposals might encourage UK groups
to incur more debt; encourage multinationals to transfer assets out of
the UK; discourage inward investment into the UK; put over-leveraged
companies at an advantage over cash-rich companies in making
acquisitions in the UK; and discourage outward investment. I shall
illustrate just one of those points, as it is quite important to
reflect on the potential outcome. We could have a situation in which a
UK-based company is being targeted by two potential acquirers. One
could be an overseas company that is cash rich, but it would seek to
finance its acquisition of the company through intra-group loans.
Alternatively, there could be a highly-leveraged private equity
situation, where there is quite a high level of external debt. Again,
the company in that situation would use debt to finance the acquisition
of the original UK-based
company.</div><a name="090609124000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern that has been expressed to me is that, because the overseas
parent company is cash rich, it has low levels of external debt or, as
in this case, no external debt. The restriction on debt
interest&#151;the worldwide debt cap&#151;would kick in on that
company. By contrast, if the UK company was acquired by a
highly-leveraged private equity fund that had external debt, the fund
would be able to use debt; it would not face the restriction on the
deductibility of interest that the cash-rich non-UK  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>company would face. As a consequence, it could borrow more to fund that
acquisition; it could pay a higher price to acquire that other
company.</div>
<a name="090609124000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
one of the concerns expressed recently has been about over-leverage in
the markets, we seem to have a situation here whereby the proposed
measures could encourage more leverage, rather than encourage companies
to have significant cash resources, whether those resources are
acquired through the retention of profits or through arranging money
via share issues. The behavioural issues are causing some concern to
outside bodies, and this could be an opportunity for the Minister to
explain the Treasury&#146;s view.</div>
<a name="090609124000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it&#151;I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong&#151;we are the only country that has introduced a worldwide
debt cap. Other jurisdictions have considered introducing some cap on
tax deductibility debt within their own jurisdiction, but not outside
it. Deloitte
suggests:</div><a name="090609124000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
introduction of the debt cap cannot be regarded as a move which will
enhance and support UK competitiveness and this aspect of the policy
design of the debt cap seems more likely to damage the UK&#146;s
competitive position than to enhance
it.&#148;</div><a name="090609124000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Minister prepared to comment on that assessment?</div>
<a name="090609124000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue that I want to touch on relates to the compliance cost. I alluded
to the fact that purely UK groups would also have to go through the
process of calculating what their external financing is, even though
they do not have any non-UK business. As I understand it, the problem
is the gateway test that has been used. When the measures were
originally consulted on, it was suggested that there would be a number
of gateway tests, one of which would enable a purely UK group to avoid
going through that process of calculating external finance. Will the
Minister explain why there is to be only one gateway
test?</div><a name="090609124000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation suggests that the reason why there is
only one gateway test is our old friend, EU law, which we discussed in
relation to the last schedule. It was said that EU law aims to ensure
that the arrangements are waterproof and free of the possibility of
legal challenge, which would mean that we will end up putting an
additional burden on UK-only groups that should not really apply, given
the nature of the debt cap rules. I should be grateful if the Minister
explained why we have only one gateway
test.</div><a name="090609124000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
themes run through the general commentary on the measure. First, is it
the best way to tackle the issue of the upstreaming of loans into the
UK? Secondly, is the compliance cost too great? That partly links back
to the fact that there is only one gateway test, which means that
UK-only groups are caught by the measure. Thirdly&#151;the problem
that exercises a number of people&#151;the measure could perversely
lead to companies taking on more external debt, but would be to the
detriment of inbound investment into the UK and perhaps outbound
investment,
too.</div><a name="090609124000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090609124000410"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
echo the words of my hon. Friend in introducing the subject. I ask the
Minister for an indication of the Treasury&#146;s broader thinking.
No one can dispute that it is quite acceptable at times to utilise the
tax system to incentivise or disincentivise certain behaviours.
However, my concern is that the worldwide debt cap that has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>put in place in the whole regime, rather short-sightedly, simply reacts
to the specific economic problems of today, instead of looking at the
long-term future.</div>
<a name="090609124000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
Finance Bill every year and I suppose that it is quite legitimate for
any Government on a short-term basis to put such a regime in place to
deal with the problems of the day, which can then be done away with in
a year or two&#146;s time, but the proposed regime obviously adds an
extra layer of complexity, not least because the worldwide debt cap
applies to global companies&#151;companies with significant interests
here in the UK, but which also have operations overseas. Given that it
is a worldwide debt cap, I would be interested to have some indication
from the Treasury as to precisely what negotiations have taken place
with other countries and whether the measure is part and parcel of a
concerted international process.</div>
<a name="090609124000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
worry that the measure may have been put in place because of the
present problems. I accept that the genesis may not lie in September
2008, but may be found a little bit before that. That raises the
obvious question that my hon. Friend mentioned in relation to the
private equity industry. In many ways, we have seen a skewing of the
tax system over the past decade or so: extremely low tax rates have
made the putting of debt on to the balance sheet a much more attractive
proposition. We are moving away from that now, and the Minister will
rightly point out that, in the present climate, he wants to
disincentivise having a hell of a lot of debt on the balance sheet.
That may be an academic point, because I suspect that many private
equity providers will not be able to get that much debt on their
balance sheet, even if they want to. Many private equity players have
problems, but because of the lack of liquidity they are trying to raise
relatively small sums of money for debt-for-equity swaps. That is
probably a more desirable way to run those businesses in the longer
term.</div>
<a name="090609124000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above all, I
am keen to know what the Treasury&#146;s broad thinking is. Is this a
short-term measure given our specific problems at the moment, or is it
part of a longer-term regime to incentivise longer-term behaviours in
relation to
debt?</div>
<a name="090609124000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000411"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I rise to be constructive about clause 35 and the
schedule that follows. It seems to be about the understanding of
complex companies and their financial footprint. That is highly
desirable. It ensures that profits are appropriately taxed and placed.
It ensures that parent companies are identified. It is not always easy
to find the parent company of a subsidiary. It is also mindful of the
need to avoid double taxation. It is an exceptionally difficult area.
The difficulty is well illustrated by the number of Treasury amendments
that have appeared since the legislation was put before us. It also
seems to me to be about an area on which most of us cannot directly
comment. It is highly technical. Schedule 15 refers to things such as
staple companies and stranded deficits. It also incorporates a fair
amount of algebra, which other Members may be able to explain, but I
certainly cannot.</div>
<a name="090609124000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="090609124000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also fundamentally about imposing international accountancy
standards fairly rigorously, which I welcome. That is a recipe for
business efficiency. People talk about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>tax efficiency as though it is the same as business efficiency, but when
companies such as Amazon export things to Jersey in order to import
them back into the country, one realises that the pursuit of tax
efficiency can be quite different from efficient business
practice.</div>
<a name="090609124000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments and concerns with clause 35 are ones that we will hear in
connection with any clause of this nature. People always talk about
compliance benefits and capital flow. Those arguments are used so often
that it is almost like crying wolf. One wants to know whether there is
any credibility attached to the complaints here. It seems that some of
the more vocal people voicing these concerns are those who are prepared
to pay huge sums of money on tax advisers. Surely that could go some
way towards meeting the client&#146;s
costs.</div><a name="090609124000258"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000412"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> In the previous clause we discussed the dividend
exemption&#151;the cornerstone of this package&#151;and the
benefits to business of its introduction. The dividend exemption will
come at a cost of tax forgone and could also lead to multinational
groups taking undue advantage of those generous UK interest relief
rules referred to by the hon. Member for Fareham. Clause 35 in schedule
15 introduces a limited restriction on the deductibility of interest in
computing taxable profits.</div>
<a name="090609124000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000413"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister explain a little further the link
that he perceives between the dividend exemption rules and this
particular clause? If this is about a group trying to transfer money
into the UK, it could now make a distribution or pay a dividend that
was tax free. How does he think that that is going to lead to greater
use of upstreaming of loans into the
UK?</div><a name="090609124000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000414"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will respond directly to the point and argue that
these two measures do indeed belong together. I will explain why in a
moment and will also answer the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster. We are introducing a clear and fair principle to be
applied to the treatment of interest for UK tax purposes. The UK is
prepared to allow finance expense in calculating the UK profits of a
group up to the amount of the group&#146;s entire worldwide external
finance cost. That is a very generous rule by international standards,
but it does prevent groups putting more debt into the UK than they have
borrowed externally for their worldwide business. I want to be sure
that the Committee has grasped that fundamental point. We are saying
that companies will not be permitted under this arrangement to put more
debt into the UK than they have actually borrowed across the whole
world in gross terms. It is clear that that is a pretty generous
constraint compared to others that we might have applied.</div>
<a name="090609124000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">How and why
does that measure belong with the dividend exemption? There are a
couple of points on that. First, as we discussed earlier, there is a
revenue gain from the debt cap to offset from the revenue loss
resulting from dividend exemption; but dividend exemption would also
open up potentially large avoidance opportunities, and the debt cap
provides the limitation in a principled and relatively straightforward
way to address that. It is certainly a simple idea in principle: a
company should not charge in the UK more debt than it has across the
whole world. The conclusion that we drew from the consultation over the
past couple of years is that it is the most straightforward in practice
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>well as in principle. I do not claim that the measure has no complexity
or that it is absolutely obvious how it applies in every case, but it
is more straightforward than the
alternatives.</div><a name="090609124000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster raised an interesting
point. I do not see this as a short-term measure. It is certainly not
part of our fiscal consolidation, for example, if that is what he was
suggesting. It addresses a general problem of companies putting too
much debt into the UK, which could become more prevalent once dividend
exemption applies. So, the two measures belong logically together, and
not just from the point of view of the measure providing some
additional revenue that will be forgone as a result of dividend
exemption.</div><a name="090609124000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000415"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am still at a loss as to exactly where the link
is between the two. I understand completely why the increased revenue
that will come from the worldwide debt cap is there, and why it could
be used to offset the losses that arise from the dividend exemption.
However, the Minister is yet to demonstrate the linkage. What mischief
will be created by introducing a dividend exemption policy that could
be made worse by the tax deductibility of interest in the UK? The
Minister has asserted strongly that there is a link, but has not given
an example of a transaction that could suffer&#151;he might have one
in his hands as we speak. It would help to know exactly how he sees the
two things linked, other than simply through offsetting losses and
gains of
tax.</div><a name="090609124000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000416"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> What we have generally seen in the current regime
is that companies use upstream loans to offset their tax liability on
foreign dividends. With dividends to the UK exempt from UK tax, there
is no case for allowing interest relief for loans to the UK because
dividends can be paid instead. The two things belong together: dividend
exemption could lead to business reorganisations that take advantage of
both dividend exemption and the generous UK interest relief rules. We
need to have measures in place to prevent
that.</div><a name="090609124000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000417"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister tell the Committee what
proportion of intra-group loans upstream of the UK is there to tackle
the issue of the tax payable on dividends in the existing regime, and
what proportion is there for normal financing arrangements, for when an
acquisition has been funded for example? A more factual basis for the
Minister&#146;s argument would help if we are to be convinced that
there is a real reason why the two measures are linked, other than
simply to offset
revenue.</div><a name="090609124000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000418"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not have those figures. From the point of view
of HMRC, it is not always clear&#151;there is no particular reason
why it should be&#151;why a company is doing a particular thing. What
is certainly true is that a large amount of tax that would otherwise,
under the current regime, be payable on foreign dividends is offset by
the effect of upstream loans. I perfectly accept the point that there
are other reasons for having those loans, but it is a substantial
feature of multinational taxation currently that upstream loans offset
what would otherwise be tax paid on
dividends.</div><a name="090609124000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090609124000419"></a><b class="B">John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000420"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me just respond to some of the other questions
that the hon. Member for Fareham raised, and then I shall gladly give
way to his hon.
Friend.</div><a name="090609124000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham and a number of other people have made the
point that perhaps we could have achieved the constraint that we need
in other ways. It is true that there are alternative approaches that
can be adopted to address what you might call &#147;debt
dumping&#148;, but each would imply compliance burdens on business.
Before deciding that the debt cap was the right answer, we looked at
other possible approaches and found that each of them presented its own
challenges, and we concluded that the debt cap was the best way to
proceed. Other countries adopt other approaches, and the hon. Member
for Fareham has made the point that the UK is the first country to
adopt an arrangement of this kind, which is probably true. However, if
we look at the way such matters are handled in the US, our arrangement
is much more straightforward and its attractiveness may well become
apparent to other
jurisdictions.</div><a name="090609124000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether the gap in the commencement date between 1
July and 1 January would be used for further consultation. After much
consultation, we believe that the rules being introduced are
appropriate. It is, of course, true that we can use the period between
now and 1 January to listen to any remaining concerns, although I think
that all the material issues have been addressed. If there are any
other issues, people have the opportunity to raise
them.</div><a name="090609124000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000421"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000422"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me pause in answering the questions asked by
the hon. Member for Fareham. I will first give way to the hon. Member
for Henley before giving way to the hon. Member for
Wellingborough.</div><a name="090609124000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000423"></a>John
Howell:</b> I thank the Minister for his generosity in giving
way. He has said that it is not always possible to ascertain why
companies do something, yet there is a test in the provisions to decide
whether a loan has been taken out for a genuine commercial purpose.
What are the parameters of the test? The complexity of the issue has
also been raised. We have seen it go through a number of iterations in
draft legislation, and it is quite clear that we are still on a
journey. Will he tell us more about how that journey will be concluded?
Clearly, a lot of things in the provisions are still
inadequate.</div><a name="090609124000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000424"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman at all.
There certainly was concern at one stage with our proposals. We
discussed those concerns extensively and, in the discussions in which I
have been involved, there has been a general welcome for the progress
that has been made, and an acceptance that we now have a solution.
Indeed, on Second Reading, the shadow Chief Secretary generously paid
tribute to the consultation that had taken place and the conclusions
that we reached as a result of
it.</div><a name="090609124000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
I certainly do not agree with the hon. Member for Henley that the
relevant clauses, together with our amendments today, leave us with
legislation that is not ready&#151;it most certainly is ready. My
only point is that there will be a pause between Royal Assent for the
legislation and the debt cap taking effect. It is open to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>people to raise concerns if they have any, but I underline very strongly
that I think that we now have the answer that we
need.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000427"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I will give way to the hon. Member for Henley again
before giving way to the hon. Member for Wellingborough, just so we do
not lose our train of
thought.</div><a name="090609124000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000428"></a>John
Howell:</b> My point picked up on the comment made by the
Chartered Institution of Taxation that, without the full picture, it is
difficult to comment on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>whether we think that the whole package will work. CIOT clearly does not
think that it has the full
picture.</div><a name="090609124000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090609124000429"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Well, in terms of dividend exemption and the debt
cap, it does. As I have repeatedly made clear, we want to complete the
review of the CFC rules, which is an important next step. In response
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question about our journey towards a
territorial system of taxation, that review will be the next step in
that direction. On the narrow topics with which the four clauses under
discussion deal, the full picture is complete and in good
shape.</div><a name="090609124000281"></a>
