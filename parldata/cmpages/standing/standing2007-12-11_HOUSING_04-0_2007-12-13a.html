Chairman:
						</b> Order. For the benefit of
those beyond the Bar and outside the Committee Room, I need to set down
the ground rules again. First, welcome and thank you for joining us
this afternoon. Slightly discourteously, we remain seated, because if
we do not, we are off the microphones and not only <i class="I">Hansard</i> but
those listening on the webcast cannot hear us, so if you would be kind
enough to remain seated, as I am, that would be helpful. Secondly,
owing to the programme motion, by which we are bound, the evidence
session has to finish at 1.45 pm&#151;mid-sentence or no. That may
seem extraordinarily rude&#151;it probably is&#151;but that is the
way it
works.</div>
					<a name="07121369000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome this afternoon Adam Sampson, the chief executive of Shelter,
and Caroline Davey, deputy director of community policy and campaigns
at Shelter. The Chairman does not normally involve himself in the
proceedings, but I shall ask whether either of you would like to make a
brief&#151;I emphasise brief&#151;opening statement before we go
into the line of questioning from our parliamentary colleagues. The
Floor is yours.</div>

Sampson:

						</i> I shall be brief. First,
thank you for inviting us; it is a good opportunity for us to put our
views forward. Generally, we support the Bill and consider most of the
measures to be entirely appropriate. Although there may be some issues
about drafting in one or two places, generally we support the vast
majority of measures. One or two individual measures can be
strengthened, and, inevitably, we would not be Shelter unless we had a
shopping list of other demands that we wish to see in the Bill.
However, we are conscious of the need to move swiftly to enact the
legislation and not to delay matters. In our judgment, it is imperative
that the Government accelerate their programme of social house
building, and the Bill is a key step towards that, so we are anxious
not to delay its passage by bringing forward lots of extraneous
amendments, no matter how important they may individually appear to us.
We say that in the hope that there will be other opportunities for
housing legislation within the lifetime of this
Government.</div>

to my question. Given that we have a decent amount of
time&#151;although looking at it from the Opposition perspective, not
enough&#151;in which to bring forward constructive amendments, and
given that you have said that the Bill could be strengthened in several
areas, what would be the top two on your wish list of changes either to
add to or to subtract from the Bill?</div>

								Adam
Sampson:
							</b>
						</i> There are several. If you are asking us to
narrow them down to two, the first is to include in the legislation a
definition of overcrowding. Yesterday, the Minister for Housing, in a
very welcome way, committed the Government to move towards the bedroom
standard on overcrowding, which is the fulfilment of a promise that was
made for a new standard during the passage of the Housing Act 2004. It
has taken three years for the Government even to indicate what the new
standard will be. We have absolutely no doubt about Ministers&#146;
commitments to reaching a bedroom standard, but we recognise that there
will inevitably be timetable issues about how quickly that standard can
be embodied, as it has taken three years for the Government even to
give an indication of what the new standard will be. In view of the
time it has taken, we are sufficiently nervous about the historical
delay to think it would be extremely helpful if the ministerial
commitment given in the speech yesterday were included in legislation.
Yesterday&#146;s announcement of a review into the private rented
sector means that we will not be pushing for anything further on that
sector.</div>
					<a name="07121369000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I want to push for changes in the right-to-buy
legislation, although my colleague may disagree. Many areas would
benefit from a reduction in the maximum right-to-buy discount, in
particular council housing in designated areas with less than 3,000
inhabitants should be exempted from the right to buy. There is a
problem because of the almost total disappearance of council housing
from small rural communities, and it would be relatively simple to stem
that haemorrhage by exempting small local communities from the right to
buy. I would prioritise those two measures.</div>

George:
						</b> You have said that the announcement of a review
into the private rented sector was sufficient for you to believe that
it would not be necessary to amend the Bill to bring the private sector
within the proposed regulations for registered social landlords. Is
that sustainable in the long run, given the amount of casework that
Shelter deals with, especially in respect of the private rented sector?
Do you accept that, provided that it does not scare off the private
rented sector and is proportionate and appropriate, there is scope for
the application of some of the regulations to the private
sector?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>It would
certainly be helpful in considering the role of a regulator if the
framing of those regulations were sufficiently flexible to allow the
private rented sector to be brought under the ambit of that regulator
at a future time. However, I do not want to anticipate the outcome of a
full review of the private rented sector. Shelter&#146;s preferred
option is to have far greater regulation of the private rented sector,
and no one should be in any doubt about that. However, regulation needs
to be married with a package of incentives to encourage the further
development and professionalisation of the private rented sector. I
would not want to move swiftly to regulation without understanding the
package of incentives for decent landlords to remain in the sector.
Yes, frame the powers of the regulator sufficiently so that they can in
future be applied to the private rented sector too, if that is seen as
necessary and desirable, but postpone any decision on whether to do
that until the out-turn of the review of that
sector.</div>

						<i class="I">

								Adam
Sampson:
							</b>
						</i> A few years ago, Shelter, with the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation and some of the landlord bodies, put together a
commission on the private rented sector, which concluded that, by
changing the tax regime for private landlords to make being a private
landlord a business as opposed to something different, there would be
incentives for landlords that would allow them to accept greater
regulation. There was a trade-off, which the landlords we talked to
were willing to accept. We still think that that idea has considerable
potential, but we want it to be approached sensitively and properly as
a package, rather than rushing into one side without looking at the
other.</div>

							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): A quick
supplementary question, just to clarify where Shelter is coming from on
the regulation of the private rented sector. Are you arguing for
controlled rents and security of
tenure?</div>
					<a name="07121369000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Adam
Sampson:
							</b>
						</i> We are not at this stage, no. Security of
tenure is a profoundly interesting issue. At the moment, one matter
that really concerns us is the disjunction between the rights of
similar groups of people trying to secure social housing. If you manage
to get through the homelessness application route, for example, and be
accepted as homeless, if you are not fobbed off at an earlier stage,
you will end up having lifetime security of tenure and regulated rents.
If you do not manage to negotiate those hurdles, you end up in the
private rented sector with unregulated rents and only six
months&#146; security of
tenure.</div>
					<a name="07121369000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to us
that the two sectors need to be brought closer together. How to do
that, whether through rent regulation and legal extensions to security
of tenure in the private rented sector or through a package of
incentives and managing the market, is precisely the sort of stuff that
the review of the private rented sector needs to
determine.</div>

approach to the Bill and the broader housing reform context. Our sense
is that, while those measures are important and to a degree attractive,
although we have some detailed disagreements on some of the
report&#146;s conclusions, it would be better, on the assumption that
there is every likelihood of a second housing Bill in this Parliament,
to hold back fundamental reforms of that nature for a second Bill. They
could be taken forward simultaneously with any changes following the
Hills report or the outcome of the private rented sector commission,
and we could do the whole thing as a package rather than implementing
fundamental reforms in a piecemeal way, as you are

I am concerned by what you have said. I was not going to ask a
question&#151;I normally agree with what you say, Mr.
Sampson&#151;but you have just said that you believe that the two
types of tenure, public housing and private rented housing, should come
closer together. There have been bits of nibbling away at security of
tenure in the public and RSL sector, and there are rumours, including
in the context of the Bill, that that may continue. Could you make
clear Shelter&#146;s position on that? I hope that it is that you
support secure tenancies and assured tenancies, in so far as they give
that level of
protection.</div>

						</i> Our aim is to improve the quality of
security of tenure and management standards in the private housing
market, but should that be done by regulation or by a judicious package
of incentives? It is interesting to note that if you look at the higher
end of private renting, many landlords are anxious to offer longer-term
security of tenure to their tenants, because it guarantees good rental
streams. It is by no means an assumption that it is in the
landlord&#146;s interest to have very short-term tenure with a

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): I want to
take a slightly wider look at the whole question of the intermediate
market and low-cost home ownership. You have rightly highlighted the
problems facing people who want access to social housing, the shortages
and the long waiting lists. You have also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>highlighted the extent to which people who might like to buy are unable
to do so at the moment because of affordability issues. So there is
potentially a huge demand for the intermediate market. Why, in your
experience, have all the various models that have been tried over the
past 20 years&#151;the different low-cost home ownership
initiatives&#151;failed to produce something that is popular,
successful and taken up on the scale that you might expect, given the
demand?</div>

								Adam
Sampson:

						</i> When I first started in this job&#151;my
career up to this point was not in housing&#151;I was invited to be
on the home ownership taskforce and to chair its user group. This was
three or four years ago. As a preparation for that I sat and read
through the various low-cost home ownership products available
then&#151;they have since proliferated further. At the time, there
were 38 such products. At one point in my career, I was an Oxford
academic, yet I could not understand the vast majority of the products
as described.</div>
					<a name="07121369000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is certainly a marketing problem. It is very difficult as a consumer to
understand what it is you are being sold and its implications. When the
taskforce tested the impact of those products on consumers, the
consumer view of the worth to them of some of those products was by no
means complimentary. Some of the best established of them, such as
shared ownership, were reasonably unpopular with many consumers who saw
them as a very bad deal because, for example, even though you owned
only 50 per cent. of the equity of your house, you had 100 per cent. of
the upkeep and repair
obligations.</div>
					<a name="07121369000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
should add to that the fact that we do not yet have an adequate market
in many of these products, so it is difficult to sell on. The
proliferation of products means that it is difficult to know where you
go to get any one of them, so you have a very unsatisfactory situation.
So the problem is caused by a combination of poor product design from a
consumer point of view, poor marketing and selling of the products and
a bewildering proliferation of products with the absence of an
effective
market.</div>

point of view. Nothing that I have seen in the past two or three years

could not move them on, because their living standards improve. The
Minister wrote to everyone who spoke on Second Reading to say that that
was not the intention. However, many people have pointed out that, if
it is there in statute, someone in the future could use it in that way,

on security of tenure, which has been raised several times. Nobody
wants to deprive people of their tenure because their circumstances

						</i> Absolutely not. We have no objection to
that&#151;indeed, we think that it would be a very positive
development. However, we need to distinguish between housing options
that offer a menu of choices from which consumers can select what they
regard as their best choice and something in which a landlord or a
local authority determines what is best for that individual. In other
words, the principle behind this must be  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>consumer choice with a package of incentives, rather than a local
authority saying, &#147;You are too well off for social housing so we

					<a name="07121369000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree entirely with what you
said about communities and ensuring that people are not going to be
without social housing. Nevertheless, people do move about, and the
right to buy has perversely destroyed some of those mixed communities
and created a great shortage of affordable housing, so dealing with
rationing is an even greater priority. Is Shelter seriously saying,
even under the Bill, the limited social housing that is available
should be spread across income bands, rather than prioritised for
allocation to those who are most in need?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Adam
Sampson:
							</b>
						</i> That is a hook on which Shelter plainly
wriggles, as indeed does everybody else. As an organisation that
regards itself as representing the poorest and the most vulnerable, of
course we would wish to prioritise access to housing for those most in
need. Nevertheless, the consequence of channelling only those in most
need into a limited slot of social housing, which is not geographically
dispersed but concentrated in small areas, increases the risk of
concentrations of deprivation. The aggregation of many individual
decisions to help individual people in desperate need forces those
individuals to live in places in which none of us would wish to live.
Inevitably, the mixed communities agenda has to have an element of
priority, and much as we worry about penalising people in desperate
need by moving towards a mixed communities agenda, that must be done in
the interests of ensuring that those estates are decent places to live
in.</div>

								Adam
Sampson:
							</b>
						</i> This has largely been a covert debate about
security of tenure, but at last&#151;and this is helpful&#151;it is
becoming an overt debate about the subject. A number of arguments have
been made to justify the watering down the existing security
arrangements. We do not believe that those arguments stand up. First,
it is said that people coming into social housing, particularly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>through the homelessness route, merely experience a temporary period of
instability: all they need is to be stabilised so that they will have
the personal and economic resources to move out of social housing.
Although we believe that that might be true for some individuals, if
you analyse the range of people who live in social housing, you will
see that it is not always true. The vast majority of those in social
housing are very poor, and many of them have multiple needs, making it
very difficult for them to survive in the private rented sector with
six-month security of tenure and so on. Average income levels are about
&#163;7,500 a year. Less than 5 per cent. of people living in social
housing earn more than &#163;30,000 a year. Those are the sorts of
people in social housing. They could not easily survive economically,
or in other respects, in other housing
settings.</div>
					<a name="07121369000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
argument is sometimes made about a culture of dependency, and the Hills
report can be interpreted in that way. However, the truth is that if,
owing to the fact that we have not built sufficient housing stock, we
place people with high support needs in estates with concentrations of
deprivation, we cannot blame them for living in a place that does not
provide them with the chances and support that they need to build
decent lives. We argue strongly that it is wrong to attack security of
tenure in social housing. We do not believe that there are coherent
arguments for doing
so.</div>

						</i> Absolutely. Like more or less everybody to do
with housing, I welcome the Bill and think that it is important. I must
admit that I was a sceptic for quite a long time as to whether it was
really necessary to create the new Homes and Communities Agency and
whether that would not cause an awful lot of disruption, redundancies
and all the hassle that comes with creating a new body. I have also
been an admirer of the way in which the Housing Corporation, combining
regulation and funding, has managed to make sure that housing
associations are never guilty of corruption or mismanagement of any
consequence and never lose a penny for any of those private investors,
over all these years. I was a bit worried that separating those
functions was not going to be helpful in the great scheme of
things.</div>
					<a name="07121369000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have come to the view that this is the moment for a change. Joining up
the different parts of government that deal with the delivery of new
homes and the regeneration of old places is an enormous task, and they
have an &#163;8 billion budget. It is better that they are in one
place. I accept that putting regulation somewhere separate probably
gives it a bigger role. It would have been difficult to accomplish,
with all the complexities nowadays of regulating different kinds of
agencies, rather than just the old-fashioned standard housing
association.</div>
					<a name="07121369000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
probably good moves, and having walked round the issue quite a few
times, I think that this is good stuff. It is psychologically and
symbolically good  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>for Government to say that there will be a new Bill, new agencies, and a
new era, and that they are going to go for it. I think that that is
worth
having.</div>

						</i> Thank you for that question. I think that there
is a sin of omission, and I notice that Shelter picked up on this. This
is the moment to bring in some regulation for the private rented
sector. It is a huge elephant standing there. We now have dozens of
schemes in which there is private renting next door to social
housing&#151;literally next door. The owner of the private rented
accommodation is increasingly likely to be a taxi driver who owns one
flat in Brighton or a very, very small
company.</div>
					<a name="07121369000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
buy-to-let market, which has borrowed &#163;120 billion,
is a huge phenomenon. Great, we have had all of this massive
investment, but we have a tangle of amateur and often speculative
landlords mixed in with some complete rascals. We all know that the
worst landlords are some of the most unpleasant people. I was wrongly
quoted as saying that most landlords were drug dealers. That is not
what I said, but I did say that most drug dealers are landlords,
because that is the best place for a drug dealer to put their money.
Nobody asks any questions and you can put your addicts in
there.</div>
					<a name="07121369000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a very
scruffy bottom end of the market, but even among perfectly respectable
people, we have a bunch of absolute amateurs next door to organisations
that have to deal with regulation by the Housing Corporation, Audit
Commission inspectors and an excellent housing ombudsman service. There
is all that paraphernalia, and the Bill is talking about refining and
finessing and even more regulation. Fine, I am all for that, but then
we have the wild west&#151;the private rented sector with no
regulation. There are now rules to deal with the standard of the
accommodation, but whether they are implemented is another matter. With
regard to the management and the landlords, we do not have any
regulation or redress. You can complain that no one has answered your
letter and can go on sending that letter, but no one will do anything.
The tenant&#146;s only recourse is to take the landlord to court, and
how many people are able to do that? We have got to have some
regulation, as this is the last outpost where there is
none.</div>

Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): May I take you back
to your opening statement, in which you said that you began as a
sceptic about the concept of the agency because of the difficulties of
disruption, but had been won over? You may still remain a sceptic in
relation to delivery because the record of the past 10 years has been
pretty woeful. You painted a picture of a really rosy future in which
everything was somehow going to come right under the new agency. What,
in particular, gives you the confidence that this new vehicle can
deliver after 10 years of
failure?</div>

								Lord
Best:

						</i> I would say that those 10 years have been a
mixed story, rather than an abject failure. But yes, it is sure that
there will be lots of problems along the way and this new agency will
not have any plain sailing. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>are moving into an era in which the market is definitely taking a
downturn. We are dependent on the market for so much of what we do,
which makes it all the more important that we have other agencies apart
from house builders, as they will only produce when there is a profit
to be made from selling the houses. If we are in a time when there is a
credit squeeze and difficulty with mortgages, and in which prices might
be falling, we will have to depend instead on the other lot&#151;the
RSLs and the housing associations.</div>
					<a name="07121369000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Building prices have gone up by
14 per cent. in a year, it is difficult to squeeze things out, and
planning difficulties are not yet solved, so although the Planning Bill
will certainly help, I absolutely agree that hitting a target of 3
million homes by 2020 is a big call. John Calcutt&#146;s review
stated that the industry could do it, but whether it wants to is
another matter, because it responds only to the market, and that is a
second consideration. There might be some cajoling and a need for that
other stream of housing to be much bigger than it has been&#151;the
bit that is not propelled entirely by what the market
says.</div>

Burt:
						</b> Interestingly, you echo some of the comments made
this morning by the representatives of the Campaign to Protect Rural
England, who fell into a discussion with Nick Raynsford about whether
those targets could be delivered. The homes have to be built and the
house builders are not going to do it because of a downturn in the
market. If everything is getting tighter, with the best will in the
world, it might not be delivered, whatever an agency says or whatever
the latest 10-year plan for housing is. Just because the agency has
been created and the Government say what they will do, should there
really be any confidence that that will happen, because many other
things will affect the
delivery?</div>

						</i> It certainly will not happen automatically just
because you have a great big agency, that is for sure, even with the
public money for the 70,000 homes a year that could be afforded if
everything worked right. We are told by the economic pundits that the
economic downturn is not a major recession and looks like a trough from
which recovery is still possible, so we have to be prepared and get our
standards and ourselves in place for an upsurge. Fortunately, the
timetable&#151;we get milestones such as 2016 and 2020&#151;is not
inconceivable. I hope that we can get our 3 million by 2020, but next
year is not going to be the best year, and the year after that is not
going to be the second-best year either.</div>

housing that might be provided under this type of regulation. Let us
suppose that you were to hit the 3 million target. Under clause 35, the
HCA&#146;s duties are to ensure that the recipient of financial
subsidy is the landlord of the housing provided. There is no question
about quality and standards. How can the Bill be strengthened to ensure
that it does not result in a driving down of housing standards and
quality for those who are desperate for accommodation, but not so
desperate that they should receive substandard accommodation?</div>

								Lord

						</i> We cannot write all the standards in the Bill.
Pushing up standards will be very much part of the HCA&#146;s duties.
The most difficult thing for the agency and society at large will
probably be to produce family homes rather than the small flats that we
are used to seeing. If we keep talking about 3 million homes and they
turn out to be 3 million one or two-bedroomed flats, it will be a
complete failure. We are running out of single, childless, mobile,
young, yuppyish people who can fill the flats and thus getting
increasingly into a backlog in which we need actual family homes.
Perhaps if we can house a few older people and make the retirement
package good enough, we will get back a lot of suburban three-bedroomed
houses with gardens, but we must build family
homes.</div>
					<a name="07121369000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am
guilty of it, we must stop talking about 3 million homes. We need to
start talking about 9 million people. It is the number of people whom
we house that matters, a lot of whom will be children. In many
continental countries, they talk about people and square metres. There
are targets on square metres and the numbers of people. We have
units&#151;just one figure. That will not work. Ministers will have
to feel proud of the number of people housed instead of just the number
of units and
homes.</div>

						</b> If some developments are provided through the
quota scheme&#151;with private developers allowing a proportion of
the properties to be made available to RSLs&#151;rather than through
exception sites for which we can insist on 100 per cent. and the social
landlord is engaged from day one, those properties will be the smaller
and less acceptable, or those built on the edge of a busy highway and
the swampy bit at the bottom of the site that private owners would not
want. I accept that this is blurring the planning and the housing
provision side of government, but do you not think that there is a need
for stronger regulation in the Bill to ensure that that is not one of
the outcomes and that we do not end up with ticky-tacky boxes in the
worst sites on the edge of
developments?</div>
					<a name="07121369000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">

								Lord
Best:

						</i> These are mixed developments in which all the
decent stuff is over here, while the social and affordable housing is
planted in the corner near the gasworks, which is the real rubbish and
where the units are too small anyway. Everyone is becoming cleverer
about such matters and the deal under section 106 specifies
increasingly that people do not get the worse end of the deal. At
present, when you are piggy-backing on what the house builder wants to
do, the RSL and housing association is playing second fiddle,
especially in those areas where, unwisely, a beauty parade is allowed
so that the house builder can choose the softest touch&#151;the one
that will be most compliant with what he wants. You can then end up
with some pretty rubbishy results for affordable
housing.</div>
					<a name="07121369000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I much prefer
the model of the housing association, possibly with considerable
support through a local housing company that involves the local
authority. New local housing companies will be set up. It will not be
the house builder making all the running with others piggy-backing on
him. The RSL, the local housing company or the agency itself will
specify in a master plan what will happen. The house builder will then
do the things that house builders do best and build houses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>for sale, but as part of someone else&#146;s plan, not as the person
leading the show. They will not hang around very long or be there to
manage the property for the next 30 years.</div>
					<a name="07121369000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are people who will be
around for 30, 50, or even 100 years. I have run organisations that are
more than 100 years old and are still looking after properties that
were built 100 years ago. If you are going to be in the sector for 100
years, you do not want the people who are just there today, and who
will sell the property and go, to run at the beginning the planning
process and also the quality and standards. You want them to do their
job, but for the real control to be in the hands of the long-term
agent.</div>

					<a name="07121369000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The context of this discussion
is our belief that we still have underlying housing demand that will
effectively mean that delivery of the new housing will be a top
priority, despite any problems in the next two years. First, do you not
think that land constraint has been a significant factor in our
inability to deliver large numbers of new housing units so far, and
that the new requirement on local authorities to identify land supply
is a useful tool? Secondly, regarding retirement, would it not be
useful to develop a new culture in this country whereby older people
see moving back into the rented sector from home ownership as a
positive move that allows them to enjoy their equity while making more
housing available in the market for other people to buy? That would not
necessarily mean moving them into sheltered housing or very small
one-bedroom flats.
</div>
					<a name="07121369000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord
Best:
							</b>
						</i> Yes. Those are two separate and important
points. Land is absolutely the key. Who controls the land always wins
in the long run, and the private sector has had a pretty good run of
controlling land supply.</div>
					<a name="07121369000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very familiar with the
scene around York. It has been extraordinarily difficult for even the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation to acquire land. I ran the Joseph Rowntree
Housing Trust. Frankly, at Rowntree, we have pots of money, but buying
any land, with options already sold and deals already done, is pretty
well sewn up around York. Getting your hands on any sites in order to
lead the process has proved to be incredibly difficult. Rowntree is, in
fact, developing a large site on local authority land.</div>
					<a name="07121369000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, it is about unlocking the
public sector land; for sure, we need to be cleverer about that.
Sometimes the public sector is extremely slow in bringing the land
forward and extremely hard on the price, which militates against doing
something socially worth while with that land. Getting the land is
absolutely critical and I think that the Bill&#151;especially some of
its planning provisions&#151;will be helpful in doing that. You are
so right; land is the secret.</div>
					<a name="07121369000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding retirement, yes,
people should possibly move back to being tenants having been home
owners for 35 years, or whatever period it might be. I chair the
Hanover Housing Association, which provides retirement housing all over
the country. We are looking to see what the next big thing is. We are
the largest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>provider of extra-care housing. Obviously, extra care is a fantastic
product and there are always queues for such housing, but I do not
think that the old-fashioned sheltered housing will suit in the future.
We must have a retirement offer that is better than we have had before.
</div>
					<a name="07121369000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The biggest target
for who is going to move into retirement housing is no longer the
under-occupying council tenant&#151;although they still exist, and
creating mobility within the social housing sector is great&#151;but
the under-occupying owner, who might not be very rich at all. Enticing
them to leave the three-bedroom suburban house is a huge prize, because
that would produce the family housing that the house builders are so
reluctant to build, because they make more money out of one and
two-bedroom flats. So, you are absolutely right.</div>
					<a name="07121369000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not go the whole way,
though, and say, &#147;We welcome you.&#148; We do at the moment at
Hanover; 25 per cent. of the people who move in have sold their house.
Actually, though, at Hanover, I want to get my hands on some of the
money that those people have got from selling their property. Although
it is nice that they want to give something to the kids and all that, I
also think that we should have a shared ownership product for them,
which would put at least a chunk of the money that they have received
from their sale back into housing, where it is perfectly safe. That
would be good for them in the long run.</div>
					<a name="07121369000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have talked to tenants who
have moved in, having been home owners, and have not had the chance of
buying into their property because we just offered renting. They have
said things like, &#147;Yeah, that would have been great. I wish that
I had bought in because house prices have gone up in the 10 years since
I sold mine.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07121369000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, I am keen to collect money
from people coming into Hanover developments. Some 72 per cent. of
retired people are home owners. Many of them now have unmanageable
properties and are lonely&#151;they are affected by all the things
that can mean it is time for a move that will be good for everybody,
including the family that takes the

						</b> I have two questions, Lord Best. We live at
a time when the major political parties are committed to deregulation.
You are the second consecutive witness who has asked for more
regulation, this time in connection with the private rented sector. Is
there not a risk that if we over-regulate the private rented sector, we
could go back to where we were 20 or 30 years ago when you and others
were advocating reform in order to regenerate and revive the private
rented sector, which has resulted in what we have now? Exactly what
regulation do you want, and is there not a risk of overdoing
it?</div>
					<a name="07121369000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord
Best:
							</b>
						</i> Those are fundamental questions. I definitely
am part of a conspiracy that has been very quiet about the need for
regulation because we have been so worried about the UK having the
smallest rented sector in Europe, about encouraging people to invest,
about saying anything about regulation and frightening the horses, and
about 50 years of decline. So, I have always had to bite my lip and not
say, &#147;We should be regulating these rascals far more
heavily.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>

albeit perfectly honourable speculators&#151;I am not saying that
people who move their pension funds are dishonourable. But, total
amateurs are coming into a totally unregulated sector. It would be good

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Lord
Best:
							</b>
						</i> Just to finish my point, Sir George, on what
the money has done. It has definitely had an impact on house prices.
Some of the bubble that is about at least to deflate, if not burst, was
created by the &#163;120 billion of extra funding from those people.
Remember, housing associations have raised only about &#163;35
billion of private money. The buy-to-let people have raised &#163;120
billion in about six years. When that much money chases the same number
of houses that were there before, it is bound to have an inflationary
impact.</div>
					<a name="07121369000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the problem that first-time buyers have been driven out. First-time
buyers have dropped from 40 to 25 per cent. of the purchasers of new
homes. So, scaring off some of that investment, which is not something
that we would have dared to do for 50 years, would be great. To ease
back on it would be a good
thing.</div>
					<a name="07121369000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to how that
could be done, I have just gone on to the council of the ombudsman for
estate agents. New legislation means that, from April, a person cannot
be an estate agent unless they belong to an ombudsman and redress
scheme so that there is somebody to complain to. Estate agents must
sign up with an organisation with whose judgment they must accord. If
they misbehave in any way, they will be fined, and they can even be
struck off. They will be referred to the Office of Fair Trading and
could be told that they are out of the scheme. From April next year, if
they are out of the scheme and neither the ombudsman or a redress
scheme will have them, they have to take their sign down and not sell
any more houses&#151;they are
out.</div>
					<a name="07121369000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a
letting agent&#151;some estate agents are also letting agents, in a
rather complicated way&#151;can go and put their sign up now. They
need no qualifications and they do not have to have done anything
before. People can be a letting agent tomorrow and take serious sums of
money in deposits and landlords&#146; rents. We do not have any
regulation of letting
agents.</div>
					<a name="07121369000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
taxi drivers use a letting agent to do the job for them, others do not.
One whom I sat behind the other day said, &#147;I am not paying 12
per cent. to some agent. I can get down there at least once a fortnight
if the plumbing goes haywire or something.&#148; But whether it is
the landlord or the letting agent on behalf of the landlord, the
starting point is that they need to be part of either an accredited
scheme, or a professional body that has a code of conduct that it will
apply. Martin Partington of the Law Commission advocates that in his
report. I have discovered that the associations and federations that
represent private landlords&#151;they represent only a small number
of private landlords 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>because a lot of people will not join&#151;believe in regulation, too.
I chair the private rented sector policy forum, which is made up of
landlord and tenant groups. The landlord groups agree with the tenant
groups that you need some regulation to keep out the cowboys and to
bring some formality into the wild west that is the private rented
sector. An accreditation scheme does not need to be so frightening that
proper investors do not actually prefer it to a system that is totally
chaotic. We will see all kinds of problems now that some of this buy to
let has
unravelled.</div>

local authorities wanted to, they could oblige the house builders to do
all the things that you have expressed concern about. They do not need
any more powers, because they have got
them.</div>

						</i> That is true in theory and increasingly in
practice. Local authorities are getting cleverer, and the section 106
agreements are getting better&#151;they are beginning to understand
each other. However, a lot of local authorities are no match, in terms
of negotiation, with high-powered house builders, who can run circles
around them, frankly&#151;they have highly paid and astute people who
negotiate for them. You have some youthful planner who is working for
the council, and it is not a fair match, so the deal is not always as
good as it should be, although I think that things are getting
better.</div>
					<a name="07121369000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is still
a fundamental difference between that and, for example, the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation buying a site, doing a master plan and deciding
where it wants the children&#146;s play area, whether to get people
to walk to work by a certain route and where to put the cycle path and
the trim track for joggers. In that case, the organisation involved
will say, &#147;We want 60 per cent. for sale now. Which house
builders shall we use? These people seem to be rather good quality.
We&#146;ll bring them in, but they will have to compete with other
house builders. If such a scheme is run by the agency that is
responsible for the long-term management of the place&#151;it is
going to look after the rented housing and the communal areas for
ever&#151;it will set up a commonhold or equivalent scheme, in which
the ground rents stay in the place and can be used for the maintenance
of that place.</div>
					<a name="07121369000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a little scam that is currently almost universal in the sale of
flats. The ground rents are imposed by the house builders on the
occupiers. The ground rents are then capitalised, bundled together and
sold to an investor at 18 times the annual ground rent. That is a kind
of standard practice. You choose a ground rent that is small enough to
make no difference to the price you get for the flat, so the sale of
the ground rents to somebody else&#151;there is nothing in return for
the ground rents, which are just payments&#151;is just an extra
little bit of bunce on the top for the house builder. If we were to
collect up the ground rents, we would not sell them to somebody else, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>because they are there to pay for the grounds, the common parts of the
building and things that happen. That is just a little scam that
happens almost universally with flats.</div>
					<a name="07121369000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also makes it much easier to
manage property if the agency is there to do the managing, where as the
people building it might be gone tomorrow. Sometimes the builders
think, &#147;Where&#146;s the next site to do? That is their
problem. We have given them all &#163;1 in a management company; they
can sort that out for themselves.&#148; Can they? I am not sure that
they can or will.</div>
					<a name="07121369000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Keeping the ownership of the
place and getting the house builders to come as partners is fine. House
builders are infinitely better than Rowntree or anybody else at
building to exactly the price that they say that they are going to
build to. Everything that I have ever built has always come in over the
price that I first thought of, whereas the house builders always bring
it in. They have skills that are not always matched by the housing
associations. Use them for the things that they can do, but it is that
way round in my opinion, rather than always being second
fiddle.</div>

						</b> May we consider the regulatory regime that the
Bill establishes, and in particular, three areas in which concerns have
been voiced, not least by previous witnesses? The first is domain
regulation. Clearly, Cave&#146;s recommendation was for the
introduction of a domain regulator. The Bill does not do so, and
previous witnesses, particularly from the local government side and the
Chartered Institute of Housing, recognised that there were formidable
difficulties in defining a unified regulatory regime. Do you have any
thoughts about how that problem can be best
overcome?</div>

						</i> Yes. It is well worth trying to get more into
the Bill and doing it now. The Secretary of State will say later, as
she said yesterday, that she is definitely committed to the idea of
local authorities and arm&#146;s length management organisations
coming within a regulatory system within a couple of years, so that
commitment will happen at some later stage and it is well worth trying
to get this Bill to provide for it. The final amendments will probably
be tabled in the Lords in&#151;I do not know&#151;March? We have
some time now. Professor Ian Cole has been given the job of chairing a
little group that will examine how domain regulation could come to
pass, and we have time to table an amendment that would introduce it
early on. It is true that the regulatory system will be slightly
different, but it already has to be different for those private sector
organisations that provide social housing, so the regulator will
already have to account for differences according to who is behind the
social housing provision.</div>
					<a name="07121369000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be that the only new
clause anybody can find the time and energy to produce in the time
available is an enabling one, and it will need to be a constrained
enabling one to get through the House of Lords down the other end. If
the provision is too open-ended, people will become very anxious about
it, but a constrained enabling new clause might still be enough.
</div>
					<a name="07121369000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process whereby
you are nominated to a housing association or a council property is
fairly arbitrary: 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>your demand is today, and that is what is available. It is odd to have
two different systems, and when council stock is transferred to a new
organisation or to the council in a new guise, there is a great cry
from Defend Council Housing. It always says, with modest justification,
&#147;That&#146;s terrible. You&#146;re going to lose your rights
if you&#146;re under this regulatory system compared with the one
you&#146;re under now.&#148; People transfer and move around,
however, and as far as the expectations and understanding of the
tenants are concerned, it is important to have one totally comparable
regulatory system. The way in which it is administered, centrally, will
be different, but through the eyes of the tenant, there is no need for
it to be different.</div>

						</b> The second concern is the balance between
ensuring effective action where necessary to deal with malpractice, and
avoiding over-heavy regulatory controls. Concerns have been voiced that
the direct line from the Minister, who is able to direct on standards
through the regulator to registered social landlords, could compromise
RSL independence and might even alter their status under the
classification as non-public sector bodies. You are the chair of a
major housing association and you have enormous experience of that
territory, so do you have any thoughts on those issues?</div>

work around some amendments. I am not sure whether the wording is good
enough, and if there is any doubt, we should not risk it, because if
some EU bureaucrat classified us as public bodies and everything that
we borrowed became part of the national debt, I would not say half the
point of having housing associations, but a major reason why we have
promoted the option, would go out of the window. It would be a
disaster, and we would have far less money for social housing. It is
not worth the risk of getting the wording wrong.</div>
					<a name="07121369000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State
directing the regulator and then the regulator directing the housing

the trap of being classified as public bodies. In a way, we are being
asked to have faith that the civil servants have entirely got their
heads round this, and that they have checked it out with the economists
in Brussels or wherever, but I am not sufficiently confident that we
have got it sorted. What we need are some gentle amendments, not so as
to lose the power of the regulator to do the right thing but to make
absolutely damned sure that the Bill is not an Exocet that blows apart
what many RSLs are all about.</div>

						</b> While we were discussing the availability of rented
property and the pressures on housing generally, we touched on an
argument about the place of the rented sector in British society and
the fact that over the years there has been pressure to see rented
property solely as social rented property. That is in contrast to what
happens on the continent, where people rent much more often and the
supply is much more mixed. Do you have any observations on that
situation? Is there anything in the Bill that might change the nature
of housing in our society, which is so heavily concentrated on owner
occupation, almost to the exclusion of anything else? Is there anything
that you think would get back a slightly wider rented sector 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>and allow us to return to the situation 20 or 30 years ago, when a

						</i> From a pathetically low base. Only one European
country&#151;Bulgaria or Romania, perhaps; you have to search pretty
hard to find it&#151;has a lower proportion of privately rented
stock. There has been a turnaround in the value of that sector for the
young, mobile and single or for childless couples. I do not advocate
security of tenure for private tenants in the private rented sector,
which Shelter might have been edging towards; there is no doubt that
people would be unlikely to invest in the sector, because they would
never know when they would be able to get their money back out again.
That will not encourage the growth of the sector or its stability,
which means that we have a sector in which there is unlikely to be
security of tenure.
</div>
					<a name="07121369000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not matter
too much if you are young and mobile&#151;and nowadays, mobile,
single and not settling down with a family takes you to about 33. In my
day it was about 23. However, the sector is really not suitable for
families with children who want to put down roots and need security.
You want to send your children to a school knowing that you will not
have to move them to another; you want to get settled in a community.
For families, relatively long-term security is important and the
private rented sector is not suitable to perform that task. Someone
said that long leases are quite popular at the top of the market;
there, you blur into home ownership.</div>
					<a name="07121369000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have done well in recent
years in increasing the amount of ordinary rented housing for singles
and mobile people. I have a son who recently left Manchester
university, and he and his partner have been looking for a flat to rent
in Manchester. I can remember the days when if you wanted to rent a
flat you rushed to the phone box and tried to ring the landlord before
anyone else, almost certainly to be told, &#147;No, it&#146;s
gone.&#148; My son and his partner were taken around in a car by the
agent and shown 25 properties. It is another world. In the market they
are going for in Salford quays and Manchester the cost is about
&#163;600 a month for the two of them, and they took one at
&#163;620, which is not a bad price.</div>
					<a name="07121369000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have pretty quickly created
a new private rented market in those city centres that did not exist 10
or 12 years ago. That is great for people like my son and his partner,
but later on they will want to buy because they will want a family home
and not want the insecurity of being tenants. They will want the
investment things that go with owning and eventually paying off a
mortgage and having something for their children. That is just the
reality of it, I
think.</div>

occurring again? Do you think that there is enough emphasis in the

we will end up with sustainable and cohesive communities? You were

						</i> A really important part of that is whether, in
the future, we build a mix of incomes into what we provide. The kind of
ghettoisation of social housing has been almost criminal, has it not?
People&#146;s life chances have been diminished by the way in which
we have done it. Large estates, where only poor people are allowed, or
only people who have problems in many cases, have not been a good
policy. We know that now, and the tide has turned.</div>
					<a name="07121369000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">On how to achieve that mix,
sometimes the mix is totally artificial and slightly silly. Hanover has
a block of 50 apartments at Imperial wharf, where the private sector is
selling for an average of &#163;640,000 a flat. The social housing is
there, but it is actually just a mechanism for getting your hands on
some land. We cannot really call it a mixed community when there are
homeless families and the average price is &#163;640,000. But for the
generality of new schemes, we will try to ensure that there is a jumble
of people, some of them in the middle between the owners and tenants
and no one quite knows, and that tenants have the opportunity not to be
tenants by buying some shares and moving up the ladder.</div>
					<a name="07121369000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have got to get better at
allowing people to staircase down, as we call it; a lot of shared
owners will get into problems when the interest rates go sneaking up in
the next few months, their early offer is over and they have to pay
more for their mortgages. We will have to be clever in allowing people
to staircase down rather than make them homeless, so that they stay
there as tenants, which they can afford, not as homeowners, which they
no longer can. You are absolutely right to ring the warning
bell.</div>
					<a name="07121369000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Might builders
rush out there and do it all again? I think that the answer is probably
not. Probably the lesson has been learned and we will create things
that are sustainable as communities, not just a bunch of
houses.</div>

public policy because there is something else on your agenda.
&#147;Antisocial behaviour? Let&#146;s get these people, for free,
to do a lot of the work that might have been done by other
agencies.&#148; On worklessness, housing associations, at least the
good ones&#151;the RSLs vary on a spectrum of nought to 100, even
though there is a lot of regulation and you would

Housing Corporation has a gold award scheme, and for the third year I
am a judge. This year a prize goes to the one that is doing most to get
people into jobs on the estates and in the area where they are working.

with private sector land surrounding it, or between it and the adjacent
local authority site, so the council and the HCA will want to work on
it together. Compulsory purchase powers would be needed in such
circumstances. The proposal reflects the kind of circumstances in which
English Partnerships currently uses compulsory purchase powers. It is

as the role of the Housing Corporation, and the role of English
Partnerships as more about regeneration, although recently it has
become more about land for housing. It is important to link housing and
regeneration functions effectively, particularly in the light of the
John Calcutt review, which made some interesting proposals on the
potential for using land previously assessed as low-value brownfield
land, and increasing its value to use it to support more housing.

relevant. That, too, is part of the HCA&#146;s remit. There are other
areas where we have consulted on growth area functions, the decent

						</i> The Department&#146;s record on the Thames
Gateway is extremely strong. Look at the changes that have taken place
in the Thames Gateway. Even over the past 12 months, we have seen the
go-ahead for Crossrail, including the spur down to Abbey Wood, in which
the Department has been very closely involved. It includes the channel
tunnel rail link and the progress on the London Gateway, including the
new port. It also includes the go-ahead for the Ebbsfleet planning
permission, which was possible only as a result of close working
between the Thames Gateway team in the Department and the Department
for Transport. We have also pulled together the delivery plan, which
has involved a lot of cross-Government working to agree budgets across
Government
Departments.</div>
					<a name="07121369000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
that we are now moving into a different phase. Having got that
cross-Government delivery plan and the budgets in place, we need to
move on to the practical delivery implications, which means a much
stronger role for the HCA. As I have said, however, we will set out its
final functions in advance of your detailed
consideration.</div>

						</b> I wish to raise other issues later, but I
would like to follow up what Mr. Burt&#146;s question
about compulsory purchase order powers. As you said, the HCA is a
merger of English Partnerships on the one hand and
the investment wing of the Housing Corporation on the other. English
Partnerships has CPO powers and planning powers, but the Housing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>Corporation does not have either. Do you think that the English
Partnerships-type powers&#151;planning and CPO&#151;of the new,
merged body will move across to the conventional housing function
discharged by the Housing Corporation, or do you think that those
powers will continue to be used mainly in relation to scenarios where
English Partnerships would intervene? That is a matter of enormous
sensitivity to the local authorities. Have I made the question
clear?</div>

George Young:
						</b> At the moment, there is no question of CPO
powers or planning powers being exercised by the Housing Corporation in
relation to a straightforward housing scheme, because it does not have
them. When English Partnerships moves in on a major infrastructure
scheme, it needs CPO and planning powers. Is it your intention that
when the HCA is confronted with what I would regard as a
straightforward housing scheme it should use the CPO and planning
powers and take them away from the local authority, or would those
powers continue to be discharged, as they are at the moment, by the
local
authority?</div>

								Yvette
Cooper:

						</i> We would expect the local authority to use
its planning powers and to play a strategic housing role. We want the
local authority to lead on the appropriate development of housing, the
appropriate sites for housing and the need for affordable housing. The
HCA will have a series of roles, including the distinct roles of
existing bodies. The Housing Corporation&#146;s role is one of
funding. It does not undertake the delivery of housing schemes in the
middle of Wakefield, Gloucestershire or wherever; it funds them. It
provides funding to housing associations or developers conducting those
development programmes. We would expect there to be a whole series of
areas where that relationship pertained. There might be an application
for funding from a housing association, from a council, or from a joint
venture for funding, and the HCA will provide that funding. In other
cases, English Partnerships would previously have been the developer of
a piece of public sector land, or would hold the ring and deal with
development plans for it. Now, the HCA will lead the
development.</div>
					<a name="07121369000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
gain is that the agency is more than the sum of its parts.
It can operate as a partner in support of local
government. Local government will take the lead, and draw up what it
wants to achieve in its area, such as the development of an old
coalfield site on which the HCA is working, or the development of areas
where direct funding is available. There will be huge potential, as
local government can work with the HCA and draw on its skills. There
are some areas where local authorities have excellent skills and are
extremely good at delivering development. For example, in Greenwich,
there are lot of skills within the relevant department. However, other
areas have much weaker skills, and it is an added advantage that they
can ask the HCA for help, advice and expertise on how to take forward
some of those
programmes.</div>

the local authorities against that background, you would not want to

						</i> No, you would not expect to do so. There is
only one example of planning powers being vested in English
Partnerships, and that was done in close partnership. The decision to
give English Partnerships development control powers was made in
partnership with Milton Keynes council. We have always envisaged that
this is about building supportive relationships and working with the
local authority in the lead, which will provide flexibility. Special
arrangements can be put in place in the unusual circumstances that
apply in Milton Keynes.</div>

Communities Agency on previous occasions, you have emphasised the fact
that it would carrying forward the powers of the Housing Corporation to
ensure delivery of the Mayor&#146;s strategy in London. It is fine to
work in partnership with authorities that want partnership, but there
are obvious issues about what happens when individual authorities do
not perform, or when the Mayor is concerned that they are not
delivering satisfactorily. How do you think that the agency can balance
the two separate roles of working in partnership yet being able to
intervene when necessary, if there has been a failure to deliver by the
local

						</i> The primary starting point is the planning
system, and in the obligation of local authorities to ensure delivery
under that system. There are issues on what happens when cases go to
appeal, if local authorities do not do their job through the planning
system. Equally, we think that there are special arrangements for
London, which were set out as part of the revisions associated with the
Greater London Authority Act 1999. The Mayor has a responsibility to
deliver his overall strategy. The Act contains specific additional
powers that recognise that and allow the Mayor to step in where there
is under-delivery against the strategy on the housing and planning
sides.</div>
					<a name="07121369000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
that the Homes and Communities Agency should be tasked with delivering
that strategy for the Mayor. Additional things can be done, for
example, with public sector land and by direct work with housing
associations in areas where the council or borough is not doing its bit
to support housing. The Homes and Communities Agency will be able to
ensure that there is work to try to make progress on homes in relation
to land, with housing associations and, in London, particularly with
the Mayor.</div>

which it has provided in the past. I also want to be clear about
whether those powers will be transferred into the new, amalgamated

given your statement that the new body is a housing body, to what
extent will that mean that either the past powers of
English Partnerships to make proposals for industrial infrastructure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>and workshops will be suppressed by the activities of the new agency or

housing. Work such as the coalfields programme&#151;part of English

regeneration role. As I said previously, we underestimate the potential
of linking regeneration towards delivery of housing. Regeneration is
critical in its own terms, but it will not be possible to deliver all
the homes that are needed unless there is that link.</div>
					<a name="07121369000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have referred specifically

out the regional housing pot based on advice from regional housing

funding that will go on private sector renewal, much of which is about
regeneration.</div>

land trusts have considerable potential in terms of providing more

rural areas and seven in urban areas. The interesting question is
whether they can be made to work if the land is not gifted in for free.
If the land is gifted for free, they are clearly a successful way of
providing affordable
housing.</div>
					<a name="07121369000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are using
the pilots to look at how they can be made into viable models&#151;we
think that that is possible on the basis of some of the work that comes
forward through the models and some of the proposals that are currently
under way that look at different ways of doing that. It is something
that is currently being supported. English Partnerships is involved,
but the main engagement with the community land trust at the moment is
through the Housing Corporation, which funds some of the pilots. The
agencies have the ability to do that within the existing framework.

					<a name="07121369000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a fact
that the Department has had a problem with delivery, which has been
recognised in a variety of reports. In particular, we have already
heard about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>Thames Gateway, which both the NAO and the PAC criticised for having a
lack of direction. Delivery there has been a
problem.</div>
					<a name="07121369000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill&#146;s approach seems to be to create high targets and expect
them to be delivered. Yet the history is not favourable. In the past 10
years, about 146 housing units a year have been delivered, as opposed
to 175 in the previous 18 years. We know that fewer social housing
units have been delivered every single year in the last 10, than under
any of the 18 years before. Am I right in thinking that your analysis
is, therefore, that a more powerful central body is required to get
this delivery through, which would be the

						</i> Nice try, Mr.
Shapps.</div>
					<a name="07121369000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are clear, the level of
house building has increased substantially over the last few years and
is now at its highest level since 1990, which is important. It is also
the case that we have seen substantial increases both in the level of
investment in new social housing, and also in the level of delivery in
new social housing.</div>
					<a name="07121369000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is certainly true that the cost of social housing in the early 1990s
was much lower and, therefore, the cost of procuring and building
social housing for the public sector was much lower at that time. That
was, however, as a result of a quite devastating housing market crash
triggered by the Conservative Government at the time. Perhaps the
lesson on housing delivery from previous Conservative Governments is
not one that we should learn from or should be citing in the
Committee&#146;s discussions
today.</div>
					<a name="07121369000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there
is a question about how to move forward and achieve increased housing
delivery in the future. It is right that local councils need to take
some responsibility for that. It is unfortunate that a series of,
particularly Conservative, local authorities have been strongly
resisting housing delivery and, indeed, attempting to frustrate such
delivery in their areas. That is clearly of concern to us, and I hope
that it concerns Conservative Front Benchers as well. We want to see
all local authorities responding to the need to deliver more homes in
their area and we think that the HCA is the right way to help them do
so. I am slightly puzzled by Mr. Shapps&#146;s reference

that way and that is why this sort of witness investigation is a proper
process for understanding the direction of the Bill. To what extent do

work with 38 local authorities that account for about 60 per cent. of
the overcrowding problem. We would expect those local authorities

money and the market value. On the basis of my detailed discussions

accurate, as they simply refer to the market value, when it seems to me

						</i> Interestingly, I think that English
Partnerships already takes a long-termist view when it is looking at
the returns from its land, at how to dispose of its land and what to do
with public sector land in the public sector interests. For example,
the wave of NHS sites that were transferred over in the past few years
have been used to build homes under a first-time-buyers initiative,
where you effectively get deferred receipts as part of those schemes.
There are a range of ways in which English Partnerships already
operates in a sensible, long-term framework for getting the best
benefit for the community, for the public interest. The legal framework
within which it operates seems to allow it to do
that.</div>

						</b> Can we move on to social mobility?
Notwithstanding the devastating attack on my stewardship as Housing
Minister, I recognise that much that this Government have done in
housing is good. However, one of the failures has been on tenant
mobility. In 1997, the Government inherited a national mobility scheme
and social tenants, be they local authority or RSL, could move to other
parts of the country because somebody was operating a centralised
scheme. That collapsed, but this is not the time for a post mortem. The
Government had known for some time that that scheme was going to
collapse.</div>

					<a name="07121369000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was reading
what the Minister said yesterday, and I find it a very disappointing
response indeed. Apparently, all we are getting is that the Government
will be working with the Housing Corporation, key social landlords and
authorities across the country on how they can start to build a
national programme to give people better choice about where they can
move to. Do you agree that, given where we were four or five years ago,
we do not seem to have got anywhere since I secured a debate on the
subject a few months ago?</div>

						</i> I think that there is a problem about
mobility around the country. There is also a problem about mobility
even within areas. Even the national system that existed did very
little in terms of transfers, and there were a series of problems for
some time. Part of that was about the fact that we need more social
housing, which is an underpinning theme, but it was also about reduced
mobility even within local areas. There are three issues: one is
mobility within a district or a local area; the second is immediate
cross-border mobility and being able to move within a sub-region; and
the third is the national one.</div>
					<a name="07121369000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The choice-based lettings
schemes, which have proved effective, provide a format for supporting
greater flexibility. It gives people a chance to choose, rather than a
system of allocations, where you are told by a housing officer,
&#147;Right, it&#146;s this one, that one or you&#146;re
out&#148; and there is no other choice at all. You actually have more
chance and choice to bid, and that provides an opportunity to have much
greater flexibility within areas. That is why we said that we want to
change the reasonable preference categories, particularly to support
those people who want to move from larger properties into smaller
ones.</div>
					<a name="07121369000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">There ought
to be much greater flexibility across local authority boundaries.
Within the sub-region, they ought to be able to operate sub-regional
choice-based letting schemes. That would give people much greater
mobility within the sub-region, which is where a lot of moves&#151;in
particular, a lot of family moves&#151;take place. That will be
supported by the &#163;3.8 million that we announced in the statement
yesterday. That should allow all local authorities to be part of a
sub-regional choice-based letting scheme by 2010. That would give all
tenants the chance to be able to move within the sub-region. You are
right that that is not enough. You have then got to have the national
arrangements in place, but it seems to me that choice-based lettings,
rather than the traditional national model, are a better way. You still
give tenants a bit of choice. If they want to move from London to
Wakefield, for example, or Wakefield to London, you actually give
people choice. Unlike in the previous mobility arrangements, you build
it into the choice-based lettings system. That seems to me to be a more
sustainable long-term arrangement than the things that have been
attempted over the last few years. That is the arrangement that we want
to build on. We have work under way at the moment with the Housing
Corporation, but what we have not done&#151;I agree with
you&#151;is to set out a final framework that solves the problem in
any
way.</div>

choice-based lettings scheme does that is different to the previous
scheme is that by 2010 you will be able to go into what is effectively
just like an estate agent and look at homes across the sub-region. A
choice-based lettings unit has just opened in Castleford in my
constituency. From the outside it looks just like an estate agent. You
have all of the pictures in the window of the different houses. That is
a very different way of choosing where you want to live. With that kind
of mobility linked to it, there will be a much stronger emphasis on
choice and on what it is that tenants want. To give tenants that kind
of choice within the sub-region seems to me to be very valuable. That
is not something that they had through the old
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07121369000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
you, however, that what the old scheme did provide was much more
national mobility than is currently provided, because of the events
that we saw in the past 12 months. You and I can have a more detailed
conversation about that, because there were a series of particular
problems. The potential of getting this right is that we can build on
the choice-based lettings approach and on the idea of tenant choice,
rather than people having somebody else making the decisions for them.
Empowering tenants should be at the heart of increasing mobility within
the sub-region and at national
level.</div>

						</i> The precursor to all of this, which I am
going to have stamped on my head, is that we need to build more homes.
To ensure that the jigsaw works, the first point is whether we have
suitable accommodation for older people. Will they have the bungalows,
the adapted accommodation or whatever, in order to be able to move from
that three-bedroomed property that might help a family? Local
authorities are key in helping to assess those needs with their
strategic housing role. As we move forward, the agency will be
important in helping them step up to the

obsession with English Partnerships and its industrial workshop role.
This is really supplementary to the answers that I received earlier. My
experience of English Partnerships from my part of the world is that it
develops workshops, particularly in areas where the private sector
would not otherwise provide them. Given its clear priority and the
budget priority of providing housing and addressing housing concerns,
to what extent will this agency be able to provide any kind of
attention to economic development issues and workshop development? I
appreciate what Mr. Wright said&#151;they were warm words
and they were sincerely expressed&#151;but is it possible to set out
a notional proportion of the overall budget that will go towards
industrial and workshop development in the next few years? Do you have
any idea what proportion of the available money will be directed
towards activities that are not directly related to housing? Of that
money, how much will go towards workshop development?</div>

get in the private rented sector. That is the first area where we think
that there should be an amendment to that clause, so that it refers to

through the Housing Corporation&#146;s budget for the third year by
2010. As I said, we think an amendment is needed to clause 68(c) to
clarify the fact that there are two different kinds of housings. If
further amendments are needed to clarify things, obviously we are happy
to look at that, but our intention is simply to write down in the Bill,

recommended &#147;domain-wide regulation&#148;, yet the Bill
suggests a two-year delay for local authorities. When representatives
of the Local Government Association came before us, they suggested that
the LGA would support immediate regulation under Oftenant, saying that
if there is a delay it would prejudice its ability to influence the way
in which Oftenant developed. Even more surprisingly, they suggested
that some of the onerous regulation that comes through Oftenant would
be acceptable to them. Given that they are anxious to be in at the
beginning and they do not seem to be concerned about the onerous nature
of some of the regulation, would it not be sensible to bring it
forward?</div>

						</i> I made some comments on this as part of the
statement to the House yesterday. I was surprised that the LGA was keen
to adopt the powers as set out in the Bill. Obviously, local
authorities have a different performance management framework. In my
view, it has always been important to work through in detail the
interrelationship between the different governance structures. There
are different governance structures, and local authorities, which are
democratically accountable, have a different arrangement from
not-for-profit housing associations. Getting this right in a way that
does not make it more difficult and burdensome for local authorities in
terms of their relationship with the performance management framework,
but equally allows effective and parallel regulation, as applies to
housing associations, would take some time. If the LGA is keen to have
that kind of framework, it is obviously something that we could look at
again, but my feeling is that it would be quite difficult to
do.</div>
					<a name="07121369000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have therefore
worked on the assumption that it would not be acceptable to the House
simply to take enabling powers as part of the Bill and try to do that
through secondary legislation, because the enabling powers would be too
broad. We should therefore complete domain-wide regulation as part of a
second piece of primary legislation, which we hope will follow as fast
as possible. We are setting up a new task group, chaired by Ian Cole,
to look at getting the precise detail right, so that we can then
consult on it with local authorities, and try to get the follow-up
piece of legislation as fast as
possible.</div>

consulting on the detail of the revised provisions to include local
authorities, and if there is a clear framework and everyone is content
with the direction of travel in the second phase and its extension to
local authorities before the new regulator begins its work, that will
allow the regulator to begin its work with a clear view about the
direction of travel and about what still has to be added. The local

						</b> Then in terms of the money for the next three
years, your written statement yesterday said that &#163;8.4 billion
would go to the RSLs, &#163;2.4 billion to the ALMOs&#151;only 60
of 64 authorities that still run their own houses&#151;and the 140
authorities that are directly managed would get a share of less than
&#163;2 billion along with the private sector. Clearly the weight of
funding and intent is still against the half of the country where
people are council tenants and most of the social housing is provided
through the
council.</div>

								Yvette
Cooper:
							</b>
						</i> The budgets that you are describing do
different things. The &#163;8 billion is about new build&#151;it is
about building new homes, and as a result of the changes that we have
made, for the first time local councils can come forward to bid for
that money for new build. A lot of that money will be going to housing
associations building in the areas where councils still own the stock,
so there will still be new social housing in those areas for people in
those local communities, whether it is being built by councils or by
housing associations and whether or not they have transferred their
stock or have an ALMO. They should all be able to benefit from that
&#163;8 billion new build money.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>
					<a name="07121369000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#163;2.4 billion ALMO money is for refurbishing existing homes to
bring them to the decent homes standard, so that is a different budget
and will go directly to ALMOs to refurbish their own stock, not to
housing associations. It is going directly from the taxpayer to ALMOs
for their
refurbishment.</div>

						</b> The ALMO refurbishment, therefore, still totally
excludes the 140 authorities that are not ALMOs. Are you saying that at
the end of next year and the years after that, when we look at the
&#163;8.4 billion that has gone to RSLs, we will see that it has been
evenly spread across the country and not focused on the areas where the
RSLs have most of their housing stock already?</div>

								Yvette
Cooper:
							</b>
						</i> You would not expect there to be any
relationship between the funding for new build and the issue of whether
local authorities have done a stock transfer, because the funding for
new build ought to reflect the priorities of the regional housing
boards with regard to their advice about low-cost home ownership and
how much social housing there should be. Sometimes, they will also set
priority areas and we would then expect bids to come in from all areas,
regardless of what decisions the councils have made about their own
stock and whether they are ALMOs. We also want more councils and ALMOs
to come forward with bids, so that gives them greater flexibility than
they have had
before.</div>

Holmes:
						</b> Well, that is one to watch over the next year or
two. Clause 269 of the Bill will give the Secretary of State the power
to alter how the HRA works and, as you have said in other statements
and on Second Reading, the intention is that there will be some pilots
around 2009 to 2011&#151;there are some paper pilots at the
moment&#151;and hopefully that would start to roll out around
2010-12. Therefore, there is not much for the next three or four years
for the direct management authorities, but a hope of something further
down the road.</div>
					<a name="07121369000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us say that 75 per cent. of directly managed councils
are in positive subsidy. That is to say that they are losing rent money
to the Government to spend elsewhere, as Chesterfield does. If, after
2011, those experiments have worked, councils can then start to keep
their rent money and their right-to-buy money. That, as you have argued
every time we have talked about it, would obviously have a big impact
on the 25 per cent. of directly managed authorities which
are in negative subsidy and which get money from the rest of the
councils. What will you do to plug that gap in four year&#146;s time
when those pilot studies come into wider
use?</div>

								Yvette
Cooper:
							</b>
						</i> What is actually happening with those pilots
and with the work on that is considerably more complex because you have
to take account of some of the wider, redistributive issues embodied in
the HRA at the moment. The benefit of the HRA is that it encompasses
redistribution and takes account of the complex history of the way in
which council homes are funded in different areas. There are all kinds
of aspects of financing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>and historical debt arrangements. There is also different need across
the country. So the upside is that the HRA tries to capture that. The
downside is that it makes it difficult for local authorities to take
sensible, long-term decisions about the management of their
stock.</div>
					<a name="07121369000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
we have been doing those pilots and the approach so far has been to see
whether a situation could be envisaged in which areas could effectively
opt out of the HRA bit by bit and whether an arrangement that was fair
could be worked out so that, as they did so, all the areas that
benefited simply opted out and all those that lost ended up being
inside and lost out further.</div>
					<a name="07121369000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that the results of
those pilots raise even more complexities and that might not be the
right way to do it and that is why we have set up the overarching
review of the HRA to look more widely at the whole thing. That was part
of the statement that I made yesterday. We want to keep the pilots
moving forward, because we think that that might be one way to do it,
but you need to take account of the long-term interaction with other
areas and whether or not they should be contributing or need additional
support in order to do so. I realise that that was not a completely
clear
answer.</div>
