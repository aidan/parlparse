					<a name="08051596000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051596000245"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Dominic Grieve</b> (Beaconsfield) (Con): Regrettably, I do not
think very much of clause 68, and do not understand at all the need to
amend the definition in the way proposed. I cannot conceive of a
circumstance in which a &#147;racial&#148; cause is not already
encompassed within &#147;political, religious or ideological&#148;,
because anybody seeking to carry out terrorism on the back of a racial
motive would already be caught. For us to add yet another unnecessary
category to this growing list seems to me bad legislation, and we
should try to avoid
it.</div>
					<a name="08051596000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051596000246"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I agree
with my hon. and learned Friend. In fact, I tabled an
amendment&#151;I can well understand that that is unnecessary,
because we have a stand part debate&#151;to delete the word
&#147;racial&#148;. However, I agree with my hon. and learned
Friend that we should be very cautious about extending the range of
&#147;terrorist offences&#148;. We need to keep in mind that
conviction for a terrorist offence attracts a whole range of penalties
and consequences that go outside the normal range of criminal
law. The Committee has already dealt with freezing orders and
forfeiture orders, and we are conscious that terrorist-aggravated
offences receive higher sentences. Therefore, we should not add to the
classification of &#147;terrorist offences&#148; unless there is a
very compelling
reason.</div>
					<a name="08051596000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, as
the Committee will know, racially-aggravated offences already attract
higher sentences under existing law. We are entitled to ask, as my hon.
and learned Friend has asked, what the word &#147;racial&#148; adds
to that which is already in the definition. My own belief is that its
inclusion is simply for political correctness, and I suspect that there
is absolutely no justification for it. I shall of course listen to the
Minister explain his reasons, but my instinct is to vote against clause
stand
part.</div>
					<a name="08051596000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08051596000247"></a>
							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I support those
points. The present definition would not include matters of a racial
nature, and therefore we are very suspicious of this change and of the
need for
it.</div>
					<a name="08051596000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000248"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Tony McNulty):
						</b> Funnily enough, we start
with consensus, in the sense that neither Lord 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div>Carlile nor I argue that the change broadens the
offence. If it adds anything, it is clarity, because where
&#147;religious&#148; is already utilised in our law, it has
increasingly been the case that &#147;racial&#148; has been added
as well. I agree broadly that anything that is racially motivated would
be captured by the original wording. However, Lord Carlile says that
the words are added only for clarity&#151;not political correctness
or any such nonsense&#151;and to bring our definition in line with
European and international ones, given that UN Security Council
resolution 1566, which defines terrorism, includes the word
&#147;racial&#148;, and the Council of Europe convention on the
prevention of terrorism 2003/32 also uses that word. That is the only
reason that the words are
added.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000249"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> The Minister seems to have said that he would
expect such offences to be covered by the present definition anyway,
and that the change is about adding clarity. Does he not agree that, as
a general principle, shorter legislation is better than longer
legislation?</div>
					<a name="08051596000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000250"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> No, not necessarily. As a guiding principle, that
is nonsense. What we seek is clarity: the clearest, most
straightforward legislation possible. We do not legislate by counting
the number of words, for God&#146;s sake. We use the appropriate
number of words and the appropriate phraseology for the Bill. Whenever
we put matters relating to race or religion into law, not least in
relation to aggravated offences as the right hon. and learned Member
for Sleaford and North Hykeham suggests, they are invariably bracketed
together. For that reason, there might be confusion. I am happy to have
a further look at the clause, but I do think that it adds a degree of
clarity in our European and international dimensions
without adding to or broadening the definition. I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000270"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The next of these miscellaneous clauses deals with
the creation of a new terrorist offence in relation
to eliciting, publishing or communicating information about members of
the armed forces. If I may say so at the outset, I am perfectly aware
of the nature of the Birmingham plot, and that there has been clear
evidence that individuals have been attempting to obtain such
information for the purpose of doing harm to members of the armed
forces.</div>
					<a name="08051596000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
about the wording of this new offence:</div>
					<a name="08051596000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person commits an
offence who&#151;</div>
					<a name="08051596000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) elicits
or attempts to elicit information about a person who is or has been a
member of Her Majesty&#146;s Forces which is of a kind likely to be
useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism,
or</div>
					<a name="08051596000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) publishes or
communicates information of that
kind.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051596000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">A moment&#146;s
pause makes one realise that that is rather broadly drawn. On the face
of it, because we are concentrating on information which is,</div>
					<a name="08051596000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of a kind likely to be
useful&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08051596000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">the truth is
that almost any information is covered. A perfectly legitimate attempt
by a law firm to write a biographical note giving details about
a serving member of the armed forces might, quite innocently, reveal
material which might be &#147;likely to be useful&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08051596000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, I
recollect, going back to the days of terrorist offences in Northern
Ireland, a number of occasions when individuals were arrested in this
country, with information on them that made the security services and
the police think that a terrorist plot might be attempted. A map of the
area where a Government Minister lived was found. There were details
from telephone directories. There was information&#151;all of which
was publicly obtainable&#151;that, when put together as a package,
clearly indicated the possibility of a malevolent intent. Indeed, a
prosecution was based on that.</div>
					<a name="08051596000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face of it, the
provision is now so widely drawn that anybody who attempted to elicit
that sort of information might find themselves committing an offence. I
cannot believe that that is an appropriate way in which to draft a
criminal offence with a sanction of 10 years&#146; imprisonment. I
appreciate that it could be argued that the wording
in amendment No. 197 would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>cause another problem, as we would have to show the
intention from all the surrounding circumstances&#151;undoubtedly a
more difficult hurdle for a prosecutor to get over than the
current wording. However, just because something involves an extra
hurdle, it does not justify our creating an offence as widely drawn as
that set out in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08051596000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know the usual answer given
by Ministers in such circumstances, because I have heard it before: the
Committee should not worry because no one will prosecute a 10 or
11-year-old boy who tries to elicit information about a hero figure who
has come back from Afghanistan; the Director of Public Prosecutions and
the Attorney-General, in their wisdom, would not prosecute such a
person.</div>
					<a name="08051596000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the whole,
the law must maintain an element of certainty so far as it is possible,
and the clause creates an offence that is extraordinarily uncertain in
its scope. Anyone, however innocently, eliciting information for a
legitimate purpose about somebody who is, or has been, a member of the
armed forces could be caught by it. It would be easy to show that that
information might be useful to a person who was preparing an act of
terrorism. If the Minister can come up with an alternative view of the
drafting, I shall listen carefully. New Labour used to say that there
was a third way, but at the moment I do not see it. The clause is much
too widely drafted. It might also worry journalists who want to carry
out legitimate journalism.</div>

						</b> Amendments Nos. 44 and 197 are similar. A few
moments ago, the Minister spoke about the need for clarity. The
amendments would clarify in what circumstances the law would be
applied. My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome
whispered in my ear that someone preparing material for
<i class="I">Jane&#146;s Fighting Ships </i>might fall foul of the clause. Did
the plane spotters in Greece have a reasonable excuse for what they
were doing? Was the fact that they were plane spotters a sufficient
safeguard? I hope that the Minister will go away and look again at the
matter. Under the amendments, it would be necessary to show clear
intent that the information procured will be useful to someone
committing or preparing an act of terrorism. We need that sort of
clarity in the Bill, and I hope that he will take that on
board.</div>

						<a name="08051596000272"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): Having read the
clause, we see that a person would have a defence if it were proved
that he had a reasonable excuse for his action. However, proposed new
section 58A will criminalise the collection, making
or possession of a record of information that is likely to be useful to
a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. It goes further,
using &#147;eliciting&#148;, which means that a person will commit
an offence if they try to obtain information and make no record of it.
Liberty, for example, argues that that might already be covered under
section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981, which criminalises acts
that are more than merely preparatory to the commission of another
offence. I would be grateful if the Minister could respond to that
point in due
course.</div>
					<a name="08051596000213"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
					<a name="08051596000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
raise one other point. Going back to reasonable excuse, which is
important, proposed new section 58A(2) says that if a person charged
can prove 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div>a reasonable excuse then section 118 of the
Terrorism Act 2000 applies. The use of that defence means that, if the
defendant produces evidence sufficient to raise an issue, the duty is
on the prosecution to prove beyond doubt that the issue exists. That
appears to strengthen the defence by placing the burden on the
prosecution. However, there is also a restriction to the defence of
reasonable excuse&#151;that it will not provide protection to those
who act thoughtlessly or carelessly. Would a person who was duped into
eliciting information by others&#151;others with terrorist
intent&#151;be unlikely to have reasonable excuse? My fear is that
that person could thereby be convicted, even if that
person carelessly or thoughtlessly had no idea that information was
being used with that malicious intent. Will the Minister respond to
that point in due
course?</div>

							<a name="08051596000273"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I, too, want to express my concern about the clause,
and to speak briefly to my amendments Nos. 235 and
236.</div>
					<a name="08051596000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is already
an offence under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which is drawn
in pretty broad terms. It
states:</div>
					<a name="08051596000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person commits an offence if...he collects or makes a record of
information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or
preparing an act of terrorism, or...he possesses a document or
record containing information of that
kind.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051596000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 69 is not
an alternative; it adds to that. My first question is whether clause 69
adds anything to the law as presently stated in section 58 of the
Terrorism
Act.</div>
					<a name="08051596000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000274"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Section 103 of the Terrorism Act 2000 explicitly
refers to members of the armed forces, among others. That has since
been repealed, because it was directed only at Northern Ireland. The
clause simply puts the armed forces focus of section 103 into the
broader section 58. That is the only reason for
it.</div>
					<a name="08051596000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000275"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> When the right hon. Gentleman comes to reply more
fully, I would be grateful if he will expand on that. Section 58 seems
to cover the substance of what we would be seeking to cover under
clause 69. The extent to which clause 69 adds to the substance covered
by section 58 is still not clear. That is the first point on which I
would be grateful for greater clarification from the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08051596000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point develops that made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield. It is an anxiety that I had about section 58 itself.
Section 58 seems to me to be drawn in sufficiently wide terms to cover
journalists and whistleblowers. If they identify any defects in our
security system&#151;for example, at an airport&#151;they would be
liable to prosecution, subject to the statutory defence, under section
58. I agree that clause 69 is more narrowly drawn, but there is a
genuine anxiety that whistleblowers and journalists might find
themselves facing prosecution if they have identified faults relating
to members of the armed forces and then sought to publish them. The
point about <i class="I">Jane&#146;s Fighting Ships</i> is rather interesting,
provided that it was specific to individuals, but I can well understand
that, for example, one might identify errors in the procurement
department that resulted in armed servicemen serving in Afghanistan and
Iraq not being provided with adequate equipment, or defects in the
warning systems. If that information were to be published and
personalised, I would have thought that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>that would run the risk&#151;a serious
risk&#151;of courting a prosecution under clause 69.</div>
					<a name="08051596000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes me to my next point.
I do not like reverse burdens of proof, and that is covered in part by
amendment No. 236. Clause 69(2)
states:</div>
					<a name="08051596000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to
prove that they had reasonable excuse for their action.&#148;
</div>
					<a name="08051596000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will that impose upon a
possible defendant the persuasive and legal burden, or will it be
merely an evidential burden? The Minister will keep in mind that the
courts have applied a variety of approaches to this. Sometimes a clause
of this kind does no more than impose an evidential burden so that the
defendant has to produce some evidence of reasonable excuse, and it is
then for the Crown to negate the reasonable excuse. That is the
evidential case.</div>
					<a name="08051596000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there is also a class
of cases&#151;section 91 of the Medicines Act 1968 is an
example&#151;in which the reverse burden of proof, which is actually
couched in almost identical terms to this, constitutes a legal or
persuasive burden. In other words, the defendant has to prove on the
balance of probabilities that he or she comes within the defence
afforded by the section. I do not know whether what is contemplated by
clause 69 is what the courts call the evidential burden, or what they
call a legal and persuasive burden. It is important that the Minister
give us his opinion on that matter, if only for the guidance of the
courts hereafter.</div>
					<a name="08051596000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
next point is whether the persuasive burden is on the
prospective defendant. I want to enlarge the category of the defences
to include those set out in amendment No. 236&#151;in effect, that
the defendant had no actual or constructive knowledge that the
information and/or disclosure of the same was likely to be of
assistance to a terrorist, or alternatively, that at the time of the
alleged offence he thought that the disclosure was in the public
interest.</div>
					<a name="08051596000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The public
interest defence that I have incorporated in the amendment is basically
intended to assist whistleblowers and journalists. It is right that in
certain cases, subject to the views of the jury, a defendant should be
allowed to assert, &#147;I thought that there was a public interest
in disclosing this information,&#148; and claim that he thought he
was identifying serious shortcomings in the armed services, of which
the public needed to be aware. That is the explicit purpose of
amendment No. 236. Incidentally, I also agree with amendment No. 197,
tabled by my hon. and learned Friend, which would make it absolutely
plain that the Crown has to prove intent. He is absolutely right to say
that that amendment would make it more difficult for the Crown. Too
bad, I say. We are not in the business of making it easier for
prosecution authorities.</div>
					<a name="08051596000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will remember,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, that I did not have the pleasure of
attending the Committee&#146;s first sitting when it addressed the
Bill. That was because I was involved in a case relating to the
Medicines Act 1968, in which it was clear that the Crown had misused
its powers and there had been a gross abuse of Executive authority. I
fear that precisely that sort of situation could arise in this
case.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): As I understand it, the way
that my right hon. and learned Friend has drafted his amendment would
require the potential defendant to establish all three points. I cannot
imagine that that is what he is trying to
do.</div>

general, reasonable excuse defence, and then I have tried to spell out
alternative, specific free-standing defences. If I have erred, I

guilty of looking at the amendments to this clause, not simply in
isolation from the rest of the Bill and from the Terrorism Act 2000 in

rule of law in this country.</div>
					<a name="08051596000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd

relating the clause to section 118 and all other matters. The
discussion about whistleblowers and journalists is abject nonsense in
any terms, unless the researcher for <i class="I">Jane&#146;s</i> then tootles
off to a terrorist and gives him the elicited information. That is
simply what the clause is
about.</div>

that information has been elicited or attempts have been made to elicit
it.</div>

clause 58 of the Terrorism Act, &#147;Collection of
information&#148;. Case law is very clear on the matter too.
Incidentally, the other small point, which I do not think was the
import of any of the amendments, is that this particular offence, which
people recognise the propriety of in terms of what we are trying to do
for our armed forces, will be on a different footing from the broader
issue of collecting information more generally in the Terrorism Act
2000. We will be saying that there is a higher bar, a higher test in
terms of eliciting information about our armed forces than there
is&#151;as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy pointed
out&#151;in section 58 of the 2000 Act more generally in the
collection of information useful for terrorists. I am pretty sure that
is not the intent behind the amendment, but that will be its
consequence.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): I must bring the
Minister back to the point that somehow one has to offer or be engaged
in some sort of discourse with a terrorist for this offence to bite,
and that that is shown by its context after section 58 of the Terrorism
Act 2000. Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that this new clause is
qualified by other clauses within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>the Terrorism Act? If it is not, and if it is read
as it stands, that is clearly not the case. That is why the amendments,
tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield and my hon.

important.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000284"></a>Mr.

						</b> Go away and read the Bill. Section 117 says very
clearly that it is for the DPP to sanction a prosecution in the context
of the Terrorism Act 2000 and all of its import and contexts. Then we
come to the context of section 118 that the hon. Gentleman referred to,
which deals with the reverse burden of proof point and, as the hon.
Gentleman implies, the evidential burden is on the prosecution. If the
defence says, &#147;I was doing it simply for this reason,&#148; as
in our law generally, it is for the prosecution to prove beyond
reasonable doubt that that defence is not a reasonable excuse and
therefore should be put aside. This is why I told the Committee to read
this amendment in the context of both the parent Act and the law more
generally.</div>

duped? Two or three years ago, a constituent of mine, an award-winning
novelist in Wales asked me how many police officers and security people
there are in the House of Commons. He was writing a novel about the
House. Frankly, I ducked the issue. I know that he is not a terrorist,

							<a name="08051596000288"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> With the greatest respect, we do not start from
year zero. The law has been on the statute book since 2000, and section
58 has amassed a good deal of case law. Section 103 has been utilised
rather sparingly in the context of Northern Ireland. In our business we
do not present a clause and then have a paper trail the size of a
telephone book just to find the propriety and the roots and the other
bits that go around it. That is not how we do business. That is a
simplistic approach to Committee, which ill becomes the hon. Gentleman.
Our business is to look at a new clause and the amendments in the
context of the wider body of law from which it
comes.</div>
					<a name="08051596000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">To pursue the
point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, as soon as he
offers up &#147;I had no idea what he was&#148; as a defence, the
burden of proof falls on the prosecution to challenge the excuse that
is being offered with good reason. It is not a reverse burden of proof
either, as the hon. Gentleman himself highlighted in relation to
section 118 of the 2000 Act. Section 117 goes to the provenance of
which prosecutions should be brought under that case, and it
does not have the broad sweep that hon. Members
suggest. In R <i class="I">v.</i> K it was shown that there must be reasonable
suspicion that the information was intended to be used to assist
terrorism. Funnily enough, that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div>why that provision is in a terrorism Act. That would apply equally to
new section 58A&#151;the information must be likely to provide
practical assistance to a person committing or preparing terrorism.
Case law has been built up since the Act became
law.</div>
					<a name="08051596000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding one of
the other points made by the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford
and North Hykeham, &#147;communicate&#148; is not covered by
section 58 nor is &#147;attempt to elicit&#148;, because the
provenance of the amendment is specific to section 103 of the 2000 Act,
which was subsequently repealed because of the dismantling of the
security apparatus and legislation in Northern Ireland. New section 58A
will cover a person trying to get information from MOD staff, not to
write another little novel or to elicit where nuclear sites
are&#151;as Duncan Campbell did in the &#146;80s. Eliciting
information useful to terrorists from MOD staff is not governed by
section 58. MOD staff giving a terrorist information about the armed
forces is covered by new section 58A. On the broader point, there is
only an evidential burden. Crucially, if the defence raises an issue
about the individual&#146;s purpose, the prosecution must disprove
that beyond reasonable doubt. It says here, in my little note, which is
very kindly headed &#147;Welsh guy&#148;, with all due apology
to&#151;</div>

							<a name="08051596000290"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I think it means you. It says, &#147;If
duped, that is a reasonable excuse&#148;. Depending
as always on the circumstances of the case, that can be proffered as a
reasonable excuse. There is only an evidential burden on the defence to
prove the defence. It is for the prosecution to prove that he did not
have that appropriate defence. In that context, all the amendments
would undermine what we seek to do with new section 58A in reinforcing
section 58. I do not doubt that there might be a substantive argument
about section 58 and how that is drawn, but that is not for our
deliberations now. Nor do I doubt that there is an argument that
section 103, which related to the armed forces in Northern Ireland
only, should either not have been repealed or should have been
broadened to the UK or left aside totally. In that context, amendments
Nos. 197 and 44 would undermine the effectiveness, or
efficacit√(c), of the offence provided for in clause 69. The
insertion of paragraph (b) by amendment No. 236 would add nothing to
the statutory defence already included in the clause in terms of legal
effect or clarity and is therefore unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08051596000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">A person who can show that he
did not know and had no reason to know that
information or the disclosure of such information was likely to be
helpful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism would
be able to prove that he had a reasonable excuse for his actions. We
should remember that, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy
very kindly pointed out, section 118 of the 2000 Act places the burden
on the prosecution to disprove the defence beyond reasonable doubt once
an issue has been raised by the
defence.</div>
					<a name="08051596000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
insertion of paragraph (c) under amendment No. 236 is unacceptable. It
would allow the person in question to assert that
he believed that the information that he communicated or published was
in the public interest, regardless of what it was, regardless 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column488" />Column number: 488</div>of the damaging effects of publishing such information and regardless of
how reasonable it was for him to hold that belief. The courts are best
placed to assess whether the disclosure was in the overriding public
interest and whether an excuse is reasonable in the circumstances of
the case.</div>
					<a name="08051596000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 198 would undermine section 58 of the 2000 Act for the same
reasons. That section has been in force since 2001. Section 5 of the
2000 Act already caters for preparatory acts that are carried out with
the intention of assisting another to commit terrorist acts. Section 58
of the 2000 Act and clause 69 provide for wider offences aimed at
combating the activities of those whose conduct is likely to assist
terrorists. They do not require the prosecution to prove an intention
to assist those involved in preparing or committing an act of
terrorism. I am advised that the information itself must raise a
reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to assist in the
preparation or commission of an act of terrorism and to be of a kind
that is likely to provide practical assistance to terrorist
organisations. As we have discussed, section 58 of the 2000 Act and the
clause include statutory defences to protect those who have a
reasonable excuse for their
actions.</div>
					<a name="08051596000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
and learned Member for Beaconsfield said at the outset, there is good
reason for clause 69, and we could go through recent cases where,
sadly, members of the armed forces have been targeted. Other hon.
Members will know that recent history is littered with such actions. On
the basis of the operation of section 103 of the 2000 Act in Northern
Ireland, it is perfectly reasonable that this provision is established
as a UK-wide power because of the nature of the threat that we face. As
we have already firmly established in this Committee, Northern Ireland
is part of the UK and it would apply to Northern Ireland as well.
Recent activities have shown that the power is still required in that
context.</div>
					<a name="08051596000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I resist the
amendments and urge the Committee to support the
clause.</div>

emollient during the Bill&#146;s passage, which is uncharacteristic,
but it was noticeable this morning that he has rather ceased to be so.
I do not know whether that is because he has not had his breakfast.
When the emollience goes, one is always left wondering whether it is
because he feels justifiably outraged at the slurs against the
Government in relation to the drafting of the clause, or
whether it is because attack is the only form of defence
open to
him.</div>
					<a name="08051596000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
Minister has made some important points, the most important of which
was the clarification of the requirement of the prosecution to disprove
the defence once raised beyond reasonable doubt. I will go away and
reflect on whether there is any better way of approaching the wording
for this offence. As I said in my opening remarks, I entirely accept
that such an offence is almost certainly required. It may well be, as
my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham mentioned to me, that any necessary corrections should be made
not to the Bill, but to the original section of the Terrorism Act 2000.

						<b class="B"> </b>I agree with what my hon. and learned Friend
has just said. The Minister is quite right when he draws attention to
section 118 of the 2000 Act, which makes it plain that the burden is
evidential and not persuasive or legal, and that is very helpful. I
accept that his criticism of paragraph (c) of my amendment No. 236 is
well founded; belief by itself should not constitute a reasonable
excuse. On the other hand, publication in the public interest should
constitute a reasonable excuse. I am referring here to whistleblowers.
The proper way forward, which was outlined by my hon. and learned
Friend, is to consider amending section 58 of the 2000 Act. As the Bill
amends that Act in many respects, it would be within the scope of a
long title to make such an amendment. The best way for people such as
myself to proceed is to consider whether we wish to amend section 58 of
the 2000 Act on Report. At present, I am minded to seek to do
so.</div>

Grieve:
						</b> I would be immensely grateful if the Minister
would explain why the amendment in clause 70 is being sought. It looks

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000302"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Clause 70 is innocuous. It clarifies part 3 of
the Terrorism Act 2000, which deals with terrorist property. Section 19
of the 2000 Act makes it an offence for an individual to fail to inform
the police if they believe or suspect during the course of their work
that a person has committed a terrorist finance
offence&#151;the offences in sections 15 to 18 of
the Terrorism Act 2000. Our proposal makes it clear that the offence in
section 19 applies to all people in any form of employment in its
widest sense, including unpaid employment. The duty to inform the
police will therefore apply to contractors, office holders such as
trustees of a charity, individuals on a full work experience programme
or training and people carrying out voluntary work. In so far as this
amendment extends the definition of employment, clause 70(4) ensures
that it will have no retrospective effect. There may be a concern about
the inclusion of those undertaking voluntary work. However, the
Committee will want to note that the Charity Commission considers that
its members are already subject to section 19, and the measure simply
puts that beyond
doubt.</div>
					<a name="08051596000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
provisions in part 3 of the 2000 Act refer to the terms
&#147;employment&#148; and &#147;employer&#148; and the new
definition applies to all those. For example, section 20 allows for
disclosure of a suspicion of a terrorist finance offence to be made to
a constable or to an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>employer regardless of any restriction of the disclosure of information,
such as the duty of confidentiality. &#147;Employer&#148; will now
have the wider meaning given by new section 22A. The provision is
fairly innocuous, and I commend it to the
Committee.</div>

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>
					<a name="08051596000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a retrospective amendment to be
carried back, presumably to the time when the Prevention of Terrorism
Act 2005 was first enacted, which means that a person could not
subsequently argue that because it was being suggested that the offence
that they might have committed came in prior to this Act, they were not
involved in a terrorism-related activity, even though it might have
fallen within paragraphs (a) to
(c).</div>
					<a name="08051596000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will
not be surprised to learn that I do not like that
amendment. It is our task as parliamentarians to draft statute, and
people are entitled to rely upon statute for their protection. When Sir
Thomas More was confronted with the Act of Supremacy and with having to
take the oath at Lambeth palace, he asked for a copy of the statute
from which the oath had been drafted and pointed out to his
interlocutors that he considered that the oath did not follow the terms
of the statute. Much good did it do him, mind you, but it is an early
example of the proper reliance that people in this country have been
entitled to place upon the words that Parliament enacts.</div>
					<a name="08051596000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We live in a society where you
are entitled to do what you like unless Parliament prohibits it. This
form of retrospective removal of a possible right that could be invoked
by a defendant does not commend itself to me, and I need a lot of
persuasion from the Minister as to why it should be included. It
applies equally to the question of the application for anonymity for a
controlled person where, again in clause 74, it says these amendments
shall be deemed always to have had effect.</div>
					<a name="08051596000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister explain the
scope of both the amendments of the Terrorism Act and also explain why,
quite exceptionally it seems, that it is necessary that these

							<a name="08051596000310"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I rise to support what my hon. and learned Friend
has said. It is very important that this House, and thus this
Committee, should not pass retrospective legislation. As I understand
the intention of clause 72, it is either to define more clearly or to
enlarge the class of activity that might trigger an application for
control orders. Control orders are essentially penal in their
consequences, although they are not treated as such by the
Government.</div>
					<a name="08051596000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with my hon. and learned Friend that people should not be subjected to
restrictions on their liberty as a result of retrospective legislation.
If there is no powerful justification for what is being done, I hope
that we will divide the Committee on this
subject.</div>

							<a name="08051596000312"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I understand perfectly the concerns, but I hope
that I can allay them, because the measure is not meant to enlarge
anything&#151;it is meant to do the reverse. I understand the
objections to retrospectivity as well. I am grateful to the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield for invoking one of my heroes, although
I am not going to go down the road of the life and times of Thomas
More.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>
					<a name="08051596000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to delete a similar provision contained in the two
different clauses 72 and 74. It may help if I talk about the
background. The purpose of clause 72 is to remove two potential
ambiguities in the definition of terrorism-related
activity in the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Section 1(9)(d) of the Act
currently includes the
phrase</div>
					<a name="08051596000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;conduct which
gives support or assistance to individuals who are known or believed to
be involved in terrorism-related
activity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08051596000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
could be read as including individuals who unknowingly provide support
or assistance to those involved in terrorism-related activity. In other
words, the definition could currently include an individual A
supporting an individual B whom the Secretary of State knows or
believes is a terrorist, even though A does not know or believe that B
is a terrorist. That is the thrust of the definition as currently
drawn, which was never the intention.</div>
					<a name="08051596000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the Committee that the
current provision has never been interpreted in that way, but none the
less the ambiguity is there. The clause therefore amends the Prevention
of Terrorism Act 2005 to ensure that the definition includes only those
who provide support or assistance to individuals who are known or
believed by the individual concerned to be involved in
terrorism-related activity. Rather than enlarge, it narrows the focus
of the import of the original
definition.</div>
					<a name="08051596000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000313"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am delighted to learn that, but in the
circumstances, and granted that the Minister has said that the power
has not caused any problems in the past, why are we putting in a
retrospective clause for its operation? I suggest that the measure is
not necessary, and on the whole I would prefer not to see
it.</div>
					<a name="08051596000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000314"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> On balance, my advice is that it probably is
necessary. I take the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s points, as I
said earlier, about the construct of the thing. The current definition
also includes a potential circularity. Under the current definition,
individual X could have a control order imposed on him because he was
supporting individual Y, who in turn was known or believed to be
supporting an individual Z who was involved in terrorism-related
activity. There could be any number of links in this chain, all of whom
could, in theory, have a control order imposed on them. The definition
of those captured by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 is not
intended to be that wide and has never been used in that way, but the
ambiguity is still there. Clauses 72 and 74 simply remove that
circularity, ensuring that only those who provide support or assistance
to someone directly involved in terrorism-related activity are included
in the definition of terrorism-related activity. In the example given,
only Y would be caught by the revised definition, not
X.</div>
					<a name="08051596000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those paragraphs
may be otiose and over-cautious, but my advice, which has persuaded me,
is that on balance they are necessary. If we accept that&#151;I know
that it is terribly offensive&#151;given that narrowing of the
definition, notwithstanding the fact that it has never been interpreted
in that way, it would be foolish and illogical not to return
retrospectively to 2005 in terms of narrowing the definition. I know
that that sounds terribly complicated, but I am assured that it is
necessary and worthwhile.</div>

situation:</div>
					<a name="08051596000150"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

					<a name="08051596000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
very persuasive&#151;those are fairly empty words, to be honest. I am
sure that if the Minister were on the Opposition Benches, he would feel
equally concerned about retrospection in this context. He says that on
the balance of probability it is necessary, but it is a rather huge
step, is it not?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000316"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I do not want the Committee to think that I have
anything but the same aversion to retrospection in the law as the
Committee does. I am not diminishing the importance of not being
retrospective in legal practice. If, however, clauses 72 and 74 were
not included simply because over the past two or three years they have
not been interpreted in the way in which I have described, the
provision might be interpreted with a definition that is too broad and
that encompasses people in the net in a way in which the principal
policy did not seek to do in the first place. Over-cautious or
otherwise, it would be illogical not to amend the legislation and
introduce retrospection.</div>
					<a name="08051596000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were to
try to achieve the same thing by another route&#151;through the code
of practice or whatever else&#151;we could say, &#147;From now on,
this is what the Government clearly meant; we are very grateful that
people have not interpreted the definition in the potentially wider
context that they perfectly fairly could have done and from now on
we&#146;ll make sure that they won&#146;t&#148; If we were to do
that, however, there would still be a chance&#151;it would be
remote&#151;that the activities of someone who is up for a control
order between 2000 and 2008 would come under the current broader
definition of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 as the grounds for
the control order. Under clauses 72 and 74, however, the same person
with the same network and the same behaviour would quite rightly be
outside the net in terms of control orders, which was the original
intention. On balance, I do not think that the change is over cautious.
I appreciate that its presentation is terribly clumsy, as is
the language, but on balance it is the right and necessary thing to
do.</div>

Hogg:
						</b> There are two issues here. First, there is the
principle. I am very much against retrospective legislation. I do not
like seeing it in statute because it can be invoked later as a
precedent. The basic principle against retrospectivity is a very
important one to which we need to cling. The Minister has made a
perfectly decent argument, but it has one fatal flaw. Applications for
control orders&#151;this is the triggering mechanism that we are
debating&#151;are within the exclusive control of the Executive. If
the Executive, through the right hon. Gentleman, says that the
interpretation he has given is correct and that they will not be
seeking a control order in the future in the widest sense, we have
safeguarded the situation. That is partly because an application will

							<a name="08051596000319"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I listened to what my right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said and there may be
good grounds for withdrawing the amendments at this stage. However, the
matter leaves me profoundly uneasy. I do not like the principle. The
logic of the Government&#146;s position is not entirely clear to me.
I appreciate that the desire is not to widen the scope of control
orders but to narrow them. In short, the Government have concluded that
the current architecture of the control order system might lead to a
result that the Government did not want, in that a control order could
be granted in circumstances that they would regard as not being
justified. Therefore they want to close that down and to do so in a way
that deems that the closure dates back to the original control order
architecture of 2005.</div>
					<a name="08051596000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the face of it, the
Government&#146;s justification for this is that it is entirely a
matter that will favour the person who might be subject to a control
order. There may be an alternative way of looking at this, although the
Minister may wish to reassure me that I am wrong. Control orders, by
their very nature, walk a delicate tightrope within the limits of
acceptability under the European convention on human rights. If in the
original drafting in 2005, the scope of the possible application of the
power was placed too wide, it could be argued that that might be a
ground on which a person made subject to a control order in the future
might say that the scope of the entire control order system could not
be upheld because it was too widely drawn and that that was an example
of it. I do not know. These are recondite legal arguments, but I can
see how it might happen. I cannot help but think that that is the
Government&#146;s more likely fear, than that they would try to seek
a power that they are not comfortable with within the scope of the 2005
orders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000320"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> What the hon. and learned Gentleman says perfectly
illustrates the fact that it is time that we revisited the control
order regime to see how it could be improved and how some of its
defects, which have come to light through legal judgments and
elsewhere, could be addressed. I do not believe that this is the right
time to do so and I look forward to this afternoon&#146;s session,
although we cannot possibly do the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>matter justice in the context of the amendment tabled for that purpose
this afternoon, and it is entirely probable that we will not wish to
enter into a debate on it. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree
that it is time that we revisited the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005
and looked at the matter in the
round?</div>
					<a name="08051596000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000321"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I do agree with him. He will recollect that my
party has supported renewal of the control orders on a number of
occasions, but that we indicated on the last occasion that we hoped
that this Bill might provide an opportunity for us to look at the
matter again in some detail. I fear that that will not happen, partly
because the Government themselves have not come forward with a series
of amendments to trigger it and because the necessities of time make it
unlikely that we can consider it in proper detail this
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="08051596000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
mindful of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments. I saw that he had
tabled them, and if he had not, I probably would have tabled some of my
own. I doubt that we will have a better opportunity on Report, but
this little matter of a flaw in the control order
mechanisms that the Government have picked up on classically
illustrates why an overview of the matter may be desirable&#151;not
in the sense of getting rid of control orders altogether, because we
have always accepted that they may be an unpleasant necessity. We have
held that opinion for some time, though we have been unhappy about
them, as I am sure the Government are.</div>
					<a name="08051596000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The basic issue is whether we
should press the matter to a vote at this stage. I am slightly swayed
by the opinion of my right hon. and learned Friend and I will seek to
withdraw the amendment, but I am unhappy about the principle of
retrospectivity and would be minded to return to it on Report if the
Government cannot come up with a better formula for dealing with it.
The Minister might like to note what I have said and, with regard to my
anxiety about this being a possible loophole that a defendant could
properly exploit to attack the principle of control orders, reassure me
that that is not the Government&#146;s main motivation, rather than
clearing up an area where the Government think that they might use
excessive powers, although of course in practice I am sure that they
have no intention of doing so. Subject to that, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08051596000323"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I understand the broad thrust of the amendment,
and it is a difficult area in the sense that we seek to protect these
key facilities and afford in statute an ability for the operators to
recover their costs. We have already done this on a voluntary basis;
this simply puts it on a statutory basis. Given the importance of these
facilities for the economy and overall life of the UK, we want that
done all the time, 24/7, on a regular basis. Yes, crucially, that will
seek to prevent terrorist incursion to disrupt those facilities, but it
would just confuse things if we simply included the reference to the
national security of the UK, because we want protection all the time;
yes, principally protection from terrorism, but also for the broader
interest, economic and otherwise, of the facility.</div>
					<a name="08051596000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand where the hon.
Member for Newark is coming from in terms of trying
to strengthen the anti-terrorist dimension of the clause, but the
amendment will not achieve that. In fact, it will probably lessen and
dilute the import of what we are trying to do to protect these
facilities. The point where the national security elements of such key
facilities stops, and their broader contribution to economic life
begins is, by definition, incredibly blurred. I sympathise with his
reasons for the amendment, but I do not think it works. The clause as
written achieves exactly what he seeks to achieve, and I would ask that
the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>

						</b> Before I address the amendment, it might be helpful
to seek a definitional clarification, which is: what is meant by
&#147;gas&#148;? It is not defined in the Bill. I attempted
to table a probing amendment to seek to clarify that. I assume
we are talking about hydrocarbons&#151;gas intended for fuel
use&#151;but &#147;gas&#148; is a rather broad term, and I am
quite surprised that it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>not defined in the Bill. Perhaps there is a statutory meaning of
&#147;gas&#148; which already provides this; if so, it surprises

					<a name="08051596000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
45 introduces the words &#147;or a police authority&#148;. This may
be a matter on which the Minister can very quickly reassure me. It is
clear that when extra police services are provided for the security of
gas facilities, they can come from two sources. They can come from the
Ministry of Defence police, in which case no problem arises, or they
can be provided under section 25(1) of the Police Act 1996, entitled
&#147;Provision of special services&#148;, in which case they will
of course be drawn from territorial police forces. All I am trying to

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000331"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That is the worst of all worlds: an intervention
that did not give me the answer. The point is that if police are
provided by a territorial force, it is appropriate that the police
authority that has the responsibility for funding
that force has the recompense from this levy back to their resources. I
know when I was chairman of a police authority, there was very great
resentment when the resources for policing national events or events
with national security implications had to come from already
overstretched police authority budgets. The end was willed by the
Government, but not the means to provide.</div>
					<a name="08051596000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000332"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> The Bill makes provision for either the
MOD police or territorial police to provide that
policing. Under current arrangements, in many of these cases, there is
a central national pot that funds dedicated security posts. By and
large, that money is from the centre, given that these are national
provisions. I do take the point about abstraction from territorial
forces, but that has not been the case thus far and is unlikely to be
in the future.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000333"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am grateful for that, which means I can
abbreviate my further points. I would like to be satisfied that that is
the case. I will give a direct example: the policing of Bristol airport
at times of high terrorist activity was a significant drain on the Avon
and Somerset constabulary. It meant abstraction from our
local constabularies: police officers who were
community officers in my area found themselves instead toting machine
guns at Bristol airport. It does seem appropriate that, where local
police authorities are having to carry the burden of a national
security responsibility, they are properly recompensed for it. I hope
and think the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>Minister is assuring me that that is the case. If he can give that
assurance, I will be satisfied.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000334"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I join in the comments made by the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome. In addition, there are a couple of amendments that
we have tabled that are to be considered now. They are really
definitional, as to what constitutes &#147;in and around&#148; a
facility and whether that should be geographically defined. My question
to the Minister is whether what constitutes the provision of extra
police services in or around a facility will be a source of dispute if
no further geographical definition is given. The amendments propose 1
mile; they are probing amendments and again I come back to the nature
of the discussions that have taken place between the Government and the
industry itself and the providers, in terms of resolving these matters.
Will there be arguments over the interpretation of the text of the
statute?</div>
					<a name="08051596000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08051596000335"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I certainly can assure the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome that is not intended for this provision either to
come out or be abstracted from territorial forces that just happen to
have such a facility in their area. It is above and beyond
that.</div>
					<a name="08051596000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
quote the site but one example now has voluntarily 24 hours a day,
seven days a week armed response coverage by the MOD police. Prior to
them taking over the role, a small team from the territorial force
involved, fully funded from the dedicated security post central pot,
did that in its stead. We are trying to replicate that because I do
take the point about abstraction.</div>
					<a name="08051596000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
incurring your wrath, Mr. O&#146;Hara, the
points about airports are entirely separate and
different. The designated airports, that is the ex-BAA airports, do
need to come to some arrangement with the local police&#151;Heathrow,
Gatwick and so on. The non-designated invariably do not or are always a
matter of dispute, rather like Bristol. So the hon. Gentleman will give
two cheers at least for the announcement among others yesterday of a
transport security Bill, which is designed to implement that aspect of
Stephen Boys Smith&#146;s report that tries to restore the balance
between that crucial infrastructure&#151;local airports&#151;and
the burden on local police, simply because it happens to be in their
area. I digress, for which I
apologise.</div>
					<a name="08051596000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am
on my feet&#151;because I do not think there will be a need for a
clause stand part&#151;if the hon. Gentleman turned the page gently
to clause 81(4) he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>would see that all expressions used in the sections are defined in part
1 of the Gas Act 1986. That covers every aspect of what he referred to
earlier in terms of definition, narrowly defined, too, by the reference
in the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, which is the interplay
between those, and says what we want.</div>

admonition for someone else through me.</div>
					<a name="08051596000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
inclined to accept the point about geography, not least because in our
discussions with Ofgem, the industry and the police, it is seen as an
operational matter. These are distinct and very different facilities.
In one case, to draw a half-mile radius might be more than sufficient
to encompass all the security and policing dimensions but, given their
nature, others might be far broader than that.</div>
					<a name="08051596000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The broad intention would
be&#151;largely informally and voluntarily&#151;to have that drawn
up and agreed between the parties concerned. By their nature, some of
these sites are very close to coastal areas and rely
strongly on the road network and it is for the chief constable or the
principals concerned to determine where the security and policing
impact in terms terrorism or continued utilisation of those sites
should be drawn. On balance, while 1 km or 1 mile might be sufficient
in many areas, I do not want to restrict their hands in that context.
There can be broad agreement by the parties concerned as to what the
necessary curtilage around one of these sensitive sites would
be.</div>
					<a name="08051596000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">This seeks to put
in the Bill a statutory provision that is already carried out on some
sites on a voluntary basis. Hon. Members will know that these are very
important sites and we think that this is the way not to replicate the
airport position that imposes an undue burden on the local constabulary
simply because of the accidental geographical location of such
sensitive sites. I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>
