<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of clarification, are we discussing the revised draft of clause 19?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The document was produced by the Minister as an aide memoire, rather than a formal proposal. Technically, the clause that we are discussing is the one printed on the notice paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise in advance for having to leave the Committee in about half an hour to fulfil a speaking engagement in the north of England; I have alerted Ministers to that fact. I shall therefore speak only briefly to the clause and allow my hon. Friends to undertake more detailed scrutiny.
<P>
We have before us a Government redrafting of this most important clause. That is a helpful development, as the original clause is seriously defective, and almost absurd in its attempt to criminalise much innocent communication. Our amendments attempt to correct it; we know that the Government share some of our misgivings.
<P>
The question must be asked what point was served by publishing clause 19 in its original form. It is grotesquely wide, as we discovered in a previous debate on these matters. Clause 19 is not the only example in the Bill of the Government starting with the intention of trying to catch pretty well everything and slowly, under the impact of external criticism and debate, restricting it. The Bill will take much longer if we discover other examples. It does not do justice to the matter if the Government take pot shots at subjects and then have to table rewrites and revisions.
<P>
I propose constructively that if the Government can identify in advance other examples of clearly defective clauses, it would save a great deal of the Committee's time.
<P>
I repeat that we do not accept that primary legislation is just overall guidance and that the real meat of the Bill lies in secondary legislation; that devalues the Bill. The purpose of a Bill is to set out people's rights and obligations and the possible sanctions that they may face if they breach the law. The Bill will be the source document for many years to come; people want to know, by looking at the Bill, and not at a mass of regulations, exactly what they are expected to do. It is important to define matters closely and correctly in primary legislation.
<P>
There is a disappointing development which has partly been corrected by the positive way in which the Government have conceded it and introduced an amendment. However, on first reading, the revised clause still does not appear to do the trick. One subsection is drafted widely and attempts to outlaw communications received on the internet that are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of having an effect in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that we shall have an opportunity to debate the internet more fully later in the Bill, but that phrase represents no change from the clause's original wording.
<P>
Unfortunately, I am not an internet nerd, although I frequently receive advice on it from my 10-year-old daughter. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of having an effect in the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will catch just about anything on the internet. Unless a communication or an offer is written in Chinese or clearly excludes the United Kingdom, it could be taken up or acted upon by someone based in the United Kingdom. That phrase needs further thought.
<P>
The definition of an investment and investment activity is also drawn widely. I welcome the fact that the clause now excludes private individuals and will catch only those communications made in the course of business. However, I own property that I occasionally let on a short-term basis. If I invite someone to rent a house or cottage, I will definitely be engaged in business and I am also dealing with an asset, a right or an interest. I will not be an authorised person under the provisions in the Bill, and I have no intention of becoming one. However, the Bill's definition will catch&#151;whether deliberately or otherwise&#151;many communications of a business-like nature that are conducted between people who are not authorised or registered.
<P>
It would be absurd if I were not able to offer, as I have in the past, my cottage to hon. Members for a holiday because I might fall foul of clause 19. It might be deemed that I am inviting them to take a right or an interest in something that I own.
<P>
The revised draft is an improvement, but it does not respond in full to our criticisms and suggestions. We are not happy with the fact that secondary legislation may make the position gloriously clear. I refer the Committee to what the Economic Secretary said on Tuesday. She mentioned that a consultation paper on financial promotion had been issued. However, as far as I know, the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury have not responded to the consultations. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We intend to publish draft regulations for further consultation while the Bill is still passing through its parliamentary stages.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 20 July 1999; c. 324.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We may finish the debate on the clause and vote to accept or reject it, but only then will we see the draft regulations. However, they will be issued only for further consultation. Their final form will be invisible and they will not be seen by any member of the Committee before we finish our debate on this subject or even before we conclude our deliberations on the Bill. That is not a satisfactory way to proceed, and adds up to a potentially serious situation.
<P>
The Government naturally wish to make progress, and we have all expressed our desire to see a Bill on the statute book. However, that example of how to proceed does not appeal to the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I shall be quite critical of the clause as redrafted, but I should first make one general point. In view of the mess that the previous Government made of regulating this area in the mid-1980s, we should be aware that it is difficult to get it right. We seek by the amendment to return to the set of compromises introduced in the mid-1980s, which were arrived at with some difficulty. We are concerned that the clause will not return us to that position, but will take us to a much more draconian one. Some of us gasped when the word Stalinist was first used in Committee; now that we have reached clause 19, I am gasping a little less than I did then.
<P>
Clause 19 raises many general issues that I shall not deal with now, but if I can catch your eye later, Mr. Atkinson, I shall raise them in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I said during Tuesday's sitting that I would be happy to allow a wide-ranging debate on this first group of amendments, given the clause's structure, on the basis that the clause stand part debate would be fairly narrow and restricted to more specific points.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Yes, there are points about the Bill's workability in the face of technological change, the extent to which that question has been left in the hands of the Treasury and the relationship between the clause and schedule 2. Subsection (7) cross-refers to schedule 2. Some important issues are involved, but I shall not rehearse them now.
<P>
I shall concentrate on our amendments, especially amendment No. 85. We are attempting by the amendments to tighten up what will otherwise be an extremely broad enabling power in the hands of the FSA. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of having an effect in the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is extraordinarily broad, and could mean almost anything. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) said a moment ago, that could catch almost any transaction, including business on the internet that is not specifically targeted at the United Kingdom.
<P>
I do not think that that is what the Government intend. We shall hear in a moment whether I am correct, but I think that the Government intend to use subsection (3) to add a measure of discretion and flexibility to the bald phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``having an effect in the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That subsection will give the Treasury a let-out by which to reinstate many exemptions that would otherwise be ruled out under subsection (1). We want those exemptions put back; how many of them will be and will we return to where the law stands now? That is the crucial question.
<P>
In order to find that out, we must consider the Treasury paper ``Financial Promotion&#151;A Consultation Document'' published in March 1999. I have not read all of it, but I have read the relevant passage&#151;paragraphs 2.11 to 2.17&#151;three or four times. The Financial Secretary clearly knows them intimately, so she does not need to refer to the document. I am not sure that that passage takes us back&#151;or even that the Treasury intends by it to take us back&#151;to the current position under existing law. The key passage in my internet copy is paragraph 2.12, which sets out three possible ways in which exemption may be framed. In a nutshell, the first is giving maximum flexibility to the FSA, letting it decide to grant exemptions on ad hoc basis and giving no verbal guidance about when that should be. The second possibility is providing a clear definition of the exemption, and the third is a combination of the first two approaches.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The document shows that the Government prefer the third approach. They reject the first approach not because it would give too much power to the FSA, but because it would result in a lack of certainty for the industry. That is significant: nowhere in the document do the Government state that giving too much power to the FSA is a reason for rejecting the first approach of maximum flexibility for the FSA.
<P>
Incidentally, wherever the word ``flexibility'' appears in the Bill, it could be replaced by a phrase connoting enormous, untrammelled power for the FSA. In the hands of that body, flexibility means breadth of discretion in a large number of circumstances, and certainly in relation to the matter that we are discussing.
<P>
The Government reject the second possibility of defining the exemption clearly because it would unduly restrict flexibility. As I said, the third possibility is the preferred approach.
<P>
That seems reasonable until one examines the third tiere´, which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it will be important to ensure that it&#151;''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
meaning the exemption&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is appropriately drawn to ensure that on the one hand promotions which ostensibly comply with the indicators but which are none the less, in substance, directed at the UK, are to be caught, but on the other, that, promotions which are not actually targeted at the UK, should not be, even if they do not actually comply with the various indicators.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In plainer English, that means that the FSA has virtually total discretion, in all but name.
<P>
There is one caveat, which almost takes us back to the position in the first tiere´, which would give the FSA maximum flexibility. That is a long way from the position under existing law.
<P>
To consider the effect of that, one must examine the list of proposed indicators in paragraph 2.17, by which an assessment would be made of whether an exemption would be justifiable. I shall not go through those indicators which, however, will be crucial to the industry,
<P>
Will the indicators be justiciable? If not, they are completely valueless, so my assessment of whether there has been compromise by the Treasury in going for the third option rather than the first would be proved correct.
<P>
This morning, I took legal advice about whether those indicators would be justiciable. The answer was ``Probably, yes.'' However, I was advised that the Treasury would be caught by the indicators, only if no reasonable regulator could have reached the Treasury's decision. In other words, the Treasury would have to be unreasonable in its interpretation of the indicators before it could be successfully prayed against in law. Therefore, the indicators have little value.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell (North-East Bedfordshire):</B> The only remedy that exists in the event of a lack of clarity, which may leave the system in difficult commercial circumstances, is to make a case for judicial review. Only the last ditch of total unreasonableness by the Treasury or the FSA would provide a peg for my hon. Friend to hang his complaint upon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is absolutely correct and it shows why the document is so crucial. It is the guidance document that will clarify how the Treasury intends to implement the exemptions under subsection (3). That is also why we tabled the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 85 would bring the law back into a more balanced position. It would take us back&#151;and that is apparently the intention&#151;to the current position under existing legislation, as specified under sections 57 and 207(3) of the Financial Services Act 1986. We want to ensure that there is no drift away from current legal practice, particularly towards anything that provides wider discretion to the Treasury&#151;and therefore to the FSA&#151;in implementing the clause.
<P>
That is the argument in favour of amendment No. 85, but I want to touch on an argument that runs against it, because I am not absolutely sure that amendment No. 85 would, in the long run, be the right way to go. As drafted, I am not sure that it would enable us to go back exactly to where we are now. If the Government were to provide a statement that that was what they intended to do and that they would return with proposals to implement it, I would strongly commend them for taking that decision.
<P>
There is also a relationship between amendment No. 85, existing law and new technology. Let us use language that we can all understand. Can action be taken against somebody who is trying to communicate from outside the UK in an attempt to sell a product? In other words, as the internet develops, will even current law be enforceable? Will it be possible to set up a system of regulation to prevent people selling from abroad? Probably not. However, there is a case for providing a partial exemption, along the lines of amendment No. 85. If a total exemption were provided, it might render civil action ineffective as well.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary clarify whether she and the Government, in framing the exemptions under subsection (3), considered that point? Where there is no practical enforceability in the criminal law or under the Bill, would a partial exemption mean that civil action could be taken by an aggrieved party who bought a product advertised and available from abroad on the internet?
<P>
Having said that, at least for now, there are some good arguments in favour of amendment No. 85. I have already mentioned civil law. Another good argument relates to the importance of sending the right international signals. One crucial concern will be that we&#151;at the forefront of regulation in this sector&#151;do not regulate and create an unhelpful precedent for countries' such as Italy and France, that are seeking to protect their financial markets from competition from foreign&#151;and often British&#151;service suppliers. I am worried about the clause. Unless the amendment is accepted, we will find ourselves in the vanguard of the regulators providing precedents for continental countries to apply severe regulation to justify their protectionist tendencies. That would be disastrous.
<P>
Finally, I should say that I am not entirely happy with the current Act, or amendment No. 85, which attempts to replicate it. However, without it the clause would be far worse. If I manage to catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson, I shall explain why a more fundamental change to the clause will be required before 10 years have elapsed, with or without the amendment. Will the Financial Secretary explain whether the Government intend to replicate the existing law? If so, does that intention relate to possible civil actions in respect of products purchased from abroad on the internet by UK citizens?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I thank the Government for producing an amended version of the clause, which has made it much easier for us to cold towel this tortuous clause. I should redeclare my interest, in that I am probably the only member of the Committee who will be an ``authorised person''&#151;a new class of super citizen.
<P>
The clause's scope is far too wide. The Treasury appears to have deliberately granted itself wide powers and, where commercial needs arise, restrained them by exemptions. The concern is that exemptions may not always be right, and that the democratic scrutiny of exemptions is thin. A general order will be laid before Parliament, like it or leave it, which will provide no opportunity for debate.
<P>
Government amendment No. 94 is similar to amendment No. 129 and, in terms of impact, to amendments Nos. 101 and 102. It will introduce the phrase, ``in the course of business'', which is a crucial reservation, and exclude personal communication. We are worried that the amendment has defined communication too widely, by stating that a person must not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Elsewhere, the amendment further defines communication, but the concept of intent is missing. For such communications to be caught, the amendment should deal with information that is intended to be communicated.
<P>
In effect, by empowering the Treasury to make the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the course of business''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
mean whatever it wants it to mean, Government amendment No. 96 will undo the very concept that the Government want to introduce. That phrase is a clear, common-sense term, and there is no need for the Treasury to define and thereby undermine its intent.
<P>
As my hon. Friends have said, Government amendment No. 95 is the crucial internet amendment. The Treasury appears to be terrified of the net. It believes that, potentially, the net will drive a coach and horses through attempts to regulate, if not to tax, and has deliberately left the clause extraordinarily wide, so it can reserve the power to define whatever it wants.
<P>
It has been pointed out that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``having an effect in the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
allow the clause to cover anything. As we all spend our weekends surfing the net, whatever we may find on investment products could be seen as having an effect on the UK.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 85, in conjunction with amendments Nos. 83 and 80, is designed to define clearly the rules for the net. There is the question of whether we should have law that is not enforceable. If a bank in Berlin or Buenos Aires offers UK citizens a wonderful rate of interest on sterling deposits, it remains to be seen what we can do if there is a criminal offence. However, we accept that it is necessary to protect the right of contract. If a UK citizens enters into a contract through something that is illegal under our law, that contract is not valid. Although British policemen will not be able to lock up people in Berlin or Buenos Aires for committing a criminal offence, it is a valuable aspect of law to have.
<P>
There is a problem with the European Union{**nrl**}commerce directive which is&#151;I am not changing my stance&#151;a classic example of a good aspect of the EU. However, the Financial Secretary will be aware of widespread concerns. There is a desire to include uniform regulation for net communication in the EU so that there is a clear principle of country-of-origin, not extra-territorial, policing. The Government have given the Treasury, not the FSA, the power to decide. Our amendments are clearer and more practical.
<P>
Government amendment No. 97 appears to deal with a drafting point, but I may have missed something. It changes the definition of engaging in investment activity. Government amendment No. 98 defines communicate to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``causing a communication to be made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What are the reasons for that wider definition? I understand that it attempts to get at the person behind the communication as well as the communicator, but again, I may have missed something.
<P>
Amendment No. 106 deals with the Government's definition of ``controlled activity''. We want that qualified as a business activity. However, I accept that the amendment might be redundant if the first part of the clause sweeps up everything after it. Amendments Nos. 81 and 82 touch on important territory to which my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester alluded and which has not been tackled by the Government. Since 1986, there have been two categories of communication and two sets of rules. Section 56 of the Financial Services Act 1986 deals with cold calling and section 57 deals with advertisements. There is no criminal offence under section 56, because contracts can be invalidated, but publishing misleading or naughty advertisements is a criminal offence. Behind those provisions lies a body of practice relating to the difference between private and public marketing. Regulation, be it in Europe, the United States or Hong Kong, contains important distinctions between those two concepts, which also relate to the different types of policing of communication. Clause 19 bangs those two together, creating a number of changes to the present legal arrangements, and problems that have not been addressed.
<P>
The measure threatens to undermine the overseas exemption, which will disappear as a result of clause 19. If someone managing money in, for example, London or Edinburgh telephoned a broker in America or Hong Kong to buy stocks, that would be fine. However, if the broker later called back to say, ``I've got a line of something else, are you interested?'', that would constitute a criminal offence under clause 19. We could find no exemption for that under the draft order.
<P>
The proposal drives a coach and horses through the principle of overseas exemption, which is enshrined in current law and has established London as the major financial centre of the world. It would be a serious matter to make such extra-territorial communication by an overseas broker&#151;who is neither an authorised person nor engaging in a regulated activity&#151;a criminal offence. That will be the outcome under clause 19. That cannot be the Government's intention, but there will be many other examples along that line of thinking.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester made the point that, in the proposals, consciously or unconsciously, a body of legal practice that has resulted from sections 56 and 57 of the Financial Services Act 1986 is being abandoned, then put back together under much wider rules for communication. The Treasury would then be relied on to sort out exemptions that might or might not recreate the former situation satisfactorily. We are concerned that the Treasury might get that wrong, in such a dense and complex territory, and that while it is attempting to get it right, there will be no opportunity for debate as to whether the exemption orders are correct.
<P>
Therefore, although amendments Nos. 81 and 82 do not go into great detail, we see a great need for amendments on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned how many things have been swept up in this measure. I am not exactly sure what is swept up, but I would like to ask him a question. If a private individual goes to a private company, and asks if any of its shares are for sale, I am confident that such an activity is not, at present, caught by any regulation. Would it be caught under clause 19, and, if so, could not almost any conversation about exchange of assets be so caught?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my hon. Friend, who is moving into territory that I shall cover during the clause stand part debate. If a small business in your constituency, Mr. Atkinson, offered a promising product or service and you, as a good Member of Parliament, wished to help it, you would be committing a criminal offence under the terms of the Bill if you spoke to the business and offered to help it by putting it in contact with the small business unit of the local clearer, which could raise money by way of a share issue. You would be a non-authorised person making arrangements for the issue of shares. Under the Bill, that is clearly&#151;and there are no exemptions&#151;a criminal offence. All sorts of things will be swept up as criminal offences when, because they were in the cold-calling category, they were not under previous regulations.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> May I query with my hon. Friend whether Mr. Atkinson would have taken such action in the course of his business?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes, in the course of Mr. Atkinson's business as a Member of Parliament. I hope that he would often take such action. However, the Treasury has reserved the right to define the term ``course of business''. There is no clear definition in the Bill, and the common-sense definition is not being applied.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> This is a complex and important clause. It relates to restrictions on financial promotion and the key words appear in the first lines of amendment No. 9 which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person (``A'') must not, in the course of business, communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems perfectly straightforward until one considers the rest of clause 19. Investment activity is not defined, but engaging in business activity is defined in subsection (4) by reference to ``a controlled activity''. Subsection (5) defines ``a controlled activity'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an activity of a specified kind'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;the body that does the specifying is the Treasury.
<P>
A ``regulated activity'' may be a ``controlled activity'' because it may be one of the classes mentioned in subsection (5)(a) that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``falls within a specified class of activity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will confirm&#151;I hope that she will tell me if I am wrong&#151;that what clause 20 specifies as regulated activities are a class of activities.
<P>
I add my thanks to the Government for rewriting the clause in a coherent form and for allowing us to discuss it sensibly. That has been valuable. Although I am critical of its drafting, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester who said that such matters are jolly difficult.
<P>
My questions are those that I would have wanted to ask if I had been a Back Bencher considering what became the Financial Services Act 1986. I was on a different Bill at the time, which was probably a good thing for my political career.
<P>
Why should every provision be so complex? Let me formulate that point in terms of amendment No. 96 which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury may by order specify circumstances in which a |person is to be regarded for the purposes of subsection (1) as&#151;
<P>
(a) acting in the course of business;
<P>
(b) not acting in the course of business.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why cannot those words be construed in their natural and ordinary sense by the courts. I anticipate that the Minister's answer will be that it would be more helpful to business men to provide 96 examples of acting in the course of business&#151;and the 97th or 98th example might find it helpful to read the other 96. That might tie in with subsection (3), which specifies circumstances in which what many people think of as businesses will not be treated as businesses.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I see some value in giving the Treasury the power to grant express exemptions. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs both provided examples of innocent transactions that might be caught by the provision. When that issue arises, it is useful for the Treasury to be able to say that they do not mean to include a particular example.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs asked a sensible question about Members of Parliament and their dealings with small businesses in their constituencies. The Financial Secretary has specific knowledge of small businesses. It would be absurd for a Member of Parliament to be caught up in prohibited promotional activity. I should be grateful for the Minister's guidance on whether a Member of Parliament would, in the circumstances described by my hon. Friend, be viewed as acting in the course of business.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs's point was helpful, because that is not crystal clear. It is even less crystal clear when we think about all the activities engaged in by responsible people in a local neighbourhood&#151;perhaps a small town area in which businesses are moving up and down&#151;as they try to help friends and others out of difficulties. That is the very basis of commerce.
<P>
It will be terrible if people have to look constantly&#151;and totally artificially&#151;over their shoulder and feel obliged to say, ``I am happy to chat to you about this in theory, old boy, but treat nothing that I say as making any kind of offer or promotion. If we are close to that situation, I will get in touch with my friend, Mr. X, who is an authorised person, and I will ask him to write a letter for you.'' That is not the Britain in which we&#151;or the Minister&#151;want to live, but that might happen unless we have a commonsense compromise. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester spoke about the mid-1980s.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> In the mid-1980s, the then Government brought forward defective legislation. Slowly but surely, they rectified it and got it roughly right&#151;by listening and amending and often by affirmative resolution of the House. We need to consider whether we should replicate that in existing law or opt for something different. My worry is that we might be heading for something different.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend was certainly talking about some accord, compromise or accommodation between business&#151;in its widest sense&#151;and the Treasury. I was taken by my hon. Friend's point. It may be difficult for the Minister to answer all these questions, but she should be able to clarify&#151;with the help of those behind her, if necessary&#151;whether the object of the Bill is to start from where we are, and build and cut back, or to start again with a blank sheet, fill it with massive discretionary powers and have to go through agonies for years while trying to sort it all out.
<P>
Whatever Irish men may think, most of us have to start from where we are. I hope that the Minister will say that that is the Government's intention&#151;to start from where we are and move forward sensibly and step-by-step.
<P>
I examined the consultation document with the assistance of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. There is some sense in tieré 3 in paragraph 2.12, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``However the test is framed, it will be important to ensure that it is appropriately drawn to ensure that on one hand promotions which ostensibly comply with the indicators (say by including appropriate disclaimers) but which are none the less, in substance, directed at the UK, are to be caught''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously, it is sensible not to let people escape, because of clever wording, what is manifestly intended to be their responsibility.
<P>
The tieré continues, quite sensibly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``promotions which are not actually targeted . . . should not be&#151;''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
treated as targeted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``even if they do not actually comply with the various indicators.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unfortunately, that all goes to show that the matter is quite complex, which goes back to my earlier point about a rapidly changing world. The criminal law runs through the whole structure of the Bill, but when people act in good faith, the Government will not seek to use such a provision. That is right, as it would be grossly oppressive if the Government were to do so.
<P>
I believe that that is the Government's approach. Although there are plenty of political disagreements between Labour and Conservative parties, I am not accusing the Government of setting out to be oppressive to business. I am much more worried that the Government will give the FSA so many discretionary powers that it will end up being unintentionally oppressive to business.
<P>
Therefore, I make a plea for simpler language and fewer attempts to give examples of everything, but acknowledging that some things are definitely not caught. That would clarify the clause.
<P>
May I say a word about the internet, as it has not been mentioned by my hon. Friends? I do not pretend to have a conclusive view, but the view of what should happen on the internet that appeared in the paper produced by APCIMS&#151;the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers&#151;ought to be debated and ventilated in Committee. I am sure that the Financial Secretary has that commentary&#151;certainly her officials will have it.
<P>
Referring to clause 19, the APCIMS paper says that if United Kingdom citizens trade on the internet, they should realise that they are entering a jungle and that they are on their own. So, let the buyer beware.
<P>
Obviously, people will trade on the internet, and there should be something more than a jungle there. Let there be an area on the internet&#151;described as ``a financial safe harbour'' in the APCIMS paper&#151;which, presumably, will be monitored to some extent by the FSA, as is perfectly sensible, where business can be done, but where rules and regulations must jolly well be complied with. Citizens who buy through such a system are monitored and regulated, and can do so with the extra confidence that is the Bill's objective.
<P>
We set off down the path of the Financial Services Act 1986 in order to regulate what was hitherto an unregulated area. Now we have an excellent chance to take stock, modify, improve and change. Here is a possible solution, which has the merit of being comprehensible. I know more than my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells; I certainly do not qualify as a nerd. I am trying to become a slightly more experienced novice in my use of the internet, but, like my right hon. Friend and, I suspect, most members of the Committee, our children are way ahead of us, even when they are young. This is the world in which they are going to live, in which young people are already living, moving and having their being&#151;that sounds very ecclesiastical&#151;but that is the real world, and we cannot ignore it. Let us try and find a way of letting people use the internet, which is a wonderfully efficient way of communicating and potentially a marvellously efficient way of doing business.
<P>
Let us take note that there is a good deal of praise for the European approach to e-commerce. I do not claim to be an expert on it but I have read the material that we have been sent&#151;the Minister, too, may have read it&#151;which praises the European Union's approach and its efforts to try to set up a framework for e-commerce.
<P>
I do not want to digress too much, but in the context of a positive approach to the European Union, it needs to be recognised just how efficient it has been in creating the framework for all types of business. I was recently closely involved in medicines and cosmetics on a professional basis. I learnt about it and about the framework&#151;[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) obviously knows all about it. The European Union has a real role to play in setting up a European-wide framework, which may turn out to be a world-wide framework, because we are 15 of the most sophisticated countries in the world. I commend the thoughts in the APCIMS paper for serious consideration and I look forward to the Minister's response to them in the context of the relevant amendments.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister, I have to tell the Committee that I was remiss when we started our proceedings not to point out that the group that we started debating on Tuesday has grown by two amendments. Amendments Nos. 129 and 130, which were starred on Tuesday, became unstarred and were selected.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. This has been a lengthy, but interesting debate, which started on Tuesday.
<P>
I shall deal with some of the points made in our previous sitting and this afternoon. For once, I am in absolute agreement with Opposition Members in saying that this is an enormously complex matter, The hon. Member for Chichester was correct and honest to say that the previous Government got themselves into a difficult situation and then saw how they could make progress. This is not a party political matter, but one of trying to get things right, which is difficult.
<P>
I understand the points made by Opposition Members and I shall try to deal with them in a way that I hope will take the agenda forward. I welcome the remarks made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs who said that there is broad agreement between the Government and the Opposition on the overall objectives, but we need to consider how we get there. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks about members of the Committee having been provided with the aide memoire.
<P>
It may be useful if I explain our overall intentions. The aim of the clause is to create a regime that is capable of standing up to the developments of modern technology while remaining effective against the more traditional methods of promoting financial services. There has, properly, been a great deal of discussion about new developments in technology. We all recognise that the pace of technology has advanced to such a degree over the past five years that it is difficult for legislatures to ensure that they have the right regimes in place. Therefore, our intention is to create a flexible structure that is capable of dealing with the modern world.
<P>
We are creating a framework that we want to be robust enough to deal with the different possibilities that may arise. Information technology, broadcasting and telecommunications are increasingly converging, so we need a regime that can deal with that.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
May I say gently to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs that the Treasury is not afraid of e-„commerce? We are much in favour of it because we see it bringing enormous benefits to this country. Reports mention a worldwide trade of trillions of dollars and pounds. Therefore, it is important that the United Kingdom is at the forefront of that activity.
<P>
I note what the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) said about the discussions taking place in Europe. However, he might be interested to know that discussions have gone on not only in the telecommunications council, but in several other councils and in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Last October, the Government published a document entitled ``Net Benefit'' that sets out our views in detail and also contains responses from the Inland Revenue. The Revenue is at the forefront of discussions in the European Union and in the OECD about how to progress such matters. That will not be easy, but it is essential that we get things right.
<P>
The objective of the Bill is to set the outer boundaries of the financial promotion regime so that they are capable of encompassing those matters that should be controlled. I shall come later to some of the specific points that have been raised. Although it is true that provisions in the Bill may encompass some matters that should not be regulated, they will be taken outside the regime by secondary legislation, just as happens with the investment advertising regime under the Financial Services Act.
<P>
We agree with Opposition Members that the financial promotion regime should catch only those promotions made in the course of business. Private communications should therefore be excluded. Government amendment No. 96 will allow the Treasury to specify circumstances where a person is to be considered as acting&#151;or not acting&#151;in the course of business.
<P>
I am not absolutely clear what advantage amendment No. 130 would provide, but I accept that it was tabled so that we could examine the issue in more detail. Consideration of examples will help us to do that. A firm may not have a commercial interest in the consequences of a communication but be paid by a firm that does. For example, a telephone call centre promoting a share offer might have a commercial interest in the number of calls answered, but not in whether the share offer is taken up. However, if someone tells a few friends that he wants to sell some BT shares at a reasonable price in order to buy a car, he will have a commercial interest in the consequence of the communication. I am sure that everyone would agree that such cases should fall outside the financial promotion prohibition.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister asks what we mean by amendment No. 130 with its reference to having
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a commercial interest in the consequences of the communication.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is simply an attempt to define a little more tightly in ordinary language what is meant by business. I accept that that might not be necessary because its meaning can be left to the courts, but pointing out that it refers to commercial activities would help to clarify it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point, but I am trying to illustrate some of the difficulties that could arise from even that definition. As far as is possible, such a matter should not be left to the courts. To help business as much as possible, we should try to spell it out, if not in the Bill, then in secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister has made a watershed statement. She believes that having things pinned down in a mass of regulations that interlock clause by clause is better than having straightforward language. If she is not saying that, can she explain her argument?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am not saying that. In the natural course of events, all Governments try to produce legislation that is clear and simple, so that those who will be affected by it&#151;in this case, the financial community and consumers&#151;gain as much information as they possibly can. That is the aim of all Governments, and it is what we are trying to do.
<P>
We want to ensure that the Bill outlines the full parameters of the regime, but to use secondary legislation to set out the exemptions. It will be a positive step forward for the financial community.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not impugn the Minister's integrity, but she is mistaken in her understanding of the Bill's structure. No ordinary person could understand what it means and, even if he did, he would have to go to the mass of regulation and to professionals, who have done little or nothing else for years but advise on such matters, to understand the position. Does not the Minister realise that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Let me explain what I mean as gently as possible to the right hon. and learned Gentleman and return to the remarks of the hon. Member for Chichester. Because of the difficulties in the 1980s, a mass of legislation and regulation is codified in several places. We want to bring as much of that as possible together into the Bill.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman will also know that those who will be dealing with such matters will not necessarily be professional bodies, but they will have recourse to advice. The Bill is already very long and, by the use of secondary legislation, we are aiming to provide as much help as possible to the financial community, which I am sure prefers such matters to be dealt with in that way rather than&#151;to use the words of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#151;for such matters to be left to the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister has been making general remarks about the Bill and about the need to codify policies in a wide range of areas. She said that it must be better to have exemptions spelt out in detail&#151;or words to that effect. Was she referring to clause 19? My concern is that the consultative document on financial promotions that goes along with the clause does not take that approach. It takes a halfway-house approach and rejects the notion of spelling out in detail the exemptions under statutory instruments. Are the Government willing to move towards that in principle, even if they do not accept our amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am confining my remarks to the clause and what accompanies it. I say to the hon. Member for Chichester that, by its nature, the document is a consultative document.
<P>
The Treasury power to specify circumstances put forward in amendment No. 96 may be a better way of ensuring that the financial promotion regime applies where necessary.  We also agree that the promotional regime should apply only to clearly promotional material&#151;that is one effect of amendment No. 96 which limits the promotional regime to communications that amount to an invitation or an inducement. This achieves the effect desired by amendment No. 129.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said in our previous sitting that he was unclear about subsection (2), which limits the financial promotion regime in the case of a communication originating outside the UK to communications
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``capable of having an effect in the UK''.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision excludes only communications that are incapable of having an effect in the UK&#151;for example, communications between two persons in Canada, that cannot have an effect in the UK. [Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will give me a moment, I shall develop the arguments.
<P>
As the Government have said, the provisions set the outer boundaries of the regime and we will&#151;I hope that there is agreement on this&#151;cut back the wide scope in the exemption order so that the promotional regime will be limited to promotions that are directed at the United Kingdom.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, today and previously, the concept of ``directed at'' is particularly relevant to internet promotions, but we do not want to frame our provisions solely on that basis.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does that mean that the Government intend to replicate the ``directed at'' principle in the order that will accompany the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make progress, I shall deal with how we see the existing position.
<P>
Important points about the internet have been made, but the Government prefer to adopt a media-neutral or technology-neutral approach. That is important to prevent the outdating of regulations by further or unknown developments in technology and the markets.
<P>
Questions were raised about the difficulties of enforcing regulations against material coming into the UK on the internet from overseas. This area is difficult and complex and, as I said at the outset, will provide challenges, not only to ourselves, but to other countries. I say to Opposition Members that the difficulty of regulating overseas persons attempting to offer financial services into the UK is not unprecedented. At the moment, for example, quite apart from the internet, the FSA currently has a role in preventing inappropriate cold calling on UK consumers from abroad, for example, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned. Of course, co-operation by the relevant regulatory authorities enables action to be taken.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to deal with the points raised on Tuesday, as it is important to do so, especially for those who are following our proceedings. We discussed the role of business angels, who are an extremely important group. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire kindly referred to my interests in small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business angels play an important role. I would like to clarify issues relating to that.
<P>
There are currently two separate restrictions on business owners promoting company shares or other securities. Someone wishing to offer shares to the public for the first time must produce a prospectus under the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995, or, in the case of offering the public shares to be listed by the stock exchange, a prospectus under part IV of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) discussed the Freeserve prospectus, which is available on the internet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): It is no longer available as the issue closed at 12 o'clock today.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is a perfect illustration of the rapidly changing world of technology and the market. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making my point for me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Financial Secretary missed it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am afraid I am a Minister, therefore&#151;quite rightly&#151;under certain restrictions. Luckily, I do not have the joys of opposition. [Interruption.]
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised an important matter, so he may care to listen to my response. The prospectus is freely available because a properly prepared prospectus is exempt from the provisions of the investment advertising regime of the Financial Services Act. We will make provision in a financial promotion exemptions order for prospectuses to be similarly exempt from the financial promotions regime under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I entirely agree with the Financial Secretary.
<P>
Freeserve was available through a Dixons-owned website, which is not an authorised person. Therefore, the fact that it appeared there could be deemed a promotion, even though the full terms of the offer document were not available on the website. However, one could apply for Freeserve shares and be covered. Potentially, that was a promotional element.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which is fair. I tried to give him an umbrella answer, without going into individual examples.
<P>
When shares are offered for the first time, not to the public at large, but to a group of people who are not considered to be the public, for example, employees, authorised persons, or 50 or fewer private investors, there is no obligation to produce a prospectus. Any offer document that is not a prospectus must be approved as an investment advertisement or, in future, as a financial promotion, by an authorised person.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said on Tuesday, other jurisdictions, such as the United States of America, recognise that some private investors are sufficiently sophisticated so that they do not need to benefit from the full protections on securities offers. Such a system can be especially helpful to start-up companies which may find it difficult to meet the expense of a regulated offer document, whether a prospectus or approved promotional document. I think that the Committee would agree that no barrier should put in the way of encouraging more start-up companies.
<P>
Therefore, we are proposing an exemption so that, for example, companies or entrepreneurs who seek capital may make available unapproved share offer documents to a defined group of private investors. In that special circumstance, if an offer document were made available to a small group of more sophisticated investors, neither a formal prospectus nor an approved promotional document would be required. I have dealt with that matter at some length, but it is incredibly important to many people&#151;not only business angels but businesses generally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have only just heard the Financial Secretary's description&#151;I will not ask her to repeat it&#151;but it seems to represent a tightening of existing regulations. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not think that that is my interpretation. We rightly understand that there are different sorts of people, and we are dealing with a rather sophisticated group who have particular knowledge of how the financial system and markets operate. We do not want to stand in their way or create any barrier for them or their companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The central question is this: will an authorised person be required to take part in the middle of transactions in the venture capital world? Generally under clauses 17, 18 and 19, the answer is yes. If the answer is no, there must be exemptions. The practical concern, especially for small venture capital organisations that raise modest amounts of money, is that the involvement of an authorised person is expensive, and will put people off. That will happen unless the clause contains a clear exemption.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. I do not recognise that distinction. For the avoidance of doubt, let me say that we are not tightening up existing legislation. Indeed, the business angels exemption that we propose is not currently available under the Financial Services Act 1986. We are rightly recognising the role that business angels increasingly play. I make no political point; the business angel community has grown in recent years. I mention the United States of America because business angels have been incredibly important in its economic revolution. The USA has about five times more business angels pro rata than this country, and we want more business angels in the UK.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and others wondered whether the clause would catch many normal business activities and private conversations and make them criminal offences. He also said that we must consider the matter in our capacity as constituency Members of Parliament. As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury said on Tuesday, it was never our intention to catch private conversations. We believe that many such worries will be addressed by our amendments, which will provide that financial promotion prohibitions should apply only to promotions made by way of business. Of course, some promotions by way of business would be appropriately exempted and they can be included in the financial promotion exemptions order.
<P>
I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentlemen that Members of Parliament acting in the circumstances that he described would certainly not be caught. It is always difficult to give definitions, but it could be thought of as an activity in which people engage regularly with a view to making a profit. That is a broad definition, but it may assist the Committee. The right hon. and learned Gentleman can rest assured that his normal energetic and conscientious activities in his constituency will not be harmed. However, it is not generally our intention to reinvent or redefine what may be ``in the course of business''.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire also asked why we had taken the power to define business. There may be cases at the margin when something that is in the course of business ought not to be caught, or when something that is not in the course of business ought to be treated as being in the course of business. That may sound rather convoluted, but it illustrates some of the difficulties that we would face if we did what the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggested.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells suggested that the House would have no opportunity to debate exemptions. That is not the case. The initial order made under clause 19 would be subject to an affirmative resolution procedure as will be subsequent secondary legislation. That is important. The right hon. Gentleman also asked&#151;not only this afternoon, but on other occasions&#151;whether the renting of his property would be caught. I am always anxious to reassure him. No, renting a property will not be a controlled activity for the purposes of clause 19. Although I am willing to admit that I might be doing him an injustice, I suspect that he probably knew that that would not be the case.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The Minister's answer points up the fact that it depends on whether it is a controlled activity.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is absolutely right. That is my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way, as we have not had the answer?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I should like to make some progress. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Chichester will be interested in my next answer. He asked whether the amendments would return the legislation to the current position. In fact, the amendments would narrow the scope of the current restrictions. Section 57 of the Financial Services Act 1986 does not contain a business test. I see the hon. Member for Chichester nodding in agreement.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells mentioned secondary and primary legislation. Primary legislation sets out a broad prohibition on financial promotion by unauthorised persons in the course of business. Exemptions will allow promotions by unauthorised persons where appropriate. I gave the example of employee share schemes, which we are keen to promote.
<P>
We have had a good debate. It was correct for the Opposition to table amendments because this is a complex subject. We are all concerned that we get the Bill right and I believe that our amendments do just that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for that clarification. However, I remain concerned about the reference in clause 19(1) to communicating an invitation or inducement to engage. Is that equivalent to section 57 of the Financial Services Act in that it applies to advertising and not cold calling? She did not address the point that I made by differentiating between the two. Many activities, such as Members of Parliament who help firms in their constituencies, come under the definition of cold calling. They are not engaged in a criminal offence and, therefore, it is not an issue. However, will all forms of financial promotion or communication be a criminal offence if they are not undertaken by a registered person? If that is the case, there is a need for clear exemptions. Existing law excludes financial promotion or communication by allowing it to fall under cold calling as set out in section 56 of the 1986 Act. The Financial Secretary helpfully explained that the Government will replicate the present exemptions, which they intend to improve. She said that their proposals will be slightly wider than some aspects of section 57.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that the Government will spell out in as much detail as necessary the meaning of the exemptions. She also said that there will be a full opportunity for debate. How will that come about? If an order is laid before Parliament, there is no debate; we vote yes or no. Hon. Members may like some aspects of an order and not others, but it is not possible to vote on that basis. We must take it or leave it.
<P>
I am glad that the Government have exempted business angels. I shall discuss venture capital in the clause stand part debate. However, I am still not clear what constitutes the ordinary course of business for Members of Parliament. <P>
On being voted in, an MP receives a salary, and needs to make himself popular with his constituents. He may help small businesses and create jobs, which would, in a sense, be business activities. One cannot envisage a specific exemption for Members of Parliament, but what of businesses in similar situations, the most formalised of which are small corporate finance boutiques? One way or another, lawyers, accountants, management consultants and a whole raft of commercial and professional activities will arrange money and, ultimately, share issues for small businesses. I remain unclear whether, in respect of raising money for such activities, an authorised body will need to issue prospectuses. To avoid potential liability to criminal prosecution, where will the line be drawn?
<P>
It is true to say that we share similar objectives. Perhaps comfort can be taken from the Minister's commitment, as we understood it, that the exemptions will address everything that might reasonably be addressed. However, as I said, it will be difficult to do that without twin tools that are equivalent to sections 56 and 57. Are those sections combined in clause 19, or will cold calling continue, in some way or other, to be legal?
<P>
It is difficult to decide how to vote on the amendments. We are broadly content with the first group of amendments, which will ensure business exemption, provided that they are interpreted in the way that we discussed. Amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 84 deal with important points of principle that have not been fully addressed. If our understanding is correct, there should be a vote on those issues to ensure that their importance is registered.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. You may have noticed that I have kept my powder dry, in the hope that you will allow me a little leeway during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
I want to concentrate on media promotion and on the internet, in slightly more general terms than those covered by our amendments. I should first declare an interest in that, until two weeks ago, I was a director of an internet company in this country. As from that time, I have become an equity holder in a large American internet company, which took us over. I hesitated to mention this interest when speaking earlier, for fear of being associated with terms such as ``nerd'' or ``anorak''.
<P>
Despite all the Minister's talk on the subject of e-„commerce, the Government are behind the times in recognising the constrictions that the legislation will place on the use of the internet. I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which we were able to consider the rejigged clause, which improved the quality of our debate and our understanding of the clause, but much is still lacking.
<P>
The 38-page financial promotion consultation document was produced in March. Part of the problem is that the matter is very complicated and we did not get it right in the 1986 Act. The problem has been to distil the findings from a 38-page consultation document into a clause which originally consisted of 257 words with no promotional intent terminology. Instead, there was a blanket prohibition. The complete absence to date of the regulations containing the exemptions from the prohibition on promotion has made our job more difficult.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, the Financial Secretary was not clear about whether the original exemptions, which were more clearly faced in the 1986 Act, will be replicated and added to or made more detailed. I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond to my comments, because they are important. Will she confirm that there will be exemptions plus, perhaps with those in the 1986 Act being brought up to date for new technology and particularly the internet, which was just a gleam in the eye of some anoraks back in 1986.
<P>
I reinforce the comments made by my right hon. and hon. Friends that even with the rejigged clause, too much is being left to Treasury interpretation at its whim and discretion.
<P>
There are territorial problems with the internet. It is still unclear whether the communications constituting promotion must be made in the United Kingdom. There are specific problems with forwarded e-mail, for example, on the internet, because the route is not a simple one of A to B. The clause should be more detailed and concerned with communications directed at people in the United Kingdom rather than to those capable of having effect in the United Kingdom.
<P>
My fundamental point is that regulations should apply only to communications that are clearly promotional and made in a business context in the United Kingdom&#151;the Government have largely taken that on board. The principle should be that control occurs only at the point at which investment takes place. At what point does a telephone conversation, during which reference is made to an investment opportunity, cease to be casual and become promotional? The example of Freeserve has been used. I know that you travel in a great social circle, Mr. Atkinson. If you sat next to an employee of Dixons-Freeserve at a dinner party and you were a subscriber to Freeserve&#151;I know that you have great technological prowess&#151;you and that employee might engage in a conversation about the technical merits of applying for Freeserve shares. If you had that conversation before 12 pm today and neither of you were authorised, at what point would either of you breach the rules? You could be passing on investment advice in which you had an interest as a subscriber to Freeserve&#151;wanting more subscribers to come on board&#151;or the employee of Dixons-Freeserve might have a financial interest in promoting the shares. At what point would either of you be committing a criminal act if neither of you were authorised? I am assuming that you are not authorised in that capacity, Mr. Atkinson, although you are manifestly authorised in a great many other things. The clause does not come to terms with the rapidly developing electronic e-„commerce, and I fear that, because of how it is formulated, it will hamper the United Kingdom's position in the global marketplace, despite the Minister's comments that that is the last thing that the Government want.
<P>
There is a big enough problem with e-commerce in terms of tax liabilities at present. For someone carrying out a business on the internet, from a tax domicile point of view, where is that business located? Which country's tax regime will apply? Internet businesses are capable of using metaphorical electronic mailboxes, located in various tax havens around the world. Many tax lawyers will quote chapter and verse&#151;at vast expense&#151;the enormous problems that are arising increasingly over who has the tax liability and the problem of dissatisfied customers who have bought a product over the internet. Which country's laws of consumer protection apply in those circumstances?
<P>
We have mentioned the appeal of the internet for venture capital, which is an area that should be encouraged. However, no one, whether a fund manager or a private investor, will invest in a start-up venture capital business about whose existence they do not know. The internet is a particularly cheap and rapid way of disseminating information about various business opportunities. I am minded of the article in the Financial Times recently about the internet and the UN human development report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It costs $75 and takes five days to send a 40-page document from Madagascar to the Cote d'Ivoire. It costs $45 and takes half an hour to fax it. It costs around 20 cents and takes two minutes to send it by e-mail, which can go to thousands of people at no extra cost.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That brings the point home that there is no comparison with what can be achieved on the internet and the more conventional means. That is why it will take off.
<P>
Quoted companies and those looking to come to the market or to raise capital use the internet either to advertise the availability of their prospectus or to advertise the address to which one should send a cheque. I quoted some examples of high-tech Cambridge business science park ventures, which have done just that. Despite the debate that we have had, I am not convinced that some of those uses would not constitute criminal activity under the clause, as drafted.
<P>
We need a system that is easily accessible and readily affordable, and which will not involve budding entrepreneurs in committing a criminal offence. I am worried that the FSA has not grasped that point. I mentioned the other day the quote from a senior FSA official that appeared in The Guardian about the draft European Commission directive on electronic commerce. He complained that the directive tied the hands of those regulating financial products sold to the UK over the internet.
<P>
In the interests of moving things along on a Thursday afternoon, I shall not quote widely from the document, but a 70-page report is available over the internet from the International Organisation of Securities Commissions on the subject of securities activity on the internet. It makes some interesting points. The preamble begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The explosion in Internet use, however, also presents new challenges for securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the key principles out of the five that the report sums up relating to how international or domestic regulators should approach the system is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``regulators should not unnecessarily impede the legitimate use of the Internet by market participants and markets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is key, but I worry that, as drafted, the legislation will impede internet use, particularly if the FSA chooses not to be as open-minded as one would like.
<P>
I shall touch on other features of the IOSCO report, particularly the problems created by hyperlinks. Visits to the home page of an investment concern can appear to legitimise information that is otherwise non-„legitimate. For example, a slightly unscrupulous raiser of capital might have a website that offers unauthorised securities, and which is hyperlinked to the FSA's own website. That would lend it an air of respectability by giving the impression that it is chartermarked by the FSA. How will one regulate against that?
<P>
With regard to securities trading financial products, there is also the problem of anonymity, which is another internet tool. Remailer sites, which are becoming increasingly common, obscure providers' identities by providing pseudonyms. Users can download software from the internet with an anonymizer&#151;as it is apparently called&#151;that acts as a middle man, masking the senders' identities and the sources of the information. It can be used to conceal identities or impersonate other people on the internet. As a result, it is easy to transmit money electronically and anonymously.
<P>
Hyperlinks and anonymity are two problems associated with internet trading that the IOSCO report addressed, but for which it provided no solutions. I am disappointed that we have yet to debate such considerations, which, so far, the FSA shows no sign of acknowledging.
<P>
The internet is also attractive to financial services because it is a flexible medium. Information can be erased or updated easily and inexpensively&#151;literally within minutes. The problem is that information that someone might be trying to trace can be suddenly wiped off. In newspapers and on television, articles and advertisements are there in black and white, or on videotape, for all to see and trace. However, on the internet, such information can be blitzed into hyperspace at the touch of a button, never to be seen again.
<P>
I should also mention the use of chat rooms on the internet, to which reference is not often made in a financial context. I have not used chat rooms myself, but I gather that internet investors can use them to discuss investment strategies and start up companies. Again, such a medium can easily prove a hotbed for fraud and manipulation. With regard to companies themselves, the internet is also now used for proxy voting and underwriting. Discount and on-„line brokerage firms are forming e-syndicates, through which international public offerings can be distributed.
<P>
A lot of financial service matters are already and increasingly conducted over the internet, but they have not been touched on. I was concerned by the Financial Secretary's comments, but particularly by the FSA's slightly anachronistic comments, which suggested that one can control the internet as if it were an address in Lombard Street that can be raided on the faint suspicion of an FSA investigator and the issue of a magistrate's warrant. In such cases, one can seize the paperwork, put a hand on the shoulder of the accused and march him or her to Bow Street police station. However, the internet presents an entirely different scenario that will increasingly determine the way in which financial services are conducted.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
How will the FSA&#151;our regulator&#151;respond to miscreants who use that media? How will it deal with a new start-up venture capital business based in Baluchistan that offers shares? How will it react to a financial share tipsheet on shares that are traded on the Islamabad or Karachi markets and supposedly based in Pakistan? What will it do about tipsheets from Ethiopia on stocks that are quoted on the Addis Ababa market? Will FSA inspectors be sent on a junket to Addis Ababa, Karachi or Baluchistan? Will it send in the cyber police, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells might call them, or will it send a stiff letter&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Surely an e-mail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Or even an e-mail, asking them to stop. That is unrealistic.
<P>
My point, which I am making with only a little flippancy, is that we cannot regulate the internet. We must start from that basis. The internet can be regulated domestically for people who provide information, promotional advice and opportunities on UK-based financial transactions, but when they cross international boundaries, especially if they go beyond the EU or G8 countries, we are whistling in the wind.
<P>
Some interesting analogies were made and I should like to hear what the Financial Secretary has to say about replicating exemptions. The 1986 Act contains many exemptions, including newspaper tipsheets and financial recommendations and advice that is given on television, sound broadcast and Teletext. Share information&#151;indeed, any financial advice&#151;that is given in a Teletext broadcast is exempt from the regulations. Teletext is the steam version&#151;the forerunner&#151;of the internet and it was rightly exempted from the 1986 Act. How will the Government apply regulations to the internet, which are eminently more difficult to enforce, if they do not apply them to Teletext, which is plain for all to see?
<P>
For all that it is impossible to go after internet crooks, we have other problems that are closer to home. Some ways of providing information escaped the 1986 Act. Will they also escape this Bill? I buy The Sun and The News of the World assiduously because I like to be aware of what my constituents face, and I have identified two worrying hazards. Tabloid newspapers in particular often include a special pull-„out. Last month in The Sun there were eight pages of personal finance entitled ``Sun Money''. The pull-out said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Talk to the experts on our no-„flannel panel''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
very much part of its journalese. What will the average, not especially astute prospective financial punter, one of the 50 per cent.&#151;[Interruption.] I am not being patronising. To put that into context, 50 per cent. of the population do not know what 50 per cent. is. It is those people who might fall foul of such advice. Someone who reads The Sun regularly and believes what he reads&#151;as do many people, including some on this side of the House&#151;may believe what appears to be ``your friendly expert at The Sun'' giving friendly, independent financial advice. However, if we look in more detail, we see The Sun giving advice in a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Money guide to saving cash on health insurance,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is fine. However, it goes on to say: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``You too can make your mint in the millennium.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All sorts of schemes are outlined, alongside a symbol for MIS, a commercial company about which I know nothing, which is using the supposed independence of The Sun's journalism to promote a certain financial product. There is a photograph of a smiling family with 2.3 beaming children and a wonderfully large teddy bear, also beaming and waving, their hands full of £20 notes and a magnum of champagne.
<P>
That gives the impression that if one invests in these schemes, one will get rich quick. The article goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Join us and choose a free gift...a three-piece luggage set, Marks and Spencer vouchers, a telephone alarm clock radio.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Even worse, a similar article in the News of the World a couple of weeks ago, headed 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Time to take off with your savings''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
suggested that if one followed the investment saving promotions, one would find oneself about to board a plane and jet off on holiday. It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Treat yourself to a dream holiday with your savings...you'll thank us.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There follows a wonderful promise:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Half your premiums back after the first 12 months.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests to me that customers would be paying twice as much as they needed to, from day one, when investing in these savings schemes. Again, we are tempted, in great big letters:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Join us and choose a free gift'' <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from the ubiquitous and lovely three-piece luggage set, Marks and Spencer vouchers and telephone alarm clock radio.
<P>
It may seem a light point, but it is, in fact, a serious one. I do not wish to be patronising, but people who use the internet to obtain financial advice might be expected to be a little more switched on as to how independent or valid that financial advice will be. They might be expected so to be&#151;although it is not inevitable&#151;on the ``buyer beware'' terms that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire mentioned.
<P>
People who see these publications, and who are apparently being sold financial products with  the promise of wonderful gifts and getting half their money back in 12 months dangled in front of them, have the potential to be conned. I believe that they are likely to be conned. After all the talk about going after the bandits on the internet, what do the Government propose to do about these financial promotions blatantly masquerading as independent Fleet Street journalists' tabloid financial advice? I would wager that a great many people respond to such advertisements, despite having no knowledge of the appropriateness of the advice, or of the one-size-fits-all product, that they are being offered. What do the Government intend to do about that, and what will the FSA be able to do under the terms of the regulations that we are discussing?
<P>
Those articles are a world apart from the tipsheets and the financial press advice that appears these days in the non-tabloid press, such as The Sunday Times, The Sunday Telegraph and The Mail on Sunday. We know where we are with such newspapers, because the likes of the tipster in The Sunday Times are exempted under the 1986 Act. He could tip, for example, Hornsey Widgets plc as ``a good punt, it has had some good results, we rate them as a buy,'' or rate the Ainsworth pipe and tool works&#151;and we are jolly glad that it does&#151;as ``a good bet, pile in, buy these shares.'' Such tipsters are exempted, and we know where we are with them. They are respectable market followers tipping respectable, fully quoted share investments in those two highly worthy companies, if only they existed.
<P>
There is another example: every Monday the office where I used to work full time received a fax round-up of all the weekend's financial tip sheet recommendations. How will that be covered in the Bill? The company does not make the tips itself, but it makes money from circulating the tips because it operates a subscriber system to send the fax to people like me. Will it be caught by the Bill as a financial promoter because it is acting in a business context to make money to attract people? The share tipsters in The Sunday Times, The Sunday Telegraph and other business publications tip certain shares on the basis that they get a good reputation for tipping the right shares, the theory being that if those shares go up more people will buy that newspaper. Therefore, the newspaper has a clear business interest in promoting certain shares or other types of investment.
<P>
I am trying to highlight the potential for the most enormous grey area; there was a big grey area in the 1986 Act, which specified all sorts of exemptions. We do not know the scale of the grey area in the Bill because we do not know the exemptions. Unless the Minister is prepared to make it absolutely clear that the 1986 exemptions will be replicated in full and explain how they might be updated and added to, we are scrabbling in the dark. How can we discuss an enormously important Bill that will give an enormously important organisation enormously important all-ranging powers to clamp down on people who abuse their position in promoting financial services when we do not know whether, such things will be covered? Those issues affect our constituents on an everyday basis; we are not talking about a few professional sophisticated crooks&#151;the Barlow Clowes, the Maxwells and the like&#151;who are the exception rather than the rule, I am glad to say. We have to be careful about such people and perhaps give greater flexibility and leeway to the experts in the FSA to clamp down on them, because as soon as one loophole is closed they will exploit another.
<P>
The potential victims of these promotions, which may be wholly inappropriate, are our constituents, those who, every day of the week, read the publications. I do not know how they will be protected by the Bill as drafted, although I began to have an idea about how they might be protected because of the detail of the 1986 Act.
<P>
What is the purpose of clause 19? It appears to repeat section 56 of the 1986 Act without the detail. That Act merely re-enacted the legislation from the 1930s without much updating. I fear that the Minister is in danger of repeating that anachronism and churning out 1930s legislation in 1999; but the whole ball game has changed dramatically, as members of the Committee will admit, and as the Minister herself said about the problems of the internet, which I, too, tried to highlight.
<P>
The 1986 Act, despite its extra detail, did not prevent what happened with Maxwell, Barlow Clowes in Gibraltar, BCCI or Barings. One must ask who was protected by the 1986 Act. Let us not make the same mistakes now. As drafted, the clause, as with so much of the Bill, is far too woolly and will prove to be out of date before it is enacted, unless the Minister&#151;who curls her lip, shrugs her shoulders and shakes her head&#151;can give us the assurance that we seek, to show how wonderfully acrobatic and articulate she is. We need that assurance, because otherwise, despite all our deliberations, which will continue for many months, an enormous number of our constituents will be left unprotected. I am grateful for the leeway that you have allowed me, Mr. Atkinson, to pose such practical, genuine questions that affect our constituents daily.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is likely to be a Division in the House quite shortly. When the Division Bell sounds, I shall adjourn the Committee for half an hour to allow hon. Members to have a cup of tea before we return.
<P>
This is not a criticism of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, who did not speak in the previous debate, but I allowed a fairly wide-ranging debate on amendments to the clause. Other hon. Members who have spoken should bear that stricture in mind.

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I shall bear that stricture in mind and continue where my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham left off. What is the purpose of the clause likely to be in the light of technological change? Everyone agrees that we need to regulate financial promotion, and we must tackle the problem of how to do so. Everyone agrees that private conversations, such as those among people having a chat in the pub when someone says, ``What about a few of these?'', should be exempted. However, not everyone agrees that every sort of promotion should be covered, even if it takes place in the UK. We have just debated trying to replicate exemptions specified in legislation enacted in the mid 1980s, and there are some differences of view about the extent to which such provisions should be replicated.
<P>
We face a new problem, to which my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham alluded&#151;the internet. Increasingly, people can and will market the same products from overseas regardless of what we specify in the clause. We must think ahead about the regulations that we need for the next decade.
<P>
If we were left with the old legislation and the Bill were not introduced, two classes of investment activity in industry would be likely to emerge. The first would comprise regulated, home-based business handled almost entirely by authorised professionals, providing a high level of regulation, safety and protection for investors, but at a cost. Such investments may become orientated more towards safer, mainstream bond and equity markets such as Wall Street, Japan and London. Alongside it, in the 21st century, another class of investment industry is likely to emerge&#151;[Interruption.] I did not hear what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): We shall still be here, discussing the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Using the same arguments&#151;[Interruption.] The Committee must come to order.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's frustration, but it is, sadly, my job to call the Committee to order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I apologise unreservedly for usurping your role, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Two classes of activity are likely&#151;one that is regulated and traditional, involving only authorised professionals, and a new, unregulated class based on the caveat emptor principle and working entirely through the internet, at lower cost, which will probably be targeted towards higher-risk investments, emerging markets and people prepared to take higher risks.
<P>
My central criticism of the Government's handling of the matter is that they have imperfectly replicated old legislation without giving remotely enough thought to how to deal with a new class of activity. I refer again to the key document. The consultation document on financial promotion, which was produced by the Treasury in March, skates over all the issues and does not discuss the possibility that a rival industry may grow up.
<P>
However, if competition and competitiveness were an objective in the Bill, the need for this debate would be dramatically reduced. The FSA's job under clause 19 would be to adjust immediately to the competition that would result from the new industry that will almost certainly develop over the next decade. Competition would drive down regulation to a level that would make the clause effective whatever its original wording.
<P>
If the FSA is unresponsive&#151;and it has the power to be relatively unresponsive&#151;the risk is that business will go abroad. I do not discount the possibility that big names, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Barclays and others, might eventually decide to go abroad and market to the United Kingdom. They might not direct communication towards the UK because that would contravene the legislation here, but they might market globally. They would not tout for business, but engage in global marketing. The FSA could try to respond and catch them in this country, but if it did, even more businesses would move offshore. Competitive pressure will greatly restrict the clause's effectiveness.

<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I was saying that there were two possible ways in which the market might develop. Some major firms might decide to market themselves on the internet as well. A third possibility is to continue as now, with the internet continuing to grow while marketing highly respectable products. The truth is that the majority of people marketing products on the internet are respectable, not cowboys. Firms such as HSBC, Barclays and others would use their name, irrespective of whether they were in a grey area of regulation, in order to secure business more cheaply with a lower cost base.
<P>
Clause 19 does not address the future. It partly replicates the current situation, but imperfectly. However, there is no case for responding by tearing up the clause and giving up. We need legislation in any case, even if it is partially defective. There is an argument for keeping dissuasive legislation on the statute book&#151;legislation on cannabis, for example, is imperfect, but no one suggests removing it entirely, at least for the moment.
<P>
There are three possible responses to the problem of enforceability. One is the tough, draconian approach. Clause 19 as originally drafted, before the exemptions were included in subsection (3), is draconian. I am pleased that a more flexible approach to the exemptions has emerged this afternoon. The second approach, which would apply if all the exemptions were put back, is the ``directed at the UK'' approach, whereby that distinction becomes the crucial factor for regulating the net. The third possibility&#151;the one that I believe will develop&#151;is the country of origin approach so that when one buys a product on the internet, one knows that it is regulated by the country from which it originates, and that that is the only legislative protection that one has. In the long run, whether or not we stick with the ``directed at'' principle, as I have called it, we may be forced into a mutual recognition approach. Many of my colleagues feel that there must be a plot in anything that emanates from the EU. Sometimes there is&#151;as I know from when I worked in the Treasury&#151;but I am pleased to say that I have noticed an excellent draft directive on e-commerce from Brussels. The consultative paper states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where consumers take the initiative of accessing Internet web-sites operated by financial service providers in another Member State, they should be willing to accept that the web-site is configured and operated in accordance with the laws of that country.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clearly a country of origin approach, which is probably what will be adopted. The alternative would make internet marketing almost impossible because someone trying to market a product on the internet would find himself subject to a multiplicity of inconsistent or conflicting regulations and jurisdictions. If legislation is unenforceable, it will be ignored. If it is enforceable, as it might be, UK consumers might find themselves excluded from some multi-country promotions.
<P>
The UK has the most to gain from a much freer approach. I was struck by an opinion from Reuters on this subject, whose view on the way the UK should go can be summarised in one sentence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The UK, as a pre-eminent international centre for international financial services trading, has perhaps the most to gain from dismantling regulatory barriers that threaten to cover the e-„commerce world with the equivalent of red flags, reminiscent of the birth of an earlier communications revolution.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I very much agree with that sentiment.
<P>
I should not be at all surprised to find that the view that the Treasury appears to take, in its consultation document, which is not highly developed, is not shared around Whitehall. I know that in the UK, unlike the United States, the Government move forward on one front. We have collective Cabinet responsibility, so it is inconceivable that we could put a cigarette paper between different Departments. But it would be fascinating to know what internal advice is coming from the Department of Trade and Industry or the Cabinet performance and innovation unit about the internet.
<P>
I have not answered the question that I posed at the beginning, which was that it is all very well for me to flag up the problems with internet trading and the difficulties posed under existing regulations, but what should we do? We have to do something. We have existing law and a Bill going through Parliament that will change that law. We have to take the ``directed at'' approach for the time being, which is encapsulated in the amendments that we debated this afternoon.
<P>
I understand that, as far as possible, the exemptions under existing law will be replicated in the statutory instruments when the Bill is enacted. However, that will still lead to a two-tier regulatory approach. There will be the ``directed at'' approach, as I have described it, for promotions outside the European Economic Area. The only sanction on those disobeying the rules will be the opportunity for civil action, to which I referred earlier, and which is mentioned in the document on financial promotion. I hope that I am not going too fast for hon. Members to follow my arguments&#151;I do not want to repeat the points that I made earlier&#151;but, I would like an answer from the Financial Secretary on whether the Government believe that there will be an opportunity for consumers to take civil action against internet products and that that will be a reason for not accepting reality and granting a more blanket exemption. It is the same point as the one that I posed when we discussed amendment No. 85.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I envisage a two-tier regulatory approach: the directed-at approach for promotions outside the European Economic Area, and a country of origin basis for those in it based on the e-commerce directive, which I hope the United Kingdom Government support. Do the Government support the country of origin approach set out in that directive?
<P>
Many of the problems that we are trying to grapple with in clause 19&#151;one of the six or eight crucial clauses in a 290-clause Bill&#151;result from the fact that the competitiveness objective is not written into it. If it were, it would restrict the over-regulation that will be consequent on the clause, and the need to concern ourselves with exemptions that may result from subsection (3) would be reduced.
<P>
We will lose business if the clause, with the exemptions that the Government will permit, proves to be over-regulated. We will find out the hard way that that was the wrong approach. I remain uncomfortable about the clause, despite the Government's assurances, and I will oppose it if there is a Division. It would be extremely helpful if the Government offered fresh thinking on how they expect the internet to interact with this cumbersome Bill in the long term. The clause is entirely contingent on what will become a huge raft of statutory instruments or orders.
<P>
The Minister said that we shall have an opportunity to debate statutory instruments under the affirmative resolution. Therefore, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells was incorrect when he said that discussions would be curtailed. We are debating the clause without knowing what the resolution will look like, which is a crucial point. We shall have a chance to under the affirmative resolution procedure, but it will be all or nothing. We will not be able to pick off 90 per cent. of it that we agree with and disagree with the other 10 per cent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend will have noticed that we have a starred amendment that would try to improve that by suggesting consultation two months before the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I had momentarily forgotten the starred amendment, which we have discussed previously. My right hon. and learned Friend may want to develop that point.
<P>
Clause 19 is not satisfactory. It does not take account of the growth of the internet, and I hope that the Government will make intelligent suggestions that go beyond the findings of March's consultation paper and develop ideas on how we shall reconcile what could be highly burdensome leglisation with the globalisation of financial markets.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> It comes to mind that the world may little note or long remember what we saying, but what we are doing is important. I make a short plea for less complexity in the clause and shall be bold enough to suggest that it is redrafted and is made up of about 66 words rather than approximately 283. I make no criticism of the parliamentary draftsmen; in a sense, I hope that I had a comforting arm around them. I have the highest regard for them. Usually, they do not receive the right instructions. I cannot believe that they were told to put in the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the course of business'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which was a classic omission. However, it is no good raking over that issue. Such words will be inserted in the Bill, which is good.
<P>
The clause is unnecessarily complex. Even if I am wrong, it will help me to know why I am wrong in my understanding of the framework of the Bill. I shall give a quick example of the sort of bemusement that an ordinary person&#151;even an ordinary person in business&#151;would be likely to feel when reading the clause. Would the buying of a machine tool for a factory be an investment activity? Let us suppose that a person wants to buy a new woodworking machine for his factory. Clearly, the machine would be an asset and would come under the broad definition of an investment under subsection (8).
<P>
The person telephones the machine tool manufacturer and asks for a brochure to be sent to him. The machine tool manufacturer does so, which is clearly an invitation to engage in investment activity and is prohibited under clause 19(1). Such action takes place in the course of business under subsections (2A) and (3). Is there not now a snag? Can such action be termed as engaging in investment activity? To find out whether a hypothetical person in such circumstances might be a criminal depends on whether the activity was controlled. To find out that, one would have to look at the Treasury orders to see whether such an activity was specified as such. That is the structure of the clause.
<P>
To be greatly daring, may I suggest a clause that comprises about 66 words as opposed to the 283 words that make up the revised draft outlined on the helpful piece of paper that has been handed round. I ask, on a point of order, Mr. Atkinson, whether there is any way of reading into the record what is written on the piece of paper that we have all been discussing for the past few hours and without knowledge of which those outside would be bemused? People outside the House read the record of our debates. Yesterday, I spoke to a person who said, ``I wasn't chasing you on something else, because I saw how heavily engaged you were on this'', and that person was from probably the largest firm of solicitors in the world. People are paying attention to what is going on. How can the revised clause be made part of the record, or shall I read it out quickly to the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman will not be able to do that. I cannot allow him to read the revised clause word for word to the Committee. It is a public document and will be made available in conjunction with the written record of our proceedings. Those who want to see it will be able to do so. It will not be a good idea to read it into the record just for the sake of it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I accept your ruling, Mr. Atkinson, but you can see the difficulty. If I may, I shall quickly read out a shorthand version of the draft revision. Subsection (1), which is the meat of it, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person (``A'') must not, in the course of business, communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that it is all right if people are authorised, or if they get an authorised person to do it for them, and that the provisions will apply only if the communication is capable of having effect in the United Kingdom. It then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury may by order specify'' 
<P>
</UL></FONT>what is a business and what is not a business.
<P>
The revised clause then sets out what is meant by ``Engaging in investment activity'' and ``a controlled activity'', and links those definitions to schedule 2, which is attached to clause 20. It ends by delimiting the word ``communicate'' and appearing to define the word ``investment''. That word may be deeply misleading. Most people think that an investment activity means an activity in connection with investment; but, as I have already pointed out, that is wrong. Investment is defined thus:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```investment' includes any asset, right or interest.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lastly, it states what we have seen countless times in the Bill:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```Specified' means specified in an order made by the Treasury.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a quick view of the structure of the revised clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> My right hon. and learned Friend has missed out one crucial provision. Subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Nothing in Schedule 2, as applied by subsection (6), limits the powers conferred by subsection (5).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, a complete waiver is built into the revision.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend: he is absolutely right. I thought earlier that the clause contained a weasel word, but my hon. Friend is right that one subsection contains other weasel words.
<P>
The Government's revision of clause 19 has 283 words. I suggest another, shorter version of clause 19:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(1) A person must not, in the course of business, direct to a person in the United Kingdom an invitation or inducement to engage in any investment activity unless he is an authorised person, or the context of such communication is approved for the purposes of this section by an authorised person.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) Investment activity means activity of a kind specified in an order made by the Treasury.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is much simpler. It has the great merit that people will be able to find out what is meant by investment activity. At the moment, they cannot find out directly; they have to discover what are the Treasury's specifications. The Treasury specifies controlled activities, regulated activities and probably other sorts of activities, but it does not specify investment activities. I do not think that I am going outside the scheme of the Bill.
<P>
I notice that that newly drafted clause 19, which I cannot read into the record but which I am waving about, talks about an activity being a controlled activity if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is an activity of a specified kind or one which falls within a specified class of activity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems sensible for ``investment activity'' to be a specified class; then even simple-minded businessmen would get there in one. That might be helpful.
<P>
You will see, Mr. Atkinson, that I bear no ill will to anyone when I say that I find it difficult to support clause 19 standing part. We should aim higher. If I am proved wrong, I shall be not delighted but slightly sorrowful that the world is more complex than I had realised, but it will at least have been illuminating.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham had to say about the internet. I am glad to hear that he is doing so well as a result of the burgeoning internet industry, and I wish him every success. However, I would treat what he said rather more seriously if the party of which he is a member had not sought to delay the Government's introduction of e-commerce legislation by refusing to allow it to be carried over. 
<P>
The internet community and industry are following those proceedings carefully, and they are extremely disappointed by that almost dinosaur, Luddite approach.
<P>
I shall deal with the issues that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised about the internet. Of course, he is right that we are in a time of great change. The internet and electronic communications are clearly important to financial services. They are powerful new tools that could make financial services more accessible and possibly cheaper. They should enhance competition among the regulated community.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has to be alive to what can happen with those new services. For example, in time, internet services could be delivered on digital television, so we must be flexible. That is why we must be media neutral, or technology neutral. We must not favour one platform or technology more than another. Over-detailed specification of media, such as that in the Financial Services Act 1986, can lead to confusion and a regime that quickly becomes out of date.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the report of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. We broadly support that report, and the FSA played a part in that. It is interesting that that report broadly supports the ``directed at'' test and stresses that it should not be media specific, and we agree with that. How the FSA will respond to overseas promotions on the net has been mentioned. International regulatory co-operation is vital, so I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman said nothing about it, given the expertise that he assumed when speaking about such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughtons:</B> That is rather unfair. The entire thrust of the report, which I have read and quoted from, is that regulating independently within domestic boundaries is entirely useless. That is the point that I was making. If anything can be done, it must be done in an entirely international context. That is why IOSCO exists and why it commissioned that report. The FSA's attitude in response to the European directive seems to be rather isolationist. My concern is quite the reverse of the unfair allegation that the Financial Secretary makes.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not become too heated; it was not my intention to insult him.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> My hon. Friend has been very kind.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As my hon. Friend says, I have tried to be as kind as possible.
<P>
The point about international regulatory co-operation was made by IOSCO. I am slightly disappointed with the hon. Gentleman because he did not refer to the co-operation that is taking place. I have the great honour to represent the United Kingdom on the Telecoms Council and had the privilege of chairing it during the United Kingdom's presidency of the Council of Ministers. There are many examples of such co-operation not only in the EU but in the OECD. The hon. Gentleman will find the document, ``Net Benefit'', which we have produced for the Ottawa OECD ministerial conference in October, very interesting reading. We need such international co-operation and, of course, it is taking place at the moment.
<P>
Perhaps on a kinder note, we understand the points that the hon. Gentleman made about advertisements or advertorials.
<P>
Bona fide journalism should not be regulated, and we acknowledge the importance of the points he made.
<P>
Issues were raised about the draft e-commerce directive, which provides for home state regulation of electronic commerce, including some financial services. The Bill must be able to, and does, accommodate that approach. On the directive, we acknowledge that there are some arguments in favour of a home state approach to regulation. However, the directive is still under negotiation in Brussels and we need to be assured that that directive&#151;and the complementary distance marketing directive&#151;provides sufficient safeguards for UK consumers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Do the Government support the broad thrust of the e-commerce directive, as presently drafted? As the internet develops, does the Minister accept that there will be increasing tension between the ``directed at the UK'' approach&#151;likely to be embodied in this legislation&#151;and the country of origin or home-based regulatory approach in the e-commerce directive?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have set out the Government's approach. We are in the middle of negotiations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for saying that this is not the place for the Government to debate those negotiations.
<P>
I have also been asked about civil sanctions and whether there are grounds for excluding the internet. The Government are not convinced that the internet is impossible to regulate. The overwhelming majority of activities on the internet are legitimate and bona fide: they take forward the social and cultural, as well as the financial and economic, agenda. However, no member of the Committee would support some of the activities on the internet and these can be regulated through co-operation at international level. The Government's view is that what is illegal off line must be illegal on line too. I am sure that Opposition Members would adopt the same approach.
<P>
This clause stand part debate has been puzzling in that everything that hon. Members have said about the need to ensure that the regulatory framework is not set in stone and is capable of being adaptive supports our approach. We have the right framework to accommodate change and development. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I shall be brief. Prompted by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, I should declare an interest as a director and shareholder of an internet company&#151;we are high-tech Tories.
<P>
Both sides of the Committee would agree that we have had a meaty and valuable debate. The more we, as Opposition Members, dug into the clause, the more uncomfortable we became about it. It is too much like French-style political politics: it goes down the route of leaving law in the hands of the Government of the day. The approach amounts to setting the outer boundaries and leaving it to the Treasury&#151;effectively the Government of the day&#151;to fill in the crucial detail by exemptions. The Treasury may be full of brilliant people, but we are unhappy that the exemptions will not meet the needs of the marketplace promptly enough and will not be readily available. It took us an hour and a half to find in the draft order&#151;it was right at the end of the document&#151;the important exemption for a company issuing its own shares. That is a significant point for large and small companies.
<P>
We have already said that we believe that sections 56 and 57 of the 1986 Act are unclear. The cold-calling regime and the advertisement regime, with their different legal bases, were put together and caused many problems. We are pleased that the Government will provide for business angel exemptions. However, many large companies, such as Glaxo Wellcome, have venture capital funds and they publish advertisements saying that they are interested in putting money into particular companies and that they seek applicants. I do not know whether such companies fall into the business-angel category.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I would define such activity as corporate venturing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Right&#151;and I assume that the Financial Secretary means that corporate venturing will be exempt. Glaxo is not necessarily an authorised company.
<P>
I do not think that the internet will be a vehicle for corrupt products. Citizens all over the world are increasingly sensible and, when they buy something on the net, they want to see that it has been regulated by a decent regulatory authority. The net is a powerful marketing tool, and British regulation has one of the best reputations in the world. If something is regulated in this country, it is regarded worldwide as being regulated properly. That is not always so of regulatory regimes elsewhere.
<P>
The internet will put huge pressure on international collaboration. At present, a British investment product cannot be marketed in the United States, and vice versa. A similar position applies to Britain and the European Union unless expensive and difficult local registration is undergone. There will be enormous pressure&#151;at least, within the G7&#151;for acceptance of each other's regulations and for more common regulation. That would be a desirable step. However, I want British regulation to be in the lead as a model for the rest of the world. For that reason, the Bill is crucial.
<P>
The clause is a step back on the 1986 Act because of its lack of clarity and its complete reliance on Treasury orders. As my colleagues have pointed out, the 1986 Act is out of date, and the Government have our sympathy in that they will have to live with the legislation. I am sure that many grey areas will emerge for which exemption orders will not be granted in time. That may create problems, particularly for the venture capital industry and for international interaction.
<P>
The Financial Secretary did not respond to my question about the overseas exemption, but I assume that there will be an exemption that copies the existing one. Although both sides of the Committee broadly share the same objectives, we are not convinced that clause 19, even after being amended, is the right way to achieve them. It is likely to cause many legal problems over and beyond those that already exist.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Safekeeping and administration of assets''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in schedule 2 triggers discussion on the clause. I am taking the opportunity to discuss not the principle of mortgage regulation, which the Government have accepted, but the timing and mechanism of that. It is appropriate to discuss that now because the Government have recently issued their consultation paper and I received my copy from the internet on Tuesday, a few minutes after the Government issued it.
<P>
The debate can be crystallised by saying that there are two positions. One, which the Government have accepted, is that the case for self-regulation, as against statutory regulation, is unresolved, that further consultation is needed with reserve powers perhaps being introduced in secondary legislation following a full survey of the problem. The alternative position, which I want to press, is that of many of the witnesses to the Treasury Select Committee, the Joint Committee on Financial Services and Markets, the Consumers' Association and others, which is that self-„regulation is seriously flawed and has been demonstrated to be so. I am sure that Ministers are familiar with the recent survey on the working of the voluntary code in Which? magazine. A large survey demonstrated that mortgage lenders rarely, if ever, told their clients about the existence of a code, rarely, if ever, advised their clients about the existence of independent advice, and that mortgage lending practice was characterised by a bias towards the promotion of endowment policies. That survey data is widely recognised to be part of current financial practice in the market.
<P>
Apart from survey data, inherent weaknesses in the self-regulatory structure were identified in the pre-legislative process, one of which is that self-regulation can apply only to mortgage lenders who are party to it. By definition, those who do not subscribe to the code are not governed by it. Many mortgage lenders on the fringe of the market are not covered and their practices are subject to criticism.
<P>
Another structural weakness of the process is the way in which it applies to the major players under the code. The only sanction that ultimately exists in a voluntary code is expulsion. It is easy to imagine an over-„zealous independent financial adviser being expelled, but it is difficult to imagine banks expelling each other from the code for failure to comply with its spirit.
<P>
There is abundant evidence&#151;the Government freely acknowledge this&#151;of practices, such as lock-„in, that impose severe penalties on people who wish to repay their mortgages early. There is a further structural problem because one of the key purposes of the Financial Services Authority was to create a one-stop shop for regulation. Yet what will happen now, at least until the Government put the reserve powers into law, is that there will be a voluntary regulation system in addition to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
I appreciate that regulatory costs are involved in any move to statutory regulation. That has been one of the currents running through our debate and the point was emphasised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham on Second Reading. I understand that, and I also understand that it is necessary to be prudent and thoughtful about how that is done. However, the Government consultative paper makes it clear&#151;in paragraph 26, I think&#151;that there are about seven different ways in which regulation could take place. Any combination of those would produce different cost outcomes because the cost-benefit ratio will operate in different ways. The point that I wish to make and the purpose of the amendment is to pose the question that was posed by the Government in their consultative paper about how mortgage regulation should take place rather than whether it should take place. The ``how'' question rather than the ``whether'' question is appropriate. The ``how'' question raises perfectly legitimate issues about whether to adopt a light touch or a more aggressive form of regulation. I would certainly favour forms of regulation that are not excessively onerous and costly. However, to get to that debate, one must overcome the obstacle of deciding whether the Government will make these reserve powers law. Therefore, amendment No. 131 proposes that, within six months of the passage of the Act, mortgage regulation should come within the remit of the Financial Services Agency. That gives the FSA time to make the necessary administrative preparations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am following what the hon. Gentleman is saying closely because implicit in his remarks about bringing mortgages within the net is the idea that the voluntary code, instigated in 1997 by the Council for Mortgage Lenders, has failed. What is the evidence that it has failed and if, indeed, it has failed, why will it still have failed in six months' time?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, may I say that the amendment is narrow and relates to timing. We seem to be moving on to a general discussion about whether mortgages should be regulated, which it seems to me should appropriately be discussed in the stand part debate on schedule 2. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman and other Committee members would concentrate on the amendment, which is about timing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I fully accept your guidance, Mr. Atkinson. The thrust of the amendment is about timing. We accept that mortgages should come within the framework of the FSA and we are trying to prescribe a time limit to ensure that they do. If I could briefly refer to the intervention&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to encourage the hon. Gentleman not to reply to the intervention. The amendment does not refer to mortgages; it is simply about timing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I acknowledge that, Mr. Atkinson. I do not think that the Bill refers to mortgages at all. At least the word does not appear. Perhaps you can guide me on that because I am not an expert on drafting. One of the difficulties I have&#151;perhaps other hon. Members experienced this too&#151;is that the whole question of whether mortgages should be regulated does not feature explicitly in the Bill. Therefore, we are trying to find a legislative provision in the Bill that will enable us to debate it properly. Perhaps I am misguided about the proper way of doing that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If it is helpful to the hon. Gentleman, I shall repeat what I said. The view of the Chair is that this matter would be better debated in the stand part debate on schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> In view of what you have said, Mr. Atkinson, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment. I just wished to air the issue and was not proposing to press the matter. I fully accept your guidance that it would be better to discuss the amendment under schedule 2 and I shall withdraw the amendment, if that is your advice.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. When we come to the stand part debate on schedule 2, his contribution will, I am sure, be welcome.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the clause is currently drafted, it will give the Treasury absolute powers to determine what ``a regulated activity'' is, and subsection (5) will give it the power to determine what
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `Specified' means in an order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 2 is merely illustrative of such regulated activities. The clause will empower the Treasury to do what it wants.
<P>
Our starred amendment, amendment No. 133, contains the relevant checks and balances. It states that the Treasury should not make an order or determine an asset unless the order is specific and until it has gone out to consultation for two months. That would encourage transparency of understanding and informed debate in the industry. I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-„East Bedfordshire will discuss that matter in greater detail.
<P>
The clause raises a question about whether the business of the Government and of government agencies should be regarded as a regulated activity. I shall not, at this stage, discuss whether that is a good or bad thing. The relevant order suggests&#151;I stand to be corrected&#151;that various areas of government activity will not be covered. I believe that it will cover central banks, the National Savings Bank and the Post Office in its banking capacity, but that it will not cover Government Departments or the Post Office in so far as it sells gilts. We all know that the Department of Social Security is a widespread giver of advice on pensions. Its misadvice&#151;it failed to state that the SERPS widows pension would halve in April 2000&#151;has caused problems for hundreds of thousands of people. In many ways, the Inland Revenue has become the giver of tax advice. We need to establish whether government agencies should be exempt.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will argue that such agencies will be exempt, and I suspect that any Government would so argue. However, I firmly believe that we have moved into an age in which that is inappropriate. In relation to the provision of financial advice and financial services, products and investments, the boundary between the Government, government agencies and the private sector is completely grey. It is wrong to draw lines and to argue that the public need substantial protection in the private sector but, apparently, none in the public sector. The clause and the relevant orders suggest that the Government want some Government activities to fall within the purview of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
I considered whether to discuss mortgages in relation to the clause or schedule 2, and I am happy to postpone my comments until we reach the schedule. However, I must point out, perhaps rather cheekily, that for elucidation on loans relating to land, page 2 of the Government consultation document refers us to paragraph 16 of the schedule. So far as I can make out, that is a printing error&#151;it should refer us to paragraph 23.
<P>
In conclusion, when we discuss schedule 2 there will be much to say about the illustrative areas of regulated activity. The proposal is in the spirit of too much of the rest of the Bill; it gives carte blanche powers to the Treasury with insufficient consultation, relying on the Treasury to get it right. The orders do not solve that problem because there is no scope to vote for some bits and not for others or for adequate debate. That is not the correct approach to what is admittedly difficult territory.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs was right; I want to focus my remarks on the moral duty of the Treasury to give plenty of notice to the industry and to consult before it lays down regulations.
<P>
Clause 20 is as wide as any in the Bill. I have already said that there is much overlap of terminology; the clause defines regulated activity as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``activity for the purposes of this Act if it is an activity of a specified kind''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a blanket proposal, which is reinforced in subsections (1)(a) and (b) which state that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relates to an investment of a specified kind; or (b) in the case of an activity of a kind which is also specified for the purposes of this paragraph, is carried on in relation to property of any kind.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That rubs it in that the Treasury can treat anything that it likes as a regulated activity. Please would the Minister tell us if there is any restriction on what the Treasury can treat as a regulated activity, at least in the natural and ordinary meaning of those words? I have a feeling that if the Treasury started to go too wide, the courts would become ingenious, and impose some sort of common-sense limitation under the ``of the same kind'' rule, which used to be referred to as the sui generis rule. [Interruption.] I tried to get the English in first, if only to modernise my speech.
<P>
The key point, of which we gave notice in our starred amendment, is that the Treasury should publish the regulations in draft and consult on them; our second point, which is more focused on by the starred amendment No. 133&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman has tried this one before. Amendment No. 133 is starred and therefore it was not selected. I should be grateful if he would not refer to it; he may wish to cover the territory, but he should not do it so blatantly that it upsets the Chair.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I retreat into my hole, Mr. Atkinson, in order to gather myself the better to jump out, which you will recognise is the translation of reculer pour mieux sauter.
<P>
The point of our criticism is to try to get something on paper to assist Ministers; if they choose to read it in the privacy of their closet, if they have one, it may assist them. My point builds on what I was saying in respect of the previous clause and after all, we are dealing with Part II of the Bill. Are we starting from where we are today? I did not notice whether the Minister answered that. However, I put it again to the Economic Secretary. I hope that we are starting from where we are today.
<P>
If that is so, we are suggesting that doing something new should be put in an order that deals with that new aspect of regulation alone. That way, at least we can debate and, if necessary, vote against the new change without destroying everything that has gone before. I do not wish to tie the Economic Secretary's hands. However, I hope that she will give a sympathetic response to my sensible suggestion.
<P>
Secondary legislation necessarily contains much detail; that is certainly true in the context of the Bill. Therefore, it is important that our parliamentary procedures develop in practice so that Parliament has a sensible opportunity, not merely to express a view, but to bring that view to bear if a majority in the House so wishes.
<P>
That may seem a little artificial at present. However, I have enough goodwill toward the Government to hope that they will not use their majority simply to ride roughshod over thoroughly sensible suggestions on every occasion. That may not be all that generous of me, but it leaves a chink.
<P>
The Economic Secretary was open to persuasion regarding other reasonably sensible proposals that we made. I very much hope that she gives a helpful answer in relation to the spirit in which my points were made, and offers an assurance that the Government will examine seriously that aspect, perhaps tabling an amendment of their own.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Debate on clause 20 can be brief because all the meat is in schedule 2.
<P>
My only comment on the clause is that it is quite astonishing that subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Schedule 2 makes provision supplementing this section.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, we need to examine schedule 2 to find out what is going on in the clause, which contains the phrase ``a specified kind''.
<P>
Having read subsection (2), we may be quite happy and know where we stand, as we have only a 200-line schedule to get through. By the Bill's standards, that is small beer. However, subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Nothing in Schedule 2 limits the powers conferred by subsection (1).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, schedule 2 merely serves an illustrative purpose. It has only a little more weight than the 60-page consultation document, ``Financial Services and Markets Bill&#151;Regulated Activities'' which I have glanced at quite a lot, inking up various passages.
<P>
An enabling clause such as the one that we are discussing requires a great deal of justification. I therefore look forward to the Economic Secretary's response.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> It might help if I explain why we are proposing to deal with the scope of regulated activities in secondary legislation rather than in the Bill itself.
<P>
As hon. Members have said and as we are all aware, the scope of the 1986 Act is set out in schedule 1.
<P>
However, fortunately, the 1986 Act allows that schedule to be amended by order. I say ``fortunately'' because that power has been used at least a dozen times over the past 10 years to cope with changes and developments in the marketplace.
<P>
Anyone reading the 1986 Act would be misled about its scope, because what is specified in schedule 1 is significantly out of date and no longer constitutes an authoritative statement of the law. We therefore believe that a single statutory instrument comprising a definitive list of regulatory activities will avoid a great deal of the confusion that arises in respect of a provision in primary legislation that becomes increasingly out of date and must be buttressed by several supplementary regulations.
<P>
We are not trying to avoid scrutiny of the scope of regulated activity under the Bill. Indeed, paragraph 26 to schedule 2 explicitly requires both the first and subsequent orders made under the clause, which add to the activities regulated under the Bill, to be subject to the approval and scrutiny of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
In February, we issued a consultation document, which included a draft of the order specifying the activities to be regulated under the Bill. We also published a draft exemptions order made under clause 34, and an order made under clause 206(5), to cover arrangements that do not constitute a collective scheme, which we shall reach later in our proceedings.
<P>
We received a constructive response to that consultation document, and we are now carefully considering how to improve the draft orders. That is the general reason why we propose to delineate the scope of the Bill through secondary legislation rather than in a definitive schedule.
<P>
On the point raised by the starred amendment&#151;I do not refer to the unmentionable amendment&#151;if I understand their suggestion correctly, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire advocate one order to deal with matters covered by the 1986 Act; another order to deal with deposit-taking, which is covered by a different Act; and a further order to deal with effecting and fulfilling different types of insurance contract. Ultimately, more than 20 orders would be made, simply to ensure that the new regime covered the same territory as the 1986 Act regime. Other financial services, such as mortgages or pre-paid funeral plans, would require further orders to be brought within the scope of regulation. Such an approach would be entirely contrary to what we are trying to achieve under the Bill&#151;a single order that is kept up to date and constitutes a definitive statement of the scope of regulated activities.
<P>
I think that I may be able to meet the anxieties of Opposition Members by emphasising that, just as we have consulted on the initial draft scope order, we shall, naturally, consult when it is appropriate to do so. It is important to do that so that not only hon. Members but practitioners, consumers and other interested parties have an early opportunity to comment before a new order is laid. Through the normal process of parliamentary scrutiny, we shall be fully accountable for the exercise of the powers that the clause confers.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and the hon. Member for Chichester asked whether the scope of the clause will be adequately restricted by schedule 2.
<P>
The clause does not allow us to bring any activity we like within the scope of regulated activities. It enables us to use Treasury powers to bring within the scope of regulation only activities that fit within the four corners of the Bill&#151;in other words, within the scope of financial services.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Schedule 2 provides an indicative list of the core activities that might reasonably be regulated by a regulator of financial services. It is not an exhaustive list, as subsection (3) makes clear, nor does the inclusion of an activity in schedule 2 necessarily mean that it will be subject to regulation when the Bill is enacted. It may in future be appropriate to regulate on matters additional to those set out in that indicative list, and the Bill allows us to do that. However, we will not be able to stray too far from what is set out in the schedule. The test will be whether an activity is the same kind of activity as those activities set out in the indicative list.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs suggested that the Government should themselves be bound by the legislation and that many activities should be brought within the scope of regulated activities. The hon. Gentleman, who refers constantly to the FSA as a leviathan, is now proposing that its remit be extended, presumably even to the social security system&#151;although since he wants to privatise that system, that is perhaps consistent. The Government's view is that it would confuse accountability if the Government were regulated by the regulator for which they are responsible. Ministers are answerable to Parliament and the public for the conduct of Departments&#151;that includes the social security system and the benefits system. National Savings, for example, used to sell gilts through the Post Office, but no longer do so; the problem therefore does not arise in that regard. The Bank of England, like central banks under the financial services regulation regime of other countries, is exempt. It is in the nature of central banks and their operations that they cannot be regulated in the same way as other financial institutions.
<P>
The clause is an extremely important part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am not quite clear whether the Minister has answered my question about whether, in building on existing and new regulation, the Government's aim is to start where they are now and develop&#151;forwards or backwards.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am sorry that I did not make that point clear. We have made it clear on numerous occasions that the intention of the Bill is, in terms of the activities to be regulated, to reproduce&#151;with a few minor qualifications in respect of Lloyd's&#151;the scope of existing financial services regulation. As members of the Committee know, we are consulting on the question of mortgages and will take a decision by Christmas on whether the selling of mortgages should be brought within the scope of the Bill, through the order that will be made on or after enactment. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As hon. Members have said, schedule 2 is essentially illustrative and makes reference to the Treasury being able to interpret the Bill as it sees fit. The Government have taken schedule 1 of the 1986 Act, but dropped its various exemptions. We are uncomfortable that a measure that was previously open&#151;even with the problems that the Minister has outlined, given what has been added since the 1986 Act&#151;will become somewhat opaque.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 is designed to make it clear that the list in schedule is not an authoritative list and would include other matters as determined by the Treasury under its power in clause 20. However, it is not clear in the schedule that that is the case. Amendment No. 118 describes in more detail the draft that the Treasury is obliged to publish in relation to our amendments to clause 20.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 would widen the definition of assets to include investments. Amendment No. 114 spells out&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing amendments Nos. 112 and 118.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson. All the amendments are relatively narrow, but amendment No. 118 is the most important. It would be irrelevant if clause 20 did not have the power that we propose, but I hope that its spirit is taken on board, which is that when the Treasury goes to consultation in respect of orders, the format will cover those items referred to in the amendment. There is much to say about schedule 2 and, as the two amendments are so specific, perhaps I should stop now and return later to the other amendments in the stand part debate&#151;the meat of our discussions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said to the Committee that the important part of schedule 2 would be its stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Amendment No. 112 is designed to fix the scope of regulation by stating that the activities to be subject to regulation would be those described in the schedule, or those of a similar nature. Its purpose is no different from ours, but unintended consequences might result from adopting it. No one would suggest that bringing the giving of dematerialised instructions into schedule 1 of the 1986 Act would not be within the four corners of the Treasury powers under that Act. However, if one asked whether the giving of dematerialised instructions was similar to the activities regulated under schedule 1, the answer would be no.
<P>
With technology moving as fast it is and the shape of the financial services industry changing so rapidly, it would be most unwise inadvertently to restrict ourselves in a Bill that will be passed in 2000, if not 1999, only for a subsequent Government to find in 10 years' time that they have to amend the legislation to bring within its scope an activity that everyone agrees should be included.
<P>
I suggested in the debate on clause 20 that the four corners concept is in the Bill and that the Treasury will not have unlimited powers to bring whatever it likes into the scope of regulation. Any order made under clause 20 will be subject to the normal procedure for accountability in the House. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will withdraw the amendment, but if not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend referred to the consultation that is at the heart of amendment No. 118. That is an important point, which I made in generic terms in my previous speech. I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary would now answer our questions on the subject.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I apologise. I did not respond specifically to that amendment because the issue about Treasury consultation was discussed at great length earlier. It would be inappropriate in primary legislation to require the Treasury to go through the same consultation process that we rightly require the FSA to undertake. The Treasury as a Department is accountable through Ministers to Parliament. As I suggested in various debates, we intend to consult whenever appropriate on the exercise of the Treasury's powers under the Bill. That is why we are already consulting extensively on the draft scope order, in the same way as we are now consulting on the question of mortgage regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her response. I think that she said in relation to amendment No. 118 that the nature of Treasury consultation is likely to be as it has been to date and within the parameters that we seek, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 113, in page 192, line 30, after `another' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which consists of or includes investments, or may do so'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 114, in page 192, line 39, after `persons' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in their capacity as investors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 115, in page 194, line 17, leave out `to participate' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or interest of a participant'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 119, in page 196, line 13, leave out `contract or'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 113 relates to the paragraph about safakeeping and administration of assets. It would slightly widen the definition of assets to include investments or items that may become investments. I apologise; the wording seems slightly convoluted, but that is the intent.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 deals with the paragraph on investment advice. It would add after ``persons'' the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in their capacity as investors or potential investors''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That concerns the issue of limiting the scope to the course of business.
<P>
Amendment No. 115 would improve the definition used in paragraph 16(2), so that it would refer to any right or interest of a participant in a collective investment scheme.
<P>
Under amendment No. 119, the words ``contract or'' would be deleted, because they are unnecessary. That amendment deals with a purely drafting point; the word ``arrangements'' alone would cover the full meaning.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> These are fairly technical amendments. Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 are designed to track more closely the equivalent provisions in the Financial Services Act 1986. That is unnecessary. Schedule 2 is designed to inform&#151;but not, in itself, to define&#151;the statutorily regulated activities under the Bill. If those amendments would do anything, they would narrow the scope of schedule 2, which would be unhelpful.
<P>
Under amendment No. 115, paragraph 16(2) would refer to the interests of a participant in a collective investment scheme. That is unnecessary; paragraph 24 of schedule 2 already makes it clear that any right or interest in an investment is deemed to be an investment for the purposes of schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is an investment the same as a collective investment scheme?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Could the Economic Secretary explain why not?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> All members of the Committee already know the difference, and I shall not waste the Committee's time by going over it again.
<P>
An interesting point is raised in amendment No. 119, for which I thank the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, and I should like to think about it further. Whether contracts should be specified needs further technical consideration. I shall consider whether such a change should be made, and report back in due course. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for what she has said. However, I hope that she will realise that the amendments were tabled not lightly to pad out the Amendment Paper, but because of the huge amount of work that is being done by some of the most experienced lawyers in the City of London. They understand the Financial Services Act 1986, have been advising on it for years and think that these are sensible and important points to be considered.
<P>
The amendments deserve serious attention, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will reflect on them and say, as she was kind enough to do a moment ago, that she will reconsider them. They may be drafting amendments, but they are more than that because they affect matters of substance. If there is any point at all in having a schedule that is simply illustrative, our purpose must be to get it as right as we reasonably can.
<P>
For no payment, those who are fascinated and deeply involved in this particular world&#151;for which we should be grateful&#151;have taken the trouble to read the Bill and its schedules very carefully and to introduce serious points&#151;it is not always easy for us to expatiate on every detail in every tiny amendment and I do not wish to do so. If we did so, we would never get through the Bill. We table serious amendments and we are entitled to have them considered properly. I hope that those in the Treasury and the FSA who are following our proceedings&#151;we are grateful to them for doing so &#151;will wonder whether there is some point in the amendment and assume that it was tabled for a reason. This is the stuff not of shifts of Government, but of good Government and I hope that the Economic Secretary will respond generously to the hard work of those who are assisting us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Let me expatiate. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire made an important point and as it is close to the end of term I should like to express public thanks to the top lawyers who have helped us with the amendments entirely free of charge. One of the Economic Secretary's colleagues said today that it is amazing that the British system includes no provision for lawyers to help Opposition Members when dealing with a technical Bill such as this. We are grateful for the dedication and professional assistance that top City security lawyers have provided.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that she will consider amendment No. 119 and if the Treasury, in its wisdom, finds good points in amendments Nos. 113 and 114 which would sharpen the definition, perhaps she will reconsider them in the autumn. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let me make a small housekeeping point. The Public Bill Office will be open during the week before we return. If amendments are to be unstarred on 19 October they must be submitted by 3 pm on the previous Friday.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
<P>
Bill to be further considered on Tuesday 19 October at half-past Ten o'clock.&#151;[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at eight minutes to Seven o'clock till Tuesday 19 October at half-past Ten o'clock.
