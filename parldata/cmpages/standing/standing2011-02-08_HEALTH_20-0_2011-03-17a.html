I should like to make a few comments on clause 55 and in particular on
the continuing function of Monitor in the approval of foundation
trusts. I will refer to evidence given at the Francis inquiry on Monday
this week during the questioning of Mr Gill, who was working for or on
secondment to the Department of Health and the strategic health
authority for some of the period with which the Mid Staffordshire NHS
Foundation Trust independent inquiry is concerned. I am referring to
page 49 of the evidence. The QC put it to Mr Gill
that<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“there
appears to have been…a drive to get SHAs to put trusts forward
for foundation trust status. Here, Warren Brown…is saying
‘SHAs may be putting trusts in waves that have no business being
there’.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>—that
is, pushing them forward for FT status inappropriately. Mr Gill
answered:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
think a number of SHAs gave the FT pipeline, as it was called, a
different priority. So some really embraced it, wanted to work with the
Department and get their organisations through to FT status. Other
SHAs, perhaps, saw that as a dilution or diminution in
power”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Further
on in the evidence is this
statement:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
think…the Department of Health wanted a nice, clean kind of
throughput of organisations through to Monitor to meet the quarterly
waves.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

how Monitor views the ongoing process of approval for foundation trust

happy to give him that assurance. I would also like to tell him,
because I think that it will encourage him, that there is no question
of NHS trusts being allowed to sacrifice quality while developing their
application to become an FT. To achieve FT status, a trust must be able
to demonstrate that it is delivering high-quality care and is well
managed and financially strong. The FT process has improved
considerably during the last two years to address some of the very
failings that my hon. Friend highlighted with regard to the Mid
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. That trust achieved FT status
despite very poor standards of care. The changes to the assessment
process have ensured that quality is the key focus for trusts working
towards FT status. I hope that that explanation provides some of the
assurances that my hon. Friend
seeks.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the past six
years, 134 trusts have got foundation trust status. Monitor estimates
that about another 120 NHS trusts will need to be authorised
to get every trust to foundation trust status. Let us be clear,
however, that Monitor is also looking at about 30 major transactions
that foundation trusts are involved in, and it will look at any future
transactions between trusts that are currently NHS trusts, but which
will take on foundation trust status. Monitor has said that that means
it will probably have to make 150 or so assessments of one sort or
another over the next three years, compared with the 134 that it has
looked at over the past six years. At the recent Westminster health
forum, David Bennett said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000060">&#160;</a>

in every trust across the country have the skills and expertise

has governors with sufficient experience and of sufficient quality to
manage budgets of millions of pounds is a very real challenge. Monitor
is supposed to help to train governors to do that, but it is a huge
challenge. What steps is the Department taking to deal with that? The

                           <em>s</em>
                           <em>
</em>that Monitor’s aim will be to create a genuine market for
fair competition between providers. However, that would require a fair
plying field between competing providers, and as things stand, there
cannot be a fair playing field, due to the differential costs that
apply to different types of organisation. The Opposition are genuinely
concerned that Monitor will decide to act against those differential
costs, which it will justifiably view as regulatory burdens. The Bill
certainly gives it the powers to do so, and David Bennett’s
comments fit in with that
scenario.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
of State, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and I have had a number
of exchanges on the matter. On 4 February, in a reply to a written
question, the Minister
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
impact assessment for the Health and Social Care Bill…includes a
partial assessment of factors affecting the costs incurred by national
health service bodies and private providers, respectively, in
delivering health services for NHS patients. The key conclusion is that
some of these factors appear to increase costs for NHS bodies relative
to private providers, whilst other factors appear to increase costs for
private providers relative to NHS bodies. However, based on the
information held centrally, it has not been possible to determine, on
balance, whether NHS bodies or private providers of NHS services are
systematically advantaged or disadvantaged relative to the
other.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 4 February 2011; Vol.

                        </p>
                        <p>I
confess that I have struggled to reconcile that ministerial answer with
the Government’s impact assessment. Paragraph B55 states
unequivocally:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
majority of the quantifiable distortions work in favour of NHS
organisations”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
layman’s terms, NHS providers are able to provide services at a
cheaper cost base than private providers. The impact assessment also
has an intriguing section on the cost of capital. In it, the Government
admit that public investment is far more efficient than private
borrowing. I do not want to deviate from the clause, but there is a
credibility gap between the Government’s rhetoric on the private
finance initiative and what is actually happening on the ground. There
are issues around deeds of safeguard that need to be tackled elsewhere.
Alarmingly, the point about the cost of capital is viewed as a problem
rather than an argument for the publicly funded investment that we all
want.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The impact
assessment goes on to outline how to remove the distortion when
creating private markets. Whether the Minister or the impact assessment
is correct is irrelevant because we have to deal with the provisions in
the Bill. It will be the duty of Monitor, not the Minister, to take
action and resolve these problems. The impact assessment uses KPMG
research into fair playing fields, which calculated additional costs
for private providers at 14%. By and large, according to KPMG, NHS
providers are 14% cheaper.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the view of
Opposition Members and some informed commentators, the spectre of
European competition regulations and rules on state aid are quite
important. Monitor will be under pressure to give either tax breaks or
subsidies to private providers, or to put additional costs on to NHS
providers. Unless the Minister is willing to reduce the scope of powers
given to Monitor by this Bill, it will not be able to offer any
guarantees on decisions that will be out of its
hands.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
power within the health service will dominate the provision of future
services. The Bill suggests that it will take a prime position over the
bodies responsible for quality, notably the Care Quality Commission.
The clause gives Monitor unnecessary control over the market by giving
it the power to fix costs and act against the naturally cheaper and
better option, the NHS provider. I would argue that if the Government
are sincere about rejecting price competition, Government Members
should take this opportunity to vote against clause
56.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope the Committee will be satisfied if I deal

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
56, as we know from clause 52, ensures that Monitor’s main
duties are to protect and promote the interests of people who use
health care services by promoting competition where appropriate and by
regulating where necessary to enhance quality. Clause 56, therefore,
requires Monitor to keep those regulatory practices under review so it
does not increase or retain unnecessary regulatory burdens, and,
through that, it will ensure best regulatory
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Over
time, as the health care markets change and competition becomes more
embedded and efficient, Monitor will adapt the way it regulates those
services, particularly where regulatory activity is no longer
necessary. It will also be possible for it to reduce certain regulatory
activities for certain types of providers, which would ensure that
regulation is applied proportionately and only where necessary. That
would ensure sufficient regulation while keeping burdens and costs to a
reasonable minimum. Monitor, under this clause, will publish statements
reporting its actions for every 12-month period and its plans for
future regulatory
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000092">&#160;</a>

carefully so as not to go down a cul-de-sac and stray out of order, Mr
Hancock. Amendment 192 to clause 104 will ensure that Monitor cannot
vary prices according to whether a provider is public or private. We
will debate that later, and I am sure the hon. Gentleman will have a
considerable amount to say about it, although I hope he studies the

those duties for which clauses 60 and 61 provide. Those clauses give
Monitor similar powers to those of the Office of Fair Trading under the
Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. In other
words, no impact assessment is required for anything that Monitor does
in exercising its competition duties. It seems astonishing that Monitor
does not have to produce an impact assessment when using such
fundamental powers, which are the same as those of the OFT. What is the
point of having a duty to produce impact assessments, if they do not
relate to any of Monitor’s competition functions? I am

                           </strong> I will, Mr Hancock, because amendment
489, I am reminded by my notes, relates to clause 62. It would delete
subsection (2) of that clause, which states that Monitor’s
general duties, as set out in clause 52, and matters to which it must
have regard, which discussed under clause
54,<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000132">&#160;</a>

functions that the OFT has under the 1998 and 2002 Acts, it does not
have to pay regard to its general duties or to other matters to which
it must have regard. The kindest way of looking at this is that it is
badly drafted and completely unclear. I apologise to any civil servants
sitting here who might have been involved. What is the point of setting
out duties and matters to which Monitor must pay regard, then saying
that when it is exercising pretty much its main functions it does not
have to bother with them? What is the point of having a duty to conduct
impact assessments when they do not have to be done? That is entirely
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000133">&#160;</a>

enables Monitor to act in a manner similar to the OFT for its
concurrent functions as competition authority, which are granted under
the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. There is
significant overlap between the matters to which the OFT must have
regard in protecting consumer interests, and Monitor’s duties in
protecting patients’ interests.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In deciding
whether to take a case under the 1998 Act, Monitor could
consider how doing so fitted into the performance of its overall
duties. That is to say that it must make the best use of its resources
and it is legally permitted to apply administrative priorities when
deciding whether to take cases; its administrative priorities would
reflect its duties. We must avoid inconsistency in the legal framework,
however, for concurrent competition authorities such as Monitor and the
OFT. To do otherwise would undermine the UK’s competition regime
and put Monitor at risk of legal challenge. Amendment 489 would create
such an inconsistency.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor must
be subject to the established duties that apply to the OFT to allow it
to perform its competition authority function effectively and in the
best interests of patients and taxpayers. It is worth remembering that
the OFT could currently take action under the 1998 Act against
undertakings providing health care services. In so doing, it would have
regard to the usual matters that a competition authority could take
into account, such as the market share of the undertakings concerned
and the impact on consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The drafting
in the Bill, therefore, maintains the legal powers as they already are
but with the added benefit of establishing a sector-specific regulator
for health and concurrent powers. The advantage of a sector-specific
regulator is the potential for enhanced knowledge and understanding of
the health care market. The amendment would, therefore, be extremely
inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn to impact assessments. When Monitor applies the 1998 Act, it needs
to use reasoning that is in line with the law. A decision that is
reached based on an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 819<a class="bkMark" name="Column819">&#160;</a>
                           </div>impact assessment would be subject to legal challenge. An investigation
under the 1998 Act would have an impact on the persons who are under
investigation, and it would not be appropriate for such an impact to
determine whether it was appropriate to pursue the case. I fully expect
Monitor to consider the potential impact on patients before deciding
whether to investigate a case under the 1998 Act. I think that
amendment 482 might make us subject to legal challenge, and for the
reasons that I have given I will resist amendments 482 and
489.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth bearing in mind, however, that the 1998 Act
involves consideration of factors other than the effects on
competition. For example, agreements are permitted that contribute to
the improvement of the production or distribution of goods or the
promotion of technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a
fair share of the resulting benefit, provided that they do not impose
unnecessary restrictions and they do not allow undertakings to
eliminate competition entirely. We will undertake an impact assessment
of the regulations that are permitted under clause 63 on GP consortia
and the NHS commissioning board. That will ensure that all the impacts
resulting from the requirements that are placed on commissioners are
taken into consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
would like my hon. Friends also to consider Government amendments 377
and 378, which clarify clause 57 and remove unnecessary duplication.
Clause 57(2)(a) refers to clauses 60 and 61, and we propose
to remove that paragraph. It is not necessary, because paragraph (c)
refers to the entirety of chapter 2, which includes clauses 60 and 61.
The addition of “by virtue of” clarifies that the duty to
carry out impact assessments does not apply in relation to any of
Monitor’s functions under chapter 2, irrespective of whether
they are specified in primary legislation or, for example, in
regulations made under that chapter.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000141">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> I do not think that the Minister has adequately
explained what Government amendment 377 does. Clause
57(1)(a) says that Monitor has to carry out an impact assessment when
it proposes to do something it considers
would<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“be
likely to have a significant impact on persons who provide health care
services for the purposes of the
NHS”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>So
Government amendment 377 says that Monitor does not have to do an
impact assessment if it affects staff. I respectfully request that the
Minister be clearer about the amendments that he tables, because this
amendment says that when Monitor exercises its functions under
competition law, it does not have to look at the impact on staff. That
is how I read it, and I would appreciate more clarity on that. It is
wrong; any impact assessment should look at the impact not only on the
users of services, but on the staff, who the Government often say they
very much want to involve in
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
my mind, the Government either want Monitor to pay regard to patient
safety, improving quality, fair access, better use of resources and
promoting investment, research, and high standards in education and
training, or they do not. If they do, they should not say in their
legislation that these are not issues that Monitor must pay regard to
when exercising its functions under the 1998 and 2002 Acts.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000144">&#160;</a>

either want to ensure that there are impact assessments that set out
the impact of Monitor’s decisions on people who provide and use
services, and the general public, or they do not—in which case,
the Government should not say that Monitor does not have to do an
impact assessment when exercising its competition functions. The
Minister has not explained that. As I said earlier, the nicest
interpretation is that it is a legal mess—clauses are being
added here and there—because the different parts of legislation
do not fit. Alternatively, the real reason for the subsections in
clauses 57 and 62 is that the Government do not intend Monitor to
deliver these laudable goals, but instead want it to promote
competition in all parts of the NHS with no regard to the impact on the
people or the providers of those
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000145">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I want to make a few remarks to
clear things up—in my own mind, if no one else’s. Some
concerns have been raised that I have not previously had a chance to
ask the Minister about.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It strikes me
that the fundamental thrust of the legislation is to create a regulator
who will stamp out anti-competitive practice and bring the benefits
that people perceive competition to have. The Minister has explained
that we are not talking about crude competition, that a series of other
issues must be taken into account—we might call them mitigating
factors—and that impact assessments are to be made. We have just
argued about what they mean in effect, and we seem to be creating an
entity that is slightly more than a simple regulator—almost a
strategic body capable of making decisions that have major
consequences. It will be an unaccountable body and, as I said this
morning, it will not have to deal directly with the consequences of its
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give an analogy that helps me, although it might not help anyone
else. We are perfectly happy for referees to decide matters such as the
offside rule and to implement a set of bloodless rules, but if they
must make judgments about how the game is going, and whether it is
being played well or badly enough, we are less happy, and think,
“What right does he have to decide such matters?” If we
have a hard and fast set of rules, and we know clearly what they are
and how they should be applied, we are comfortable. In other
situations, we are less than
happy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
burden of my remarks is not only that Monitor could create a problem
that it does not have to manage, but how it will meld—the hon.
Member for Halton made this point—with the fact that it will
sometimes overrule decisions on matters that consortia want. Sometimes,
it will overrule decisions on matters that are welcome to the public,
or decisions that the commissioners and the public want, but Monitor
deems to be
anti-competitive.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
gave an example this morning of an issue in my constituency. I am still
not clear about it. I could ask Assura Medical to provide a Southport
walk-in centre for children, and accept the risk because I know that
the background is that the GPs do not want it, but that the public
do—and I know that the Secretary of State does because there are
photographs of him campaigning for some sort of children’s
facility in Southport. The argument against that, which was put to me
by the existing PCT—presumably, it will also be made by the GP
consortia as they take over from the PCT—is that it will imperil
not the A and E service, which I understand there to be no competition
about, but the paediatric unit in another
town.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is not a stand-alone independent paediatric unit; it has no surgery and
it is partly dependent on Alder Hey, but that was the rationale given
to me for the non-provision of this facility. At some point, I would
genuinely like to refer a case to Monitor and ask, “Is this
anti-competitive or not?” Monitor, presumably, will make a
judgment call. Whether that call is for or against, it will be highly
controversial, and my constituents will not be any happier being
frustrated by Monitor’s decision than they are being frustrated
by persistent decisions from the PCT.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not see,
therefore, where accountability comes into this. We have no health and
well-being board to test 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 822<a class="bkMark" name="Column822">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Monitor’s decisions against. It can make what I consider to be
major strategic decisions, but we are given no voice for rebutting or
countermanding them. Such decisions can be important and controversial,
but they do not seem to be subject to review by anybody other than the
Secretary of State, who, at some point, can decide that Monitor are
doing a bad job, and that it is making the wrong decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This morning,
however, the Secretary of State said something that alarmed me even
more. He gave helpful examples of things that would count as
anti-competitive practice, which I appreciate. He mentioned such issues
as producer collusion, or decisions not to deliver certain services. To
talk again about my local hospital in my own patch, a decision is being
made to concentrate pathology services there, which affects the whole
Mersey region. Why? Because it is part of a QIPP—quality,
innovation, productivity and prevention—saving, and that pattern
is repeated right across the piece.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All the
hospitals, apart from some foundation trusts that do not want to play,
are getting together to consider how they can meet the Nicholson
challenge, how they can reduce over-costs, and how they need not
provide a full range of services because they can decide among
themselves which hospitals provide which services, using NHS
manpower and resources more efficiently than they would otherwise. That
strikes me, however, as something that would be snarled up
by Monitor. It is a classic example of producer collusion, which the
Minister mentioned this morning. Yet that strategy is being followed in
the Merseyside area to get the budget under control and make the
appreciable savings that are necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I see all
those problems generated by the creation of Monitor. I cannot help
thinking that we are creating a bureaucratic monster, with a whole
series of different ancillary roles that are not necessarily mutually
consistent. It will cost a lot of money, and I do not understand why we
are doing it. If the thrust is to have a system of competitive
regulation for clinical services, analogous to the system we have for
the procurement of other kinds of hospital services—the bedpans,
the beds and so on—it must be observed that there is no
regulator for such an activity. It does not
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> That is an excellent point, well made, and I
want to amplify it, particularly in relation to the hon.
Gentleman’s example of pathology services and the risk of
charges of anti-competitive behaviour. It strikes me, as someone who
worked in the pathology service for 12 years, that the service would be
ripe for a private laboratory to come in and issue a claim to Monitor
that it was not being allowed to compete, because the commissioners
were using the preferred provider based at the local hospital. Even the
threat of legal redress being resorted to, with the 10% fine for GP
commissioners, may be enough to shift the existing NHS provision to a
private provider.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000213">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is not an academic point. In the north-west and
Merseyside, we are trying to maintain access and facilities as best we
can—and this is not something that this Government have done,
because the £20 billion is a consequence of the Budget in which
the then Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West
(Mr Darling), said we would have to find that
saving.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000214">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The way to
maintain access and facilities is to ensure that the hospitals are
colluding as to the activities they are engaging in. That is the least
painful way of doing it. The other way is to beat one another to death
and have facilities go down in different areas and to have access
diminish. I do not see how we can run with the remit of Monitor and
simultaneously make a quick saving. I would be grateful if the Minister
explained how this would happen. I am making a serious point; I am not
trying to get one over on the Government or whatever. I am making the
point because I am worried. I am really
worried.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is that we are creating something that we have decided is
going to grow in cost. It is going to be a big bureaucracy. We are
giving it a lot of roles and a lot of different considerations. Not all
of them seem to dovetail together, which is going to be more difficult
and more legally complex. Why are we doing it? Local authorities manage
to go through processes of using a variety of providers and they have
guidelines. They have best value. The hospitals currently procure in an
open way, subject to European rules. We can discuss them later on. We
do not have a central provider. What is the point of the central
provider when we get all the benefits and none of the problems without
having
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000216">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall follow on from what my hon. Friend the
Member for Southport has said and raise one further question with the
Minister. It is a genuine question about how this legislation would
impact on a specific case. When I say “a specific case”,
I do not mean specific to my constituency, but a specific general case
across the country.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many general
practices have community pharmacies within them. Many of those
practices reinvest the profits from the pharmacies into other services
that they provide to the community—they do not take them out for
partners; they put them back in. I can think of one particular practice
in my constituency that does precisely that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The question I
raise with the Minister is about whether such a practice would be
considered, or be at risk of being considered, anti-competitive. For
instance, would another provider of, for instance, the home visits to
cancer patients, which the practice provides out of the profits from
its pharmacy, be considered anti-competitive by another provider that
potentially wanted to offer that service to the local
consortium?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000219">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am inspired by the hon. Member for Southport
and I have been thinking about this for some time. It seems as if the
Bill is developing two parallel universes in the NHS. One is from the
NHS commissioning board driving GP commissioning consortia
with—question mark—a degree of accountability, with some
health and well-being boards and local authorities joining up. There is
that world. Then there is the world of the economic regulator and
competition law driving changes in the system. My question is about how
on earth the two relate to one
another.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000220">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause requires Monitor to carry out impact
assessments for particularly significant proposals, or to publish
statements explaining why it is not necessary to do so. Significant
proposals would include proposals that would have a significant impact
on health care providers for the purposes of the NHS, NHS patients and
the general public, or proposals that involved major change to
Monitor’s activities or made changes to the standard licence
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
Monitor will not need to carry out impact assessments in relation to
the exercise of its competition functions, or when the matter is too
urgent for delay or intervention, as that would involve taking account
of considerations not relevant to the enforcement of competition law.
We want to ensure that Monitor considers only what is appropriate for a
competition authority to consider, which includes the effect on
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000227">&#160;</a>

sets out how the impact assessment should be carried out. That includes
why intervention by Monitor should be necessary rather than its using
its powers under the competition function, and how the intervention
fitted in with Monitor’s overarching duties. Monitor must
consult on its impact assessments for at least 28 days, and
give details on those that it has conducted in its annual report. The
clause is needed to ensure that Monitor’s activities are
appropriately justified and that it does not carry out activities
outside its stated duties and functions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000228">&#160;</a>

earlier but as the Minister has repeated his remarks, I shall make it

assessment in areas where it exercises its principal function in

other regulators in respect of competition law. Does that not point out
the deep inappropriateness of competition law being binding and biting

There is not much that I can do about it; the hon. Gentleman is not

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Member
for Southport asked a number of questions, and I shall deal with them
briefly. He spoke about competition law preventing collaboration in
general. I believe that competition law would not preclude
collaboration—for example, shared pathology services would
improve services and be in the interests of patients and
taxpayers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also spoke about Monitor and QIPP. I believe that Monitor
will help drive greater efficiency and productivity for the benefit of
patients and taxpayers. There is growing evidence that well designed
competition can improve efficiency as well as drive up clinical
quality. Health and well-being boards cannot hold Monitor to account
for decisions on anti-competitive behaviour. Although Monitor does not
sit on a health and well-being board, commissioners do, and the board
can challenge the commissioners directly about their commissioning
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000234">&#160;</a>

will be the economic regulator of health care services. We do not
intend to compromise Monitor’s independence or undermine the
benefits of economic regulation by allowing for political interference
in its decision making. However, we need to strike a balance. Monitor
will continue to be a non-departmental body, and, as such, we need to
ensure its political accountability. The Secretary of State will be
able to direct Monitor only in respect of significant failings in the
performance of its functions, and will not be able to intervene in
individual cases. Where the Secretary of State does intervene, he or
she will be required to publish a statement on his or her reasons for
doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000268">&#160;</a>

amendments are needed to make the accountabilities clear and to ensure

political interference. At the same time, they will ensure that steps
can be taken should there be significant failings by Monitor in the
performance of its functions as an economic regulator. The amendments
will also bring Monitor into line with the Government’s proposed
overarching principles for economic regulation, which the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills published in

                           </strong> The clause updates the Secretary of
State’s powers of direction during an emergency to reflect the
new framework for the health service provided by the Bill. That is done
by amending section 253 of the National Health Service Act 2006. The
Secretary of State will be able to use such powers of direction only
when he considers it appropriate by reason of emergency.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000386">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 39
inserts proposed new subsection (1A) into section 253 of the 2006 Act,
which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000387">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A

to—<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>(a) an NHS body other than a
Local Health Board;(b) the

Social Care Information
Centre;(d) any body
or person providing services in pursuance of arrangements made in the
exercise of the functions of the Board or commissioning consortia under
section 3, 3A, 3B or 4 or Schedule 1, other than an NHS
body.”<p class="tabbed">The
purpose of amendments 222, 223 and 224, which are minor, is to ensure
that the references to the bodies in new sections 253(2) and 253(2A) of
the 2006 Act are correct. That is necessary, because, as a result of
new section 253(1A) of the 2006 Act, a necessary consequential
amendment should also have been made to new section 253(2),
which is inserted by subsection (4) of the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000388">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
cross-references to new section 253(1A), which are in new section
253(2A), as inserted by subsection (4) of the clause, should also have
been updated. I am sure that that will be clear to hon. Members when
they study their copy of <em>Hansard</em> in detail over the weekend.

clear.”]<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000389">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
powers of direction will affect how NHS bodies, or other bodies to whom
directions are issued, exercise their functions, and such powers will
not only relate to an NHS body’s activities, but bolster
co-ordination between bodies at times of emergency. The Bill maximises
the autonomy of organisations at the local level. The Secretary of
State will, however, retain a few specific and limited powers. Those
will include sufficient powers of direction to ensure a command and
control framework in an emergency. I am sure that the Committee will
agree with me that, in an emergency, that is an appropriate and
necessary step to take.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000390">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State would be able to direct an NHS body or a provider of NHS
services on how they should act in the event of an emergency. He would
be able to delegate his power of direction to the board, which would
allow it to exercise a national command and control role where it
considers that it is appropriate to do so in an emergency.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000391">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In summary, the
amendments are minor, consequential and correcting. For that reason, I
hope that the Committee will support them and that the clause, once
amended, will stand part of the

hon. and hon. Friends and I have raised serious concerns about the
proposed changes to accountability, particularly to the accountability
of the Secretary of State’s Department. A point was made about
the ability of Ministers to intervene in matters raised by MPs and
whether MPs would be told to go to speak to the NHS board or consortia.

his responses, the right hon. Member for Chelmsford, whom I
congratulate on his elevation to the Privy Council, has kept telling us
that the Bill is about freeing up the NHS from bureaucracy, reducing
political interference and liberating providers. In the clause,
however, we see that the Secretary of State’s powers, which have
been described by some as draconian, have been extended. Will the
Minister give us more information about the extent of the Secretary of
State’s powers under the clause and what has changed from the

the clause if I were to describe the architecture in respect of

concern about the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might

                           </strong> Let me develop the thread of my speech a little
further and then I will be more than happy to take an intervention. In
the event of a major flood affecting an area, as happened in Cumbria, a
hospital trust in a neighbouring area may be directed to treat patients
transferred from hospitals in the affected area. The ongoing Exercise
Watermark, which relates to flooding, would be a case in
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000420">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give another example to develop the point and then give way. A
transient power failure in a hospital would initiate a local emergency
plan on a site, but that would not require the emergency declaration by
the Secretary of State. However, a longer-term cessation of power that
rendered the local NHS unable to maintain essential NHS services for
patients might require a direction from the Secretary of State for
mutual assistance from other areas. Those are a few
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000421">&#160;</a>

because the Minister was developing his point. In the event of the
failure of an NHS trust—we can go back to the Mid Staffordshire
case—how would failure be determined under the Secretary of
State’s powers? I apologise if the Minister was coming to that
point, but it is important because failure might be subjective in some
instances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000422">&#160;</a>

about. It is not about describing or dealing with the failure of
providers in the sense that we might in other contexts. It is about
circumstances in which an emergency requires the marshalling of NHS
resources

a good example. We are talking about circumstances in which, for one
reason or another, there is a need to ensure that services are
organised to deliver—where there has been a failure of the

wants to intervene again, I ask him to be clear about what he means by
failure for this purpose, so that I can be as helpful as

                           </strong> Let me try to deal with that by describing what
would constitute a relevant emergency for the purposes of the clause. A
relevant emergency, to which these duties apply, includes any emergency
that might affect a body to which the duty to be properly prepared
applies, whether by increasing the need for services that it
commissions or provides or in any other way. The emergency preparedness
provisions therefore apply in relation to an emergency in which the
body in question may be asked to assist other NHS bodies or other
public authorities responding to that emergency, as well as one that
directly affects its local
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000425">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give some examples. An NHS trust would need to plan to protect
its services in case of fire, flood or power failure—the
examples that I have already

issues around the failure regime and so on will be dealt with, but they
are not dealt with in this clause. This clause is about dealing with
civil emergencies of one sort or another, where there is a need to have
clear command and control to ensure that public resources are directed
appropriately through the NHS to address a civil emergency. I hope that
that answers the question—I am answering it as clearly as I

want to ensure that, before we finish our debate on this clause, hon.
Members are clear about the intention behind it. Through this clause,
some hon. Members are trying to explore—quite
understandably—what the failure regime might look like, how it
would work and the role of the Secretary of State. What I am trying to
say to them, as clearly as I can, is that this clause is not about the
failure regime.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000432">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman was talking about the Mid Staffordshire trust. What happens
in a case such as Mid Staffordshire is that the CQC is responsible for
safeguarding essential levels of quality and safety. In the existing
system today, that responsibility sits with the CQC and not with the
Secretary of State. That is what the hon. Gentleman’s question
was about—“What happens now?” And that
responsibility would not sit with the Secretary of State in the future.
However, this clause is not about those
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000433">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will intervene on the Minister one last time,
just to get some clarity. So the Bill does not change the situation. We
can go through all the various bodies that will have
responsibility—Monitor, the CQC, whatever. The same is true of
the bodies that are in place currently. However, if those bodies all
miss a problem and do not deal with it, the Secretary of State still
cannot come in and make a direction in a situation such as the one in
the Mid Staffordshire trust. Is that right?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000434">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That question does not apply to this clause. It
is an important question and it is one of the reasons why, at earlier
stages in the consideration of the Bill, I indicated the
Government’s desire and intention to listen to and act on the
recommendations of the Francis inquiry. It is also why I have made it
very clear on the record today that we already have provisions, through
the arrangements for the CQC, to safeguard essential standards of
safety and quality. Those provisions were legislated for in the last
Parliament by an Administration of which the hon. Gentleman was a
member and they provide those safeguards to deal with situations such
as the one in Mid Staffordshire. We are willing to consider other
changes in the light of Mid Staffordshire, but this clause is not about
that

                           </strong> The amendments are all minor and technical
changes to the National Health Service Act 2006, as a result
of changes made elsewhere in the Bill. The vast majority are consequent
on the abolition of primary care trusts and strategic health
authorities, which is provided for in clauses 28 and 29 of part 1 of
the Bill, which we have already considered.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000444">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As such, most
of these amendments are concerned with removing references to and
definitions containing “primary care trust”. For example,
amendment 252 removes “primary care trust” from the
definition of health service hospital. In addition, a number of these
amendments remove references to strategic health authorities. For
example, amendment 226 removes strategic health authorities from the
list of bodies in section 78 that the Secretary of State is allowed to
direct in the event of a failure. References to these bodies will no
longer be needed once they are abolished by the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000445">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some
of these amendments insert references to the new bodies established by
the Bill, including the NHS commissioning board and consortia where
appropriate. For example, amendment 234 to section 123 transfers some
ophthalmic functions previously held by PCTs to the NHS commissioning
board, in line with changes in primary care elsewhere in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000447">&#160;</a>

236 to 241 ensure that the amendments to the National Health Service
Act 2006 currently in the Bill extend powers to request
documents—for investigative purposes—from contractors
providing services for the Secretary of State’s public health
functions, as well as those of local authorities. They remove
references to local authorities in the definition of the Secretary of
State’s security management functions. The existing version of
the Bill incorrectly suggests that those functions would be extended to
local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000448">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
238 also ensures that amendments to the 2006 Act that are currently in
the Bill are extended to require the production of documents for
contractors providing services for the purpose of the Secretary of
State’s health functions. While the amendments to this schedule
and the next are numerous, they are of a minor and inconsequential
nature, and I hope that hon. Members are reassured that they are
essential to the functioning of the Bill and all related legislation.

                           </span> I want to talk briefly about
part 6 to schedule 4, which relates to ophthalmic services. I have two
points, but first I should say that I am vice-chair of the all-party
group on eye health and visual impairment. Perhaps I am being a
pedantic lawyer, but in my copy of the Bill, part 6, “Ophthalmic
services”, is listed as part 7 in the contents. We may want to
correct that before it becomes law.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000487">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is welcome
that primary ophthalmic services, notably sight-testing services, are
within the remit of the NHS commissioning board. That is strongly
supported by the Optical Confederation, to which I am grateful for its
help in pulling together my thoughts. It represents optometrists,
opticians and optical businesses. It makes sense to utilise optometric
practices to deliver primary eye care, as they are the logical partners
of hospital-based ophthalmology. That has been demonstrated with great
success in Wales and Scotland, where people with eye problems see their
optometrist first, rather than going to their GPs or to hospital. In my
constituency, GPs work closely with opticians and optometrists to
secure decent
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000488">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Enhanced
eye care services, such as shared care arrangements with hospitals and
GPs, for pre and post-operation cataract assessments and stable
glaucoma management, are currently commissioned locally. My right hon.
Friend the Minister has made it clear that the NHS commissioning board
will devolve enhanced optometric services to GP commissioners, and, in
the main, that also makes sense.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000489">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
optometrists are concerned about glaucoma referrals under the NICE
guidelines and community-based acute services. Managing red eye and
minor eye problems are two small services that are national in
character and, many believe, should be commissioned nationally on the
same basis as the NHS sight test. That would ensure national coverage
and appropriate protocols and accreditation within an agreed patient
pathway, and would save money and transaction costs throughout the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000490">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Suspect
glaucoma referrals became a significant capacity issue for hospitals
when NICE laid down a very low threshold for referral into secondary
care. In Stockport, a local scheme enables optometrists to carry out
further tests to reduce unnecessary referrals to the hospital eye
service by appropriately retaining patients within primary care. That
scheme is deflecting 77% of low-risk patients with suspect high
inter-ocular pressures who would otherwise be seen in a hospital
setting.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000491">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Negotiating
that simple yet effective scheme PCT by PCT has proved to be complex,
and it has not been established in many areas despite NICE advice to do
so. From a patient point of view, to reduce hospital capacity problems
and make the service cost effective, the NHS commissioning board may be
best placed to ensure provision across England. I hope that the
Minister can comment on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000492">&#160;</a>

write to my hon. Friend, and therefore the rest of the Committee. She
has helpfully illustrated one of the great strengths and opportunities
that the NHS commissioning board presents—the ability to have
greater consistency in how commissioning of certain services is taken
forward, to ensure that some past concerns about

consequential amendments made to other enactments in schedule 5. The

the list of amendments is long, in the majority of cases they simply
remove references to primary care trusts or strategic health
authorities and insert references either to commissioning consortia and
the commissioning board or to the Secretary of State or local
authorities performing public health functions. In a few cases, we have
removed references to PCTs and SHAs and not inserted any reference to
the new bodies created by the Bill. That is usually because the new
bodies will no longer be responsible for the activity. For example,
unlike primary care trusts, the NHS commissioning board and
commissioning consortia will be not providers of services but
commissioners of services. That provides a split that has increasingly
been established over the years.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000499">&#160;</a>

not intend to speak in detail about each amendment, I would like to
draw the Committee’s intention to amendment 260. I know that my
hon. Friend the Member for Southport also wanted to speak to this
amendment. He raised his concern about access under the access to
public bodies provisions. Let me remind the Committee that during the
discussions on the commissioning board, we promised that we would
ensure that it was subject to the Public Bodies (Admissions to

have reassured the Committee and that the amendments will be

                           </strong> This matter goes back to the question that I asked
about the previous schedules. Perhaps it was an oversight, but the
Minister did not cover it in his speech. He will probably understand
that we have a great suspicion that the Government want to take the
word “national” out of the national health service.
<em>[Interruption.] </em>If the Minister will listen, he may be able to
reassure me.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000501">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 312
refers to a person who is receiving NHS treatment. That seems fair
enough. However, under amendment 332, the phrase “NHS
services” is substituted with “health services”.
Amendment 333 changes NHS functions to “health service
functions” and amendment 335 substitutes an NHS function with a
“health service function”. Amendment 337
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000502">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Many
provisions make changes to various other Acts of Parliament, and that
is important. It underlines the rush that there is to get this
legislation through Parliament, which means that this is not good
legislation. I could speak to a number of other amendments, but I am
conscious that the Whips want to move on with business. Will the
Minister tell us why those changes have been made and why the reference
to the NHS is different in an earlier
clause?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000506">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Local Government Group has expressed concern about new clause 2. It
said that the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 requires primary care
trusts in England to appoint medical examiners to introduce a unified
system of death certification for all deaths that does not require
coroners, post mortems or inquests. Part 1 of schedule 5 and clauses 77
and 78 of the Bill have the effect of transferring the PCTs’
duties in regard to medical examiners to single and upper-tier local
authorities, in line with the planned abolition of PCTs in
2013.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000507">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Local
Government Group has concerns about the uncosted change to the 2009
Act, which, it feels, has not been adequately consulted on or had a
thorough impact assessment. The question is about how this additional
requirement on councils squares with the commitment for no new burdens.
This will be a wholly new requirement for local authorities and, given
that the system will not be up and running before the abolition of
PCTs, councils will be faced with the introduction of a largely
untested process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000508">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Department
of Health has anticipated the need for around 1,000 medical examiners,
appointed by local authorities on a part-time basis. The new service is
expected to impact on the NHS through the requirement

			Column number: 841<a class="bkMark" name="Column841">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of PCTs to recruit and train support officers and to monitor and manage
performance and service, while ensuring that medical examiners are
independent in how they exercise their professional judgment as medical
practitioners. The requirement of PCTs is to provision office
facilities, resources and access to information systems, all of which
will now impact on local authorities and all of which have a
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000509">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
what are the financial implications for councils? The initial impact
assessment did not consider the cost implications for local
authorities, other than for publicly held funerals, as the original
intention was for the requirement of PCTs. They believe strongly that
there should be a new impact assessment that considers the detailed
implications for local authorities. The original impact assessment
considered that the cost of introducing the medical examiners would be
met in full from the fees paid by the public for death
certificates.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000510">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
proposed system, a flat fee would be payable irrespective of whether
the body was buried or cremated, instead of the current situation in
which those who choose to bury their relatives pay nothing and those
who choose to cremate—some 70% of people—pay
£160.50. It has been estimated that the cost of the new system
will be less than the current one, so the total amount paid by the
public should be less than at present. The flat fee should be less than
the current fee for cremation. Currently, the total annual expenditure
on cremation is estimated to be around £45 million.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000511">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Local
Government Group has consulted with several other member authorities
who are sceptical about whether the introduction of the new role will
really be cost-neutral, funded by fees from the public. Their concern
is about funding and the additional cost burden, both in the short and
long terms, and a potential unintended consequence may result from the
fact that the public is asked to pay a much lower fee for deaths
investigated by the coroners service and there may be increased
pressure for coroners to investigate deaths. It is proposed that the
fee for death certification will be set nationally. They are concerned
that the national fee will not adequately reflect the differing costs
of implementation at local level.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000512">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local costs
will be affected by issues such as rurality, demography and, for
example, communities whose religious practice requires burial to take
place as soon as possible after death. The concern is that in the
current financial climate any new charge will be seen as a death tax
imposed by councils.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000513">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although local
government does not oppose the idea in principle, as authorities
already manage coroners and registrars, both of whom have had to work
closely with medical examiners, it could make sense for them to be
commissioned by local authorities and co-ordinated with the coroners
and the registration service. They feel this issue needs to be
addressed in a broader context, abrogating the totality of the new
burdens associated with the health reforms. Furthermore, they seek
agreement on planned consultation which will identify all the costs and
implications for local authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000514">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will be
interested to see what the Minister says about that. I had not realised
the total impact on local authorities and wonder whether he would take
the issues away and look at them
again.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000515">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions and
I will try to address them in the order that he raised them. I will
start with amendments 332 to 336 to provide the context in which the
use of “health services” is appropriate. They amend
provisions in schedule 5 that amend the Health Act 2009 and
they relate to the NHS constitution. The amendments ensure that local
authorities are added to the list of bodies who must have regard to the
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000516">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
duty to have regard to the constitution covers the entire health
service to reflect the fact that in the Bill we are transferring public
health duties to local authorities, and we want to ensure that those
aspects of health that are discharged by local authorities are covered,
we are using the definition that we are. We are changing the reference
to “health services” so we can ensure that we cover the
comprehensive health service, which includes the NHS and
public health. Both parts constitute the comprehensive health service,
and we want to ensure that that is clear in terms of discharging duties
under the NHS constitution. That is why the language is as
it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000517">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
danger of retaining “NHS services” is that it would give
the impression that health services provided and commissioned under the
public health responsibility of local authorities were not part of that
duty. I should have thought that hon. Members would want to ensure that
the NHS constitution’s values, principles, and so on were being
considered by local authorities when discharging their public health
duties. That is the intent, and there is no sinister purpose behind it.
It is about ensuring that we fulfil the ongoing obligation, which we
believe we have, to a universal health service.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000518">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 337
to 339 amend provisions of the Health Act 2009 relating to quality.
They ensure that quality accounts apply only to the provision of NHS
services, not to public health services, and that Monitor, rather than
strategic health authorities, will require providers to correct errors
or omissions in their accounts.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000519">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
hon. Member for Halton raised a number of concerns about the examining
service, on behalf of the Local Government Group. We have already
embarked on a consultation about the public health responsibilities of
local authorities and the resourcing of those, but to fulfil the hon.
Gentleman’s request, I will write to him to ensure that we give
him the best possible answer. I also want to make sure that we are
properly consulting our colleagues in local government, so that we deal
with any concerns that they have about a new burden that is not
properly resourced. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that officials and
Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government would
be among the first to warn us of such a consequence, if it were there.
I will, however, write to him on those points and with that, I hope the
clauses can be amended in the way we
recommend.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000520">&#160;</a>

minor technical changes are necessary to clarify two points that are
not made explicitly in the Bill. The first would ensure that the
Secretary of State retains his powers of delegation in relation to
primary care trusts, until their abolition. The second change would
ensure that directions made to special health authorities under
existing legislation can continue to be in force once clause 17, which
relates to functions of special health authorities, commences. The
provisions are important to ensure that the period of transition is as
smooth as possible, and that everything continues to function as it
should. I recommend, therefore, that the amendment stands part of the

of the Health Protection Agency is an important step in the
Government’s plan for unifying national health protection
activity and creating a more transparent, responsive and accountable
service under the Secretary of State. The Health Protection Agency is
mentioned in primary legislation ranging from the Health and Safety Act
Work etc. Act 1974 to the Employment Rights Act 1996, and in many cases
the Secretary of State is already named in the relevant legislation and
the reference to the Health Protection Agency simply needs to be
omitted.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000617">&#160;</a>

Secretary of State directly accountable for protecting the health of
the people of England. In many ways, the Health Protection Agency has
done an outstanding job and it has established an international
reputation for excellence. The efforts of staff will continue to the
same high standard through Public Health England. The agency’s
scientific expertise and ability to provide expert advice will
continue. There will now be a clear line of sight to the Secretary of
State for Health, however, on vital health protection and emergency
preparedness issues. New arrangements will be much stronger and more
efficient. I hope that the Committee will support the

                           <strong> </strong>Clause 46 abolishes the Health
Protection Agency as a statutory organisation and make the Secretary of
State responsible for its functions, and we need to pause and think
about the sense of that. I know that a number of organisations are
anxious about it. There is concern that the Health Protection Agency
will lose its independence and its impartiality, not only in fact but
in the perception of the Health Protection Agency’s alternative
structures. As the Minister has said, the agency has done an
outstanding job and has an international reputation. If it is not
broken, why is any attempt being made to fix it? On one hand, the
Minister has argued for the importance of changing it to ensure greater
transparency and accountability in the new structures. On the other
hand—I know that the Government have this at the forefront of
their mind in a lot of this legislation—it is important to avoid
political involvement and to free the NHS from political
interference.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000619">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
obviously the potential, as there has been in the past, for a breakdown
in public trust; we know about the BSE crisis and we know about the MMR
vaccine crisis. The Royal College of Nursing in particular has asked me
to point out that the Health Protection Agency is very different from
the Department of Health. The Health Protection Agency is public and
customer facing—it provides advice and information to the
general public, to health professionals such as doctors and nurses and
to national and local government—but the Department of Health is
not naturally a public-facing body. That is causing some concern, which
is why I am raising it today. Has the Minister given consideration to
that, and to how the Department will carry out these new
responsibilities?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000620">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Health
Protection Agency has a number of UK-wide functions. Will the Minister
explain how those will be transferred to the devolved Administrations?
I would also be grateful if the Minister explained the motivation
behind that change and, in particular, why the Health Protection Agency
will not be made a special health authority, which would have given it
greater
independence?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000621">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is not necessarily an encouragement, but the
Department of Health is the place that people write to when they have a
concern about their experience in the health service. In some cases,
that means that we will signpost it, but, in other cases, we will deal
with it appropriately. In the case of reforms in public health, that
further strengthens
us.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000624">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the agency’s reputation for independence
and how that might be affected. There is no reason why it should be.
Public Health England will have all the functions of the Health
Protection Agency along with its experts and scientists, many of whom,
I am sure we all agree, are world class. There will continue to be
expert advisory committees drawn from the scientific community through
open recruitment, and the chief medical officer will continue to
provide impartial and objective advice to Ministers and
others.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000625">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady went on to ask about Health Protection Agency functions and
how accountability will be improved. At a national level, there is a
clear rationale for accountability for health protection resting with
the Secretary of State and, through him, Parliament. That is the
intention of the changes that the Bill makes. The nature of various
threats to health range from infectious diseases to terrorist attacks,
and they are not always amenable to individual or local action. They
require a clear line of sight from the centre of Government down to
local services, and we need a system that is more integrated and less
dispersed than the present one. Abolishing the agency and conferring
its responsibilities directly on to the Secretary of State will be a
major step
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000626">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Health Protection Agency does a good job, and its efforts will continue
to the same high standards through Public Health England. Its
scientific expertise and ability will continue to be available to
provide independent expert advice. There will be a clear line of sight
from the Secretary of State on vital health protection and emergency
preparedness.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000627">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
essence, we want to the see the Secretary of State and the Department
of Health having a much sharper and clearer focus on public health than
has historically been the case. That is an important, and up until this
point oft-overlooked, area of responsibility in a comprehensive health
service. By having clear outcomes and frameworks for the NHS, for
public health and, indeed, social care, too, and also having that
responsibility close to the Secretary of State, will allow us to be in
a much better place to drive a public health agenda, of the sort that
is necessary to address so many of the public health challenges that
the country faces, right across Government. It is for those reasons
that we are proceeding in this way. While concerns have been raised
around implementation and transition in the consultations that we have
undertaken; there have been no concerns about the principle of the
direction of travel. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Lady is
reassured and that the amendments are

                           </strong> I hope that I will not detain the Committee for
too long, but I have been trying to get to the bottom of what
“competition” means in relation to the Bill. We have been
told on numerous occasions that the Bill is an extension of the
legislation introduced in the past 10 years in which the
previous Government introduced the independent sector to the national
health service. That prompts the question—I see one or two
Government Members nodding their head—why do we have to have all
these clauses to introduce competition law if the Bill is just an
extension of what has been happening over the past 10
years?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000632">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Earlier
in our proceedings, I asked the Minister what he meant when he said on
BBC television earlier this year, “It is going to be a genuine
market. It is going to be a genuine competition.” His answer was
that there is going to be competition in terms of quality. When we set
off on this Bill, we looked at NICE’s role in quality standards,
which I support. The spreading of best practice has been very poor
inside the national health service, so, in that respect, I see where
quality comes through from NICE’s laying down standards for
patient pathways and having both commissioners and providers accept
them. That seems to me to be a simple concept to
accept.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000633">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Competition
law is a little different. On Tuesday I asked a number of questions of
the Minister on the Government’s intention for competition and
the introduction of competition law. We see here that it is an
introduction of competition law; it is not using the current framework,
otherwise we would not have to have it in the Bill. I asked several
questions. Our greatest problem, in a sense, is with the powers of
Monitor. Those powers are described in the explanatory notes on clause
52, which say very little about how the shape of competition will work.
The explanatory notes simply say that it will
work<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000634">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

necessary.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001149">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
Tuesday we debated competition law and some of its different aspects. I
asked a number of questions of the Minister, some of which he answered,
but he was not taking interventions at the time because he wanted to
get through answering questions that other Members and I had asked. The
questions I asked of him related not to what is in the explanatory
notes, but to what is in the White Paper that was published last July
and explains the scope and powers of Monitor. I want very briefly to
describe those questions. One question was on the powers Monitor will
have to

the powers to grant access by third parties to a monopoly

so.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001153">&#160;</a>

is a whole debate, not only in this Committee or in this
House—it was debated in the Chamber yesterday, but I did not
participate in that debate—but in political parties and in the
different organisations that represent different aspects, both clinical
and non-clinical, of the national health service. What exactly does
this mean? What does bringing competition law into the NHS mean? With
all due respect, “in limited circumstances” means
absolutely nothing. It means very little to me that the new power the
Bill will allow Monitor to exercise will be used “in limited
circumstances”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000640">&#160;</a>

equation. We are the Committee that should be looking in detail at the
implications of this legislation for our constituents and the country.
Going away from here on the basis of “in limited
circumstances” does not satisfy me that, as a legislator, I can
say to my constituents—or anybody else—that this
legislation will not disrupt the NHS in the way that it has the
potential to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000645">&#160;</a>

Is there not an added complication in this part of the Bill? If
European competition law is a part of Monitor’s remit, would a
monopoly provider, such as the one my right hon. Friend mentioned on
Tuesday evening, potentially be subject to state aid rules if we were
applying competition law to its full

                           </strong> Let me answer that very relevant question by
explaining to the Committee. On Tuesday I said that we were all sent a
brief on competition law by the NHS Confederation. An element I did not
bring up then but will now is
that<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000647">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Under
the NHS reforms, Monitor will have the same powers as the OFT, in
relation to competition in the provision of health services in England.
Competition law regulates anti-competitive conduct, mergers and state
aid. In relation to anti-competitive conduct, there are two main areas:
[one is] (collusion) [and the other is]
(monopoly)”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
am not convinced that monopoly will only be threatened “in
limited circumstances”. We had no examples as far as the law is
concerned—I am not a lawyer, but bringing competition law into
the health service could open up every
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000648">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said on Tuesday, I accept entirely the existing issues around
procurement. Competition law should be used there because it is a major
way of protecting the public purse. There are good examples of where
NHS procurement has not been as efficient for the taxpayer as it should
have. There are many, many examples of that over many years. However,
clinical services are entirely different. I am unsure about the
implications around the issue of state aid and competition
law—perhaps the Minister could tell us whether there are any
implications concerning state aid, given that our health service is
pretty unique in how it is
funded?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000649">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said earlier, I do not want to detain the Committee, but I must go
back to the question I posed to the Minister, which was not answered on
Tuesday. It related to the White Paper published in July, which
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000650">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor’s
powers to regulate prices and license providers will only cover
publicly-funded health services. However, its powers to apply
competition law will extend to both publicly and privately funded
healthcare, and to social
care.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again,
I pose the question to the Minister: what are the implications of that?
What does it tell the Committee about whether competition law will be
involved in every aspect of health and social care in this country? I
entirely accept the issue about procurement, but this is about monopoly
providers, which in general terms are hospitals, and about having
access to them. I do not pose the question to scare anybody, but this
is relevant. Even if all we get back is limited in terms of how this
arrangement can work, I pose it to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000651">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
has been a great debate for 60 years about whether hospitals should
have private wings. My local hospital does not have a private wing, but
I have been into some that do. Some people who work in the NHS and many
of our constituents would take strong exception to a current NHS
hospital being told that it had to open a private wing because Monitor
believed that that was a way to use the powers given to it by the Bill.
I know that we are on competition law and not the powers of Monitor,
but this is about the powers of Monitor. It has the power to look into
the market and direct things if it feels that the market is being held
up in any way. Competition law, quite frankly, does not reassure me
about the decisions that will be
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000652">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Southport said in an earlier debate, much of our
health care system is integrated, and has to be integrated at a
regional or sub-regional level on occasion. That is how our NHS works.

                           </strong> My view echoes that of my right hon. Friend.
This is another cornerstone of the Bill. The provisions clause 60 and
some subsequent clauses on functions under the 1998 Act are causing
considerable concern, not only to my party and the public, but to many
Members of the governing parties, and certainly to the medical
profession.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000654">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 60
gives Monitor powers under competition law that it can use concurrently
with the Office of Fair Trading, as my right hon. Friend said. My
understanding is that Monitor will identify market distortions or
anti-competitive practices, and the Competition Commission will take
appropriate corrective action. The application of competition law to
health care is a major departure in terms of the clinical provisions
and is of considerable concern. If the full weight of EU competition
law applied to the NHS, as if it were a standard service industry, the
process of privatisation, which Opposition members are concerned about
and the Government have indicated that they are opposed to, could not
only be accelerated but might become entirely
irreversible.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000655">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend said that a quarter of the Bill is dedicated to
clauses dealing with competition. This seems to be a difficult concept
to explain, but my principle concern is that in changing the structure
and architecture of the NHS we are exposing the clinical areas to EU
competition law. It is not so much about the drivers in the Bill, but
the structural changes, and that is the issue of concern to Opposition
Members and those further afield. It is important to read the clauses
in conjunction with the impact assessment, and to note that the
competition powers can be invoked where a private provider complains
that a commissioner, such as a GP commissioner, is favouring an
incumbent provider, such as a local NHS hospital. We touched on this
when the hon. Member for Southport gave particular examples in his
area, so I do not want to rehearse those.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000656">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
implication is that, on receipt of such a complaint, Monitor would be
able to investigate local GPs with the threat of full enforcement
powers, and the possibility of levying a penalty of up to 10% of their
turnover where it determines that there has been anti-competitive
practice. I accept that Monitor would do the investigation and would
make the recommendations and that the Competition Commission would want
to carry out the sanction. However, in cases like this—and even
in extreme cases—it is conceivable that, under European
competition law, there could be criminal offences. I am not suggesting
that that is going to happen; it would be an extreme situation.
However, even if that scenario is unlikely, just the prospect of it may
be a useful weapon for the private providers who are seeking to gain
entry to the market by exerting influence over local GPs to commission
their services instead of the preferred NHS providers. Indeed, such
threats would counteract any political pressure from the local
community to save local services and local NHS hospitals.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000657">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not wish
to go any further, but in part 1 of clause 15 there are also
concerns about opening services to EU competition
law.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000658">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friends the Members for Rother Valley and
for Easington both raised important issues about this clause. I would
like to say some more about what the clause seeks to do and why I think
that that is a huge problem, as do my hon. Friends. For the record,
clause 60 gives Monitor concurrent functions with the Office of Fair
Trading under part 1 of the Competition Act 1998. There has been much
debate about this, both within this Committee and on the Floor of the
House. The Act is applied and enforced by the OFT in a number of
regulatory functions. I have found another one in the explanatory note
with the Bill: it is not just telecoms, gas, electricity, water and
railways but sewerage. So that is added to the mix.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000659">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Part 1 of the
Act has two chapters. The first prohibits what are called undertakings
from reaching certain agreements which prevent, restrict or distort
competition, which include reaching agreements not only to fix prices
but also to “share markets”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000660">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Chapter 2 of
part 1 of the Act prohibits undertakings from abusing a dominant
position in the market, which include limiting production.
Undertakings, as hon. Members will know, are defined in EU law as
entities engaged in economic activity. I say EU law, because chapters 1
and 2 of part 1 of the Competition Act are modelled, as detailed in the
explanatory notes, on articles 101 and 102 of the treaty on the
functioning of the European Union. It is clear that these provisions
are being generally applied to the NHS in primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000661">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor would
have the same powers as the Office of Fair Trading to conduct
investigations where it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that
either of the prohibited areas that I have outlined have taken place in
relation to health services in England. It would also have powers to
impose remedies or penalties for those breaches. If I may clarify what
some of my hon. Friends have said, the OFT’s powers include a
power to fine businesses who are found to have broken the law up to 10%
of their turnover. Third parties, including injured competitors,
customers and consumer groups, can bring damages and claims against
them. Individuals found to be involved in cartels can be fined and
imprisoned for up to five years and directors of companies that breach
prohibitions can be disqualified for up to 15 years. That is why it is
important for us seriously to consider the implications for the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000662">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to get
to the heart of the issue which Mr. Hancock rightly said
should wait to be discussed until this clause. Members on this side of
the Committee have not argued that this Bill extends the scope of
competition law; we have argued that it extends the applicability of
the law by extending it to the NHS. I say to the Minister that the
national health service has explicitly become a market in which
competition law has been added to primary legislation for the first
time. The Minister is guaranteeing that it will be treated as a market
and bodies will be treated as undertakings because that is enshrined in
primary legislation for the first time. By introducing an economic
regulator, the Government have made it clear that the NHS is being
treated more as a market.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000663">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would go
further, however. As the private patient price cap is entirely removed
from foundation trusts and they can make money from the private sector,
they would be more likely to be considered undertakings. As there are
no more primary care trusts or strategic health authorities as a
management level of Government to

                           </div>cope with some of the results of patient choice, the Government’s
policy is to move the NHS to be considered, as the Minister said in his
“Newsnight” interview, more as a genuine market with
genuine competition.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000664">&#160;</a>

about which there is real concern is whether commissioners will become
undertakings. My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley has
already pointed to a briefing, which I have mentioned before, that was
issued last month by the NHS Confederation and Mills and Reeve—a

the moment, PCTs are not counted in their commissioning function as

to which different laws apply, but I am arguing that the changes in the

these challenges and issues. The proposed changes could explicitly
clarify that they are subject to the full force of competition law,

through the legislation, and there is uncertainty. I am not making it
up out of nowhere; I am raising these questions for the same reason
that the NHS Confederation and other organisations are raising them,
and I ask the Minister just to stop and look at those concerns. He may
disagree with them, but he is not a lawyer. Neither am I; I am a member
of Her Majesty’s Opposition rightly questioning what this

point that I made earlier, I have asked the Minister to publish the
legal advice, so that we at least have a better understanding of these
different issues. I conclude by urging him to do so, because the most
telling part of the briefing from the NHS Confederation is the
statement that once the competition regime is in place by 2012—I
say this respectfully to the hon. Member for Winchester—it will
be very different from the previous regime. The King’s Fund says
the same. If it was not different from before, arguably there would be
no point in the legislation. The NHS Confederation says that
competition will be enforced by Monitor through legislation, rather
than by NHS policy. Ultimately, where competition should be applied
should be based on evidence and decided on by policy, not by lawyers or
Monitor and certainly not in the courts—whether in this land or
another.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000683">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Not at the moment. Let me make a little progress.
The 1998 Act prohibits undertakings from reaching certain agreements,
decisions or concerted practices that prevent, restrict or distort
competition. Giving Monitor concurrent powers to the OFT opens the
gateway to wholesale privatisation. The Government must realise that it
will be difficult, at best, to close that door once they have opened
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000686">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions contained in the clause will open the NHS up to legal
challenges under UK and EU competition laws. That represents a
significant marketisation of the NHS. Once the precedent of competition
law has been set, it may be impossible to reverse it. The Bill is
forcing the Tory ideological commitment to competition and full-scale
free marketisation of the NHS. To be clear, we support competition in
the NHS where it benefits patients, but we oppose the ideological drive
to introduce markets when it will harm services. The Bill is harmful.
Its provisions mean that any GP consortium fondly imagining that it can
keep using its well-trusted local hospital will be bitterly
disappointed when it finds itself tangled in wasteful and
time-consuming legal
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000687">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Concurrent
powers would enable Monitor to investigate where it had reasonable
grounds to suspect that health service providers had colluded in a way
that prevented, restricted or distorted competition, against the
interests of patients. I cannot see what is wrong with that, and
if  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 871<a class="bkMark" name="Column871">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Labour Members can, I am puzzled. Monitor could also investigate
undertakings that it had grounds to suspect were using their monopoly
power to prevent competition, for example by stopping patients from
being referred to or treated by other providers. Again, that seems
eminently reasonable and sensible to
me.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000716">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor
would have concurrent powers to issue directions and fines as remedies
for breaches of the prohibition. For example, a direction could be a
requirement to bring the infringement to an end and remedy its effects.
Any sane person would assume that that was beneficial and
commonsensical. These powers currently sit with the OFT; giving them to
Monitor in relation to health care services, alongside its powers to
set licence conditions to promote competition, would effectively result
in a single regulator for competition in health care services. This
would ensure clarity of roles and provide a single centre of expertise.
That is what clause 60 is about, and to my mind it is very
sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000717">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us look at some of the issues raised. The right hon. Member for Rother
Valley asked whether state aid law would apply. Monitor will not be
able to enforce state aid law—only the European Commission can
do that. As with the rest of competition law, it is only if a provider
is an undertaking that state aid rules apply. To help the Committee, a
body is an undertaking if it is carrying out economic
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000718">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
point raised by the right hon. Gentleman was why Monitor should be able
to fine providers. That ability would act as a deterrent, and take away
unlawful gains that might be made by providers engaged in that sort of
activity. It is entirely consistent with normal regulatory practice in
other sectors. Fines are rarely used, but they deter anti-competitive
behaviour that is against the interests of patients and
taxpayers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000719">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman also asked what the implications of
Monitor’s competition powers applying to private and primary
funded health care were. As set out in the White Paper, Monitor will
become the sector-specific economic regulator for health. Its
competition powers will extend across health care, both NHS and
privately funded. These powers already exist and are held by the OFT;
we are simply creating a dedicated regulator with expertise in health.
Monitor’s other powers on price-setting and on service
continuity are relevant only to NHS-funded care and do not apply to
privately funded health
care.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000720">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman also asked whether an NHS hospital would be forced
to open a private wing. No, is the straightforward answer to that. This
is about ensuring that NHS patients have access to the best services
where they are not provided or provided well by a monopoly trust.
Patient interest would be key in determining the limited occasions when
Monitor uses such a power, so Monitor could never force an NHS hospital
to open a private wing.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000721">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall attempt to keep my comments brief. As
hon. Members know, clause 61 gives Monitor functions that the Office of
Fair Trading has under part 4 of the Enterprise Act 2002 in
respect of health services in England. Essentially, it will allow
Monitor to make market references to the Competition Commission if it
has reasonable grounds to suspect that any features of a market would
prevent, restrict or distort competition. I have two points to make on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000762">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, what is
a market in that regard? Does such a market cover a local geographical
area? I hope that the Minister will be able to explain what that would
cover. Could Monitor say that it requires a whole local area as a
market that it does not think there is enough competition in? Would
Monitor be able to refer what might be called a national market for
services? We know that the NHS commissioning board will be
commissioning national services. I think that the Minister very
helpfully clarified that when we had the debate on it. That was
probably only a few weeks ago, but it feels like many more. A whole
list of services is currently commissioned nationally, under the
specialised commissioning list. It includes such things as specialist
renal services, kidney treatment, treatment for people who have
pancreas problems and special cancer services. Would that be considered
as a market to which Monitor could refer, or might Monitor—as
David Bennett mentioned in one of his recent articles for either <em>The
Times</em> or the <em>Financial Times</em>—take diabetes care and
say that there was not enough competition in that system, and so on?
What is the market and will it be able to cover those different
areas?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000763">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second point relates to a more practical question. Hon. Members will be
aware that, although the Bill gives Monitor powers that the OFT has,
including the ability to refer to the Competition Commission,
the Government announced in October last year that the OFT
and the Competition Commission would merge. One new competition body
will investigate mergers, dominance and cartels. Another body will then
take on

                           </div>the OFT’s enforcement and consumer functions. The Government are
asking us, in the Bill, to agree to give Monitor functions and powers
to two organisations that will actually be abolished and merged into
two new bodies, when we do not know what the functions and powers of
those two bodies will be. When will we find out what those two new
bodies will be—when the OFT and the Competition Commission
merge? According to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,
the different functions are being looked at to decide whether to change
them in any way. Will those two new bodies have stronger functions and
different functions? How can we agree to a Bill that proposes giving
functions to bodies that are going to merge? I would appreciate clarity
on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000764">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Like the hon. Lady, I shall be relatively brief.
The clause gives Monitor powers to make market references to the
Competition Commission if it has reasonable grounds to suspect that
features of the market restrict, prevent or distort competition. That
could happen, for example, if a number of providers introduced systems
that made it difficult for patients to choose provider or move between
them, or for potential new providers to offer services to patients. In
such cases, the Competition Commission would investigate, and if it
found an adverse effect on competition, it would determine remedies to
address that. Monitor would undertake that function concurrently with
the OFT, and the Bill requires those bodies to consult each other when
first exercising that function, and not to make the reference if the
other body has already done so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000765">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Like clause
60, clause 61 does not create powers that do not already exist. It
simply provides for powers currently resting with the OFT to be
exercised by Monitor instead. We want to create a single regulator for
the health care sector, to provide clarity and a single focus of
expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000766">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked about what “a market” would cover. That would
cover a national market for specialised services—for example, a
regional market for elective hospital care, or a more local market for
long-term conditions. It would be up to Monitor to define those
conditions. I hope that the hon. Lady finds that
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000767">&#160;</a>

the merger of the OFT and the Competition Commission? When will that
merger take place and are the Government considering new powers for
those bodies? I assume that Monitor will take that on. It is an

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 490, in

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not know
whether the amendment is probing or not. Subsection (4), which the
amendment seeks to delete, gives Monitor the power to disqualify
directors for competition infringements, if they are in breach of the
Competition Act 1998. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that
those are the exact powers that the OFT has. I want to ask him some
questions, so that the matter can be clear and on the record for
Members, if they have the joy and pleasure of reading the <em>Hansard
</em>account of our proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000801">&#160;</a>

the accountable officer? Will it be the individual GP members of the
consortia or practice managers? Who will be considered responsible
directors for commissioning consortia? Similarly, for foundation
trusts, will that be the executive directors of the board, the
non-executive directors or the governors? Will the Minister please
clarify?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000802">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
would the implications be for directors if Monitor can have them
disqualified for competition infringements? Does the subsection imply
that there is any personal liability attached to the directors of any
health bodies now considered as undertakings? Are there financial
implications? If the Government propose that Monitor should have the
same powers as the OFT when it comes to disqualifying directors, we
need to know who they are and what that will mean for them. People
involved in running GP commissioning consortia and health service
providers would like to know what their personal, financial and other
responsibilities
are.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000803">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment proposes preventing Monitor from
applying to the courts for the disqualification of directors of
providers who infringe competition law.

                           </div>Evidence suggests that director disqualification, though rarely pursued
under the Competition Act 1998, provides an effective deterrent to
anti-competitive behaviour. It is vital for Monitor to have a range of
enforcement powers to address anti-competitive behaviour by providers,
so that it can protect the interests of patients and taxpayers. The
power provides a very strong sanction and would therefore be used to
address only the most serious breaches. I understand that the Office of
Fair Trading has used it only once.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000804">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
enforcement powers set out in the Bill are the same set available to
the Office of Fair Trading and other sectoral regulators. Indeed, the
OFT could currently apply to the courts for the disqualification of a
director of a provider of health care services, if it had breached
competition law. The Bill does not change the sanctions that can apply
to providers, so the hon. Lady was right to anticipate what I would say
on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000805">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked to whom the provision applies. It applies to directors
of companies and those in equivalent positions, such as senior staff in
NHS providers who perform a director-like role. She also asked from
where the power to disqualify directors comes. It does not come from
Monitor; it cannot disqualify. Only a court can disqualify a person,
and the relevant powers relate to breaches of the Competition Act 1998,
which will not apply to consortia when commissioning NHS
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000806">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can I clarify that? The provision will not apply
to GP commissioning consortia. I have already raised the fact that
there is some confusion about whether they will become undertakings.

clarify?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000807">&#160;</a>

come from; I am clear on that. I specifically asked who would be
considered directors. The final question I asked, to which I hope the
Minister will now reply, is: what would the implications be? Are there
any personal financial implications, and any personal levels of
responsibility? Could the provision apply to a whole board? I know that
the Minister said that the OFT has never used the
power—<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000809">&#160;</a>

people to whom she referred cannot be fined; there would be a
disqualification from the position. Unless I misheard her, the hon.
Lady also asked for the definition of directors within the providers.
The definition is a member of senior staff in an NHS provider who is
performing a director-like
role.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000812">&#160;</a>

Bill states that Monitor’s overriding duty will be to protect
and promote patients’ interests. The purpose of the regulations
mentioned in clause 63 is to ensure that commissioning processes enable
services to be delivered by the best providers; that any conflicts of
interest between commissioner and provider functions are appropriately
managed; and that choice for patients is promoted on the principle
“no decision about me without
me.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000849">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Competition
is not an end in itself. Amendments 498 and 499 clarify our intentions
and reduce any potential for misunderstanding by narrowing the scope of
regulation-making powers to remove the scope for regulations to include
requirements on commissioners to promote competition. We are replacing
that with strong and clear provision for regulations to include
prohibitions on anti-competitive
conduct.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000851">&#160;</a>

amendments remove any doubt about whether commissioners could be asked
to promote competition for competition’s sake. The sort of
anti-competitive conduct that we want to prohibit would include
behaviours such as: commissioners and providers agreeing to prevent the
entry of a new provider with a potentially higher-quality service;
collusion to fix prices; and agreements between commissioners and
providers to exclude existing providers from being offered to patients
under patient
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000852">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Having
clarified that the scope of Monitor’s powers will be limited to
addressing potential abuses, I come to Government amendments 500 and
501. It is important that Monitor has the appropriate investigative
powers. To that end, I propose that the Bill be amended to give Monitor
powers to carry out an investigation on its own initiative where it has
reasonable grounds to suspect that commissioners have failed to comply
with the prohibitions on anti-competitive conduct. For example, Monitor
could become aware of a pattern of service provision that suggested
that patients might be being directed to certain providers, or that
choice was not being offered. If it followed that up and found further
indications that that was the case, for example through discussions
with the local healthwatch, it could then have grounds to suspect that
commissioners were not complying with the regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000853">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The ability to
initiate investigations concerning anti-competitive behaviour is
important, as certain types of behaviour, such as the ones I have
described, are difficult for other providers or individual patients to
observe, and it is therefore difficult to make a complaint about it.
Moreover, the amendments will strengthen Monitor’s power to seek
out and address anti-competitive behaviour resulting from conflicts of
interest. Monitor will be able to require information from
commissioners to help it with its investigations. However, it may be
helpful if I clarify that we are not proposing that Monitor has the
power to access a commissioner’s premises and seize documents or
other
materials.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000854">&#160;</a>

a look at the matter under the new

                        <p class="tabbed">Opposition
amendment 492 would remove the express provision that regulations under
clause 63 could include requirements relating to competitive tendering.
Our intention is that effective regulation should provide a mechanism
for ensuring good procurement practice by commissioners, including in
their use of tendering. That is important because the use of
procurement in tendering has already been well established in the NHS,
including under the previous Government. Rules on tendering are already
set out in guidance to primary care trusts on procurement that was
introduced by the previous Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000857">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
regulations would ensure that requirements on commissioners to adhere
to good procurement practices, including in the use of tendering, are
clear and enforceable. However, it would be for the commissioners to
determine how best to make use of procurement to drive improvements for
patients. Our aim is simply to ensure that contracts for NHS services
are awarded to the best provider, or providers, and that patients have
greater choice and control of their area. It is in the best interests
of patients and the taxpayer for the scope of the procurement
regulations under clause 63 to include requirements relating to
tendering. For that reason, I urge my hon. Friends not to support
amendment 492 if the Opposition decide to put it to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000858">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let us be clear about what amendment
492 tries to do: it deletes subsection (3). Under the clause,
regulations can be introduced that would allow the Secretary of State
to require both the national commissioning board and local
commissioning consortia to do certain things, one of which, under
subsection 3(a), which we are trying to delete, is to
require them to put services out to competitive tender. In other words,
the provision allows the Secretary of State to say to the NHS
commissioning board and local commissioning consortia, “This is
what you must put out to tender.” If Government Members think
that is about decentralising power and control, I find that quite
astonishing. The provision allows the Secretary of State to direct the
national board and local commissioning consortia to put services out to
tender. I do not think that that is the right approach, which is why I
am pressing the amendment to a

                           </strong> The clause permits the Secretary of State to
regulate the procurement practices of the NHS commissioning board and
commissioning consortia, to ensure that they adhere to good practice in
procurement, protect and promote patient choice, and that they do not
act in a manner that would—or would be likely to—prevent,
restrict or distort competition in the provision of health care
services for those purposes. Such regulations may include requirements
to manage the commissioners’ conflicts of interest between their
interests in commissioning services and their interests in providing
them. For example, some GPs might be in a position to provide the
services that they commission through their commissioning consortium.
While they might be the best provider for a particular patient, we want
to ensure that patients are given the choice of provider, and that
alternative providers are given a fair chance to provide the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000895">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
63 also states that regulations may include requirements relating to
competitive tendering of clinical services. Where competitive tendering
takes place, we want to ensure that bad procurement practice, such as
excluding bidders unfairly, could be prevented. Our aim is to create a
presumption that all patients will have choice and control over their
care and treatment, and choice of any willing provider, wherever
appropriate. However, competitive tendering will continue to be
required for certain services, such as when patients have complex and
enduring needs that require a range of skills and resources. The clause
therefore ensures that commissioners use best procurement practice,
protect and promote patient choice, and promote competition in the
interests of patients. That will be key to driving up standards, and
the clause provides a mechanism for ensuring that it happens.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000896">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I also propose
to introduce, via new clause 7 and new schedule 2, a power to allow
Monitor to accept undertakings—that is, commitments—from
commissioners if they have breached regulations under clause 63.
Monitor could accept those undertakings in lieu of issuing a direction
or of declaring an arrangement ineffective. The 2006 report by Richard
Macrory, “Regulatory Justice: Making Sanctions
Effective”, stated that such undertakings represent a powerful
alternative to traditional coercive, regulatory enforcement action, and
have the potential to impose fit-for-purpose sanctions that are more
satisfying for both the offender and the victims of non-compliance. The
Bill already allows for Monitor to accept undertakings from providers
to remedy non-compliance with licence conditions. The amendment
provides for a similar power in respect of commissioners and
non-compliance with regulations made under clause
63.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000897">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
new clause 8 would place Monitor under a duty to set out how it would
apply regulations made under clause 63 to commissioners, by publishing
guidance. It would require Monitor to consult the NHS commissioning
board in doing that, and to seek approval for the guidance from the
Secretary of State. The duty would ensure that commissioners are clear
on the rules and the behaviour expected of them. I urge the Committee
to accept clause 63 and to accept, in due course, the new clauses and
new
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000898">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to try to put this in layman’s
terms. The provisions mean that not only can the new commissioning
consortia—there will be four in my area—be referred by
Monitor for behaving anti-competitively or for not putting services out
to tender, but that they can now be referred by the NHS commissioning
board as well. Is that not Government and policy by quangos, ordering
around the different
consortia?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000899">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is an important matter, but I will be brief.
Clause 64 gives various powers to Monitor, or it allows for
“regulations”—in other words, the Secretary of
State—to confer powers on Monitor. Let us be clear that there
will be no more proper discussion in Parliament. Clause 64(3)
says:<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000926">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Regulations

Monitor—<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">(a)

                        </p>
                        <p>Essentially,
clause 64(3) allows Monitor to say that a service provided for the NHS
is “ineffective”. There are so many questions that one
could ask about that, from very simple and immediate
questions—for example, how will Monitor determine what is
“ineffective”?—to the more fundamental question,
“Why on earth should it be up to Monitor to decide to declare an
NHS service ineffective?” For that reason, we have tabled the
amendment and we are seeking to delete the remainder of the clause,
because it should not be up to Monitor to decide
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000927">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall be equally brief. If amendment 493 is

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s intention in seeking delegated power to make
regulations under clause 63 is to establish clear requirements on
commissioners that would be binding and enforceable. To remove the
ability for those requirements to be enforced would be irresponsible.
Monitor needs credible sanctions to deter the types of behaviour that
would be bad for patients and taxpayers. I recognise that the majority
of GP commissioning consortia and the NHS commissioning board will
always seek to do their best for patients. Others may find themselves
on the wrong side of the rules, but will respond to a soft approach by
Monitor and these powers do not preclude Monitor from adopting a soft
approach. However, we need to ensure that there are powers in the
system to prevent the most damaging behaviour, such as referring
patients inappropriately to services that the commissioner has a direct
vested interest in. That type of action would result in poor outcomes
for patients and poor value for money. We cannot allow the regulations
to be ignored and we cannot allow that sort of behaviour to continue
unchallenged.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000929">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Earlier
in our discussions, the Government tabled an amendment that required
Monitor to publish guidance, with approval from the Secretary of State,
that sets out how it would apply its enforcement powers to breaches by
commissioning consortia and the NHS commissioning board. Without
enforcement powers, Monitor would be in the same toothless position as
the Co-operation and Competition Panel, which the previous
Administration established. That body can make investigations and
produce reports, but any actions that it recommends are subject to
decisions by the Secretary of State. To my mind, that situation is
completely inconsistent with having a transparent and independent
economic regulator. Therefore I strongly resist amendment
493.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000930">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The example that the Minister gives of the type of
“ineffective” behaviour that Monitor would seek to
intervene on appears to be an example of clearly

conflict of interests. Can he briefly say what else is considered to be

                           </strong> I might be able to help the hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">With the
extension of patient choice, however, the need for tendering would
diminish in any event. Moreover, the remaining powers for Monitor to
set aside a contract where there has been a serious breach
of the regulations and to direct the commissioner to put in place
measures to prevent or mitigate further breaches should provide
sufficient of a deterrent effect. Powers for Monitor to go further and
direct the commissioner to put services out to tender would be
unnecessary. It is for these reasons that I urge the Committee to
accept Government amendments 502 and 503, and to oppose
amendment
493.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000933">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will make my last comment of the day. I do not
like hyperbole, but I think that we are developing a Kafkaesque
nightmare of regulation and bureaucracy that is completely unnecessary.
The Government may want to see more competition and more diversity, but
they do not have to set up all these powers. It is extremely confusing
and extremely bureaucratic.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000934">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> A rather confusing situation has arisen. We have to
vote again on Government amendments 500 and 501, which were earlier
voted for unopposed, because I was a bit presumptuous. I should have
waited until after the debate on amendment 493, for reasons that I
obviously do not
understand.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000935">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of order, Mr Hancock. You say that you
are going to deal with Government amendments 500 and 501, but we have

                           </strong> I know, but the Clerk has told me that Government
amendments 500 and 501 were grouped with Government amendment 498 to
clause 63, but they are amendments to this clause. They should have
been called formally after clause 63 stand part. If we call them
formally now, we can then call amendment 493. We can take
the amendments together if that is the will of the
Committee—<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000937">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of order, Mr Hancock. I am trying to get
this right. We voted against the clause that had the amendments to it.
We have already voted against that clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181000938">&#160;</a>

archaic—or rather the way in which the amendments are tabled. It
is like voting at the end on things that have

way—the details were in front of me. I shall now give a full
explanation, and I shall do so quickly. The clause enables the merger
control regime for enterprises in the UK to be applied to mergers of
foundation trusts and mergers between foundation trusts and other
businesses. As I continue my explanation, the answer to the right hon.
Gentleman’s question will be
unveiled.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001000">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the clause, the OFT could make a reference to the Competition
Commission to review foundation trust mergers to test whether they gave
rise to a substantial lessening of competition. We want to ensure that
mergers of foundation trusts and mergers between foundation trusts and
others would go ahead if they did not cause a substantial lessening of
competition or if their impact on competition was offset by the
benefits that they would create.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001001">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We want to
prevent or address any adverse effects of mergers that do not create
benefits for patients and taxpayers, and which are detrimental to
competition and therefore to choice and long-term
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001002">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It will be for the convenience of the Committee if
I speak first. Clause 66 requires the Competition Commission to review
how competition in the provision of quality health care services is
developing and how Monitor is fulfilling its duties in relation to
competition. Reviews would be every seven years, with the first one
starting no later than the end of 2019. Other sectors do not have such
a review requirement, but we think it is particularly important for
health care services. It will enable the Competition Commission to
ensure that providers, commissioners, Monitor and the regulations that
apply to these bodies are working in a way that ensures that
competition is improving quality and working for patients and
taxpayers. The commission is required to publish reports on its reviews
within 12 months, and make recommendations where it finds
issues detrimental to the public interest. The Secretary of State,
Monitor and the commissioning board are required to respond to those
recommendations within six
months.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
would be sensible to periodically review how competition in the sector
is developing. The commission’s review will help show how the
market is developing in the interests of patients and taxpayers and how
Monitor is exercising its functions. The Competition Commission will be
able to make informed, independent judgments, including making
recommendations on any matters it had considered and concluded might
have effects adverse to the public interest.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose of
new clause 9 is to give the Competition Commission powers to collect
information to inform its reviews of the development of competition in
the provision of NHS services and the exercise by Monitor of its

                           </div>functions. It would have the ability to request information, but not to
undertake raids. It also encourages compliance by permitting the
Competition Commission to impose penalties where an organisation does
not comply with an information request. The powers are no more and no
less than those that the Competition Commission would otherwise have in
requiring information to inform market investigations. The
recommendations from the reviews will inform the development of policy
and the operation of regulatory processes. It is, therefore, vital that
the Competition Commission has the powers to collect the information
that it requires, for example from commissioning organisations and
providers of NHS
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001035">&#160;</a>

that I was not going to say anything else, but not for the first time

be clear; the provision says that the Competition Commission will carry
out a review on whether Monitor is promoting competition enough in the
NHS. The Minister has said that it will make informed decisions about
that. How will it do so? What health care knowledge does the

                           </strong> The Competition Commission is going to look at,
as the Minister has said, whether Monitor is promoting markets and
competition enough in the NHS. What knowledge does the Competition
Commission have about health and health care? We have enough problems
with Monitor and how democratically accountable it is to people for the
decisions it takes that will affect health care. Now we have the
Competition Commission reviewing and judging Monitor. We seem to have
layer upon layer of decisions that are made by undemocratic,
unaccountable bodies that do not know anything about health and health
care. It is not about devolving that power and responsibility.
Government Members—even the hon. Member for Broxtowe, who is not
really allowed to speak because she is a Parliamentary Private
Secretary—must question what this is all for. We seem to be
imposing layers and layers of bureaucracy. What knowledge or expertise
does the Competition Commission have about
health?<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001040">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a question about the review of competition.
I understand why the provision is there, but under clause 52 Monitor
has a duty to promote competition “where appropriate.”
Will that definition of “where appropriate” be taken into
account when the Competition Commission conducts its review? Clearly,
the Competition Commission could conduct a review of competition
throughout the NHS and decide that in certain areas it does not exist,
but that could be because Monitor has decided that competition in those
areas is inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001041">&#160;</a>

Friend, I will answer his question. Monitor’s duty, under clause
52, which he rightly refers to, is to promote competition where
appropriate. The Competition Commission would look at how that is being
interpreted, but there would be no bias for competition. It would only
be where it was
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103181001044">&#160;</a>
