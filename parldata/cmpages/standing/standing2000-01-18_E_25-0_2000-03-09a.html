<H4><center>Matters to be dealt with in charging schemes </center></H4>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 769, in page 84, line 30, leave out subsection (6) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(6) In setting the charges imposed by a charging scheme under this Part--
<P>
(a) the reasons for imposing different charges for different cases (as under subsection (5)) must be specified by the charging authority,
<P>
(b) regard may be had to the purpose for which any of the net proceeds of the charging scheme may be applied (in accordance with Schedule (11)).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that we are all looking forward to another day's debate on this important Bill. The amendment would ensure that the charging authority explained its reasons for setting differential charges. The charges may be different on particular days or at certain times of day, or they may relate to certain types of road and classes of vehicle or to distances travelled. The reasons for the decision should be made clear. The amendment gives the Government the opportunity to explain how the scheme would operate. We ask also that the charging authority should consider how to spend the money that is raised. As many of our debates have been about hypothection of revenues, we would like to know more about the sort of transport schemes would be considered and so forth.
<P>
Differential charges raise a number of questions. Will they be set according to the size or type of vehicle? Will they be based on a vehicle's emissions? Will a local authority be able to charge higher rates for older vehicles and vehicles that are less green? It is possible that a local authority could have a lower charging regime for its own residents than for outsiders. We have heard before of the difficulties of towns such as Bath that are visited by many tourists. I hesitate to say this, because the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is not present, but it is possible that Bath and North East Somerset unitary authority may set a better regime for its residents.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I have an interest in the matter as I live only two miles outside Bath, albeit within the Wiltshire county council area. If, as my hon. Friend suggests, Bath were to have a special regime for its residents, what arrangements would be made for the people of Colerne or Slaughterford, which is where I live, who have to travel by car because there is no public transport? Will those people be penalised under such a scheme?
<P>
<B> Mr. Syms:</B> Those are important questions. We need to know what scope authorities will have to vary charges. As we have heard, sensible arrangements could be made, but other arrangements could be made that may seem bizarre and cause difficulties. Local authorities in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) might wish to introduce a scheme that benefits local residents, but if those who live in the constituency of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) visit Northumberland, they may find that they are treated differently.
<P>
Those are important matters. We do not want to be too prescriptive, but if a local authority decides to set up a scheme, we want to ensure that it does not act in a way that causes difficulties for visitors to that authority area or town. I am sure that the Minister will want to reassure the Committee on those issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The amendment would achieve an aim as regards road and workplace parking charging that the Bill does not fulfil. The Opposition believe that the charges are wrong in principle, but that if they are to be imposed, they must have legitimacy and the public must be able to accept them. They will not do so for two reasons. First, they are a tax. Back-Bench Members may laugh, but they might be surprised in the London elections. Road charges will feature significantly in the campaigning, and whichever Mr. Dobson Labour Members support, their candidate may get a surprise because of the new taxes on London's drivers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that either in 1994 or 1995, the Conservative party proposed in a document about keeping London traffic moving the very charges that he is denouncing on its behalf?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Green Paper involved wide discussion. It would be surprising if my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir G. Young), for whom I worked as a special adviser when he was Secretary of State for Transport--[Interruption.] Of course, in those days there were a small number of special advisers and only highly qualified and highly intelligent people were allowed to do the job. Nowadays, more or less anyone can be a special adviser because there are so many of them, and the poor old civil servants have lost out. It would be surprising if my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire had not taken an interest in road pricing and other mechanisms considered for making transport in Britain better. The Labour party--then in opposition--would have criticised him heavily for not having considered them. However, we did not introduce road or workplace parking charging in our 18 years in power because we realised something crucial: those taxes did not have legitimacy in the eyes of the people.
<P>
I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. Gale, in allowing me to stray slightly. Legitimacy brings me back to the purpose of the amendment, which is intended to give what is otherwise an unacceptable taxation regime a degree of legitimacy in the eyes of people who will be paying for it. There will be a national uprising if people in London and elsewhere suddenly find a gantry over the road and have to pay £5 to get into town, which appears increasingly likely to happen as time wears on. The poll tax riots might pale into significance in comparison with outrage about the new poll tax on wheels and we intend to pin responsibility fairly and squarely on this poll-tax-raising Government.
<P>
The principle of the taxes was considered last week in a Second Reading debate, and we should not repeat that debate now. The Committee is aware of Conservative opposition to the taxes. Our purpose in tabling the amendments is to make a demonstrably bad Bill slightly better. The amendments are an attempt to tell people "This is why the Government are imposing motoring taxes on you. We do not agree with them, but we must try to find ways to make the policy as acceptable as possible. These proposals are ways of making it slightly better.
<P>
First, we must consider the way in which the congestion-charging tax will be varied. Last week, I referred to Singapore, where the charge is dependent on traffic speed. Sensors detect whether the traffic is moving fast--it can travel at up to 50 or 60 mph on the highways into Singapore--and if it is, the tax is almost zero. No charge is made at night for that reason, but the moment that the traffic slows down, the tax increases. That seems a perfectly sensible way to charge. We must think carefully about how to vary the tax and how to ensure that it is paid when congestion is at a maximum and not at other times. A simple way to do so would be to set hours and to require payment between 6 am and 10 am, but that might not work on bank holidays, for example. Will the mechanism be clever enough to turn the machine off on a bank holiday Monday, or might I suddenly find myself paying for the privilege of driving into London on Christmas day, with no other cars on the road? Careful thought must be given to the way in which the tax might be varied depending on the speed of traffic.
<P>
My hon. Friend mentioned an important point. If we are moving into an era of encouraging drivers to use particular cars, especially electric or gas-driven "green" cars, there should be a way of using tax to add to incentives. The grading of tax according to engine cubic capacity has hardly worked as an incentive because so few cars are exempt from the higher rate of vehicle excise duty, although that rate could be increased. The use of the new tax might encourage people to use "green" cars.
<P>
The crucial question concerns who might pay the tax and who might be exempt. So far, the Government have got themselves into a muddle. They have said that people who work in national health service hospitals should not pay, but have chosen not to exempt anyone else. They have avoided the question by having the blanket escape clause of saying that they will leave it up to local authorities. The same rules should apply to everyone, not just to NHS workers.
<P>
Either the Government should lay down national guidelines on who would be exempt from the charges, or they should leave the question entirely to local authorities. However, if they do that, they will get differences between local authorities. One authority might say that orange badge holders need not pay and another might say that they do. What will an orange badge holder do when he moves from one local authority area to another and discovers that he has to pay when, previously, he did not? A local authority might legitimately ask why a highly paid consultant at the Royal and United hospital in Bath should be exempt. It would be fine for a trainee nurse to be exempt, but not for the senior consultant at the hospital when he comes into work from my constituency. The question of exemption--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I detect that the weekend has already started in some quarters. Might we try to settle and to concentrate on the debate, please?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I fear that I was not gripping them; I shall try my best to do so. The question of exemptions is important.
<P>
We have considered the legitimacy of the tax. It will not gain legitimacy if people do not know what the money is spent on. I alluded to that central issue last week in my three philosophical reasons why the tax was wrong, which the Minister, for Housing and Planning tried to dismiss offhandedly. The Government have airy-fairily said, "Don't worry, it will all be hypothecated and spent on public transport. We shall tax you into the ground to get you off the roads"--the tax take must be large to achieve that. Further, they have said, "Tough luck if you are poor, disabled or on a low wage and so unable to drive; everything will be okay because we will put all the money in a big pot and spend it on public transport." The Minister has admitted that the sum raised in an area from the congestion charge might not cover the costs of public transport improvements there. Such improvements will have to be paid for from a pot including money from the fuel duty escalator, local congestion charges and central Government.
<P>
Political decisions and Whitehall civil service decisions will be taken on where the money is to be spent. We might have a punitive tax in Bath, but it might be decided that the beauty of the buildings means that a light rapid transit system is not appropriate for the city. The money raised might then be spent elsewhere because the Government would not pump in enough extra money from the fuel duty escalator pot to build a monorail around the Royal crescent. The hon. Member for Bath ought to intervene; I should assure him that I am not seriously proposing that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster (Bath):</B> Wash your mouth out!
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Yes, I should.
<P>
The problem with hypothecation is that the money might not be spent where it is raised. I live two miles outside Bath, where congestion is simply appalling. The charge would have to be stringent to make the traffic use the side roads, which is possible only if one knows the roads. The charge in Bath would have to be high, but it is difficult to know whether the money raised there would be used on new public transport systems to encourage those who live in villages down the tiny Cotswold lanes in my constituency to use them. The bus fare from Corsham to Bath is £3.40 each way. Corsham is the only town that is near enough to Bath to have a bus service; the rest of my constituents live in tiny villages with no public transport. [Interruption.]
<P>
9.15 am
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have said this once and I will not do so again. Hon. Members are here to listen to the debate. Any hon. Member who does not wish to hear 945 946 what is being said has every opportunity to go outside to conduct their private conversations. The Chairman wishes to hear what the hon. Member who has the floor--from whichever side of the Committee--is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is important for people to know that those who are being taxed will benefit from that taxation. The Boston tea party shows what can happen when people have taxation without representation and without seeing a return. The people of Slaughterford, my home village, will have to pay through the nose in tax to go to Bath when they cannot use public transport--buses cannot replace the motor car because that small village is reached by a five-mile, single-track lane--so that someone in Bath, or even Bristol, can benefit from improvements to public transport. The only possible benefit for the people of Slaughterford might be a park-and-ride scheme. That has often been considered, but the streets of Bath are such that, for the eastern borders in particular, it is not believed that it would be any great advantage.
<P>
The amendments are designed to do two things. First, we want to improve the way in which the tax works. Secondly, we want to establish who should pay it. That is a vital matter, which we shall discuss again. At the moment, the tax is a blunt instrument and it is desperately unpopular. Thirdly--we are trying to help the Government--we want to give this unpopular tax, this poll tax on wheels, some legitimacy. We are trying to improve it so that people will not be so harsh on the Government in the forthcoming London mayoral elections and in the next general election, which must be held within two years. We are giving the Government the opportunity to make the tax less damaging.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> We are approaching the part of the Bill that deals with charging schemes, so I shall give a brief overview of the contents of clauses 147 and 148.
<P>
Clause 147 sets out the practical measures that must be dealt with in charging schemes, such as designating the roads to be charged. Clause 148 deals with exemptions from charges. The clause requires any road user charging scheme to designate which roads are included in the scheme, explain what event triggers a charge, and set out the types of vehicles to be charged and the charges that apply. Those are the details about which the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) justifiably inquired.
<P>
The clause requires that charges must apply to using a vehicle as well as to "keeping" it or parking it on the road. The reference to "keeping" is necessary, as it will allow authorities to enforce schemes against parked as well as moving vehicles. That will allow permits in parked vehicles in a charging scheme area to be checked.
<P>
Clause 147 ensures that the road charging powers cannot be used to impose additional parking charges in an area. The clause also allows a charging scheme to provide for how a charge is to be recorded or paid. In practical terms, that means whether a charge is paid and collected in cash at toll points, or requires a paper licence, or is recorded and paid electronically. Schemes may require documents or licences to be displayed or equipment to be installed in vehicles. Those are all options because, as hon. Members know, such schemes can operate in several different ways.
<P>
Charging authorities will also be able to apply different charges for different types of vehicle, different days or times of the day, and different roads in a charging scheme. That will allow flexibility, for example, for charges to apply at peak congested times only, or for evenings and weekends to be uncharged. That point was raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) who produced a slightly fanciful image of charging schemes operating on Christmas day. Of course there will be the flexibility to turn the machines off: the hon. Gentleman might not live in an age in which it is possible to turn off devices, by means of a switch or even a time switch that can be set in advance, but the rest of us are familiar with such technology. In the age of e-commerce, it is fanciful to imagine that such machines cannot be turned off. I give way to the old-fashioned and honourable Member for North Wiltshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> In the best traditions of the House, I shall not say anything rude about the condescending way in which the Minister responded to the points that I raised.
<P>
Of course the machines can be switched off, but that is not the point. We are setting national guidelines for what local authorities should or should not do. Are we telling local authorities to charge people only when congestion is at its worst, or are we telling them to maximise their revenue by charging as much as they like, whenever they like, in which case some local authorities--no doubt those controlled by the Labour party--will charge people all the time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As we shall establish as we scrutinise the Bill, substantial discretion will--rightly--rest with local authorities because they are best placed to decide how schemes should be tailored to meet local circumstances. However, the Bill includes provision to ensure that there will be full consultation with all interested parties locally, so that decisions are taken on the basis of a proper appraisal of local needs and after bodies representing local interests have had a full opportunity to express their views. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Not even slightly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In that case, the hon. Gentleman clearly takes a somewhat different view of local democracy than I do. I suspect that he spent too much time in the company of his colleagues at Westminster city council, who are tempted to pursue policies whose primary objective is to raise revenue, rather than to meet traffic and parking objectives. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we expect the majority of authorities to take a responsible view of the traffic and parking needs of their areas and not to be motivated primarily by a desire to raise revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister makes an important point, even if it is not included in the Bill, bearing in mind that Hansard can now be used in a court of law and that, therefore, the Minister's words are binding. The Minister says that he expects local authorities to raise those taxes primarily for environmental reasons and to deal with congestion. Therefore, if we find, three years from now, that local authorities are using the provision not for environmental reasons, but to raise revenue--for example by charging £10 on Christmas day--will he condemn their action?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not paid attention to our consideration of previous clauses, which make it clear that any charging scheme must be introduced in the context of a local authority's transport plan. Therefore, any authority that did not do that would merit condemnation. That is fundamental to the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend the Minister. As former leader of the largest London borough, I should say that in setting parking charges, we would evaluate both the environmental impact and, more importantly, the competitive economic impact. If the rates were too high in comparison with Kingston and Bromley, that would have an impact on our business community, whom we would consult on the charges. That would be a blueprint for best practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling point. Local authorities will have regard, not only to immediate traffic issues, but to competitive issues that apply in any situation where there is not a monopoly--and in most local authorities there is not. Thought must be given to the impact of any charging scheme on the demand for services and shops located in the area.
<P>
Clause 148 allows for exemptions from charges and reduced rates. It provides a regulation-making power that can be used to require all charging schemes to include common exemptions. Hon. Members will have seen our response to the consultation paper "Breaking the Logjam". In England, we propose to use that power to provide an exemption for emergency vehicles and some form of exemption for disabled motorists. We shall develop proposals with experts and representative groups and consult further but, as I said, local authorities will be able to include their own exemptions and concessions according to local circumstances.
<P>
Despite the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Poole, the amendment is not necessary. Any charging scheme will be a key feature of a local authority's transport plan. The approval of schemes by the appropriate national authority will provide a safeguard to ensure that schemes are fair and equitable and that they contribute to local transport objectives. I have no doubt that a local authority would want to make the reasons for a particular charging scheme and charging structure clear to local people and businesses. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) is absolutely germane to this matter. Business communities should be aware of the impact of any charging scheme in their area and would certainly make forcible representations to the local authority if the scheme raised concern about adverse effects on economic prospects. The points I have outlined would all be part of the consultation on details of the scheme that we want to happen before any scheme is approved.  Consequently, we do not believe that the Bill needs to specify the details in the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire has undergone a remarkable transformation during the Committee's sittings. He promoted himself early on as a humble lance-corporal. I admit that the departure of the field marshal has given him aspirations for promotion, and the absence of the subaltern has perhaps encouraged that even more, but in the past two sittings he has presented himself as the philosopher king.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): Does my hon. Friend have King Canute in mind by any chance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I make no observations about the likelihood of a political flood sweeping through North Wiltshire and ensuring the removal of the hon. Gentleman at the next general election. I will instead confine my remarks to an observation on his curious amnesia about the previous Government's position and, indeed, his part in the relevant process, given that he confirmed to the Committee that he was a special adviser.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): The hon. Member for Cotswold lanes earlier said that he was not stupid, but does my hon. Friend agree that it is not sensible to use such pejorative terms about legislation introduced by one's own party? We have been reminded that it was the Tory terror of the poll tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes an exceptionally good point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> We did away with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The triumphant response of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is that his party devised the scheme and his party did away with it.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Perhaps I may remind my hon. Friend that yesterday was Ash Wednesday and the day for confessions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am only sorry that we are not meeting on that day, but a belated confession from the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is welcome.
<P>
The previous Government issued a Green Paper that made it clear that they saw the case for charging schemes and that they believed that local authorities could best determine how to devise schemes for local circumstances. That is all on the record. We are pursuing this course of action because it is sensible. The Conservatives may have changed their minds, but we believe that the arrangement should be in place to enable local authorities to introduce schemes.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire doubted whether the money would be spent where it was raised. The hypothecation arrangement provides for the money to be spent where it is raised or outside an authority's area if it is for the area's benefit. The nightmare scenario of his constituents not benefiting from a charging scheme in the Bath area would depend not simply on the foresight of the hon. Member for Bath in ensuring that it applies more widely, but on Bath city council taking up the option that is provided in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I did not make myself clear. My main concern was not that the money would not be spent elsewhere, but that unless the Government top up the money from central funds, such as the tax from the fuel duty escalator, the charge would not raise enough for necessary public transport improvements. For example, a monorail in Bath would cost vastly more than the council could raise from the city's traffic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> All of those are matters for local analysis, but it seems that the hon. Gentleman may have to repent again. His reference to the Government topping up funds implied the use of Government expenditure, but that might not be compatible with the tax guarantee that his party is making such a fuss about. I advise him to be careful before asking for additional Government expenditure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> So that it can be on record, the Minister referred to Bath city council. More than 10,000 of my constituents recently signed a petition in favour of re-establishing that council. There is no such council and they will be delighted that the Minister has given an idea of how his Department will react to the petition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I immediately recognised the slip of the tongue. The local authority is Bath and North-East Somerset council--"Banes" as it is sometimes known, which brings to mind a "baneful" experience. When I visited the area, the hon. Gentleman took me on one of the most hair-raising experiences of my life. I hesitate to expand on that, but as there is an appetite for amplification, and because it might be germane to road-user charges, I shall describe my visit to the hon. Gentleman's constituency.
<P>
I inspected the former stone mines on the outskirts of Bath, which produced the stone that built many of the city's fine terraces and crescents. The deterioration of the props that support the mines means that there is a risk of a collapse, which might destroy the local roads on which buses and vehicles travel, so having an impact on road-user charging. The experience was hair-raising, but the Government have responded and are working with Bath and North-East Somerset council to secure a satisfactory outcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. On hypothecation and what would happen to the money raised from congestion charging, he reassured the hon. Member for Bath that it could be spent outside an area, which might be on something that is unrelated to the scheme. For example, some authorities struggle to provide school transport. A local authority might ring fence money from a charging regime for public transport which it has decided includes school transport. That might not directly benefit the area from which the charges are raised. I spent 14 years on a local authority and know that they look for ways to use money to the best effect, which is not necessarily in ways that the Government intend.
<P>
We are concerned about the variation of a scheme. In a pure local democracy, each local authority would decide what it wanted, but several schemes in one area that are run on a different basis could be confusing. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 751, in page 84, line 34, leave out paragraph (a).
<P>
We do not need to dwell on the amendment. It reflects our concern that schemes should be electronic rather than paper based. As schemes will encompass parked cars, I accept that some form of identification might need to be stuck on windscreens. There needs to be a way of recognising that a vehicle is part of a scheme.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I understand the reason for the amendment and hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Road user charging can be undertaken in a number of ways. An electronic charging scheme, such as the scheme in Singapore, is one possibility. Paper-based charging that requires a paper disk or permit to be displayed on a vehicle's windscreen before entering a charged area or driving on a road where charges apply is another. We are firmly of the opinion that local authorities should decide whether either of those options is suitable for their area in light of local circumstances.
<P>
There will be an option to adopt paper-based schemes. Only one such scheme is anticipated so far. Derbyshire county council, in conjunction with the Peak national park, is developing a paper-based scheme for important but limited traffic flows through the park. It is feasible to expect vehicles to stop at the edge of the park and purchase a paper document to permit entry. However, we expect few--if any--other road charging schemes to be introduced within the span of four to five years, by which time the normal mode of charging should be by electronic means. The technology is expanding rapidly.
<P>
Before I came to the Committee, I refreshed my memory of the briefing that I received in Singapore last autumn. As Committee members who have visited that lovely island are aware, the electronic road pricing system is operated by gantries. The Singaporean authorities expect to move rapidly towards using the global positioning satellite system to operate the road user charging regime. We also expect to move quickly towards that system. Information on whether motorists have paid a charge will be conveyed by satellites and computers, but the obvious evidence of subscription to the scheme will be a highly visible in-vehicle unit--a so-called IU. The unit will be installed above the dashboard, as it is in Singapore.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not expect to see a proliferation of paper. We expect that the charges will, to all intents and purposes, operate through in-vehicle units and other electronic means.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Will cost be a factor in the consideration of schemes? One can think of a variety of paper and electronic means of running schemes. Some will be expensive because of equipment, others because of administration. On Tuesday, the Under-Secretary mentioned that Westminster council grossed £101 million from parking but that half of it was spent on employing traffic wardens, emptying parking metres and so on. That is a high proportion, and we should be concerned about such costs, especially if the idea of schemes is not only to manage but to ring fence money raised for public and other alternative means of transport. Schemes could chew up money if people have to collect cash in booths because some drivers do not have proper equipment.
<P>
A few weeks ago. I was in New York. Passage through some of the tunnels into Manhattan is charged for by using barcodes on the front of cars. However, if the barcode is not displayed or one is driving a different vehicle, one must pay $5, $3 or whatever other sum in cash at a toll booth. All schemes have scope for employing people to cover various aspects of charging. If motorists are paying for driving, their money should not go into a giant employment scheme, but should be put back into public transport, as is intended. If a high percentage of the cost of a scheme is incurred by administration, the benefit of the revenue raised will be minimal.
<P>
Technology is advancing. An authority may want to introduce a paper-based scheme but then become aware of the benefit of an electronic equivalent that requires further expenditure, changes and expense. Once an authority starts to pursue a scheme, will it have to stick with it? For example, an authority might want to abandon a scheme if a brilliant and revolutionary satellite were invented in the year after its introduction, which would incur additional costs. Will the Under-Secretary reassure me on that point, either now or in writing? Will guidelines be provided? Local authorities might introduce schemes that raise £5 million a year, but two thirds of that money may not be spent in the manner intended by the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I have to reprove the hon. Gentleman. He was present on Tuesday afternoon--I know that from Hansard. He spoke at 4.30 pm and I responded at approximately 4.50 pm. I spoke about administration costs, but the hon. Gentleman was obviously not paying attention. To assist him, I shall briefly reiterate the major points. To some extent, schemes' costs are not a matter for speculation. The Government commissioned the so-called ROCOL--or Review of Charging Options for London--study, to provide an estimate of the implementation costs of introducing a road user charge scheme or a workplace parking levy scheme for cental London. In a nutshell, ROCOL's report, which was produced at the end of last year, suggests that a workplace parking levy scheme in central London would cost £5 million to introduce and £5 million a year to operate and enforce, and would be expected to yield proceeds of £90 million to £110 million. The operating costs would therefore be 5 per cent. It was estimated that it would cost between £30 million and £50 million to introduce a road user charging scheme--that refers, incidentally, to a paper-based road charging scheme. It would cost about the same amount per year to operate. The expected revenue from charges would be £260 million to £320 million, so operating costs would be about 14 per cent. of gross revenue.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole raised an important point in arguing that the administration costs of the schemes should not be great enough to undermine their beneficial effects. On the evidence so far, it appears that significant proceeds would be available for all the good things that congestion charging schemes can provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for reminding us that Londoners will have to pay something like £500 million a year as a result of these taxes.
<P>
Did the ROCOL study examine the capital costs of installing electronic congestion charging? Surely, the capital cost of setting up the gantries or the GPS system would be enormous and would take many years to repay. That certainly happened in Singapore.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> ROCOL's remit was to consider a paper-based scheme, but the report includes estimates of the costs of introducing electronic road charging. I do not have the figures to hand, but will write to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee on the matter. The ROCOL report was published this week and has been deposited in the Library, so it is immediately available for consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I apologise for delaying the Committee; I had hoped to intervene again in the Under-Secretary's remarks before he sat down.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Poole made an important point. If the cost of introducing or administering the schemes is so great that it is barely covered by the revenue generated--I can imagine that happening in certain English towns and cities--what is the point of the exercise? The Minister responded rather rudely by telling my hon. Friend that he had not been listening. He had been listening to what was said on Tuesday about the ROCOL report and a paper-based scheme. However, earlier in his remarks the Minister said that the scheme would be, not a paper-based but electronic--either gantries of GPS. Therefore, it is wrong to tell the Committee, "Do not worry, chaps. The ROCOL report has shown that the paper-based scheme will cost hardly anything." The Under-Secretary must provide detailed and specific costings, from Singapore or elsewhere, for installing gantries and maintaining the satellite overhead--or leasing satellite time from the United States, which owns most of the satellites. The figures should explain how much revenue would be raised from the schemes to pay the costs.
<P>
Another gap can be perceived in the Under- Secretary's philosophical approach to the matter. Let us imagine that the total revenue raised is precisely the same as the cost of installing the scheme. That would not be beneficial for the installation of new transport systems through hypothecation, as the Government are describing. None the less, if schemes are to be introduced only to reduce congestion and not to raise revenue, one could imagine a situation in which swingeing taxes were introduced in London, costing an enormous sum to administer, which would clear the roads so that my friends in the City could zip through in their Rolls-Royces. The Government seem determined to allow that.
<P>
The Government's thinking again seems muddled. They must tell us the administration costs and whether the revenue will cover them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall happily give way--I always enjoy the hon. Gentleman's interventions. They are helpful to our side, so I am grateful to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman making an intervention or a speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am making a speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not for anyone other than the Chairman to rule. The Under-Secretary sat down and the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is making a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale. I said at the beginning of my remarks that I had hoped to intervene on the Under-Secretary but that I would have to detain the Committee for longer because he had sat down. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central was obviously not listening. I would be happy to give way to him because every word that he says is so helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there will be an opportunity to use off-the-peg technology systems from Singapore and elsewhere, and that unit costs are likely to fall? Does he also accept that the figure of £50 million in administration costs for Westminster, albeit for the labour-intensive system of people walking around looking at cars rather than a congestion-charging system, is high? That seems to be an example of bad value and Tory management. The UnderSecretary should study again the costs being incurred in Westminster and consider whether different suppliers should be used to reduce them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> As usual, the hon. Gentleman is helpful. He correctly said that the unit costs might fall as more schemes were introduced and as technology developed. If every city in Britain had a system, the costs might fall to extremely low levels. Paper-based systems, such as Westminster's, might be too expensive; the Under- Secretary should perhaps study the costs. We have no idea about the costs of introducing the plans apart from the ROCOL scheme, which does not address electronic charging.
<P>
The Government have reminded us that the damaging tax regime will cost £500 million. Before they introduce it and hammer the citizens of London, they should let us know the costs of introduction and what the profits will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> The hon. Gentleman would do well to do his homework; satellite-tracking and messaging systems have been running commercially for many years, in Scandinavia in particular, for as little as £1 a day. We are talking specifically about charging. Will the hon. Gentleman not accept that there are commercial advantages to having such in-car technology for security, fuel consumption or communications, for example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making my point--that is what we are saying. The systems might cost as little as £1 a day, but the Government have not told us one piece of information about costs, The Under-Secretary offhandedly said that I should study the ROCOL report, which is in the Library, even though he also said that it had no relevance to electronic charging.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) might be right to say that the system costs nothing, and the hon. Member for Croydon, Central might be right to say that the unit costs will be lower if there are lots of schemes. Everything might be tickety-boo and fantastic but before the Under-Secretary starts charging Londoners £500 million--[Interruption.] The Under-Secretary mentioned £120 million in installation costs and subsequent costs of between £300 million and £400 million; from the top of my head, I calculate that to total £500 million.
<P>
The Under-Secretary should correct me if I have the figures wrong and if the cost will be lower, but that is what I understood him to say. He should tell us the total cost to Londoners, to the people of Bath and to others. How much does he intend to raise from the swingeing new taxation system--this poll tax on wheels? If £500 million is not the correct figure, let him tell us how much it will be. We need to know what the cost of raising the tax will be. So far, the Under-Secretary's answer has been woefully inadequate. He said that the ROCOL report contained all that we need to know, but it does not. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have raised important points about the fact that that system could be cheaper than the paper-based system, but we simply do not know at the moment. It is incumbent on the Government to produce detailed and extensive evidence about the cost of installing and running the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): My hon. Friend is talking about the cost of setting up the systems and, as he is extremely well informed on the matter, I hope that he can advise me. If we use an electronic system that involves gantries rather than GPS, which does not involve fixed structures, what will be the administrative cost of setting up gantries, including the cost of obtaining planning permission? I wonder what the hon. Member for Bath would say about gantries being placed on the wonderful Georgian crescents and terraces of Bath. Will not huge additional costs be incurred?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point on two grounds. First, gantries are huge pieces of metal placed across the road with notices on them and they are environmentally very unattractive. They might not look that great in many of our historic towns and cities. Secondly, the cost of installing gantries will be extremely high, especially in a complicated town. They would be easy to put in place in the City of London, where the ring of steel was set up reasonably easily, but to put up gantries to prevent people from entering London or to surround the whole island of Singapore, as someone mentioned last week, would require gantries over hundreds of roads. I believe that implementation of the gantry-based system is being considered in Bristol, but hundreds of gantries would be required to prevent cars from going into the city unless rat-running is to be encouraged.
<P>
In Singapore, it was decided not to use gantries on small roads to encourage rat-running. The authorities there want to get cars off the main entry points and into downtown business areas and they think that it is fine if cars go down side roads. They are content with that, although they are expanding the gantry system. It would be unacceptable if all the small streets in London suddenly became clogged with traffic because gantries had been installed on main roads. Therefore, it would be necessary to put a gantry on almost every road and the capital cost would be extraordinarily high.
<P>
If that analysis is incorrect, it is incumbent on the Government to let the people know how much it will cost to introduce the system and how much it will cost to run thereafter. The Government's answer so far has been inadequate. I hope that the Minister will let us know in detail--this afternoon, or next week--how much it would cost to install a gantry system, to run it and to lease satellite time for a GPS system. Only then can we balance the income of half a billion pounds from the people of London, to which the Minister admitted today, against the net cost of running the scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): We are focusing too much on examples of places with relatively small populations. The hon. Member for Eccles cited Scandinavia, and I know that some hon. Members have been to Bergen and Oslo, where fairly small populations are very loyal to a particular town. Not many people in Bergen would try to drive into the Oslo system and there are relatively few roads into Bergen, so it is easy to cut it off with a gantry or even a GPS system.
<P>
There has been too much emphasis on Singapore, which is a fairly small place with 600,000 to 700,000 vehicles, a population of 4 million and not that many roads into the city centre. Even there, they have trouble with their system, which pushes congestion into what my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire called rat runs along smaller roads. This country would have to have a manual or paper system because many people drive all over the country. We have heard the example of Leicester. People in Scotland would not be natural candidates to receive a postal shot from Leicester council asking them to apply for a transponder for their windscreen. If they came down from Edinburgh on business and wanted to enter the congestion scheme zone, they would presumably have to pay through a manual, paper system. As I see it, there will have to be some sort of intrusive checkpoint on every road into Leicester, of which there must be many hundreds.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A larger city, such as Birmingham, which I am sure is one of the Government's targets in their campaign to encourage people on to public transport by taxation, offers a kaleidoscopic variety of permutations for entering the centre. How will my constituents in Shropshire, who may go to Birmingham once or twice a year, get there? Will they receive an expensive mail shot from the Birmingham authorities? I suspect that they will find a back road that they know well and they will get round the system as I believe that the Government intend to place the entry points only on the main highways. It is a massive practical problem and I want to know if the Government have a clue about the answer to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will gladly respond to the debate. I had sat down to allow the hon. Member for North Wiltshire to intervene, Mr. Gale, but that is no fault of yours. We have heard an extremely helpful exchange.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In that case, I apologise because both the hon. Gentleman and I understood the Minister to have sat down. If I had thought otherwise, I would have curtailed the intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I may have reproved the hon. Member for Poole, but the last thing that I want you to imagine is that I am reproving you, Mr. Gale. That would certainly not be in my interests, or anyone else's.
<P>
I begin to regret trying to be so helpful to the Committee by supplying some figures on this matter. Earlier this week, I commented on the dangers of the helpful, friendly intervention from one's own side. We have paid the penalty of kindness in the exchanges that we just heard.
<P>
Opposition Members bandied around some absurd sums of money, none of which I recognise. Costs will be associated with the introduction of schemes, but in Oslo and Singapore the installation costs have not been prohibitive and the schemes have obviously worked well. There, they have used physical systems--toll booths in Oslo, gantries in Singapore. The expectation is that, in the introduction of electronic road pricing, we are most likely to move rapidly not to physical but to satellite systems such as GPS. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles for his expert intervention on this matter and for saying how cheap these systems will be to operate.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire, in painting a horrific picture of the blight that would result from the large-scale introduction of gantries into London and other cities answered his own question. The electronic road charging systems that we are likely to use in this country will almost certainly be based on satellite technology. Technology is advancing very fast, but that environmentally benign system is the one that is most likely to be introduced. I have obviously given Opposition Members food for thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, no; we have heard a great deal from the hon. Member for Salop North, and I certainly intervene on him from time to time. However, it is always a delight to hear the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth).
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. However, I am sure that it is a great delight to the Committee also to hear my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). He makes a great contribution to our proceedings.
<P>
I have not had the benefit of visiting Singapore. I am merely a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee. We go no further than Winson Green prison, so I have not had the opportunity to see what happens in Singapore. Is 957 958 the Minister suggesting that if the scheme is applied nationwide, the people of major provincial towns would not need to fear the introduction of gantries because the Government expect the technology to be GPS driven?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is not for the Government to lay down the nature of local schemes. To that extent, the answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire is encompassed in the fact that, as we make clear in the Bill, it will be wholly a matter for local authorities to decide. In the hon. Gentleman's terminology, there is no question of the Government imposing a particular scheme. For obvious reasons, we shall encourage interoperability between schemes. However, it is not for the Government to propose detailed schemes or to impose solutions on local authorities. They are all matters for local authorities to consider before they propose schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> How does a small authority such as Telford or Leicester cope with motorists who come from distant parts of the United Kingdom? They are most unlikely to apply to be part of the scheme. The locals who regularly go to those towns will obviously find that GPS is much the best system. But how will those people be charged who come everv day from other parts of the country?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> If they regularly come from elsewhere--
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> No!
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that they come in every day. I shall deal with that point.
<P>
If they come in everv day, the obvious solution would be for them to have an in-vehicle unit fitted. Although, for the purposes of the hon. Gentleman's argument, paper systems are rather easier to implement, if people make only occasional but expected visits to the city or town, they can do what foreign-registered vehicles are expected to do when they visit Singapore. In an island state such as Singapore, any outside vehicle is by definition a foreign-registered vehicle. Visitors have detachable in-vehicle units fitted that can be removed when they leave the island. It is not a complex process. When the hon. Member for North Shropshire next visits Singapore, I can recommend the Hong Bee company as absolutely the place to have the unit fitted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Under-Secretary has made my point for me. There is only one entry point into Singapore. which is the causeway from Johore Behru. It is easy to catch every Malaysian truck or van entering the country. A temporary transponder can be fixed to that vehicle before it is allowed into Singapore. It is easy: it is an island state and it is not very big. I am concerned about people who legitimately want to travel from Scotland or Lancashire through the middle of Birmingham or Telford. They are unlikely to have received the mail shot--the Under-Secretary has not touched on that issue--or an application to join the GPS system. The only way to catch those people is to operate a physical system, which means placing a gantry or entry point on every road into those towns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I think not. The hon. Gentleman does not take into account the fact that when authorities seriously consider the schemes in the next few years, there will be greater public awareness of the introduction and implementation of the workplace parking levy and road user charging schemes. It is unlikely that visitors from Scotland to the west midlands will be unaware of the road user charging scheme. There will be clear provision for them to acquire the necessary documentation for a paper-based scheme or physical apparatus--an in-vehicle unit--for an electronic scheme. The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that concern, but the problems are not insuperable to the human mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We have just heard a remarkable suggestion. If a person wants to travel through England to Edinburgh in a few years time, he will have to plan his route weeks in advance and apply to each local bureaucracy to get a permit or electronic tag to enter every town. Is the Under-Secretary serious? He has not addressed the practical realities. Local authorities will obviously not be able to send out mail shots to every citizen. That is possible in a little place like Singapore, which has a population of 4 million, but it is not possible in a nation of 58 million people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it is not possible, but the reality is different. The schemes will be introduced for two reasons. First, local people will find them attractive for environmental reasons and, secondly, they will bring significant investment to local transport. Increasingly, the schemes will operate in our cities. We expect local authorities to choose electronic schemes and we anticipate, as the schemes become universal, that cars and other road vehicles will automatically be fitted with in-vehicle units. If they are not, motorists will increasingly decide to have a unit on board. The technology is simple. Either a cashcard is charged up, inserted into the unit and the charge is automatically deducted, or a monthly bill is sent for all charges incurred. The technology is exciting, but it is not rocket science. I am certain that local authorities and motorists will be able to cope.

<P>

<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Is the Minister giving way to me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, but then I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke).
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Under-Secretary is relying on human ingenuity to resolve the problem--which is not unreasonable given the ingenuity of this country's people--and it is fair to say that many cars will be fitted with GPS, but how is the visitor from Scotland who was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire to know that there is a charging system when he arrives at Birmingham in a 1995 Mondeo that is not equipped with the GPS system? If there are no sanctions or physical barriers, how will authorities distinguish between those vehicles that are fitted with GPS and those that are not?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Gantries might be used in an electronic scheme, although we suspect that satellite technology will be more popular. However, in all circumstances, clear notices will be positioned on approach roads to alert motorists to the fact that they are entering a road user charging system. If the hon. Member for Aldershot is patient, he will see that that is provided for in later clauses. It will be made clear to motorists who enter areas that operate paper-based schemes that it is necessary to acquire documentation to subscribe to the road user charging regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): Does my hon. Friend fear that the debate is becoming tedious? It cannot be beyond the wit of Opposition Members to accept that new technology develops at a fast pace. Two years ago, a satellite system for route planning cost £300; today, a vehicle satellite receiver costs £20 or £29 through the AA. We are discussing legislation that is to come into effect in one, two or three years' time. Not only will cars be fitted automatically with such devices, but it will be relatively inexpensive to fit cars with a device that covers the whole country. There will be no need to have different schemes in different cities and towns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful for that helpful intervention. I agree that exchanges are becoming tedious, but I am anxious to respond to concerns. As my hon. Friend said, the technology is advancing rapidly. The indications are that it will not involve significant sums of money. It is certainly not beyond the ingenuity of local authorities and motorists to cope with the schemes.
<P>
Local authorities, motorists and local publics must be allowed to consider the merits of charging schemes. It is up to local authorities to decide to introduce them, but they must develop a local consensus. We are pleased by the interest that local authorities have shown in congestion charging regimes and by the surveys in which the majority of motorists recognise the advantages that can be accrued from them. We are confident that they will make an important contribution to the future of transport in this country. I suspect that the Opposition will find themselves bypassed as a result of the course and progress of history.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I should like to put on the record that no Opposition Member disputes that GPS technology will work for frequent users of motor vehicles entering large towns where a scheme has been set up. Clearly, the Government do not have a clue what to do about less frequent visitors to large towns and others who may not have applied for an electronic gadget or whatever equipment may be necessary. They will be caught only by a manual or paper system, but human ingenuity and skill will then come into play because motorists from distant areas will try to evade the pitch points. In that case, the whole exercise will be pointless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I had intended a short debate. However, many important points have been made. Indeed, my hon. Friends have only mentioned that people throughout the country have raised about such schemes. No one is in any doubt that the technology will work very well. However, the debate has made us aware that, for various reasons, many people will not have the devices fitted to their cars. Tourists arriving on the ferry at Poole may head off to Bath or Birmingham and then to Yorkshire or London. They may be caught by several schemes and a paper-based scheme or tolls might be more suitable. The cost of taxing people at the margins will be higher than the cost of taxing those who use the scheme regularly.
<P>
We have spoken of our concerns about the scheme and about its cost, which is a material factor. It has been a useful debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 762, in page 84, line 37, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() Charges shall not apply on any day on which any part of the local underground, metro, bus or rail networks are disrupted or closed by industrial action.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 76, in clause 163, page 92, line 40, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() Charges shall not apply on any day on which any part of the local underground, metro, bus or rail networks are disrupted or closed by industrial action.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The amendments are eminently sensible. They suggest that charges should not apply on any day on which local transport--underground, metro, bus or rail--is disrupted by industrial action. I should be interested to hear how the Minister can object to such a commonsense amendment.
<P>
The premise of this part of the Bill is that, despite clear evidence to the contrary, public transport will be provided as a substitute for the private car. The Government assume that efficient public transport systems will somehow be conjured up. I shall give two brief examples. I mentioned the first the other day. The Under-Secretary has just left the Room, so I can try the mammoth trap again.
<P>
I spoke of the Mersey tunnel, which I used to use frequently. Noticeably, when the Mersey rail system was disrupted, the most appalling congestion and tailbacks occurred. This touches slightly on the previous debate, because the tunnel has a manual system for cash payments of tolls and a fairly primitive tag system--a tag in the car window triggers the barrier. The most appalling congestion occurred on days when the rail service was out of use.
<P>
We suffered similar problems last year when the Circle and Northern underground lines were closed. It should be a matter of common equity that if the taxpaying motorist is expected to pay the tax when there is a viable public transport system, he should not be obliged to pay it when that system is not available. Also--this touches on the previous debate, because I am totally unconvinced by the Under-Secretary' replies--there will have to be a manual system. Unless the charges are dropped, the most appalling congestion will occur at the barrier points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire; he has made a good case. I remind the Minister of what happened last year when the Circle and Northern underground lines were closed because of industrial action. Commuters are absolutely incensed. The Minister for Housing and Planning is an outer London Member--he represents the constituency of Greenwich and Woolwich. He knows what his constituents say whenever public transport is disrupted. He is an extremely reasonable man and I am sure that he accepts the fact, particularly if he wants to hold onto his seat at the next election, that it would be inequitable for the charging regime to continue to apply when the public transport system is down. By accepting the amendments, he would  be sending the clearest possible signal to public transport service providers that there is a severe disincentive against any industrial action and consequent disruption of that service occurring. I hope that he will find the logic of our arguments persuasive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It will come as no surprise that I do not find the locic compelling. I hope that I will give an answer that will satisfy even the hon. Member for North Shropshire and the hon. Member for Aldershot, who tabled and supported these amendments.
<P>
The basic principle of the framework that we are putting in place is that it is for local authorities to decide what charges should apply, when they should apply and under what circumstances they should not apply. It would be highly inconsistent with that framework if we were to prescribe in the Bill certain circumstances where charges that would normally apply would not, particularly if the phrasing left ground for uncertainty. Let me take the hon. Member for Aldershot through the amendment. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Charges shall not apply on any day on which any part of the local underground, metro, bus or rail networks are disrupted or closed by industrial action.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Would that mean that no charges would apply in London if one individual bus garage in one outer area were closed by an industrial dispute on that day? It would be nonsense to suspend the charging system for the whole of London because of one highly localised incident, but that would be the effect of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are litigious members of the public who would seize on any such opportunity, the smallest report in a local newspaper about an incident in one element of the network, and claim that they were unlawfully charged that day. I hope that he will accept that, on the basis, the amendment is not practical.
<P>
There is a further problem because of the way in which the amendment is drafted. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On any day on which any part of the local underground, metro, bus or rail networks are disrupted or closed by industrial action.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is the phrase "are disrupted" and then a second phrase "or closed by industrial action". Disruption involving the loss of one train or a momentary difficulty on one part of the system could be interpreted as circumstances justifying no payment. That would make nonsense of any charging scheme, as it would allow any aggrieved individual to challenge the legality of the charging system.

<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> If there were a security alert or infrastructure failed and major disruption occurred, the amendment would cause significant cost to the transport operators.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point about major disruption. Any minor disruption would fall within the terms of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does the Minister accept that he is shielding himself behind a legalistic defence? He may believe that the amendments are poorly drafted, in which case the clever fellows who work for him will find ways of drafting better amendments. But will he ensure that the Bill provides that, if there is a total transport strike--there have been a number in recent years and, under a Labour Government, we expect them to increase--and people cannot travel into London or any other town, there will be an exemption from the charges?
<P>
The Minister has said that he is leaving it all to local authorities, but he has already breached that principle by exemption hospitals. We are talking about what else can be exempted. Will he exempt strikes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman accused me of shielding behind a legalistic defence. I hope that I said very clearly, as he picked up himself, that it would run against the principle of the scheme to impose a national requirement of this nature. He has highlighted the fact that we are creating certain national exemptions. However, those are not for particular days or circumstances. They are overriding exemptions that will apply at all times. I hope that he will accept that if the scheme is to operate sensibly, decisions about where to vary it, when it should apply, the charges to be levied and whether there should be exemptions on some days and not others must be taken in the light of local circumstances.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I can reassure hon. Members about what would happen in the event of a major breakdown of public transport services which, sadly, happens from time to time, although it is a calumny to suggest that transport strikes would be associated with a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): The amendment would encourage trade unions to take industrial action and perhaps even encourage recalcitrant management to force industrial action. It would enhance the trade unions' power to disrupt the city and the city's revenues from the charging scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, which perhaps highlights the motivation behind the amendment--an attempt to foment industrial unrest to secure exemptions from charges. I leave it to others to judge.
<P>
We are giving local authorities a clear discretion. There is a tradition in this respect. Normal parking restrictions were relaxed when the transport system was disrupted by industrial action under the previous Government. Such arrangements could equally apply locally. Local authorities would have discretion to exempt motorists from charges when the public transport system was not working for such reasons. I hope therefore that hon. Members will accept that the amendment is inappropriate and not well drafted and that it should be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We have had an interesting little debate, with a telling intervention by the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas), who talked about the revenue flow being interrupted. That is what the matter is about. That was the point of what I said about continuing to tax people who use the Mersey tunnel even during times of massive extra congestion, should the rail alternative be down. Instead of hiding behind a quibble about punctuation, the Minister could have discussed how the amendment might be improved. Clearly, it is intended to relate to disruption caused by industrial action. However, since he has said that local authorities would have discretion to suspend an arrangement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 620, in page 84, line 38, leave out 'Secretary of State' and insert 'appropriate national authority'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 621 to 624, 630, 631, 633, 649 to 652, 654, 661, 662, 664, 665, 675, 677 and 700 to 703.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The number of amendments is fearsome, but they all have a similar objective--to respond to the framework of devolution introduced by the Government. They would increase the discretion and responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales and empower it to specify the framework for operating the charging and licensing schemes in Wales.
<P>
I could take the Committee through all the amendments and explain the precise effect of each one, but it would probably be sensible for me to sit down. I am of course happy to answer questions from members of the Committee about the amendments, but I commend them on the principle that decisions about the impact of any scheme in Wales should be for the National Assembly rather than the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 753, in page 84, line 42, after 'payable' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'and will exempt from payment any registered disabled person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 148, which deals with exemptions, is probably one of the most controversial in the Bill. No doubt there will be much argument about who should be exempt. Amendment No. 753 would exempt from payment any registered disabled person. We want reassurance from the Minister about the position of disabled people, but there is concern about exemptions in general. The Government have set a precedent by exempting people who work in NHS hospitals. It would be up to local authorities to decide whom to exempt and different categories might be exempt in different schemes, which could cause confusion. There will be public concern about this.
<P>
In some areas and cities, everyone except councillors and council employees pays for parking. I wonder how Ministers would view local authority schemes that exempted members of the local authority or passenger transport authority. It has been known for those introducing a scheme to exempt themselves from it. We want a little debate on exemptions and on the categories of people--in addition to those specified in the amendment--who might be exempted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It is becoming clear from the exchanges on several amendments this morning that the Government and their advisers have hardly begun to think through the practicalities of the workplace and congestion-charging schemes that they propose to introduce in a great rush. The Minister lightly dismissed the question of cost by saying that all the indications are that the schemes would be relatively inexpensive. What are those indications? So far, we have been told only about documents in the Library.
<P>
The amendment is designed to show up a further astonishing intellectual gap in the Government's thinking about the principle of congestion charging. We have seen the publicity that they have achieved by saying that NHS hospitals are to be exempt from workplace charging, which we welcome. It would be absurd if low-paid nurses were required to pay workplace charges. However, the Government's cheap bid for publicity from that exemption has had two results. First, it has exposed some interesting old-Labour thinking along the lines that people who work in NHS hospitals should be exempt from workplace charging from those who work in private hospitals should pay. The Consultants who work half the time in NHS hospitals and the rest in private hospitals are forgotten about in that approach. Should the consultant declare, as he goes under the gantry, whether he is going to an NHS or private hospital? The distinction is of course absurd and is being made for politically correct reasons.
<P>
Secondly, and more importantly, the Government have admitted by exempting NHS hospitals that the decisions cannot be left to the discretion of local authorities. They have decided that Whitehall and Westminster must impose national conditions on local authorities and that even if those authorities do not believe that they should exempt NHS hospitals, the Government will require them to do so. They have thus weakened the principle that the Minister set out. He stressed the importance of local authority discretion, but the muddle over GPS undermines that view. If co-ordination between local authorities will be needed, the scheme will have to take on an increasingly national character. The Minister cannot hide behind the idea of allowing local authorities to make up their own minds, because he has made such a significant concession. If he gives a national exemption to people who work at NHS hospitals, what about those who work in private hospitals; what about all kinds of emergency vehicles--police, fire and ambulance?
<P>
<B>The Chairman Order. I have been listening carefully to the hon. Member and must remind him that the debate is specific to registered disabled people. It is not a general debate about exemptions.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I accept your point, Mr. Gale, but if we are discussing whether registered disabled people should be exempt, it is surely reasonable that we should in the same breath consider exemptions for other people.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that I have just ruled that that is unreasonable. It is in order for the hon. Member to set his argument in the context of the Minister's remarks, and he has done so. It is not in order, however, for him to broaden a debate that specifically concerns disabled people to cover every form of exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, Mr. Gale. I hope that we will be able to debate other exemptions later.
<P>
The Government should square up to interested groups throughout the nation. Disabled people are asking how they will have to pay, whether they will pay locally and whether it is up to local authorities to decide on exemptions. Orange badge holders are often dependent on their motor cars. An orange badge holder who wants to set off from Edinburgh and drive to Plymouth via Bristol and Bath will first ask whether he can be certain that he will not be charged for passing through those towns. The Government cannot respond to such concerns by glibly stating that they will invest the money raised to establish and improve park-and-ride schemes and that disabled people will be able to jump out of their cars and into buses--disabled people cannot do that. Will the Minister tell us clearly and without equivocation that people who are registered as disabled and who are holders of orange badges will be exempt throughout the nation? If he does so, he should bear in mind that we will examine later his reasons for exempting NHS staff but not private staff and other people who should be exempted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Poole raises the important matter of exemption for disabled people from road-user charging. Hon. Members will have received copies of our response to "Breaking the Logjam: the Government's consultation paper on fighting traffic congestion and pollution through road user and workplace parking charges", which was published on 22 February. The consultation paper asked, among other things, which exemptions from charges or other concessions should be specified nationially and which are best left to local discussion. As the Committee will know, we propose an exemption from road-user charges and workplace parking charges for emergency vehicles. We also propose an exemption from both charges for disabled persons. In addition, we propose some form of exemption or concession from the workplace parking levy for NHS hospitals. I do not intend to pursue that point now, as it is not germane to the amendment, but I shall return to it later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole and I are at one on the need to grant an exemption for the disabled. We are firmly of the view that national exemptions from the proposed charges are best specified in regulations rather than in the Bill, which gives an opportunity for flexibility if future amendments are required. The regulation- making power is provided by clause 148 in respect of road-user charging and by clause 163 in respect of the workplace parking levy. This sensible approach will ensure that we can work with appropriate interest groups, including organisations representing disabled people, to ensure that the detail of the exemptions or concessions is workable and equitable. That could not be guaranteed if we sought to specify in the Bill exemptions from charges, as the amendment proposes. Definitions and other points of detail must also be taken into account.
<P>
I well recall the work that I did a couple of years ago to give effect to our commitment to extent part M of the building regulations to allow disabled people easier access to accommodation. We took into account a series of detailed considerations. Organisations representing disabled people were fully involved and the outcome was far better for that involvement. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that such discussions are integral to the regulation-making process that we envisage.
<P>
I reiterate our commitment to giving local authorities responsibility to devise charging schemes that reflect local circumstances, priorities and needs. We are keeping our proposals for national exemptions to a minimum, although clauses 148 and 163 empower local authorities to grant additional exemptions or concessions from road-user and workplace parking charges in the light of local circumstances. However, we are firmly of the view that decisions about exemptions and concessions--not including the small number that will apply nationally--should be taken locally in the design of an individual charging or licensing scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> Can my hon. Friend confirm that clause 147(5)(e), which provides that charges may differ for different classes of motor vehicles, allows local authorities to impose lower charges rather than exemptions for specific categories of vehicles such as motorcycles or those with orange badges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I admire my hon. Friend's ingenuity in introducing motorcyles, a matter that I know concerns him, into a debate on disabled people. He is right to assume that the Bill provides considerable scope to take account of different classes of vehicle. To avoid incurring your wrath, Mr. Gale, I shall return to the exemption with which the amendment deals.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. To be fair to the Committee, I should remind hon. Members that the amendment is very specific, which is why I held them to it. The Minister may make further remarks during a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I shall be happy to make wider remarks in a clause stand part debate if the Committee wants me to do so. I have spelt out the Government's position on the proposed exemption for disabled people, and I hope that the hon. Member for Poole will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in light of my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 621, in page 84, line 43, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
No. 622, in page 85, line 3, leave out 'subsections (1) and (2)' and insert 'subsection (1)'.
<P>
No. 623, in page 85, line 5, leave out 'subsection (1)' and insert 'that subsection'.--[Mr. Raynsford.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Minister said that emergency vehicles were exempt. Is he talking only about police, fire and ambulance vehicles? If not, does the category include vehicles used by the Automobile Association, the Royal Automobile Club, the British Transport police or the St. John Ambulance service? What is the definition of an emergency vehicle? Exemptions such as those proposed by the Government can lead to difficulties. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire pointed out, the introduction of exemptions for some NHS hospital staff leads other NHS employees to ask why they do not benefit. A variety of staff in hospices and other institutions might also want to be exempted. If regulation is to be made, I hope that it will be introduced speedily, so that people will know what the Government intend. The exemptions are a minefield. My hon. Friend's comments about a poll tax on wheels might apply not only in terms of the amounts raised but in terms of exemptions. Some of the most aggrieved people whom hon. Members see in our surgeries feel that they should receive a benefit but do not get it or that they are making payments that somebody else is not making. The Government must be cautious and clearly state what exemptions will apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale, for straying when we discussed disabled people. It is important in the clause stand part debate that the voices of the people with the key concerns, who are watching our debates throughout the nation, should be heard. Many people who deserve exemptions from workplace and congestion charging are bombarding hon. Members with their concerns. Their voices should rightly he heard in Committee.
<P>
Other exemptions should be included, either nationally or locally; the Government are muddled about the basis on which that should happen. If they are to be local, they can be left to local people. However, as soon as the Government interfere in this way, they make value judgments about who should be exempt. It is only fair that they should include as many exemptions nationally as is reasonable.
<P>
The Government have said that emergency vehicles should be exempt--fine. In Chippenham, the firemen do other jobs and, while on call, carry bleepers so that they might be summoned to man the fire engines at a moment's notice. Will they be exempt when going to the fire station in their private vehicles? There could be gantries outside Chippenham. I hope that I shall never see them there, but will we charge firemen to go through the gantry points?
<P>
Wiltshire county council runs school vehicles for children. Will schools have to declare workplace charging when the buses park outside? In many rural areas, the tiny village schools are run by teachers on low pay. Will they be charged?
<P>
We have heard about the exemption on workplace charging at NHS hospitals, but what about the nurses travelling to them? It is no good our saying that they will come late at night or first thing in the morning and avoid the rush hour--that is often impossible for low-paid nurses because of shifts. Are the Government saying that they do not care about nurses and that they will leave the decision on whether to exempt nurses to local authorities? The Government are, at least passively, accepting that some local authorities will charge nurses to get to their workplace. Having exempted nurses, doctors and other essential emergency workers from workplace charging, they should also exempt them from congestion charges.
<P>
Doctors on call might be contacted suddenly and have to rush in their cars to reach an emergency or they might have to go to to care for a patient. Will they be exempt? Again, to say that that will be a matter for local authorities is to abdicate responsibility. What about midwives having to reach pregnant mothers?
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> The hon. Gentleman reads out an interesting list, but I suspect that he is confusing congestion charging with workplace charging. Will he explain how to determine whether nurses, teachers and other such workers are on their way to work or visiting their granny?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am not confusing workplace and congestion charging--both might be levied on people going about their legitimate business and one can consider them together.
<P>
The hon. Lady makes a powerful point. Firemen and others going to their legitimate place of work will pay workplace and congestion charges. Nurses will be exempt from workplace charges, but not from congestion charges. As the hon. Lady said, one cannot correctly distinguish the purpose of a visit.
<P>
So far, the only people who will be exempted are those who can plainly state what they are doing--workplace charges will not apply to designated staff at NHS hospitals and congestion charges will not apply to orange badge holders. Therefore, for the good reason cited by the hon. Lady, the Government and local authorities will not be able to exempt nurses. Whether congestion charges are imposed by the Government or by local authorities, nurses will have to pay them to get to their hospital. The example highlights one of the flaws in the system.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> The hon. Gentleman is still confusing workplace and congestion charges. If somebody goes to work at an exempt hospital, they will be exempted. The issue is different from that of congestion charges. If people are to pay for travelling from A to B, one must consider charging a range of people. Were we to act on the hon. Gentleman's basis, it would be almost impossible to find anyone to charge who could not give a reason about where he or she were going.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Lady powerfully makes my case for me. I am not confusing workplace and congestion charging. I have made it plain that there will be exemptions from workplace charging. People such as a low-paid nurse in her A-registered car on her way to her 969 970 legitimate place of work, the hospital, will be charged. For the Government not to include in the Bill an exemption for them, arguing that a decision on the matter should be for local authorities, is an abdication of responsibility.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> No--the hon. Lady keeps interrupting. She said reasonably that a local authority would be extremely unlikely to exempt a nurse who was on her way to work because it would be difficult to do so.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall not. The hon. Lady has had two goes to make her point and has done so reasonably well. It is a good point, highlighting the fundamental flaw in the Bill. She argues that it would be hard for a local authority to determine why a nurse was driving down a road and so it would decide to charge her. What about a community nurse visiting a patient at home?
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Lady is determined, so I shall.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I have sympathy with nurses and other public-sector workers. Will the hon. Gentleman explain the distinction that he is making between a nurse, a low-paid cleaner going to a private house or any other worker?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall explain if the hon. Lady will allow me a moment to do so. I was about to expand my argument to include other categories of people who could say that they should not pay the charges with equal justification. As she correctly says, it will be extraordinarily difficult to exempt everyone who might reasonably expect to be exempted. One can produce many arguments about hospital cleaners-- [Interruption.] She is keen to make her brilliant argument against the Bill.
<P>
Many people who might legitimately expect to be exempt will not be exempted by the Government and, for the reasons that the hon. Lady described, local authorities will not exempt them either. The upshot of the introduction of congestion charges by local authorities will be that people such as nurses on their way to work will pay. We are saying to the nation that the Government are introducing a Bill that will charge nurses to get to their hospital. That is what the hon. Lady is saying and she is right.
<P>
Other groups should be exempted, such as volunteer workers going to and from the posts for which they earn no money. This is the year of the volunteer--the Prime Minister tells us that he will take a day off from his busy schedule to volunteer. My son volunteers at the night shelter for the homeless in Winchester. He will face congestion charges and workplace charges for going in his car to help there. Drivers of taxis and private hire vehicles will be charged to go about their legitimate and sensible business. What about cars taking desperately ill people to hospital? Unemployed people who have not a penny to their name, who are taking their granny to the local hospital will be charged. All those people could reasonably be exempt.
<P>
What about road freight vehicles taking goods to supermarkets? They will be charged. The driver will not pay the cost and it will not come out of Safeway's profits--it will be added to the cost of food, which will create inflation. Every lorry entering London will pay a large sum, which will mount up substantially. The road haulage industry has already been hammered by the Government under the guise of environmental taxation. Road haulage operators are going out of business across the nation. What will the Government do? They will introduce a charge that will make it harder than ever to deliver goods to local Safeway stores.
<P>
What will happen to farm vehicles? There is a livestock market every Friday in Chippenham--the farmers come by tractor to sell their sheep and calves. They are on their knees and are finished thanks to the Government's lack of interest and their ignorance of farming problems. One of our farmers sold a calf this week for 23p. That farmer would have to pay congestion and workplace charges because there is no exemption for farmers. What about hearses and funeral corteges? Will a funeral cortege have to pay congestion and workplace charges if it goes across a gantry?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What about the excellent Wiggly bus run by the Conservative Wiltshire county council, which the Minister praised in a previous debate? Will the Wiggly bus have to pay? [Interruption.] It is revealing that while I am listing legitimate causes, the Opposition seem to find the subject funny. They find it funny that nurses, volunteers, bankrupt farmers and hearses will have to pay, but we do not find that funny. Such people deserve to be exempted by the Bill because, as the Government have admitted, it is unlikely that the local authority will exempt them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> For the sake of brevity, will the hon. Gentleman tell us who he thinks should pay the charge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is precisely my point. If those deserving categories should not pay, and I have not heard a single Government Member say that they should--I am sure that the electorate will be very interested to hear if the Government think that hearses and nurses should pay--[Hon. Members: "Hearses and nurses!"] There is great levity, but the issue of exemption from the tax is a serious point, which will be of particular concern to interest groups throughout the nation. The fact that every Opposition Member seems to find it amusing says a great deal about the flaw in the Bill.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) correctly said, if we were to go through the categories of people who should reasonably be exempted from the Bill, precious few people would end up paying the charge. That was also the point made by the hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward), and it is one of the most fundamental flaws in the principle of congestion and workplace taxes. It will damage the people who are least able to pay for it and those who are going about their legitimate business.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I seek his expertise. Perhaps, when he travelled to far eastern parts, he learned exactly who is charged and who is exempt in Singapore, because if the system was made to work there, the list of exemptions proposed by the hon. Gentleman could not possibly apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Lady raises a useful point. First, the system has not worked there. Secondly, the charge is 10p or 20p a day, which is why it has not worked. The charge is extremely low so no one minds paying and there is no need for exemptions. However, in the case of Leicester, the charge is £8 a day and people have mentioned a figure of £10 a day for London with Mr. Livingstone--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) is a mayoral candidate, but he is still a Member of the House and must be referred to by his constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I accept your direction, Mr. Gale. The trouble is that with all these Frank Dobsons around it is often difficult to remember which one is the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) and which is not.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, East tells me that the charge might be as much as £10 in London. Of course exemptions will be necessary if the charge is £10. If the giggling Government Back Benchers believe that changing nurses and voluntary workers £10 to come into London is funny, their electorate will see them right at the general election on 4 May next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The clause sets out detailed provisions about how charging schemes should be specified, how charges might be levied and how variations and exemptions might be prescribed. The debate has focused entirely on exemptions and I shall try to respond.
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole highlighted definitions. Exemptions provide enormous scope for resentment on the part of those who are not given them if they believe that their case is as strong as those who are exempted. It was probably involuntary, but the hon. Member for North Wiltshire illustrated that point by producing a long list of people who might claim reasonable grounds for exemption. By the end of his speech, it became clear that no one was likely to come within a category who could not be exempted. Indeed, in the hon. Gentleman's view, it seemed that even Mr. Goldman Sachs would probably be able to make some sort of case for exemption.
<P>
That was not a fruitful path. However, a case can be made for some limited national exemptions, which should be clearly specified after appropriate consultation with all parties. I emphasised in the previous debate the importance of consultation with organisations representing disabled people. The same will apply to the definitions of the emergency services. Although we are minded to exempt the police and the ambulance and fire services, the various other ancillary emergency services mentioned by the hon. Member for Poole could also be considered as part of that consultation. Nothing has yet been written on tablets of stone, but we are not minded to make extensive exemptions for the reasons that I outlined.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire highlighted the position of NHS staff in relation to the exemption for emergency services. Some NHS staff who have to attend hospitals are required to provide a 24-hour service. It is different, for instance, for teachers in rural schools, as they would not be required to be present at midnight or through the early hours of the morning when no bus service was likely to be available. We draw a distinction between people in that situation and staff who have to be available to maintain an emergency service at all hours of the day and night when public transport is not available. A nurse going to work during the daytime would have the choice, certainly in town, of travelling by public transport or by car. It is a logical distinction. Applying the exemption to workplace parking charges would enable staff to be present to provide emergency services at hours when public transport was not available.
<P>
The hon. Menmber for North Wiltshire conjured up all sorts of fanciful images of huge charges being applied to many categories of people. I remind him that it will be for local authorities to determine what charges should apply, if any, and whether to make exemptions. The local exemptions that might be specified over and above the national exemptions could well include some of the categories to which he referred, but the Government certainly do not intend to introduce a swingeing charging system that will penalise people. We want local transport plans to ensure the most efficient transport arrangements within the locality; we want to give people a range of travel options; and we want to discourage unnecessary vehicle movements that can add to congestion in highly congested areas. Those are the principles that underpin the scheme.
<P>
Once again, the hon. Member for North Wiltshire conjured up his nightmare vision of gantries all around Chippenham. It would be for the local authority to determine whether Chippenham was an appropriate area for charging and whether gantries should be used. I find it difficult to believe that that would happen.
<P>
I shall try to end on a light note. Were the authority in North Wiltshire unwise enough to put up a number of unsightly gantries and road signs, I am sure that, you, Mr. Gale, would soon be there with your camera, taking the sort of photograph that we so enjoyed seeing in the exhibition.--[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] It showed a number of our colleagues against a particularly appropriate road sign, which showed a message that is certainly welcomed by Labour Members. On that note, I urge that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 627 in page 85, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5A) A person commits an offence if he removes a notice of a charging scheme penalty charge which has been fixed to a motor vehicle in accordance with regulations under this section unless--
<P>
(a) he is the registered keeper of the vehicle or a person using the vehicle with his authority, or
<P>
(b) he does so under the authority of the registered keeper or such a person or of the charging authority or any of the charging authorities.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 628, 629, 682 and 708.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As we begin another subsection of the Bill, which deals with the enforcement of charging schemes, it will be helpful to the Committee if I give a brief overview of the provisions of clauses 149 and 150. They include provision for penalty charges, liability for penalties, criminal offences where there are systematic attempts to avoid charges through fraud, rights of entry to check vehicle equipment and licences and powers to immobilise and remove vehicles.
<P>
Clause 149 imposes penalties and liabilities. It does so because it is important that charging authorities have sufficient powers to enforce charging schemes fairly and consistently. Clause 149 covers penalty charges and the liability for penalties. If, for example, a vehicle is found in the area of the charging scheme without a required permit, the penalty charge will be issued. The liability would fall on the registered keeper of the vehicle as already happens with parking fines except when specified otherwise in regulations. These could transfer the liabilities say, to the hirer where there is a valid hire agreement for a vehicle, or if a vehicle has been reported stolen. Those provisions would mirror the provisions that exist in the case of parking charge.
<P>
Clause 149 also provides for criminal offences in situations where there is a systematic attempt to evade charges through using forged documents, by tampering with electronic charging equipment in a vehicle or by removing penalty charge notices from windscreens.
<P>
Clause 150 provides for rights of entry. Regulations will allow charging authorities power to authorise people to enter vehicles to check permits and electronic charging equipment and whether it's been tampered with. We expect that the great bulk of enforcement work can be undertaken from the outside of a vehicle, but we envisage the need for an occasional spot check to deter the use of forged permits or equipment that has been tampered with. Clearly, a vehicle will need to be entered for this sort of check to be made properly and this will be possible on any road, but not on private property. Clause 150 also provides for vehicles to be immobilised or removed. We envisage that power being used against persisten offenders.
<P>
This group of amendments makes it a criminal offence for an unauthorised person to remove a penalty charge notice from a vehicle where a notice has been affixed to that vehicle for a failure to pay a road user charge. The penalty on summary conviction will be a fine not exceeding level 2 on the sliding scale, which is currently £200. I am sure the Committee is aware that on-street parking legislation already provides for an identical offence and penalty for the unauthorised removal of a parking ticket from a vehicle, so this simply matches existing arrangements. This will ensure that the enforcement of a road user charging scheme is not undermined by unauthorised removal of penalty charge notices from vehicles. This could be particularly important in a simple, paper-based charging scheme, where enforcement agents would check the permits of vehicles parked on the street in an area where road user charges apply.
<P>
Amendment No. 682 to schedule 12 amends the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to provide the same offence and consequential penalty in London that applies to the rest of England and Wales. Amendment No. 708 is consequential.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are worried that the clause will allow the random stop and search of motor vehicles. The purpose of the amendment is to tease out the powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I confess that I am in a little difficulty. We were considering the merits of the amendment. Unfortunately, the hon. Gentleman has used opening gambit C, or D, in the hope that I would say something, but I had hoped that he would make a strong case to incorporate the provisions.

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): The Minister chides my hon. Friend the Member for Poole without realising that it is sometimes whispered in his ear that we need to make progress. If the Minister continues to chide him, we may decide to make longer speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Far be it from me to encourage long speeches, certainly not by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire. Had I known that concise and incisive introduction to the amendment by the hon. Member for Poole was prompted by a note passed down the Bench from the Whip about making progress, I would have turned my fire on the hon. Member for Hexham.
<P>
There is an issue to consider. We expect the powers to be used when there is good reason for believing that an offence has been committed. Existing arrangements should satisfy that, but we should like to reflect further on the matter and return to it at a later stage if there is a need for, and merit in, a similar amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Excellent. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We believe that it is important that when someone enters an area with a congestion charging scheme, it should be properly signed so that they know that they are doing so.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new clause 27--Exemption from local non-domestic rating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I beg to move that new clause 27 be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I grant that it is confusing, but we are debating the lead motion, which is whether clause 153 should stand part of the Bill. We are also discussing, but have not yet moved, Government new clause 27. The new clause will be moved at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you for that correction, Mr. Gale. I beg your indulgence to allow me to say a little about new clause 27.
<P>
The new clause deals with the rather technical matter of liability for non-domestic rates. Clause 153, which dealt only with exempting hereditaments from non-domestic rates, leaves us with a problem. "Hereditaments" includes buildings and structures such as toll booths and the inevitable gantries needed for charging schemes. The difficulty is that the definition goes wider than just building and structures. New clause 27 is designed to cover all those issues.
<P>
Believe it or not, Mr. Gale, a public highway is not liable to rates; but when a charge is levied on a road, the highway authority may be seen as the beneficial occupier of the road, and the road would thereby be liable to non-domestic rates. I find it astonishing, but that is the legal position and it could have a considerable impact on charging schemes, with revenues being sent back to central Government in the form of rates. That clearly is not our intention.
<P>
New clause 27 is a necessary substitute for clause 153, which is why I was in error when I tried to move it. I must now eat my words and say that I hope that new clause 27 can be substituted for clause 153. It will allow us to clarify a highly complex, technical and unsatisfactory position.
<P>
Question put and negatived.
<P>
Clause 153 disagreed to.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
<P>
Bill to be further considered on Tuesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.--[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
