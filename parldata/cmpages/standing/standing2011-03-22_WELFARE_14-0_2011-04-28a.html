Karen Buck</strong> (Westminster North) (Lab):<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000555">&#160;</a>
                           </span> I was warming to my
theme by the end of this morning’s sitting. It is nice to see
that the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth appears to have brought
sufficient paperwork to enable her to intervene extensively during my
contribution. We all look forward to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
we have many hopeful expectations for universal credit, particularly in
relation to the advantages of integration and simplification, it would
be a grave mistake to proceed without an assurance, which is what the
amendment requires, that the welfare advice sector has sufficient
capacity to deal with the advice and representation needs of its
clients.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The context
is that the advice sector, particularly the element associated with the
legal aid budget, is under unprecedented attack. I will return to that
in a moment. The most worrying thing about this debate’s
framework is that, at the very time that we are undertaking a massive
transitional process to a new and untested benefit system, the means by
which clients are able to access advice and representation are fast
disappearing. I am sure that that is of grave concern to the Minister
and that he will want to support the amendment, because he will want to
be satisfied about the system’s capacity. That is the first
grave concern—the undermining of the ability to respond to the
challenges of universal credit and the transitional process leading up
to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Transitions
always lead to a huge increase in demand, because people are unclear
about the changes to their circumstances and do not want to be worse
off as a consequence. We talked this morning about elements of
universal credit, and we have talked throughout the Committee about
those parts of universal credit that lack fundamental clarity.
Certainly, at the moment, claimants in the system lack clarity. We have
also talked about the strands of universal credit that are of most
concern to us. There is the council tax benefit, and we will talk next
week about the social fund. We have talked about a number of aspects
associated with the conditionality regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000022">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to make
some comments and ask some questions about universal credit. One of the
assumptions of the White Paper that underpins the Bill is that the
default position for access to universal credit will be through digital
communication. The Minister needs to clarify how the Department and the
independent advice sector will be able to respond to the needs of
people who are not able to access the system
digitally.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are right that the growth of the internet provides us with
enormous potential to improve the quality of service to clients. It is
obviously infinitely preferable for the many people who can to be able
to submit their claims and note changes of circumstance via a digital
medium; it is also possible that the Government will be able to save
money, which would be agreeable. We would expect those who have easy
access to the internet and the skills to use it to be able to do that.
We welcome giving universal credit the capacity to enable people to
access it digitally and all the benefits that flow from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No
one is saying that the Government’s argument is that there will
be 100% expectation of internet access to universal credit, but will
the Minister clarify how the Government intend to protect the interests
of, and provide advice, assistance and face-to-face communication for,
those individuals who are not able to do that? We want the Minister to
tell us today how he will be able to report to Parliament on the
capacity within the system to meet the needs of people who do not have
internet access.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
the numbers involved are very substantial. Currently, 7 million people
do not have internet access. Of course, that figure is weighted towards
older people; a high proportion of those 7 million people will be
pensioners. None the less, millions of people of working age do not
have internet access. We know that one in five people aged between 55
and 65 do not have internet access and that almost one in three
households with incomes below £10,400 do not.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also know
that there is a very strong bias within the system against the north of
England and that in cities with highly mobile and complex populations,
which include people for whom English is not a first language, even
having the physical capacity to access the internet does not mean that
people will be able to submit their claims, submit information about
changes of circumstances or deal with queries comfortably and easily
through the internet. The Department has made it absolutely clear that
there will be capacity within the system to meet the needs of people
without internet access. However, one of the central purposes of the
amendment is to ask how that capacity will be established and
monitored, and how we can be assured that the capacity will be
available within the system to meet the needs of those
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So far, there
has been a worrying vagueness about those issues. Mr Moran, the
director general of universal credit, told the Work and Pensions
Committee in February:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
those who can, some of the information will be provided by them through
online support. For those who can’t, it will be available
through other
means.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000477">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
must say that that is somewhat lacking in specificity. Mr Moran went on
to say in that evidence session that we have years in which to make
preparations for all these things. But we do not have years—we
know how fast time flies when one is preparing for massive legislative 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 565<a class="bkMark" name="Column565">&#160;</a>
                           </div>change and we will be introducing the first people into universal credit
in two years’ time. It is rather worrying that the means through
which the Department is planning for people to gain access to universal
credit and through which it is planning to provide support for those
people who cannot gain access digitally—given that it is
absolutely clear that there will be a “digital
default”—are so
vague.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Can
the Minister tell us today what research has been done on this issue?
At the time of that evidence session for the Work and Pensions
Committee in February, we were given an indication that research was
being undertaken. What research is being carried out into the balance
of online access and other forms of access, including face-to-face
access and telephone access, for those people seeking to make claims or
to register changes of circumstances? It would be very helpful to know
when we will have a clear indication of the Department’s
thinking on how that balance will be developed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will there be
a target for online claims? The White Paper said that digital access
will be the default option. However, I am absolutely
sure—perhaps the Minister will challenge me on this—that
there will be a target and that somewhere within the system a set of
planning assumptions will be made about what proportion of new claims
and what proportion of new circumstances being registered will be done
online. Otherwise, I fail to understand how the Department will be able
to plan the resources to meet the demand that it acknowledges will
undoubtedly exist for face-to-face advice and assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If there is
no such target, how will that planning be undertaken? How will the
Department assure itself that it has sufficient staffing capacity,
including where those staff will be, to respond to
people—whether that is providing continuing assistance through
online assistance, a national phone service or the face-to-face
capacity in some local offices, which is critically
important?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Whether
clients of universal credit will have a right to access services other
than by going online is another question that I would like the Minister
to answer. Will access to personal and face-to-face services be
automatically granted should a client request it, or will that be
restricted to certain categories of clients? If so, how will those
categories be chosen? For the purposes of planning staff levels, what
assumptions are being made about the average amount of face time that
will be available per client and client group? Does the Minister
anticipate an increase in the client case load for Jobcentre Plus
advisers, compared with the current system? They will need to know how
their work load will unfold.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On Tuesday,
the Minister spoke sincerely and eloquently—I felt the sincerity
of what he was saying—about the importance of utilising the
judgment of advisers when it comes to applying sanctions and making
judgments on conditionality. Will the Minister tell the Committee how
he will satisfy Parliament that such discretion can be applied properly
when such a large proportion of all communication is assumed to be
digital?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will
probably discuss the social fund next week, but in the impact
assessment for that, the Department made it clear that one reason for
proceeding with the localisation of social fund applications is that a
national phone service has proved to be inadequate for the purposes of
making discretionary judgments about fines and appeals. How can we be
sure to get that right? If we do not get it right, we will have more,
rather than fewer, bad initial decisions. The problem of bad initial
decision 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 566<a class="bkMark" name="Column566">&#160;</a>
                           </div>making has been at the heart of welfare rights and advice service
requirements, both in the past and possibly in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
raft of questions about the implications of using default digital
communication. I do not argue against the majority of communications
taking place in that way, but we need to know how many people are
expected to require face-to-face communication, and how that will be
planned for. In the run-up to universal credit, we want to know that
Jobcentre Plus will have the capacity to make discretionary decisions
and good initial judgments. If that is the case, it will undoubtedly
benefit the wider welfare rights agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
concerns need to be factored into the report that would be required by
the amendment. We know, however, that all transitions are problematic.
There has never been a major change to the tax and benefit system,
however well intentioned and planned, that did not lead to a
consequential increase in demand for advice and representation, at
least in the short term. We discussed that this morning in the context
of tax credits, and it was also true of the introduction of
supplementary benefit. There will be a need for information, and as we
enter into the universal credit system during the mid years of the
decade and beyond, it will be in the Department’s interest to
ensure that we have the capacity to respond to that need. It will be a
learning process, and if we learn better and more quickly from demands
for advice than perhaps we have done previously, the universal credit
system will be better.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">None of us
wants to see a repeat of the Child Support Agency, which was an example
of an initiative in the early 1990s that was almost consensual in
parliamentary terms. We all saw the need for it, agreed with the
principle and could see the benefits of the system, yet effectively it
collapsed. Many MPs will remember sitting on such Committees, although
newer Members will not have had that experience. Well into the early
years of the last decade, we were dealing with a substantial
parliamentary case load arising from the Child Support Agency, despite
the fact that there was considerable consensual debate on the matter in
Parliament beforehand.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The story of
the Titanic was that it was an unsinkable ship, which was why nobody
thought to put enough lifeboats on it. No one is suggesting that
universal credit is a Titanic—quite the reverse—but it is
absolutely essential that sufficient lifeboats are provided because we
do not know and cannot say exactly what the demand is likely to be.
However, we can be confident that, at least temporarily, there will be
an increase in demand for welfare advice and assistance. We do not know
how much of that will be met face to face and whether inquiries will be
dealt with within the DWP
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
importantly, there are many elements within the universal credit that
are likely to lead to an increase—possibly transitionally, but
in some cases structurally—in the demand for additional advice
and assistance over the longer term. One of those elements is the issue
of housing costs and the reduction in housing support, which we
discussed at considerable length in Committee and will possibly come
back to next week. The extent to which the Government are proposing
reductions in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 567<a class="bkMark" name="Column567">&#160;</a>
                           </div>housing benefit for both private and social tenants leads to the
potential for a massive increase in demand for welfare rights and
assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There will be
a far greater reliance on the discretionary housing payments scheme.
That is absolutely what the Government expect to happen. They want more
discretionary decisions on housing claims to be taken at a local
authority level. However, any element of discretionary payments within
the system always and invariably leads to more challenges precisely
because people will have a subjective view on the extent to which a
discretionary benefit should apply to them. Of course, that is
complicated further by the fact that every local authority will
potentially have different criteria for determining discretionary
housing payments and many—a substantial minority—of
universal credit claimants will be mobile and will move between
different areas. The rules that will apply to people living in Hull are
completely different from those that will apply if they then go to live
in Watford. People will therefore make multiple applications for
discretionary housing benefits in a way that they would not if the
total demand for DHB was not inevitably rising because of the
shortfalls in housing
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have talked to some extent about the increase in conditionality and
elements of the sanctions regime. We expressed our concern about the
potential for a three-year maximum disentitlement to benefit. However,
what I would say in the context of the amendment is that if those
people who would have been willing or able to accept a short-term loss
of benefit because of a high-level sanction under the old regime see
the potential for those sanctions cumulatively building to a three-year
loss of benefit, they are far more likely to challenge those initial
sanctions. It is therefore extremely likely that the higher stakes
involved in the sanctions regime will lead to an increase in the number
of appeals and challenges to the
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Next
week, we will come on to debate the social fund, to which we have just
referred. However, I am afraid that the localisation of crisis loans
and community care loans will predictably mean a nightmare of
challenges and appeals. There are many reasons why, the most obvious of
which is the extent to which the localisation of what is effectively a
national system will lead to a significant minority of people not
having a local connection. For example, if someone does not have a
local connection and they apply to local authority A for a crisis loan,
it might say, “But you are someone fleeing domestic
violence” or, say, a rough sleeper who has been made homeless,
“And you left local authority B in order to make your
application. You are rightly the responsibility of local authority
B.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It will be
inevitable and structural that local authorities will seek to deter
people from making applications at a local level. We already see that
in the homelessness legislation, but that legislation at least provides
for local authority A to house someone pending an inquiry before it
refers them back to local authority B, from which they originally came.
As the Bill stands, there will be no such system within the social
fund. If someone is destitute and applies to a local authority to which
they have no connection, or does not meet that authority’s
criteria, they will appeal against that decision or will need advice
and representation—in numbers that far exceed any that are
likely now—to find a way to correct a decision that they believe
to be wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000044">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We discussed
the localisation of council tax benefit a couple of weeks ago, and we
heard the criticism that localisation went to the heart of the
universal credit’s claims to be a single, integrated benefits
system. Different regimes will apply in different local authorities. In
fact, I was looking only last week at the report drawn up by my local
authority, Westminster, which is seeking the opportunity to reduce the
number of those on council tax benefit in its area. We are inevitably
looking at different rules and regimes for benefit
entitlement.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The people
who are most likely to seek advice and representation and to challenge
that decision will be the people who are mobile. They will be the
people moving from Camden to Westminster, or from Newcastle to
Liverpool. Actually, that last one is a bad example, because they will
be people moving to a neighbouring local authority. They will be people
who have a job, and are seeking to maximise the benefit of being in
work. However, crossing the border from one local authority to its
neighbour will potentially lead them into a totally different benefits
regime, and they may well find that they cannot afford to work anymore.
They may then find that they are immediately sanctioned and subject to
conditionality, and they may wish to appeal against that. It is
extremely likely that they will do so. If we add to the single
universal credit mix all these multiple localisations, including at
least two important strands of the benefit system—the social
fund and council tax benefit—those layers will lead to an
explosion of requests for advice at the very least, and potentially
more formal requests for assistance and
appeals.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said earlier, that is all the more problematic because the advice and
legal aid sector is facing an unprecedented squeeze. I spoke about the
Child Support Agency and the tax credit system and the undoubted
problems that successive Governments have had to deal with, but at
least both those major problematic changes in the benefits system were
cushioned by the existence of a healthy legal aid sector that was able
to represent people who needed help. As things stand, with the Green
Paper on legal aid reforms and the pressure of local
authorities’ spending cuts, we will be introducing universal
credit, greater sanctions and conditionality, and a plethora of
localisation agendas without having that security blanket of legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
numbers are truly staggering. On the welfare benefits side alone,
143,000 cases were assisted with legal aid just last year, yet the
current Ministry of Justice proposals will remove legal aid entirely,
taking benefits advice out of its scope. That means that people with
genuine cases will be far less likely to be able to receive justice and
representation than they are now. Universal credit delivery will be the
poorer for it, because it will not be able to hear ways in which the
service could be improved.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000048">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">All Members,
newer and older, will be familiar with the sight of a constituent with
a carrier bag who has come to see us about debts and problems that have
led to a potential repossession of their home, or about a disbenefit or
sanction that has been applied to them. All those problems multiply and
compound one another. Sometimes, we Members of Parliament are able to
help—we are possibly a little underrated as one of the arms of
the advice and assistance service. I know that we all do our best, but
we are not trained or resourced to be specialist advisers. Above all,
we are not trained and resourced to represent people with genuine cases
who need representation. I am sure that all of us have turned at some
stage to a citizens advice bureau, our local law centres—if we
are lucky enough to have them—or other voluntary advice agencies
to ask for help representing people, or challenging a bad
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When people
are represented by a specialist or an independent adviser, the outcome
is strikingly different. Recent parliamentary questions confirmed how
important that is; the difference in the success rates for those
represented in first-tier tribunals and those who are litigants in
person is absolutely staggering. 51,000 cases were won at first-tier
appeals. Those people would not have been represented at all if the
cuts in legal aid had been in place. They were, by definition,
victorious in their appeals, and their cases were therefore genuine.
Such people would not get help—apart from a very small number of
examples where a case is allowed, perhaps because it raises an
exceptional question of policy—but they would not have been
successful at their tribunals had they not received
representation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
entering a universal credit system in which, as things stand, people
cannot be represented through legal aid, and possibly not through
Citizens Advice or other advice organisations dependent on other
sources of funding—for example, the London grants scheme, or
local authority grants, which are all squeezed and are all reducing
their capacity to fund advice. I will pre-empt the hon. Member for
Dover by making the point that that is extremely poor business sense,
because all the evidence demonstrates that having good benefits advice
in place is good value for money. I have the figures here; for every
£1 spent on welfare advice and representation, the state saves
£8.80. If there is a false economy, it is not representing
people through legal aid and other advice services in social welfare
law across the piece, but especially in the area of benefits advice,
and yet we face the situation that I have
described.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000053">&#160;</a>

only the absence of advice? Bad advice is also extremely damaging to

judicial system. We know that cases with litigants in person invariably
take longer. They request more delays and are unfamiliar with the
procedure at tribunals and in the courts. It is unsurprising,
therefore, that many of the representations made to the Ministry of
Justice on welfare rights and legal aid were on exactly that point. The

view across the board—from those who are concerned purely with
the interests of clients to those who are concerned with the efficacy
of the advice, the representation and the judicial system—is
that this is a bad move. By taking universal credit into unchartered
waters, we are taking massive risks. At a time when both the advice
sector and the judicial sector are under massive pressure, we have a
universal credit that leaves swathes of policy unclear, which will mean
that much of the Bill will have to be clarified later in regulations.
Subsequent regulations will leave advisers struggling to interpret the
constant changes in the legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are a
number of difficult inconsistencies in the regime. The central thrust
of the Bill is about clarity, integration and simplification, but
confusion will result from localism. There will be a harsher regime of
conditionality and sanctions—sanctions that should rightly apply
to those who seek to evade their duties. No one on the Opposition
Benches would argue with that. However, such a regime will inevitably
catch within it a number of people who have simply committed an
innocent error, or who are innocent victims of bad decision making or
institutional failure on the part of Government. I am not implying that
this Government will be any worse than previous Governments. Even if
they are better than previous Governments in this respect, there will
still be hundreds of thousands of people every single year who will be
innocent victims of bad decision making, contradictions, errors in the
policy, or failures that arise from the workings of the IT systems. It
is fanciful to pretend
otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
we seek, therefore, is a simple, cost-free amendment that requires the
Secretary of State to tell Parliament what provision is being made
across the piece to ensure that those who need it get face-to-face
communication with the DWP as they make their claims and declare a
change of circumstances; independent access to advice; and independent
representation in the tribunals and judicial system where necessary.
Given the problems with budget-setting for legal aid and advice, and
our concerns about a number of problems within the universal credit, I
would have thought that this was a simple, easy amendment for the
Minister to accept, and I look forward to him doing exactly
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000059">&#160;</a>

                           </div>me from emphasising one or two important points. I speak from 10
years’ experience of running organisations that were engaged in,
among other things, the provision of welfare rights advice. There has
never been enough advice, and we are now in a position where we will
have even less advice available. I echo my hon. Friend’s
comments about the particular need for advice when new systems and
benefits are introduced. As she said, transitions are never simple or
straightforward, no matter how well planned or how good the intentions.
It would be at best optimistic and at worst irresponsible if the
Government did not prepare for extra resources around advice and
information to be available over the period of transition. That is what
the amendment focuses attention
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a couple of points. The first is about the importance of
welfare rights advice in relation to the Government’s broader
anti-poverty agenda, because it is important that we keep reminding
ourselves that the purpose of these reforms—a purpose the
Opposition endorse—is to make serious inroads into poverty.
Indeed, the Minister has made important claims for the extent of
poverty reduction expected as a result of the universal credit. It
would be highly regrettable if the Government’s projected gains
in poverty reduction were compromised by people’s inability to
take up their entitlement under the universal credit, therefore
defeating the Government’s own
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
suggest that it is important for all of the universal credit proposals
to be poverty-proofed. The amendment is about poverty-proofing by
ensuring that the infrastructure for advice and information relating to
the benefit is properly in place. As I said, there has never been
enough advice, and advice agencies across the country are now
struggling all the more in the face of a range of cuts and redesigns to
the services they are offering. This is against the backdrop of local
authority cuts; the coming cuts to the legal aid budget; and the likely
reduction in funding for debt advice, as, for example, it is not clear
what will happen to the Financial Inclusion Fund after next year.
Rights agencies are doing their best to maintain levels of advice, and
to operate more efficiently and redesign and reconfigure their services
to meet these funding cuts. None the less, they are increasingly
struggling to meet the needs that exist. In my own borough, the local
authority welfare rights unit, the law centre and the citizens advice
bureau—all of whom do excellent work for people in need of
benefits advice—are seriously concerned about how they will meet
the level of need they can see will
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North specifically mentioned our
concerns about the proposed cuts to the legal aid budget, and the
wholesale removal of categories of social welfare law. With regard to
the universal credit, we are particularly concerned about the wholesale
removal of legal aid in relation to benefits problems. The Government
have suggested that the loss of legal aid funding will not cause too
much difficulty to the social welfare sector because other advice
agencies will be able to take up the slack. From my own knowledge of
those advice agencies, and indeed in their own words, that is highly
unlikely.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In evidence
to the Justice Committee earlier this year Age UK, the Child Poverty
Action Group and the Free Representation Unit all made absolutely clear
that, for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 572<a class="bkMark" name="Column572">&#160;</a>
                           </div>one reason or another, they would not be able to fill the gap left by
the loss of legal aid funding for social welfare matters. Indeed, in
some cases, where the Government assumed that they would fulfil this
function, it had never been their remit to provide that kind of advice.
In the case of the Child Poverty Action Group and the Free
Representation Unit, neither of them has ever offered first-tier advice
to benefits claimants. It is, therefore, unlikely that they will be
able to move in at this point to fill a gap that is actually outwith
the infrastructure that they currently have, let alone that which they
might try to have with reduced future
funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend points out, we as MPs are unlikely to be able to take up
the slack. We lack the expertise. We lack the capacity. Our
constituency offices are not generously staffed. I speak for my staff
and I am sure I speak for the staff of all hon. Members when I say that
our constituency caseworkers provide us with excellent support, but
none the less, as my hon. Friend said, both from a capacity point of
view and when it comes to difficult technical questions, they, too,
need to refer to the experts and we are concerned that that expertise
will no longer be
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
endorse what my hon. Friend says about the difficulties with
transitions. We have heard from Ministers over many months that there
may in time be less need for advice in relation to universal credit
because it will be simpler. But even beyond the transition period, it
probably will not prove simple to experience it, at least for some of
our more disadvantaged benefits claimants or those with complex
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
debated issues in recent weeks where there is likely to be some
confusion, complexity and possibly contention. They include determining
in a couple who is the main carer of a child and who should therefore
receive the payment for children. There is the issue of overpayments
and the recovery of overpayments, which was rehearsed eloquently and at
some length this morning by my right hon. Friend the Member for East
Ham. There are also issues that have not yet been discussed and on
which I hope to table some amendments relating to the position of
European Union nationals. They are likely in many cases to be entitled
to claim under universal credit, but there are always complex issues of
residence and entitlement and I can say from my experience that a very
considerable amount of welfare rights advice has had to be deployed on
this in recent years. I do not expect that to
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000067">&#160;</a>

matter of legal entitlement. We are signed up to a set of treaties
about the free movement of labour and that includes entitlement to
labour market benefits in the EU countries subject to those treaties.
We have been able to negotiate some periods where full rights have not
been introduced immediately for new accession states, but those rights
are not in place indefinitely. I make no judgment on whether EU
nationals in this context ought to have those rights. I simply point
out that in the current legal framework they have those rights and we
have to ensure that they are exercised appropriately. Indeed, some of
them may not have rights to some

                           </div>benefits and it is appropriate that they are told that early on so that
further time and money is not expended on trying to defend a case that
cannot be substantiated.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other issues
which I think will be complicated, either as a result of the
introduction of universal credit or other welfare reforms that the
Government are making, include the changes to housing benefits which my
hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North mentioned. I would also
highlight in that context changing roles in relation to non-dependents
and child care, where we are still completely unclear, as are the
Government, as to what sort of proposals we will have for the payment
of child care support. A range of changes is coming through to
disability entitlements, many of which we have rehearsed and more of
which we will discuss in Committee. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the
changing sanctioning regime is also highly likely to create a demand
for more support and
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Welfare
rights units and welfare rights agencies do not only seek to deal with
problems. They also have a proactive and preventive role in helping to
increase take-up. I am pleased that the Minister has placed so much
emphasis on their wish to see take-up maximised under universal credit.
In my experience, independent welfare rights agencies have had a very
significant role to play in helping to maximise take-up to ensure that
people are aware of their entitlements, to conduct programmes of
education and information, to encourage people to feel confident about
making claims for benefits to which they are entitled, and to support
them in making those claims, particularly where those claims are for
more complex or discretionary elements of the benefits system. I want
and expect Ministers to say that, as part of their own purpose to
maximise take-up, which I welcome, they want to ensure that the
independent advice sector is properly resourced to help them in that
endeavour. With the cuts that are coming down the line, however, I fear
that it will not
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000071">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other area that I particularly want to mention about the significance
of welfare rights advice is a philosophical one about the relative
bargaining strength of the citizen and the state. Inevitably, there is
an imbalance of power—what is called an inequality of arms in
the legal context—between the might of the state, which is well
resourced, well informed, holding all the cards and making decisions
about a claimant’s entitlement, and the individual. No matter
how well informed an individual may be about his or her own
entitlements, that inequality exists, and that is exacerbated when the
individual is disadvantaged, vulnerable or desperate. Those making
claims for financial assistance are, in a sense, always desperate,
because if that claim is not properly executed, they could be left
destitute, homeless or, at the least, under considerable financial
pressure and at risk of falling into
debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not right for that inequality of bargaining power to be left
unaddressed, nor is it right to say that Jobcentre Plus advisers or
Work programme providers can meet the need of advocacy on behalf of the
claimant, because they are part of the system. There may come a time
when the claimant needs to be able to access advice that is 100%
independent of the state. That independence in the welfare rights
sector is something that we all want to see protected. It is something
that we should guard 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 574<a class="bkMark" name="Column574">&#160;</a>
                           </div>jealously. It is important not only in protecting individual claimants,
but, while Ministers on the whole do not like it when it is happening,
philosophically we can all agree that it is also important in keeping
the welfare system honest. It ensures that we have a welfare system
with integrity and with the highest standards of delivery and decision
making. It is that ability to ensure that there is really good expert
independent advocacy that ensures that we have the high quality social
security system that this country aspires to. Of course, it is
particularly important that independent advice can be obtained for the
most vulnerable in society. I highlight people with language
difficulties, learning difficulties or mental health problems, who are
particularly in need of independent advice if they are to be able to
have their cases properly advocated against the authority of the
state.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North
about appeals and the concerns that we have that universal credit may,
at least for a time, generate a higher level of appeals. In a tribunal
setting, it is particularly important that the individual is well
represented. I am aware that Ministers, particularly those in the
Ministry of Justice, have often made the case that it is perfectly
possible to go to tribunal without legal representation, but, as my
hon. Friend has pointed out, the best results and greatest efficiency
are achieved when people are appropriately represented. If people are
not well represented, many cases may end up in tribunal that would
never get there if they had been dealt with by an expert professional
earlier on in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that there are already a significant number of appeals arriving at
tribunal as a result of Department for Work and Pensions
decision-making procedures, and we are particularly aware, going back
to the transition point, that this happens when new procedures and
benefits are introduced. The work capability assessment is a good
example of how a transition period is always problematic and is likely
to lead to much higher volumes of appeals. I recognise and welcome the
efforts that the Government are making to improve that decision-making
process, but, at least for a time, we are seeing a substantial number
of appeals going through as that new test beds
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are also well aware that disability living allowance is an area where
there has been a high level of success on appeal, because the benefit
is complicated. We look forward to the debate in the next few days on
the reform of disability living allowance, but nothing that I have seen
so far suggests that it will be a simpler benefit to claim than it is
now. It will be different in a number of respects in its intention,
philosophy and design, but I am concerned that it will not be much
simpler for people to ensure that they are equipped to claim it. We can
expect, at least initially, a substantial level of appeals following
the introduction of the personal independence payment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000076">&#160;</a>

put in place good quality welfare rights advice, which ensures that
individuals are always able to access their financial rights and
entitlements in full, we will pile up costs in the system; we will
disadvantage individuals; and, importantly, we will undermine work
incentives. If people have to spend time trying to sort out their basic
benefit entitlement, they will not be in a position to go out and look
for work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000077">&#160;</a>

is important for all the reasons that I have outlined. It requires
Government to make absolutely clear the consideration that they have
given to all those issues and concerns, and the steps that they are
taking to address them, ahead of the migration to universal credit,

tribunal service? What quantification of that cost has been made? What
offsetting savings from providing good upstream welfare rights advice
has the Minister taken into account? It seems to me that there would be
sensible, value-for-money reasons, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Westminster North has said, for getting this right first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000081">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I remember working on advice
about the change from supplementary benefit to income support, on the
change from invalidity benefit to incapacity benefit and on the change
to tax credits. At all those times demand for advice increased because
the benefit system supports the most vulnerable, for whom a small
change in income means a tremendous amount.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such people
are the most aware of the imbalance of power, which my hon. Friend the
Member for Stretford and Urmston has referred to, between the state and
the individual, and they need to go to a trusted agency that they feel
can redress that balance of power. They do not usually want to go to a
faceless agency that they have not heard of before. They do not want to
go to the agency that administers the benefit; they want to go to a
trusted brand such as a law centre, a citizens advice bureau or a local
advice agency that has built up that trust over the years and has
probably dealt with a number of their issues, which may have had
nothing to do with benefits, before.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Advice
agencies are already seeing an increase in questions about what will
happen to disability benefits and to universal credit. What is going to
happen to people’s benefits? As I said, these are the people for
whom a small change in income means the most, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 576<a class="bkMark" name="Column576">&#160;</a>
                           </div>they are already worried. I believe that including advice agencies in
legal aid and allowing them to deal with social welfare law was one of
the great progressions of the previous Labour Government, because it
recognised the clusters of problems with which people came to advice
agencies.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People who
come to advice agencies usually have not one but a number of problems.
If they are not getting the right amount of benefit, and they have not
done so for a number of years, they are likely to have problems with
debt and often will have gone to loan sharks. Not providing correct
welfare benefit advice at an early stage increases the likelihood of
loan sharking, debt and housing repossessions, as has been mentioned
before. Those issues have a cost to the state, as well as a cost to the
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
removal of the social welfare law will affect 97% of advice agencies,
which are not what the Government refer to as fat-cat lawyers, but
local advice agencies. Some 50% of advice agencies surveyed say that
they do not expect to be able to provide the service that they are
providing now in two years’
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
can give a practical example of a bureau losing funding. A bureau that
I worked in lost its social welfare contract last year. The number of
welfare benefit advisers went down from nine to three. We had just
about reached the stage at which we could get people an appointment
within three weeks. People are still waiting three weeks and when they
are not getting the correct amount of benefit, that is three more weeks
without the correct amount of money to live
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
local bureau in Wigan, which I now represent, has already written to me
saying that if it were to lose its social welfare law contract at the
same time as the introduction of universal credit, it would not be able
to deal with any welfare benefit cases of a specialist level. The
Government say that such cases are not serious and not complex, so it
will not matter because other agencies or volunteers can pick them up.
I assure the Government that volunteers work best when supported by
specialist welfare benefit advisers, because they are trained and can
shadow the
advisers.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the system will be simplified, the application process will still be
complex. People will need support with the application process. Yes,
volunteers will be able to do that, but only when they are supported by
specialist advisers and are thoroughly trained. Completing application
forms correctly will save time for the Government agency. Going back to
an individual time after time to ask them to fill in the form again, or
to ask them what they mean by a particular answer, will be costly,
time-consuming and completely pointless if the advice is
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston about
the importance of locally tailored advice. People want advice about
their local circumstances. They need to know about the social fund,
council tax benefits and discretion. All the advice needs to be locally
tailored.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
return to the point about specialist advice. We talk about test cases,
which may well go through, but we need a specialist adviser at the
beginning to identify cases that could be important, not only for the
individual who has come into the agency, but for other individuals
across the country. Without that we would never have had the Mallinson
decision, which did so much for blind and partially sighted
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I now go on to
the social policy area. Advice agencies not only deliver advice, but
provide an invaluable service to the Government by telling them the
unintended consequences of legislation. Something can look perfectly
sensible in a Bill—as with tax credits, unfortunately—but
the operation on the ground can have unintended consequences. Advice
agency networks, such as the Advice Services Alliance and Citizens
Advice, get together to provide reports to Government so that
legislation can be changed, because unintended consequences have caused
misery for a number of people across the country. Not having such
networks will mean that we lose all contact with those consequences,
and individuals will be left struggling. The cost of not receiving the
advice will be higher than the cost of providing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have looked at debt advice, and I have already said that if benefit
claimants do not receive the right advice to claim their benefits, they
are more likely to get into debt. One bureau that I know of has proved
that a number of suicides can be prevented by debt advice; three
suicides were prevented in the past year, which would have cost the
state of some £500,000. That is simply a monetary cost of the
suicides.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For the small
cost of advice, we would gain a considerable amount in preventive work,
and that work will come on to the state. People will be coming to our
surgeries, and I absolutely believe that we are not equipped to deal
with that at all. Case workers do a fantastic job: in my own case, we
have the Citizens Advice information system, but it only takes us so
far because we are not specialists.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000094">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">To lose the
specialists and rely simply on volunteers—however well
trained—will mean that people will lose access to the highest
level of advice. I do not believe that that can possibly be a saving.
Before we implement any new system, we should ensure that people have
access to advice. It is no use giving people rights without allowing
them the means to exercise those rights. Equally, people can be told
their responsibilities. As my hon. Friends have mentioned, they can be
advised whether they have a case or
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
system will simply clog up with people who believe they have a case
because a man in the pub told them they had the right to do something.
It happens all the time: you hear people coming in and saying,
“But they told me I was entitled to this benefit.” A good
welfare benefits adviser could say, “Actually, that isn’t
the case, I’m afraid. You will have to go away and we can look
at other options.” These people will go ahead and take their
cases to tribunal; the system will be delayed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I support the
amendment and simply say that there has to be adequate welfare benefits
advice at the introduction of any new system and throughout any system
of advice; it will not just stop. There will always be new claimants
who need it. Face-to-face advice and all ways of accessing advice are
important. It is not good enough simply to have a telephone advice line
because people often do not want to speak to a telephone advice line.
If they are in debt, they quite often have pay-as-you-go phones and cut
themselves off at certain periods because they cannot afford to pay
those bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Face-to-face
advice is valued by a considerable number of people, including the most
vulnerable. Not only do

                           </div>they go to the bureau, but the advisers go out into areas where people
cannot get advice in any other way—for example, secure units
where people claim benefits, hospitals and hospices. Advisers go out
into all those places. Yes, that costs money, but what it saves to the
state and what it saves in terms of human misery is
incalculable.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000098">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I am no Luddite about
using the internet and when I was a councillor and executive member for
housing in Edinburgh, we used a system of both paper and internet
applications for our housing application system. We used a choice
system; we were the first Scottish local authority to go over entirely
to such a system. There were people who said, “Oh, this will
never work. People will never be able to get access.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have to say
that those who were over-pessimistic were wrong. The number of
applications that came in was much higher than even we had anticipated.
But underneath that, we also found that a number of those applications
were coming in because people had gone to places to get advice and use
the facilities to find out how to set about the issue. People were not
necessarily sitting at home doing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other consideration is the complexity. The Government are very keen to
talk about this as a universal benefit, although I would describe it
best as a single benefit. But if it is a single benefit, it is a single
benefit with many arms and legs. In the debates that we have had on
various aspects of it, it was quite clear that there were complexities.
It might be wrong to assume that, just because increasing numbers of
people have, for example, used internet applications for job
seeker’s allowance claims in recent years, this will be just as
simple. On the whole, the former is a more straightforward benefit; it
does not have these various arms and legs—the housing aspects,
the child care aspects, the child payments and the disability
payments—because they come through applications for other
benefits. The jobseeker’s allowance application is much more
straightforward.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
presume that other aspects of what people have to do when claiming
benefits will be carried over. One of the things that we have observed
with housing benefits over the past 10 or more years is the increasing
amount of verification that people have been asked to produce to make
claims and establish their entitlement to housing benefit for their
property. They have to get information from their landlord and if they
do not produce information, they are not able to get the benefit to
which they would otherwise have been entitled. The help that people can
get to prepare all that and know what they should put together at any
one time can be invaluable and save a tremendous amount of time. We
have found that, where that has been done at a council office or
housing association level, the whole process was speeded up, because
people got
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not saying that we cannot use new technology—it could be
extremely helpful—but the process will probably still be
difficult, given the complexities of the benefit, which will have to
deal with many different aspects and circumstances. We cannot assume
that people do not need good levels of advice. As my hon. Friends have
already said, the saving to the system of having good advice in the
first place, as opposed to picking up the pieces afterwards, is
invaluable.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure that
many Members know just how difficult it can be to get good advice. In
my city at the moment, people have to wait up to six or eight weeks for
an appointment at the advice shop run by the local council, which is a
far from easy situation if they are in difficult circumstances. The
voluntary group that often picks up some cases in the
city—people are desperate and go to them because they cannot get
an appointment with the larger agency—is struggling to survive
at the moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At my most
recent meeting with the group in the past month, its representatives
indicated that they may not be able to survive. Our citizens advice
bureaux have, I suspect, always survived on a shoestring, albeit
effectively, but they are concerned about the kind of service that they
can offer. On that basis, we would be foolish if we did not make sure
that there is a real chain of advice that is delivered—where
possible, locally, and not by having to look something up or by reading
documentation to check someone’s eligibility and the exact
information
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that, at times, we all find completing forms to be not as easy as
it seems. I find the census form challenging in places, because some of
the questions are difficult to fit into one’s circumstances. I
struggled to decide where I lived at one point and how that fitted into
the form. I have a lot of education and I still struggled with the
form. I hope that we can agree that it would be valuable to be in a
position to say, with confidence, that, when the new benefit comes into
being, advice will be available to those who need
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I pay tribute
to the work of our citizens advice bureaux. They are an extremely
important facility in our society. I have had discussions with Citizens
Advice. Members will be aware that we have already extended a hand of
welcome to the Prince’s Trust to put volunteer bureaux and desks
in jobcentres. When it is appropriate and possible to do so and it
helps local citizens advice bureaux to spread costs, I am very happy to
see them either moving into or having a presence in jobcentres as well.
The partnership between the two is extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the big point that has been missing from all the Opposition’s
comments during the past hour and 10 minutes is the fact
that this is a simplification exercise and it will be easier and
quicker to interact with the benefit system. There will be fewer
interactions because, as people move into and out of work, many of the
adjustments to what they receive will take place automatically as a
result of the flow of real-time data when there is a change of
circumstance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is
particularly the case for people who are currently receiving support
through the tax credit system. One of the issues around that system has
been the need to report on an annualised basis, so that an assessment
of tax credits can be made on the basis of the previous year’s
income. As a result, great complexity has arisen. All that will now
happen on an automated basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000110">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of course, a
substantial proportion of claimants also move on to and off benefits
regularly. Many of the first claims for universal credit will be new
claims from people who are going through exactly the same process as
they would normally in terms of sitting down with an adviser in a
Jobcentre Plus office or making contact by telephone. Having done so,
those people will have a relationship with the DWP—the welfare
state—that will be much less complex and will require fewer
interactions than would previously have been the case as they move on
to and off benefits, and enter and leave a mini-job. Jobcentre Plus
advisers will not have to do one of the most time consuming things that
they currently do: assess whether an individual is better off in
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Opposition
Members also seem to have forgotten some of the good work that they did
in government. I pay tribute to all the people who work for Jobcentre
Plus because they have demonstrated over the past two or three years
that they are very good at rising to a challenge. When Jobcentre Plus
dealt with a large number of claims at the start of the recession, it
handled the situation with great skill and in a way that was
impressive, smooth and ensured that difficult times were dealt with as
effectively as could possibly have been
expected.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000112">&#160;</a>

efforts of Jobcentre Plus staff. I, too, think that they rose
incredibly impressively to the challenges of an increased case load
during the recession. However, does he not accept that, conversely,
problems with the work capability assessment, at least initially, have
recently demonstrated the difficulties for Jobcentre Plus, its agencies
and agents when handling the introduction of new procedures? That is
not a reflection of the staff’s abilities or commitment; it is
simply the case that the challenge of change often—if not
invariably—brings such difficulties in its
wake.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is no doubt that the work capability
assessment system we inherited had shortcomings. However, that relates
to a different situation from processing a benefit claim, which is what
we are talking about this afternoon in the context of the introduction
of the universal credit. We are talking about a very different part of
the process. Universal credit simplifies that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Aspects such as the current employment support
allowance will fall within universal credit. Therefore, surely many of
the processes will still have to take place because the proposal
encompasses all those aspects. It is not correct to say that universal
credit is completely
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000115">&#160;</a>

of course, a new claim—a first claim—made under either
the current system or for universal credit requires someone to go
through the process of sitting down with an adviser, talking to an
adviser on the phone or submitting an online application. However, with
the introduction of universal credit, if somebody enters work for three
or four weeks and leaves again, the system can adjust
automatically. They will have to sit down and continue the
job search process but, by definition, universal credit uses
real-time data and requires fewer interactions because the system can
adjust

changes of circumstance can be handled automatically, so although there
is significant pressure on the organisation in introducing universal
credit, that also leads to a reduction of activity in other areas. The
question that underlies the amendment is not about legal aid or the
future of Citizens Advice, but about whether the Jobcentre Plus
organisation has the ability to provide adequate interaction with
individual claimants to ensure that their claims are processed and
handled as accurately as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I say this to
Opposition Members: we have set aside £2 billion to manage the
process of universal credit’s reaching maturity in the latter
part of the current spending review period. We have made a substantial
investment, not simply in establishing universal credit, but in the
resulting transition arrangements. We know that, as an organisation,
Jobcentre Plus has the ability to respond to rapid change; it did so
very effectively at the start of the recession. We already provide
extensive advice to claimants through Jobcentre Plus itself, through
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, and through local authorities
via a variety of other means. We have, of course, inherited the
mechanisms to provide advice online though Directgov, including the
online benefits adviser, which currently provides customers with advice
on entitlement to up to 28 benefits, pensions and tax
credits.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000119">&#160;</a>

important point was made about the different channels of access, and of
course we accept that not everyone can access the internet. We
certainly have a goal of increasing online access to benefits. That is
in keeping with the growth of online activity in our society as a
whole, and it is right and proper that we keep pace with that change.
We have no intention of removing the right of access to a face-to-face
application. Nor do we intend to remove the right to an application
over a telephone line, which is a common activity for Jobcentre Plus.
They have the biggest virtual call centre in Europe, giving applicants
access to a substantial number of advisers, and if one office is full,
the telephone call simply transfers to the next. There is a big
resource there to provide people with the right mix of
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000120">&#160;</a>

contact centres—we will of course provide guidance for claimants
about where they need to go to get that support. Localisation
inevitably means that decisions will be taken locally. Local councils
will decide how best to promote and set out the support that they

reduce the number of interactions with the welfare state. We will use
all available resources and channels, many of which were established

delivered good advice to people for a long time. They are all still in

will ensure that all those sources of advice will include information
on universal credit, and how potential claimants can access support if
they think they are eligible. We will provide information about the
migration to universal credit and how it affects current claimants. We
will provide information on how we give additional support to those who
require it when they migrate from the existing benefits to universal
credit, including help with accessing and using online channels, and
advice for those who cannot use online
channels.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000124">&#160;</a>

is a matter for us to get right within Jobcentre Plus. We have got to
ensure that the transition is smooth and that the information is
provided. We are not considering people who walk in off the street. To
a substantial extent, they are existing claimants, people we are
already dealing with. In some cases, they will be in a position in
which circumstances do not change, the amount of money received does
not change and the migration is virtually
automatic.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
give the Committee an absolute assurance that we will put in place the
appropriate support that is needed. We will use the channels that are
already there, many of which we inherited from the previous Government,
to deliver that support, advice and guidance to ensure that we get it
right. At the end of the day, the process is a simplification, it does
not make the system more

came through the doors of my bureau were of people who felt that they
had been placed in the wrong group. They felt that they should have
been in the support element or that they should not have been in the
work-related activity group. Appealing a decision made by Jobcentre
Plus is not something that Jobcentre Plus can do itself, and people do
not believe that, as good as Jobcentre Plus staff are, they will appeal
their own decisions. So where are those people going to

things, if the Minister was so confident of his case, he would not have
found it difficult to accept an amendment that merely requires him to
satisfy himself and Parliament that the provision will be in place. I
am also disappointed that he misheard, or chose to mishear, my initial
contribution, because I made it clear that universal credit has the
considerable merits of integration and simplification, which we
support. I accept that that is the case, and I accept that, after a
transitional period—although one hopes earlier rather than
later—there will be a falling-off in the need for advice and
representation on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friends have made clear in their helpful and important
contributions, this is by no means the only aspect of universal credit
and the associated elements of the benefit system that will integrate
with it in which problems are likely to occur, and advice and
representation are likely to be necessary. We talked about council tax
benefit, the social fund and localisation and complexity. We talked
about the increase in conditionality, which is where I expect
significant demand, increased pressure in the system and decisions to
be
challenged.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
discussed issues with overpayments. My hon. Friend the Member for
Stretford and Urmston made the point that overpayments are particularly
serious when it comes to child care payments, which will not be subject
to real-time calculations. I do not think that some of those
overpayment problems will be reduced. We also talked about
discretionary housing benefit and the role of
discretion.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
some cases, those problems will remain the same. In others, if only in
the transitional period, there is likely to be increased
demand—possibly quite significantly increased demand—in
the system. It seems that the Minister has decided not to have the
lifeboats. If the Titanic had had enough lifeboats, the story would
have been rather different. If people had merely got their feet wet, we
would not have had a calamity, and we would possibly have been spared
Leonardo DiCaprio attempting an Irish
accent.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
sensible decision making must involve adequate safeguards. With the
system and staff that the Minister is paying tribute to, as we all do,
there are currently 143,000 legal-aided cases in the welfare benefit
system alone—without transition, without upheaval, without

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment highlights the fact that we are in a striking and unusual
position for such a Committee in that several of the key decisions
about how the system for which we are legislating will work have not
yet been made. That is not just a theoretical point or a point about
parliamentary niceties; it means that, unfortunately, we cannot
scrutinise the legislation, because Ministers have not yet decided what
the legislation is. It means that, for example, the implementation of
the IT to make all this happen cannot fully go ahead yet, because
nobody knows what the IT will do.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
proposes that, in the four key areas of child care, passported
benefits, the treatment of the self-employed and savings, consultations
should happen and decisions should be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I
want to be brief, but I shall say something about child care, which has
already been mentioned a couple of times today. The Secretary of State
was frank in his evidence to the Committee before we began scrutinising
the Bill, and he told us that Ministers have not yet been able to come
up with a proposal on child care. We understand the problem: Ministers
want to give funding to help with child care to a much larger group of
people than has received it up to now, but they do not want to spend
any more money on it. That appears to mean that

                           </strong> Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is
particularly important that we have such a consultation because there
seems to be some misinformation about child care provision? This
morning the hon. Member for Dover suggested that the number of child
care places had decreased between 2003 and 2008, but in fact the number
increased by 61%. Although that includes school places, even excluding
those, an increase of approximately 33% occurred in the number of
available places.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000165">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful
correction to the information that was given to the Committee earlier,
which accords much better with my observations and understanding. None
of the consultation that I thought that the Secretary of State
announced on 28 March has taken
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000166">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I cited a figure of approximately 1.3
million, and it is quite true that I got that slightly wrong. The total
number of places for child care in 2009, according to the child care
and early years survey that was conducted that year by the Department
for Children, Schools and Families, was 1,671,000. That was, indeed,
slightly up from 2006, when the figure was 1,619,100, so it was a rise
of about 30,000. My key point was that the increase in the modern world
of having both parents work means that a greater need exists for child
care. It is not a partisan point; it is a bipartisan point that we need
more help with child care and more understanding of the pressures of
modern family life.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000167">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
frankness in telling us that he was mistaken earlier, and that the
figures had increased. I agree that the need for child care is growing
and needs to be met. Child care is crucial, and it is an impediment to
the work of the Committee that we still do not know what the
arrangements will be. It is not only child care—paragraph (b) in
the amendment refers to eligibility for passported benefits. We do not

that there could be some wider discussion, although I look forward to
receiving the advice that the SSAC will provide. As we are required to
establish whether the Bill will ensure that everybody is better off in
work than out of work, we need to know who will be entitled to free
school meals, because that makes a large difference to whether people
are better off in work. At the moment, we have no clue about what those

                           </strong> I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will be
pleased to know that I agree with him about the need to consult.
However, I am afraid that his amendment has the wrong effect in seeking
to do that. We intend to consult on several specific issues before
implementing the universal credit; indeed, in some respects, we have
already done so. We have already said that 2013 is the planned start
date for new claims. In the meantime, we have a number of issues to
work through properly. Clearly, it is our goal to have a smooth launch
and to address completely and satisfactorily some of the issues that
have been raised in this debate and in response to our previous
consultation. Of course, we have already consulted on the original
Green Paper and on the White
Paper.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem with doing as the right hon. Gentleman suggests now is that we
will have gone through those consultations. We will then have a
statutory responsibility to do them all over again because, of course,
the Bill will not become law until later this year. I reassure him that
we are doing that work now. For example, let us consider the issue of
child care. We are, indeed, moving ahead with a consultation; we will
be holding a series of seminars with key stakeholders and I hope that
he and his colleagues will feel free to take part—they will
certainly receive an invitation. We intend to hold those seminars
during the summer, so that we can examine the best options to support
parents to meet the cost of child care in the future. We will certainly
be writing to him and his colleagues to invite them to take part, and
we will be inviting a variety of organisations to take part and make
recommendations to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Passported
benefits are, of course, a complex matter because it is outwith the
Department’s remit. That is one of the reasons we have asked the
Social Security Advisory Committee to consider it. We are working
closely with the devolved Administrations and other Departments that
are responsible for those benefits, such as the Department for
Education in terms of eligibility for free school meals. That
Department may also carry out some consultation. However, we are
looking to SAC, which is resourced and has a secretariat funded by the
Government, to make recommendations to us. Given the nature of the
issue and the expertise that exists on SAC, it seemed appropriate to
ask it to make recommendations to the Government. Again, once those
recommendations are produced, we will be very happy to receive the
views of the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000174">&#160;</a>

rules of universal credit, we have been much clearer about our
intentions. We have had a detailed debate and I have no doubt that we
will have further debates. However, we believe that we have taken a

consultation is not appropriate. With regards to self-employment, as
the right hon. Gentleman knows, we will continue to talk to the various
groups that have raised concerns. We are effectively consulting on that

on as many aspects of the Bill as we possibly can. We will start to
introduce draft regulations in the next few days. Indeed, we have the
first set of draft regulations, which we will make available to the
Committee almost imminently. I will be providing him with as much
information as we possibly can as we go through the process of

Gentleman and his colleagues, but then we reach Royal Assent and there
is a statutory duty to do the whole thing all over again. That would
not be helpful. I hope, therefore, that he will accept my assurance
that we will consult as much as possible, because we want the proposals
to be durable. We want people to have confidence in the legislation,
and we want it to last. The right hon. Gentleman should have no fears

this is a probing amendment, I will certainly not press it to a vote,
but I would like to record that I would be very dismayed if the
commitment that the Secretary of State made to the
Committee—that we would have the proposals on child care before
we conclude our work—is not honoured. That would be a very
serious omission, because the whole point of the Committee is to
scrutinise whether people will always be better off in work, which is
clearly the Government’s intention. If we do not have all the
facts about the costs of child care, we cannot assess whether that
intent will be delivered. However, there is no point in pursuing that

Minister says and from what others on the Government side sometimes
say, I gather that there is a sense that they have come up with a
panacea to all the problems with which we are familiar in the welfare
system. A few minutes ago, he told us that advice will not be necessary
because it will all be automated. I do not want to be unkind, but that
view is naive. The Government have not come up with a panacea; there
will still be a lot of problems, and they have not all been

is the Department’s intention that all new claims for benefit

Government has been shocking: disgraceful, wasteful, incompetent and
failing. The new Government have been looking at this carefully, as has
the Select Committee and it seems that a central part of the problem in
the past has been an oligopoly of IT providers. The movement to smaller
and more fleet-of-foot IT providers who can be more “can

had responsibility as a Minister for this Department—I occupied
the Minister’s office for a time—and I was also
responsible for HMRC. The praise that I directed towards the DWP and
its record on IT systems would certainly be much harder to point in the

<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>direction of HMRC, given some of the experiences it has had, including
some that we discussed earlier. In the light of that, I was interested
by the evidence that VocaLink contributed to the Work and Pensions
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">VocaLink runs
the infrastructure for the banks transactions payments system. It makes
the
point:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000202">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
does therefore appear to VocaLink to be essential, from the viewpoint
of developing the Universal Credit on the timetable envisaged, that DWP
should engage with HMRC: to ensure that PAYE Reform remains on track to
be delivered in time… to ensure that the interface between
DWP’s and HMRC’s systems enables DWP to make efficient
and effective use of RTI; to ensure that PAYE Reform is taken forward
in such a way that it can straightforwardly both achieve the
aspirations of HMRC to improve the functioning of PAYE and meet the
requirements of DWP in respect of the Universal
Credit”.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000491">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
started to worry about all this last summer when I read the Green

states:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

thought that that was an extraordinary claim. This will be an immense
IT project. Rewriting the entire benefits system is not going to be a
major IT project—what on earth was whoever wrote that thinking
of? All of us know the difficulties with tax credit. That will be just
one module of this system. This will be an enormous project; it is
hard, frankly, to think of anything that will be bigger in terms of
public sector IT. It will be very large. It will be difficult to get
right and it will be difficult to deliver on time. It is not very good
to start out, as the Green Paper did, by being in denial about its
being a major IT
project.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000205">&#160;</a>

the opportunity to visit the Department to discuss the challenge with
officials. I have done that now on two separate occasions. I have high
regard for the officials I spoke to, the officials I worked with when
was I was in the Minister’s office. They explained to me their
confidence that this system can be delivered on time. However, I do not
share their
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000206">&#160;</a>

I met the officials in the autumn, I wrote to the Secretary of State
setting out the basis for my scepticism, and he provided a full and

feasibility work carried out by Intellect, the IT trade organisation,
which he said had endorsed the Government’s approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000208">&#160;</a>

might be criticised by the hon. Member for Dover for representing the
clique of suppliers to which he referred, but I have a high regard for
it. I worked closely with Intellect when I was a Minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry, and I asked it whether it endorsed
the approach and the time scale that the Government have set out. The
director general of Intellect, who I know, did not say yes or no; he
advised me to read the report that it had provided to the
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Department
initially told me that I could not read the report because it was
commercially confidential. When I asked the Secretary of State,
however, he immediately said that I could. I am grateful to him for
that. The Intellect report is an interesting document. It starts by
presenting a
question:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000210">&#160;</a>

realistic?”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000493">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
then gives quite a long answer, and the answer is not
“yes”. We are told that suppliers’ views varied
considerably:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“While
many felt that from a technology perspective the timescales appeared
achievable, this came with heavy
caveats.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
does not sound like a “yes” to me. Of another group
involved in those discussions, the report
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Some
felt the timescales were aggressive and a cause for concern,
particularly since the precise requirements are unlikely to be
confirmed before the… Bill is approved by
Parliament.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000495">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
have just heard that that is absolutely true. It says of the third

unrealistic.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000496">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
agree with the third group; I certainly do not agree with the first
group.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
report makes interesting reading, and it cogently sets out the reasons
for the scepticism of that third group; its thinking is much clearer in
the report than the more optimistic views expressed by the others. The
report gives part of the explanation for the scepticism of that third
group of
suppliers:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000215">&#160;</a>

months for the core development is possible if done properly using
agile, but unrealistic given the number of additional traditional
interfaces, and in particular the one from HMRC. The split dependency

is deliverable. I mention, by the by, that the Intellect report makes
the point that, yes, more can be achieved with the agile approach to IT
development, whatever that is, than with conventional approaches.
Intellect gives the example of British Airways, which has done much
more with the agile approach than with previous approaches. It makes
the point, however, that British Airways had five years of culture
change before it started on those agile approaches, and I am afraid
that the Government have had none. The hon. Gentleman

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is clearly a difference of view between the two Departments, and I
think that Dame Lesley Strathie is absolutely right. The danger is that
Ministers have set a time scale that is not realistic. There is then
enormous pressure on officials to say, “Yes, it can be
done.” We have often seen in the past what happens in reality
when that approach is taken. I commend the permanent secretary to HMRC
for saying what is true. We are talking about a much bigger and
significantly longer-term task than Ministers have so far
recognised.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
only the time scale that she comments on; she makes the point that it
is never going to be 100% accurate. A few minutes ago, the Minister was
telling us that we should not worry about anyone needing advice because
it will all be automated, yet the permanent secretary to HMRC, who will
be responsible for delivering this automation, has pointed out to
him—and us—that it is not going to be 100% accurate.
Indeed, that would be impossible.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How accurate
will the system be? Well, it says in the documentation that came out
with the spending review last October in the name of the Treasury, the
DWP and HMRC, talking about using real-time PAYE information to inform
tax credit calculations,
that:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
costing assumes that the PAYE data has an accuracy rate of 90 per
cent.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000504">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 594<a class="bkMark" name="Column594">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">What is going
to happen to universal credit calculations, bearing in mind that those
have to be undertaken not just once a year but every single month? What
will happen to the 10% that are wrong, and how will they be corrected?
With reference to our earlier debate, where will those on the receiving
end of these wrong calculations go to try to sort out the problems that
result? These are big and difficult issues that are going to take a
significant time to
resolve.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
other important point on which I would be grateful for the
Minister’s comments is this: surely it will be necessary for
this real-time PAYE system to collect data on hours as well as on cash
received per month? Let us leave aside for a moment the requirements of
in-work conditionality. We have had exchanges about that previously,
and it is still not clear to me how people in jobcentres are going to
establish whether people are working more hours or fewer hours without
those hours data being collected by the system as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is, however, another point here. The benefit cap, which we will debate
in a few days’ time, will not apply, as I understand it, if a
couple work more than 24 hours a week between them. For
people who are in the frame of the benefit cap, as a fair number of
working claimants will be, the universal credit calculation will need
to work, first of all, by assessing the amount of universal credit that
will be payable—other things being equal—and then by
considering, if that amount is above the cap, whether the benefit cap
applies.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Establishing
that will require applying the 24-hours test. To do that, I think, the
number of hours worked by one of the couple and then the other will
have to be added up, and it seems that that will be possible only if
the system knows how many hours both of the couple have worked. I may
be wrong, and there may be some other way to apply that 24-hours-a-week
test, but I cannot see what that would be. Will the real-time PAYE
system—I agree with the hon. Member for Dover that that is
certainly one of the serious weak points in all this—collect
hours data as well as pay data? If not, how will the IT system know
whether to apply the benefit cap each month when it calculates
people’s universal credit
entitlement?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000233">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend asks an interesting question, and I
hand it straight to the Minister. I look forward to hearing his answer.
I suppose that something could be done with national insurance numbers
within the universal credit system, but it will not be
easy.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
original justification for the ambitious timetable was that the task
was similar in scale to the implementation of employment and support
allowance. I am familiar with that because, for some of the period
while the ESA system was being built, I was the responsible Minister.
In that case, policy was complete on Second Reading. It was a stretch
and not an easy task by any means, but implementation followed
successfully two and a quarter years later. In the case of universal
credit, implementation is due just over two and a half years after
Second Reading, so the period is three months longer.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

			Column number: 595<a class="bkMark" name="Column595">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
against that, the scale is much bigger, because the entire benefit
system will be rewritten. Secondly, unlike in employment and support
allowance, key policy decisions, as we have been discussing, have still
not been made. We do not know what is happening about child care,
self-employed people or passported benefits, so nobody can be getting
on with developing the IT to do those parts of the calculations because
nobody knows what those calculations will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, to
return to the point made by the hon. Member for Dover—Intellect
drew attention to this as well—there is a crucial and difficult
dependency on the system at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs,
and the permanent secretary has drawn attention to some of
the constraints there. Finally, the Department does not have any
previous experience of agile development. To say that doing it by agile
will solve all the problems strikes me as
over-optimistic.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a further major worry about council tax benefit, the exclusion of
which from universal credit is a setback for reform. We were initially
told that local authorities would not need real-time earnings data. The
Local Government Association told the Committee that it was negotiating
to obtain them. It is hard to see how local authorities could manage
without such data when working out their own localised version of
council tax benefit. When the Minister commented on that earlier today,
he said that it would all depend on how they worked out their council
tax benefit calculations. I am sure that that is true, but it is hard
to see how they could do such calculations every month without access
to real-time pay-as-you-earn data. The LGA certainly thinks that they
need those data.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That creates
a large number of further interfaces. There will be not only one
difficult interface now with HMRC, but another interface with every
single local authority in the country. Who knows precisely what the
state of the systems at the local authority end of that interface will
be? Nobody can start writing those systems yet, because, as the
Minister told us, the Government are still some way from legislating
for the new localised council tax benefit systems. The system will have
to interface with all those.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposals
also create a large new data privacy problem, because if the PAYE data
will be shared with local authorities, highly sensitive personal data
will be available to staff in every local authority in the country.
That certainly adds to the concern that Intellect has expressed in its
report about security and the potential for
fraud.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000241">&#160;</a>

more concerned about the instances where many—possibly
most—local authorities have contracted out the management of
their existing benefit systems and have contracts that go beyond the
introduction of universal credit? It will be a question of sharing data

organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000242">&#160;</a>

                           </div>had indicated. Intellect has suggested that the four-year transition for
existing claimants—the period between 2013 and 2017, when
existing benefit claimants are due to be moved over to universal
credit—may well prove even more challenging than the October
2013 milestone for new claimants. That is because of the constraints of
ensuring that nobody ends up worse off than they were before the
transition started, and of course we all want that to be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
real problem here about the feasibility of the timetable—not
about the approach; not about the rightness of the intent that is being
set out—for delivering the proposal. If that intent is
maintained for the time being, we are heading for some serious
problems. They can be averted, but that requires some courage on the
part of Ministers and a recognition that the system is not going to be
capable of handling all new applications from October 2013, which I
understand to be the current intention. It may appear rather rash on my
part to say that the system will not be ready by October 2013, but I
feel fairly confident in making that assertion.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000244">&#160;</a>

recipe for disaster. The consequences for the reputation of the

those who depend on the benefit system could be catastrophic. The

the amendment and the recommendation that we should have a pilot phase
before we move to the full introduction of universal credit. The reason
why I do not agree with the detail of the amendment, although I know he
has used it as a vehicle to raise broader issues than simply this, is
close to the central issue of our discussion of the use of agile
technology. For those who do not fully understand the approach that we

                        <p class="tabbed">The
best way to describe our approach is that we are building the software
for this in layers. There are 250 different pathways for
people signing up for universal credit—different sets of
circumstances that would come together to create an entitlement for
universal credit. We are building those layers one at a time. We have
already started to develop the simplest, most straightforward pathways
within the system. Over the next two to three years, we will build
layer upon layer to encompass the different variations that can exist
within a universal credit
claim.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000247">&#160;</a>

many respects, we are testing each of those pathways at each stage of
the development of the product. We are not creating a single engine and
then firing it up on one day. We are putting in each component and
making it run as we put it in place before we move on to make the next
component run. That is the basic principle of agile technology, and we
have used that principle in the Department, although not in the current
form, through the departmental lean programme. We have engaged

have worked with companies such as BT and British Airways and Vodafone.

robust system on time than would have been the case with previous
programmes.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
we move to the implementation phase, we will do the same thing in some
respects. We will start with new claims and then build a group at a
time. We will start beyond those new claims with people in the tax
credit system and then move on either regionally or on a group basis to
migrate people one step at a time. This is not a big bang. It is not
like day one of tax credits where people were either entitled to tax
credits or not. We will migrate people one step at a time over a
four-to-five-year period. Therefore, I do not recognise some aspects of

would not add very much. It is difficult to see how one could construct
a pilot within the phased roll-out that I have described, and I do not

Gentleman will recognise that these are simply new claimants. The
proposal does not encompass the millions of households that are
currently in receipt of tax credits or existing out-of-work benefits,
so it relates only to one group of the claimants with whom we will deal
in any year. We will migrate our way, step by step, through many
millions of households over a period of up to five years.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000252">&#160;</a>

question of needing to get to a point in October 2013 where everything
happens in one go overnight, as happened with tax credits. People were
either entitled to tax credits or they were not. Such credits did not
exist previously; along they came; and a big bang approach was
necessary. That is why I do not think it right to try to carve out an
additional pilot stage, given the layered approach that we are taking

infrastructure that we need to deliver universal credit. Substantially,
it is a development that uses systems that we already have in place.

universal credit real-time earnings element will need to be developed,
but that will also use well-known components that are used elsewhere on
the DWP estate. As a Member of Parliament who represents a party that

to know that many parts of the system that will be needed for universal
credit will use the systems that he put in place for the employment and

systems that are being developed within HMRC, the right hon. Gentleman
is right that they are moving ahead, but I do not recognise some of the
dates that he has mentioned. HMRC will go ahead with a pilot in less
than a year’s time, with volunteer employers and software
developers. Remaining employers are expected to be on real-time
information systems by April 2013. All employers are expected to be
using that system by October 2013, to coincide with the start of
universal credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000257">&#160;</a>

Office has looked at the joint-working arrangements between the two
Departments and has praised us. Believe me, having gone through the
process of getting the Work programme contracts up and running, I know
that there is a lot of scrutiny from elsewhere in the Government, and
so far we have had the thumbs-up. Indeed, I have sat with officials in
the Cabinet Office who have praised both the leadership of universal
credit and the progress being made, which is extremely important. So
our view is so far, so good.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000258">&#160;</a>

ability to deliver major projects on time. I understand why he has done
that. He is bruised by many years of being part of a Government who
failed to deliver major projects on time. In my view, with clarity of
purpose, effective ministerial leadership and a vision of what we are
trying to achieve, without the propensity to chop and change many times
along the way, it is possible to deliver projects on time. We have just
gone through the process of Work programme contracting, and we
confounded the initial expectations of officials and actually completed
the process some months earlier than they said that they
could.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000259">&#160;</a>

is that it would not be appropriate for a Minister to seek to
gerrymander a contracting process. The contracting process for the Work
programme was carried out by officials. It was independently audited.
It reached a result based on the criteria that were set out for the
bids. The winning bids won. She would not expect me, or any other
Minister, to seek to intervene in the contracting process, to
gerrymander it for political convenience. Although I might have liked
to see an additional social enterprise provider in the private
contractors, it would have been utterly wrong for me to try to change a
fair, open and independently audited contracting process. That is all I
have to say on the matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000261">&#160;</a>

the point in hand, I suspect that the right hon. Member for East Ham
and I will have this discussion on many occasions over the next couple
of years. I hope and believe that he is wrong. We welcome his scrutiny
and the difficult questions that he is asking. It is his job to do that
and it helps to keep us and our officials on our toes. I do not believe
that he is right to hold those concerns. In preparing to lead the Bill
through the House, I have asked many questions about these issues. This
can be done. It will require a lot of effort, determination and
commitment. Most fundamentally, however, given layering approach that I
have described, a pilot is not appropriate or necessary to deliver the
project.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000264">&#160;</a>

have offered so far to share his concerns with us and to explain to him
what we are doing. I think that we are on the right track. I have lot
of a confidence in the team of officials. In particular, the right hon.
Gentleman raised concerns about what was in place before ESA was
introduced. The difference this time is the agile approach and the fact
that we are building the systems one layer at a
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000265">&#160;</a>

is not necessary for every decision on every aspect of policy to be
made before we begin to build those layers. The straightforward bits of
the system can be done first, and the more complex cases can be layered
on top. That gives us time to work through some of the issues that we
are discussing in Committee and in the Department to try to get them
right, and we can build the other layers on top at the
end.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000266">&#160;</a>

is that there is no experience of using agile techniques in central
Government—certainly not in the DWP—and to say that we
have found a new way of doing things that will solve all the previous
problems is unduly optimistic. I want to press him on a specific point
that I put to him earlier. Will the real-time PAYE system collect hours
data, as well as money data? If not, how will the 24-hours-a-week
working couples test be applied?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000267">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are unlikely to do it on an hours basis.
There are a number of ways that we could do it; we could relate hours
to the minimum wage and achieve a formula, for example. We are unlikely
to seek to use the system to collect hours worked—I think it
would be extremely difficult to do that—but we are considering
the best way to set the appropriate
parameters.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000268">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Unless the Government assume that everyone is
working for the minimum wage, such a formula will not apply the test of
whether a couple works 24 hours a week between them that the Government
have said that they intend to apply. I cannot understand how that can
be done without hours data.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have to work out the most sensible way of
doing things. One option, in setting a threshold that people have to
pass to reach a certain state—for example, the point at which an
individual is no longer subject to in-work conditionality—is to
set an earnings threshold that is equivalent to a number of hours in a
full working week on the minimum wage and to say that, when someone
reaches that threshold, they are no

to collect hours data; seeking to do so would cause real difficulty. Is
the Minister saying that the proposal that a couple will be exempted
from the benefit cap only if between them they work more than 24 hours

instead?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clearly, we need to set a relationship between
hours and amount of money earned. There are only two permutations.
Either we calculate the number of hours or the amounts of money, or we
find a mechanism to relate the two. We are unlikely to collect hours
data, but we might seek to create a formula that linked the two. If
someone earns more than the equivalent of the minimum wage for a
defined full-time week, they move beyond in-work conditionality. That
is an example of how we can set a formula that moves people beyond a
certain point in relation to a number of hours without counting them.
It would be quite impractical to count them, but we can create a
formula that links an income and a number of hours and sets a threshold
in cash terms. We will probably want to come up with a formula of that
kind. I will happily provide the right hon. Gentleman with more
information as we take those
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000272">&#160;</a>

failed to come to it. That is relatively straightforward. If two people
are registered as a couple in a household, a stream of earnings data
will come in for both of them and the system will simply examine the
household income together. If the hon. Lady and her partner are on
universal credit, the system will track real-time earnings data for her
and her partner, and it will make a household calculation based on the

                        <p>I
shall speak about the amendment rather more briefly. As you will
recall, Mr Weir, the previous Conservative Government were famous for
the number of changes they made to the definition of the unemployment
claimant count, all of which had the effect—perhaps
unsurprisingly—of reducing the number of people who were stated
to be unemployed. What will the current Government do about the
claimant count? It is an important national statistic, showing the
number of people who claim jobseeker’s allowance, which we are
abolishing. As JSA will no longer exist, what will the Government do
about publishing data on the number of people who claim benefit as a
result of being out of work? Will there be a continuous sequence of
data or statistics of some kind that would be consistent with those
that are published at the moment about JSA? Once universal credit has
been introduced, what will the Government publish in place of the JSA
claimant count?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000308">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the right hon. Gentleman started with a
reminder of history, I will remind him of some more recent history. The
previous Government alleged that they had abolished long-term
unemployment by moving young claimants on to training allowance for a
couple of weeks, then moving them back on to JSA, and claiming that as
a return to zero day unemployment. There is more than one way of
viewing history, but he raises a serious point. What is different now
is that all 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 602<a class="bkMark" name="Column602">&#160;</a>
                           </div>those things are subject to guidance from the Office for National
Statistics and the International Labour Organisation—indeed,
sometimes frustratingly so. I am sure that he would agree that aspects
of the ILO system that classify a full-time student looking for a
Saturday job as an unemployed young person is pretty daft. I know that
that is a view that has been shared by Labour and Conservative
Ministers. They do not always get it right, but none the less they have
the independence to make a decision about how these things should be
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000309">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that ending JSA will
inevitably lead to a statistical change, simply because we will not be
counting JSA claimants any more. We intend to work closely with the ONS
to consider the impacts and develop alternative measures of
unemployment to complement the standard definition given by the ILO,
which of course will remain unchanged. The headline figure quoted month
after month will remain. We see this as a decision that really must be
endorsed and supported by the
ONS.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Personally,
I think that it should be relatively straightforward to continue a
similar definition to the current one. We will need to be able to
identify the number of people on universal credit who are unemployed
and looking for work through the requirement to sign on fortnightly and
undertake a job search through Jobcentre Plus. I assure the right hon.
Gentleman that we will reach a very transparent conclusion with the
ONS, explain why and how we are taking the steps that we take, and make
public the findings and recommendations for future measures of
unemployment. It will be totally transparent, and I hope that we will
come up with a measure in which hon. Members of all parties and members
of the public outside this place, will have full
confidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000311">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly share those aspirations. In fact, it is
a little disappointing that the Government have not been able to think
a little further about what they will do about this, though helpfully
the Minister has acknowledged the need to do it, and to agree it with
the ONS and others. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

                           </strong> This group brings us to the important topic of the
transitional protection that existing benefit recipients will be
offered when universal credit is introduced. The Government’s
intentions are clear, at least at the

                           </div>highest level, and they are set out, for example, in the note that we
were sent on the regulations for schedule 6. I will read a
sentence:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000318">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Government has confirmed that there will be no losers as a result of
the move to universal credit where the circumstances remain the same,

                        </p>
                        <p>That
sounds good, and we are all pleased that that is the case. It does,
however, leave a number of important questions unanswered. In
particular, when the Government say that there will be no losers where
the circumstances remain the same; what counts as a change of
circumstance that invalidates the promise of no losers? That is what I
hope to establish in discussing the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
understand the theory that people will not be worse off on transition
unless their circumstances change. There will be a cash protection for
them, and as benefit rates are increased over time, their entitlement
under universal credit will catch up with what they receive under the
old system. At that point their protection will no longer apply, it
will no longer be needed, and they will be on universal credit
alongside everybody else. That raises some important questions to which
we do not know the answers. I hope that the Minister will be able to
give us those
answers.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000320">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
kind of change in circumstance will negate the promise of protection?
If somebody receives a pay rise, for example, it would mean that their
benefit entitlement under both the old system and the new system would
be different. Will that count as a change of circumstance? If so, would
the no-loser promise no longer apply? What if their relationship status
changes? If their relationship breaks down, or if they enter a new
relationship, would that invalidate the no-loser promise? What about
the birth of a child or simply changing job, even if the new job offers
the same pay as the old job? What about a change of hours—we
have touched on that—or child care costs going up? Do all, some
or any of those count as a change of circumstance that would invalidate
the protection
promise?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000321">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is right. If one takes a broad
interpretation of the term “change of circumstance”, most
people have several of those every year. The promise that nobody will
lose out from the move to universal credit is pretty meaningless if it
applies only for a few weeks until the next minor change of
circumstance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
question is how long the promise will apply. Will it apply
indefinitely? Will people be protected for ever if, because of their
particular circumstances, they would benefit from that protection? A
few minutes ago, I mentioned Intellect’s point that, in its
view, achieving full transition of existing claimants to universal
credit over four years could be impossible if the commitment is going
to stay in place permanently. I must say that I 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 604<a class="bkMark" name="Column604">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hope that it will, because there are plenty of previous examples of
transitional protection that has lasted for a long time, and it should
do so in this case,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
119 simply requires that the regulations providing for transition must
rather than may be provided. Amendment 125 raises an important concern,
because paragraph (3)(a) directly contradicts the assurances that
Ministers have given. Ministers have assured us that recipients should
not be worse off because of the change to universal credit, but
paragraph (3)(a) says that they will not be worse off by more than a
“prescribed amount”. That is a very different
proposition. When Ministers say that there will be no losers, do they
mean it? If so, why is there a provision in the Bill that states that
people will not be worse off by more than a prescribed
amount?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
the note on regulations is illuminating. Having told us that the
Government have confirmed that there will be no losers, the note
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is not the Government’s current intention to pay less than the
existing award, but this power could be used for example to ignore very
minor changes in award between the two systems, such as by a margin of
£5.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000506">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
appears to be saying, “Well, if it’s only £5 a
week less, nobody will notice and it won’t cause any
problems.” For a lot of people losing £5 will be a
serious problem. I am glad that the note says that the Government do
not intend to pay less, but I am worried that the Bill contains a
provision to set a threshold, such as £5, that says,
“Well, if it’s only a £5 loss nobody is going to
bother.” I am afraid that people will
bother.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister will accept amendment 125, and so deprive
himself of the wriggle room that the Bill gives him in clear
contradiction of the assurance that he and his right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions gave that there will be no
losers. I hope that the amendment will be accepted to confirm that that
is the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
120 would require payments under the transitional arrangements to be
uprated in the same way as other payments under universal credit. As I
understand it, that is different from the Minister’s intention,
which is—I hope he will tell me whether I am right—that
the protection offered will be in cash terms only. As inflation affects
what is being paid, universal credit will, sadly, go up in line with
the consumer prices index only, but that will eventually catch up with
the amount of benefit that people were receiving under the old system.
Amendment 120 would secure real-terms, not just cash,
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000329">&#160;</a>

amendment 121 takes us back to the questions that I asked at the
beginning about what exactly constitutes a change of circumstance, and
it proposes that the Government set out in regulations the things that
would enable transitional protection to be dropped. What are the
changes that someone would have to go through to be no longer confident
of being protected by the promise that no one will lose? As it is, we
just do not know what will amount to such a change in circumstances. As
I said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and
Urmston, if any change of circumstance negates transitional protection,
the promises that Ministers are giving are frankly meaningless, because
many people have many changes of circumstance in a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000330">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s series of questions. Schedule 6 provides
illustrative detail on how we will handle the transition from the
current benefit and tax system to universal credit. For many claimants,
universal credit will provide support that is the same as, or higher
than, that in the current system. We think that 2.7 million households
stand to receive a higher amount under universal credit. Some people
could, of course, be entitled to less under universal credit, and we
are clear—it is a cast-iron commitment—that there will be
transitional protection in place in cases where the amount of universal
credit is less than the previous entitlement. We need the flexibility
to make that work as effectively as possible. It is a transition that
requires careful thought and planning. The illustration of how we may
use the powers in the schedule is not a definitive programme. It has to
cover a range of options to provide that flexibility, but it is a
genuine offer. I am happy to give that clear commitment on behalf of
the Government, and we are committed to fulfilling
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are considering the precise details of the cash protection—for
example, when it is appropriate for transitional protection to be
reduced or to cease, and what circumstances might trigger
that—and we will provide more information in due course. I will,
however, give some clear illustrations to the right hon. Gentleman, as
he requested. I want to ensure that we get this right and that people
moving from the current system to the new system are sufficiently
cushioned from the changes in a way that is both affordable and
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000332">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
119 simply seeks to confirm that transitional protection will be
offered. It is not necessary to put that in primary legislation,
because it is already an integral part of the package, and there is a
clear commitment to it. We will ensure that people are not worse off as
a result of the transition from the past system to the
new.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
125 aims to ensure that any amount of cash protection paid is not
limited. We are not planning to set a limit, and no limit is set out in
our plans. The paragraph that the right hon. Gentleman seeks to amend
clearly indicates that regulations can ensure that the transitional
protection is enough to make sure that there is no reduction as a
result of the transfer to universal credit. We have the regulations
that will do the job that he wants. That is our preferred approach, to
revisit the bookcase: to create a system that is flexible, in exactly
the same way that he and his colleagues sought to do when they
introduced ESA and previous welfare reforms, by making sure that a lot
of the detail was put in secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000334">&#160;</a>

reaffirms the firm commitment that he and his right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State gave that there will be no losers, yet the Bill says
that there can be losers, but not by more than the prescribed amount.
Why is that provision in there if the Minister is standing by the firm
assurance that there will be no losers? Surely he should accept the
amendment and remove that
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000335">&#160;</a>

when it amounts to a few pence, so the amendment is an unnecessary

example, is a change of circumstance. Moving into a mini-job for two or
three days is not a change of circumstance, because the basic principle
of universal credit has to be the ability to operate reasonably
flexibly. There will be a number of things that represent a major
change of circumstance, but a tweak or an inflationary increase in
annual child care costs is not the kind of thing that will mean that a
person will lose a large chunk of their protection. We will take a
common-sense approach. When there is a material and significant change
in circumstance, the transitional protection will end. When there is a
minor change that results from a natural part of the system—an
inflationary increase or whatever—we will clearly use common
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000338">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Bear in mind
that the whole principle behind the introduction of universal credit is
that we encourage people to take mini-jobs. It is clearly not sensible
for someone who takes a mini-job to lose all their transitional
protection. If they make a major employment change, that may be
different. We will apply common sense; when there is a material change
in someone’s life, that is the point at which their transitional
protection will come to an end. We will give full information about
that and provide an opportunity for the House to debate the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000341">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That depends on the scale. We will have to use
common sense. A major change in a person’s employment situation
could include them moving from unemployment into a reasonably well-paid
job that

some form of dividing line, but I do not see someone getting a two-day,
temporary job as being a material change in circumstances. Again, it is
an area where I am happy to have an offline discussion with the right
hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. We are still defining the specific
detail of where we should draw that dividing line. I hope that the
Committee has a sense of what is a small issue and what is a large

take in the near future, and I can give an undertaking that we will
provide information to the House when we do that. I have given the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 120
would ensure that any cash protection applied to an award is uprated.
Let us be clear that it is not our intention to uprate cash protection
along with the rest of the entitlement. There may be a few people whose
circumstances will not change and for whom a cash protection top-up
will be paid for an extended period, but we expect that the cash
protection will erode step by step over time. We think this is a fair
and balanced approach in what are challenging times financially. To
take the approach set out in amendment 120 would potentially amount to
a spending commitment that we do not feel able to make. I do not know
whether the right hon. Gentleman feels that his party’s
financial plans would permit it to make that spending commitment. We
have taken a clear policy decision that it will not be uprated, and
that is the right approach to
take.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000346">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a fascinating area. We look forward to
considering it in more detail. From the Minister’s conversations
with the Department for Communities and Local Government about council
tax decentralisation, can he tell us whether the changes in
circumstances that would apply to council tax recipients will be the
same as those that will apply to universal
credit?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000347">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> By definition, the localisation of council tax
benefit and the development of individual localised schemes would mean
that it would be impossible to apply a national rule to every localised
scheme, so it is not my expectation that that would be the case. We are
dealing with the protections available in universal credit and the
successors to council tax benefit, and the support provided therein
will be a local matter for local authorities to decide. That is what
localisation is all about, I am afraid. It is about local decision
making on how to deliver support to people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000348">&#160;</a>

all about acting fairly and reasonably and effecting a smooth transfer
to universal credit. The purpose of a significant change to the benefit
and tax credit system is to drive work incentives and offer greater
simplicity to claimants, not to make people worse off. We have been
clear that we will provide transitional support. That is an absolute
undertaking

where it is now, because it is about as clear cut as it could possibly
be. We have explained simply that that protection will be there. It
will decline in real terms; it will remain constant in cash terms. It
will only cease if there is a material change in someone’s
circumstances. I do not feel that those things need to be written into
the Bill. We have made our position clear, so I cannot accept the

                           </strong> The Minister has frequently told us that we are not
here to write the books but just to build the bookcase, but a few days
ago he gave us some encouragement when he said that he recognises that
MPs need the chance to look at the books and approve them before they
take their place on the shelves, even if subsequent changes to them do
not get the same degree of
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000369">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments draw attention to some regulations that I hope the Minister
recognises as falling into the category of needing to be considered
under the affirmative, rather than the negative, procedure before they
are put on to the statute book, particularly those regulations for
which the notes provided tell us nothing like enough. If, before I
tabled these amendments, I had heard the Minister’s answer to
the previous amendment, I would certainly have added the regulations
made under that clause to my list, but I had not. The amendments
therefore cover clause 5(1)(a) and (2)(a) on the amount of savings that
universal credit recipients, including those in work, can have before
they lose their universal credit; clause 8(3), on the taper rate;
clause 9(2) about the amounts payable under universal credit; clause
10(3) about the amounts payable in respect of children;
clause 11(3), (4) and (5) on the regulations prescribing
housing support, including mortgage interest support;
clauses 12 and 19(2) on how caring will be handled in
universal credit and in cases of limited capability for work; clause
19(3) on in-work conditionality, and the Minister accepted that the
note on the regulations was particularly vague on that clause, and it
certainly warrants scrutiny before going further; clause 19(4) about
the treatment of couples; clause 22 on exceptions to the

compliance with requirements; clause 27 on sanctions; clause
28 on hardship payments, including when loans will be made instead of
grants, as at the moment; paragraph 4 of schedule 1 on the assessment
of capital and income; paragraph 4(3) of schedule 6 about transitional
protection, which is the discussion that we have just had; and
paragraph 5 of schedule 6 on sanctions. Finally, amendment 153 relates
to sanctions and hardship payments in the transitional JSA arrangements
and proposed new clause 3 relates to sanctions and hardship payments in
transitional ESA arrangements. The Minister has previously given us
some encouragement, so I hope he will agree that is a reasonable list
of those sets of regulations that, at least on first appearance, should
be subject to the affirmative rather than the negative
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000370">&#160;</a>

has said this afternoon and in an earlier part of the debate. As he
knows, we have had the discussion in reverse in the past. I have some
sympathy with what he says, but I am not planning to accept his
shopping list this afternoon. I want to go through it carefully to see
what the right approach is. I am minded to do what the previous
Government did with some of the major welfare reform changes they
introduced: that is, to have some
provisions initially subject to an affirmative resolution, so that when
the measures are first brought before the House they are a matter of
proactive debate. To have an ongoing requirement subsequently to use
the affirmative procedure for what will become routine annual changes
would not be appropriate. It would be unduly time-consuming and would
deprive researchers for Opposition Members of opportunities to look out
for statutory instruments as they are laid, so that they can be prayed
against. That is a job to be done by the Opposition and I do not plan
to help them out entirely.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000371">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment relates to matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow Central in amendment 43. It is designed to ensure
that claimants in receipt of JSA, as opposed to the new universal
credit, are able to access the necessary personalised and localised
support to enable them to move into employment or undertake
work-related activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000379">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are all
aware that people may face substantial barriers to moving into
employment: young people, for example, may come from unstable family
backgrounds; disabled people face particular barriers; lone parents
have a different, though complex, set of barriers to moving into
employment; and, importantly, people with addiction and
substance-misuse problems may face a particular set of challenges and
need intensive support to prepare for and move into employment. It is a
matter of common agreement among all parties that that support must be
personalised, individualised and largely tailor-made and provided on a
one-to-one basis locally if we are to help such people to move
successfully into sustainable long-term employment. Ultimately, it is
good not just for the individual, but for the local community in the
widest sense when such people can access appropriate support that
increases the likelihood of their sustained participation in
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000380">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Along with my
hon. Friends, I am aware of the wide range of private and voluntary
sector organisations that will deliver such support through the new
Work programme, the prime contractors for which have just been chosen.
We know that, as has been Ministers’ intention throughout,
specialist providers, including third sector providers, will be given a
role in the delivery of the Work programme. We also welcome the
Minister’s commitment that Jobcentre Plus staff will have more
flexibility to determine particular challenges faced by individuals and
to understand the broader issues affecting their community or locality
as a whole. For example, if youth unemployment is seen as a
particularly large problem in an area, the local Jobcentre Plus will be
able to direct its funds to tackle that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000381">&#160;</a>

the increased flexibility that will be available within the Work
programme for the longer-term unemployed to access support and for
Jobcentre Plus to deal with identified local needs, but it is important
that co-operation and provision are in place at local level to ensure
that local and individual needs can be met. The amendment would ensure
that we do not move to such a hands-off market model that we end up
with gaps in the support that people need to meet the requirements of
the new welfare scheme. In particular, I tabled the amendment to
explore with the Minister the extent to which the Government will
continue to implement specific schemes to tackle specific barriers to
work, rather than simply rely on the market to generate bottom-up
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000382">&#160;</a>

recess, we heard much from the Government about the number of people
receiving incapacity benefit who have alcohol and drug addiction
problems. It was noted that some people with such issues have been
receiving incapacity benefit for more than a decade. Some of us were
concerned about exactly what the thrust was of presenting those
statistics. I certainly hope that it was not to suggest that such
people should not receive benefits, as removing their means of
subsistence is likely to plunge them further into addiction, with all
the problems that that brings; I also hope that it was not intended to
create a blame culture. People often fall into habits of substance
misuse due to significant external pressures that make them more
susceptible to being challenged by abuse
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000383">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point is that a work capability assessment will
be put in place to assess whether people are capable of work, or have
physical or mental health barriers that mean that they are at a
different point in that journey, or are unable to undertake the journey
at all. There is little point trying to second-guess a work capability
assessment that is formulated not around the name of a condition, but
around the capacity for employment. I welcome that. We have, obviously,
had difficulty with the implementation of the assessment, but it asks
absolutely the right questions and it recognises that people have a
complex range of health needs. When the work capability assessment
works well—we welcome the attention that the Government have
given to improving how it works—it will ensure that our aim is
not to put labels on people and then determine what happens to their
benefits, but to unpick the barriers to their moving into employment,
and focus support and attention on those.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000385">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is certainly the possibility for alcohol and
drug-dependent benefit claimants to be in receipt of, for example,
incapacity benefit, but there has always been and continues to be a set
of tests that determine their entitlement to that benefit. The
amendment does not suggest that the tests should not be in place and
that there should be a blanket prohibition on alcoholics securing the
financial support of the state to help them to subsist while we seek to
provide the support to move them out of their addiction dependency and
to dismantle that and the other barriers they might face to moving into
employment. My personal view is that, in the long run, it will be good
for the individual and cost-effective for the state to spend the money
up front on doing as much as we can to dismantle those barriers,
including ensuring that people have a basic level of subsistence while
we move them closer to, and ultimately into, the labour
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000387">&#160;</a>

would love to have the debate, but this might not be the place for it.
Suffice it to say that the objective of the welfare reforms is to move
people who are currently detached from the labour market towards, and
ultimately into, employment. We have a work capability assessment that
addresses what the barriers might be, and enables both a calculation of
benefit entitlement and the development of a tailor-made programme of
support—which is the subject of the amendment, Mr
Weir—to be put together for that individual. The purpose of the
amendment is to ensure that that tailor-made support is in

come to the nub of the matter, concerns are being expressed among
charitable organisations that cracks might be appearing, with
unemployed people not able to get the help that they need. For example,
DrugScope has highlighted that two support programmes for people with
drug and alcohol problems are being discontinued, with no new referrals
to the progress2work scheme after 1 June 2011 and no further funding
for dedicated Jobcentre Plus drug co-ordinators. I would be grateful if
the Minister explained how confident he is that the new provision being
put in place through the Work programme and other models will ensure
that that expert and tailor-made support continues to be available in a
different form, so that we have a proper means of dealing with and
supporting people who often have multiple and complex problems

                           </strong> I understand the hon. Lady’s point, and
her amendment is, in fact, technically flawed because it would apply
the requirement simply to jobseeker’s allowance for two years
and not subsequently to universal credit claimants, which is why I
could not accept it in its current form. Let me be absolutely clear:
the support that we provide through the Work programme will be open to
all claimants who reach the appropriate threshold, which means that it
is available to all ESA recipients, all adult jobseekers who have been
out of work for longer than 12 months, and all younger jobseekers who
have been out of work for longer than nine months, and there will also
be a block of jobseekers for whom earlier access is made available
because they have particularly challenging circumstances. There is no
question, therefore, of there being gaps in that element of the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000392">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The contracts
last for five years, but they are effectively seven-year contracts,
because the last referrals to the Work programme take place after four
years and 364 days, and they are for two years. I hope, as
we all do, that it is successful; I hope that the next Government, of
whatever persuasion, will be minded to retender the process and renew
the principles of the Work programme, and I hope that it will deliver
the kind of support that the hon. Lady wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000393">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have
created a varied pricing structure to ensure that there is a real
incentive to work with the hardest-to-help groups. We have also put in
place minimum agreed standards; each of the bidders has set out the
minimum support that they will provide to every claimant to avoid
creaming and parking, whereby a bunch of the claimants are simply put
in a room at the end of the corridor and nothing is done with them. I
hope and believe that we have put in place safeguards to ensure that
there are no cracks to fall through in the Work programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000394">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For those at
an earlier stage of their job search—the hon. Lady referred to
the work provided through progress2work—we have devolved funding
to the front line of Jobcentre Plus through the flexible fund. We are
saying to front-line Jobcentre Plus advisers and the teams in our
districts that they know what is best suited to the needs of their
areas. The challenges that are faced by Jobcentre Plus teams in Surrey
are very different from those faced by teams in inner-city areas, and I
want them to have the flexibility to tailor programmes accordingly. In
some parts of the country, that may mean spending money on support for
professionals, and in other parts it may involve providing support for
people who have addiction challenges. Those decisions should be taken
on the front line by people who understand the real need in their area,
rather than applying a one-size-fits-all plan, which has always been
the danger with the previous approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000395">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is my hope
and belief that we have not left any cracks; if we find cracks, we will
seek to fill them. The structure of the Work programme should give an
incentive to providers to work with everyone, and certainly people who
reach those thresholds will be referred to the Work programme. I hope
that that addresses the points that the hon. Lady has
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000396">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the Minister address the claimant commitment
and support? Listening to him, it would appear that those personalised
and localised support mechanisms will be in place, so what would be the
objection to linking that to the claimant commitment, as the amendment
suggests?<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000397">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> There are two reasons. First, there is the
technical reason that I have just explained—if it were made to
this part of the Bill, the amendment would simply add the claimant
commitment to the current jobseeker’s allowance structure until
jobseeker’s allowance is superseded in 2013. In 2013, the
requirement that we are considering would disappear and would not apply
to universal credit, which I do not think is sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000398">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
claimant commitment will apply to people in the early days of their job
search. For the first few months, we give people light-touch support
and the freedom to shape their own job search, and the support that we
provide kicks in only when someone begins to find a challenge in the
job search. That is sensible, because some people will want to claim
unemployment benefit and jobseeker’s allowance and will take
some time to sort themselves out, but they will not want or need
proactive support from the resources that we provide. They would not
need the money that we would be committing to them if we did so, and it
would be an unnecessary use of public money. There comes a moment,
however, when people struggle in the recruitment process, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 615<a class="bkMark" name="Column615">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and they need extra support. As they spend more time out of work, that
support will build up through some of the schemes that we are making
available through Jobcentre Plus, such as the work experience scheme,
or ultimately through the Work programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000399">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Those are the
two reasons why I do not think that the amendment is appropriate. I
hope that I have reassured the hon. Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000400">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am certainly grateful for some of the assurances
that the Minister has given us. I welcome his confirmation that, if
people meet the criteria for inclusion in the benefit and support
offered by Jobcentre Plus through the Work programme, they will receive
that support. I welcome his assurances about the demands that are being
placed on Work programme providers. I am sure that those providers will
be keen to put all that support in place, and that the specialist
providers who subcontract to them will be particularly keen to ensure
that it is effective and of good quality. I also welcome his commitment
to ensuring that devolved funding will be given to the front line in
Jobcentre Plus to provide for appropriate support at an earlier stage,
before claimants access the Work
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000401">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
I may note this in passing, Mr Weir, it is unfortunate that those
welcome assurances are made against the backdrop of the inexplicable
publicity about the numbers of people who are
drug or alcohol-dependent and are in receipt of the benefit. I worry
that that may send the wrong signal to Jobcentre Plus about how it
should spend that devolved front-line funding. It might take that as an
indication that Ministers do not think it right to spend money on
people who are drug or alcohol-dependent, because they are in some way
seen as not worthy of, or not entitled to financial or other forms of
support. I am sure that that is not the Minister’s
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000402">&#160;</a>

thing that has given me great pleasure in recent weeks is seeing some
of the leading mental health charities, including Mind, in the list of

that we should continue to strengthen the experience of decision makers
in Jobcentre Plus on mental health matters. The role of the disability
employment advisers is particularly important. We have some very
experienced professionals in Jobcentre Plus. It is very much our
intention that that role should continue. Moreover, in the ongoing
training provided to Jobcentre Plus staff, we should seek to increase
awareness of disability and mental health issues more generally. I know
that the previous Government began that work, and they have played
their part in raising knowledge, awareness and understanding. The
charitable groups that make representations to us have also played an
important role in raising awareness of such issues. My message to the
Committee and to those groups that are listening to this debate is that
we see it as extremely important for people with disabilities and with
mental health problems to have access to advisers who can give them the
guidance that they need.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000410">&#160;</a>

taken with all the available facts in front of the decision maker, and
that proper consideration is given. The amendment seeks to achieve that
aim.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000418">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
based on the presumption that it is better to get the decision right
first time, with all the known circumstances taken into account, than
for the decision maker to make a decision without looking at all the
relevant facts. Ultimately, that could lead to the claimant’s
lodging an appeal against a decision. Appeals are both time-consuming
and expensive for the Government, and they are far less likely if all
the facts and circumstances are properly taken into account before a
decision on imposing a sanction is
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000419">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
some clarification from the Minister about a general point on clause
46, which indicates that sanctions will be applied where the claimant
has been unable to demonstrate that they had a good reason for failing
to take up employment or participating in appropriate activity. I would
like the Minister to assure us that the understanding of what
constitutes a good reason will be based on full consideration of all
the relevant evidence. That includes, I think, looking at the
implications for an individual of some of the consequences of applying
a sanction, and how such consequences can be addressed and mitigated.
In particular, there are the implications of getting further into debt
for an individual who is facing a sanction or is in receipt of a
hardship payment that they subsequently have to repay. Debt is

                           </div>debilitating, not only because of the financial difficulties that it
creates, but because of the health implications for individuals. It can
be the cause of considerable stress, and stress-related
illness.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000420">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Equally,
we think it is important that, in the application of a sanction,
physical and mental health is taken into account within a wider set of
health conditions. For example, the requirement for a woman’s
pregnancy to be taken into account when applying sanctions is
important, because a sanction that cuts into what I would argue are the
already inadequate benefits that pregnant women may be in receipt of
will have consequences for the unborn child. If we deplete the pregnant
mother’s financial resources, she will of course find it more
difficult to afford the healthy diet that is so essential during
pregnancy to ensure a healthy
birth.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000421">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is not what the amendment says. It says that
that is a factor to be considered by the decision maker. We are clearly
talking about a sanction applied to an adult, but it will have
implications for her unborn child. Decision makers should give thought
to the broadest possible context when looking at how sanctions can be
effective in achieving their objective, which is to bring that woman
back into compliance with work search requirements. That, too, will
have to be considered in the context of her
pregnancy.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also important to understand that, as I said earlier, leading people
into debt may actually inhibit their ability to move back towards
employment, not least because creditors, or the bailiffs and debt
collectors who act on their behalf, will often up the ante in terms of
how they seek to recover payment of a debt as people move into paid
work. Repayment arrangements that were put in place perfectly happily
while claimants were out of work and in receipt of out-of-work benefits
can suddenly fall apart when the creditor discovers that the claimant
has moved into employment, albeit probably low-paid and possibly
sporadic employment. Decision makers should think about that,
particularly as people move back into work, to ensure that the chances
of them sustaining employment are not weakened. There is considerable
evidence that the impact of debt on people’s mental health is
substantial and significant, and mental ill health means that people
are less likely to move into
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000424">&#160;</a>

am aware of the underlying issue that the hon. Member for Dover is
really getting at, which is: am I saying that people who have
particular health or well-being needs should never suffer sanctions? I
am actually asking for a set of considerations about the way in which
the sanctions are applied and the impact that they will have, which is
exactly the same as, for example, the approach taken in the magistrates
court when they are imposing, or being asked to review or revise, a
financial
penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000425">&#160;</a>

in a position where they are no longer able to meet their housing
costs, for example. We already see this, even where the benefits are

is well known to hon. Members for its work with people at high risk of
falling into debt and facing benefits sanctions. It highlights a case
of suicide, reported by the local government ombudsman, in which the
claimant had his income stopped—in this case in error—by
the jobcentre. It was an accidental sanction, if you like, and for some
reason it had the knock-on effect of stopping both his council tax
benefit and his housing benefit. I am not clear why that followed
automatically, but it did. In the present environment, those benefits
are separate, but it is arguably more likely that such a situation
could arise when we enter the world of a single and integrated
universal credit. In the case of that individual, the council tax
arrears were enforced with maximum power. So great was his fear and
concern about the situation that he hanged himself, leaving a note
stating that he simply had too much debt and did not know how to deal
with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000427">&#160;</a>

the application of that sanction. Although I am not looking for a
blanket assurance that sanctions will never be applied to particular
categories of claimant, my concern is to ensure that those factors are
properly taken into account. This is not only a compassionate society,
but a society that wants to move people back into employment as quickly

I address the amendment, I want to touch on an important point. The
current drafting of the provision implies that private contractors will
have the right to issue sanctions, which of course is not the case. We
have no intention of taking sanctioning powers away from Jobcentre
Plus. There is a technical reason related to section 19 of the
Jobseekers Act 1995 that would make the amendment problematic, but I
sense that the hon. Lady is only seeking
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000430">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make it clear, particularly in relation to the more substantial
sanctions, that we expect full consideration of all the relevant
evidence. That is the guidance that will be given, and is given, to
Jobcentre Plus decision makers. Even under the current system, we
expect such information to be taken into account, to the extent that in
cases where there are suspected mental health problems, our decision
makers will even undertake a home visit so that they can truly
understand the circumstances of the person
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000431">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
also remind the hon. Lady that we are not talking about a total
withdrawal of benefits. We are only talking about withdrawing the
equivalent of JSA, which will be at the standard amount within the
universal credit. The sanctions regime does not apply to housing
benefit and its successor, and it does not apply to the child-related

                           </div>elements or to child benefit. Somebody with a child will not find
themselves destitute, but that is an individual circumstance anyway.
Someone who is pregnant, for example, will not lose their home as a
result of a
sanction.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000432">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Where
I differ from the hon. Lady is that I do not think we can apply
different rules to people with problematic financial situations. If
Jobcentre Plus advisers are aware that someone has a problem, with debt
for example, they already look, where possible, to refer them to a
specialist support project or support worker. That might be the local
citizens advice bureau or someone within Jobcentre Plus. Our staff look
out for individuals who need particular
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000433">&#160;</a>

may be referred to Jobcentre Plus. It is not my understanding that
Jobcentre Plus deals with people’s debt to the extent of
assisting them. The other issue is that referring people without
ensuring that appointments are available within a reasonable period of
time is not sufficient, particularly because a number of funding
streams for debt advice are finishing within the next year. The
availability of debt advice will be extremely limited. Referring
someone with a pay-as-you-go mobile to a telephone helpline, even a
freephone number, is not adequate, because such calls are quite often
charged at a high
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000434">&#160;</a>

am looking to offer space in Jobcentre Plus offices to additional
services. We are already in the process of moving, for example, credit
unions into Jobcentre Plus offices in some locations. We are bringing
in volunteer bureaux through the Prince’s Trust desk that I
described. That is why I have said to the chief executive of Citizens
Advice nationally that I would welcome discussions about whether we can
bring either a CAB presence or, in some cases, an entire bureau into a
Jobcentre. I want to see a much closer working partnership between
Jobcentre Plus and individual organisations that provide

I want a savvy group of people in Jobcentre Plus who can first signpost
people on where to go for help and advice. The presence of voluntary
sector organisations in Jobcentre Plus offices has the dual benefits of
providing an extra resource for claimants and spreading knowledge
within Jobcentre Plus. The closer that we can get to a one-stop shop
for guidance, advice and support, the better. I absolutely hear what

                           </strong> I am grateful for the Minister’s assurances
and the tone in which he responded to the amendment. I would like to
raise a couple of points that remain important. I note what he said
about claimants who are in financial difficulty and who already have
substantial debts, which sanctioning could make worse. My hon. Friend
the Member for Makerfield made some important, helpful points about how
difficult it can be for people to get themselves out of debt when
good-quality advice, for one reason or another, is not readily and
speedily
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000439">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a pity that the Minister is taking such a hard-line approach. I
understand where he is coming from: he does not wish to allow people to
run up enormous debts and then have to say, “We cannot sanction
you because you got yourself into this difficult situation.”
However, the truth is that people fall into debt primarily because they
are on such low incomes to start with and face difficulty meeting their
obligations. My concern is that the application of a sanction will
exacerbate that situation and make it even less likely for them to move
into employment and start to get themselves out of debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000440">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What lies at
the heart of my amendment is not a moral argument, but an argument of
efficacy. As I have said, that is exactly the approach taken in
magistrates courts. Rather than push people into a likelihood of
greater criminal behaviour, they take the sensible view that whatever
the reasons for someone getting into that bad situation, it is not
their role to make that situation even
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000441">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
on the point that the Minister has rightly reminded me of, he has
already given a commitment to the Committee that private contractors
will not be responsible for taking sanctioning decisions—that
such decisions will be taken within Jobcentre Plus. That is welcome,
and I am pleased that we have that assurance. Clearly, it will be
important that the decision maker does not take the information given
by the Work programme provider simply at face value. It will be for the
decision maker to seek out all the necessary evidence to inform the
decision about sanctioning, in line with the issues that the Minister
has pleasingly
recognised.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000442">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> With your expert guidance, Mr Weir, we have been
racing through the Bill this afternoon, and I have no intention to slow
down our rapid progress with this group of amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000453">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would repeat for the transitional benefit the changes that
we have debated previously for universal credit, so that the duration
of the withdrawal of benefit should be limited to one year rather than
three years; so that lower-level sanctions should be limited to 13
weeks in duration, rather than 26; and so that sanctions in
transitional benefits should not be imposed on someone with a
disability without a disability employment adviser being consulted.
Again, I am glad to have heard what the Minister said about the
continuing role of those advisers in Jobcentre Plus.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000454">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would make explicit the requirement for an appeal mechanism
and aim to ensure that hardship payments are grants rather than loans.
I have put all those arguments to the Committee previously and I do not
intend to repeat them, because the same arguments apply to transitional
benefits as to universal credit. They are important points, and I hope
that the Minister will take them to heart. Nevertheless, they are here
for completeness, rather than for the purpose of initiating a new
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000455">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
making his comments in the way that he did. A number of the amendments
refer to the appeals mechanisms, so perhaps the most appropriate way
for me to respond is to say that I think that those mechanisms are
necessary. I appreciate that there are divisions of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 623<a class="bkMark" name="Column623">&#160;</a>
                           </div>opinion in the Committee about the application of some of our sanctions
proposals. Members who do not agree with us feel particularly strongly
about the appeals mechanisms.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000456">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman’s desire to have a clear appeals mechanism for
these measures is entirely appropriate. He does not agree with the
measures, but he is absolutely right that there should be an appeals
mechanism. I want to reassure him that the appeals mechanisms provided
by the Social Security Act 1998 apply equally to all the changes in the
Bill. Nothing will change. JSA and ESA are already within the scope of
that Act and will continue to be so when they are only contributory
benefits. Effectively, all the changes in the Bill that relate to the
provision of social security support are subject to those original
appeal provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000457">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have
written to members of the Committee to set out precisely what those
appeal provisions are and how they apply. So I reassure the right hon.
Gentleman that claimants will continue to have clear appeal rights
against decisions to reduce an award in accordance with the sanctions
and that they will have the rights that they have always had to
challenge our decision if they disagree with it. That is appropriate
and necessary. It is particularly appropriate because Jobcentre Plus
does its job pretty well, but no organisation will ever get everything
100% right. Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate that people should
have a fall-back position and a proper independent assessment of that
decision. That will continue to be the case. It is written firmly into
law. The amendments are therefore not necessary, but I absolutely take
on board why the right hon. Gentleman tabled
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000458">&#160;</a>

available for such activity only during school time and school terms,
that suitable child care would be in place to enable them to undertake
employment and that they would not be required to work in
excess of 16 hours a week—that would none the less mean that
they were compliant with any other requirement that might be imposed

                           </strong> I will respond equally briefly. First, there are
technical reasons why we need to redraft the legislation and why, in
reality, it would be impossible to accept the amendment. It would
prevent the redrafting of regulations to fit in with the creation of
universal credit and the new system, and it would leave us stuck with
the previous system. There is a need to redraft the regulations simply
to fit in with the world of universal credit for technical and legal
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000465">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have been clear throughout about our intention to protect the interests
of lone parents. We have moved the threshold from seven to five, but we
have been clear about the protections that will be provided for lone
parents with children under the age of five. We have been clear about
the limits of what we expect in terms of work search for a parent with
a child at primary school. We have been clear about our recognition of
the importance of child care. With this Administration, from the Prime
Minister downwards, the intention is to adopt a family-friendly
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000466">&#160;</a>

will reassure the hon. Lady and say that the safeguards that she is
hoping and wishing for are very much there. We intend to migrate the
past rules to the new rules in the confines of what we have described
in other parts of the debate, but there are simple and practical
technical reasons why her amendment would not work. It would prevent
some of the protections that we want to import into the universal
credit world from being imported, and I am sure that that is not her
intention. I therefore hope that my comments have reassured her, and I
hope that she will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042895000467">&#160;</a>
