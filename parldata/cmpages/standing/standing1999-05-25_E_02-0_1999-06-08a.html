<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 8, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``youth court or other magistrates''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I sincerely trust, Mr. Stevenson, that you enjoyed the fortnight's break since the Committee last met. The amendment is largely probing but it would none the less improve the Bill. It might help hon. Members to follow the train of our argument if I briefly explained our approach to clauses 1 and 2.
<P>
Essentially, we have adopted a twin-track approach. First, we anticipate that the Government will seek to reverse the decision taken in the other place at Third Reading about the current discretionary nature of clause 1, particularly subsection (2)(b) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court may order the offender to be referred''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although our preference is to retain the discretionary nature of the referral order, we anticipate that the Government will seek to change the discretionary back to mandatory, so we feel that we should endeavour to make other amendments to the Bill which would improve a mandatory referral order.
<P>
Although when we come to the third group of amendments I shall marshal our arguments about the discretionary as opposed to the mandatory aspect, amendment No. 2 and some of the other amendments tabled to clause 1 would either reflect a mandatory referral order or generally improve the Bill either way. Amendment No. 2 would improve the situation either way although the matter is covered in our new clause 1.
<P>
Essentially, we cannot understand why the referral order is restricted to the youth or other magistrates court and appears to be prohibited from the Crown court. The Government's thinking is clear from paragraph 35 of the notes on clauses, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The order-making power is available in the youth court and the adult magistrates' court. It is not available in the Crown Court''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government apparently intend, however, to make the power available to a Crown court when determining appeals from the lower court. A youth court could have imposed a custodial sentence on a first-time offender who appeals against it in the belief that he should have had a referral order. If the referral order is thought by the Crown court to be more appropriate it can say so, but the case must be remitted back to the youth or magistrates court for sentence. That seems nonsensical.
<P>
If the referral orders were to be discretionary--which is our preference--it would be bad enough because it would hardly be a vote of confidence in our judiciary if magistrates can impose a referral order but judges cannot. If, as we anticipate, the referral order returns to being mandatory, the court will have no option but to refer a young offender to a youth offender panel, because a custodial sentence will not be imposed. Therefore, we do not understand why the Crown court that has considered the matter should send a case back to a youth or magistrates court for the referral order sentence. That would involve another hearing and more delay and expense.
<P>
I have tried to imagine what the Government's rationale might be. We know that they would prefer young offenders to plead guilty and to admit their guilt, because that would mean that they are mentally prepared to face up to their offending behaviour. In youth and magistrates courts dealing with such cases, there would be a general discouragement on the accused young offender from using his option to take an either-way triable offence to a Crown court.
<P>
However, as I pointed out on Second Reading, the opposite might occur in practice. In order to avoid a youth offender panel, a young offender might be advised to take the case to a Crown court. He would plead not guilty to avoid the youth offender panel. [Interruption.] The Minister looks a little surprised, but an offender can be referred to a youth offender panel only if he pleads guilty before a magistrates or youth court. If, on an either-way triable offence, he elects for trial at a Crown court and pleads not guilty, he cannot be subject to a referral order. As I said on Second Reading, that might provide a perverse incentive for people to plead not guilty if they wish to avoid the disposal of appearing before a youth offender panel.
<P>
If the accused elects to go to Crown court, he might, for reasons that the Home Secretary has recently elaborated, plead guilty. Some offenders plead guilty; there are several reasons for doing so. An offender might plead guilty to avoid a custodial sentence. He and his advisers might believe that a youth or magistrates court might be more inclined to impose a custodial sentence. Therefore, many young offenders might plead guilty in a Crown court for their first offence, and I do not understand why the Crown court should not have the power to impose the referral order on the offender. When the Minister replies, I am sure that he will tell us that the magistrate might be an important member of the youth offender panel and might seek to create a relationship with the accused. However, the Crown court should surely have the power to impose a referral order.
<P>
Other factors may determine why a first-time young offender appears in a Crown court rather than in a youth or magistrates court. For example, he may be charged with others. At the time of election of court of trial, the accused may be undecided about what to plead or unsure of what sentence to expect if he pleads guilty, or is found guilty. Associates with whom he is charged may be older than 17--perhaps 18, 19 or 20--and may make it clear that they intend to plead not guilty. Some may have previous convictions, and a further conviction would create difficulty.
<P>
Having come before a Crown court, a young offender may be advised that pleading guilty would be the best way of avoiding a custodial sentence. So it is perfectly feasible that in many cases a young offender of 16 or 17 will enter a guilty plea before a Crown court, and that all the circumstances that apply in respect of a referral order will then apply. We merely question why a Crown court cannot make the referral order. Why must such a case be remitted back to the youth or magistrates court?
<P>
There are other reasons why a case may be heard by a Crown court. For example, the offence may be an indictable-only offence. It would be a serious offence which in many instances would be likely to incur a custodial sentence, although not necessarily always. We know from constituency cases that an automatic custodial sentence is by no means a certainty if a youngster is charged with an indictable-only offence in a Crown court and it is his first appearance before a court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): It might help the hon. Gentleman's argument if he told us how many first-time young offenders have appeared before Crown courts in the past couple of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer given to me by his hon. Friend the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), when I asked how many cases there had been, as this was an important aspect of deciding how many youth offender panels would be required if, after the pilots had been completed, the new disposal was applied throughout the country to all first-time young offenders. I seem to recall that there were approximately 39,000, of which 37,000 were in youth or magistrates courts--which means that 2,000 have appeared before Crown courts each year. That is a not inconsiderable number. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, which helped me to recall an important factor in the argument which I omitted from my notes. Effectively, many youngsters can be dealt with at Crown courts.
<P>
Another factor to remember is the provision in clause 2 for a discretionary referral order where the accused pleads guilty to one or more offences but not guilty to others. Such circumstances would arise in cases dealt with by Crown courts which might involve a mix of either-way and indictable-only offences. Again it is not difficult to imagine the Crown Prosecution Service accepting a guilty plea on one charge and not proceeding with other charges, or proceedings on other charges being halted by direction of the judge, or at the request of the CPS. It is possible to envisage such cases, involving serious offences where a youngster is experiencing a first court appearance, being dealt with by a Crown court. We accept that, in the main, cases will be heard by a youth court or a magistrates court, and we entirely understand and support the Government's thrust towards, and desire to encourage, that process. But it will not happen in every instance and there will be cases in which a discretionary or mandatory referral order will apply. A Crown court should have the ability to stipulate the referral order, not least because it will have heard all the evidence and the facts and thus be best placed to determine how long the referral order should be in place--whether three, six, nine or 12 months.
<P>
Flexibility is important; the amendment would improve the Bill and I commend it to the Committee. If it is not accepted, we anticipate criticism in the years ahead.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), as his visage shows, joins us refreshed from France, where he has been building sand-castles. He has clearly got into the habit of doing so: the sand-castles that he has sought to build in Committee--as you will recall from fond memories of your childhood, Mr. Stevenson--almost immediately ooze back into the sand as soon as one begins to build them. The reason for that--[Interruption.] Perhaps the sand-castles built by the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) always stood upright. The edifice that the hon. Member for Ryedale sought to construct does not hold up because it is based on a false premise: a young offender may not elect for a trial in the Crown court, and only in exceptional circumstances will he or she be tried in the Crown court under the provisions of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The hon. Gentleman gave examples of such circumstances, usually cases of exceptional gravity or where the young person is to be jointly tried with an adult. It is only in such limited circumstances that a young person will be tried in the Crown court.
<P>
I shall not anticipate the wider debate on Government amendments to clauses 1 and 2 and the stand part debates, but we envisage the youth justice system diverting the first-time young offender who pleads guilty away from the criminal justice system; it is right that that should happen on a mandatory basis. I anticipate the hon. Member for Ryedale's anxieties, but we are determined to resist the approach of the other place. Clauses l and 2 refer not just to another form of disposal; they propose a fundamentally different way of considering how to intervene most productively and effectively in the life of a young person to stop crime and offending. In exceptional cases when a young person comes before the Crown court ab initio or on appeal, it will always be open to the Crown court to exercise its powers under section 48(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, which provides that the Crown court, sitting in its appellate jurisdiction, may award any punishment that the lower court appealed against might have awarded. Therefore, where the young person comes before the Crown court on appeal, the disposal is already available to it, without the hon. Gentleman's amendment. In any other circumstances, the Crown court will be able, where it believes it appropriate, to remit the young person for disposal to the youth court, which has all the powers that it needs to make a referral order if the judge or the bench in the Crown court believes that that would be right.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that we have responded by effectively to his concern by saying that, in the rare instances where the Crown court is required to deal with a young person and would wish a referral order to be considered, the powers exist to enable it to do so. However, as I am sure that he will appreciate, the Crown court will not normally deal with young offenders for whom this disposal is intended, because in the majority of cases that come before it a referral order is neither necessary nor appropriate. For that reason the Bill limits the circumstances in which referral orders will be available. They will be available to the youth court and the adult magistrates court. The existing law provides ample opportunity for judges, where they deem it appropriate, to use their existing powers so that the youth court may consider making a referral order.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman probed at some length. If that is to be the tenor of his speeches on future probing amendments, we shall be here for some time, but that is all to the good. I am happy to be probed by the hon. Member for Ryedale. I hope that he feels that we have responded to his concerns, and that he will not press his amendment to a vote. It is a helpful amendment, because it has enabled me to make the position clear and to assure him that we shall issue appropriate practice guidance to the Crown courts, so that they are fully aware of the powers available to them and the circumstances in which it is appropriate to consider using them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I suspect that there will be more sand-castles than the Minister thinks. He is right to say, as I believe I alluded to in my remarks, that in many instances, when young offenders are before a Crown court, the matter will be serious and they will not be thought suitable for a referral order, even when are first offenders. However, I am not sure that the Minister has explained the point.
<P>
As I said in my opening remarks, when the Crown court is the appellate court, it has jurisdiction. But as referral orders become the norm, particularly if they are applied to other than first-time offenders, there will be cases in which the Crown court has already dealt with the offence and will find it strange to have to refer it back to the youth court for the sentence of the referral order.
<P>
Doubtless those involved will be able to read this exchange in Hansard and, as the Minister said, it is always helpful to use the Committee to probe the legislation brought before it. I am happy to withdraw the amendment but, having heard the Minister's explanation, I have to tell him that he has not fully answered the point. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 12, after ``court'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, having obtained and considered a pre-sentence report,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 4, in page 1, line 14, leave out ``and''.
<P>
No. 5, in page 1, line 15, after ``absolutely'', insert ``or conditionally''.
<P>
No. 6, in page 1, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and (d) the court is not proposing to impose a fine.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Amendment No. 3 is also a probing amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> More sand-castles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Well, I am not sure that this will be considered a sand-castle by magistrates because it seeks to clarify whether, and in what circumstances, they should obtain and consider pre-sentence reports before determining whether a custodial sentence is inappropriate.
<P>
The Minister may say that the point is covered by clause 4 but, as ever, we must examine the Bill in the round, not solely on the minutiae of the subsections. We look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation. We want to probe the matter a little further, although not as extensively as I probed with amendment No. 2.
<P>
In practice, offenders will fall into three categories. I am talking about first-time offenders for whom referral orders may or may not be appropriate. First, there are those for whom custody is unwarranted or unavailable--and I suspect that there will be many cases for which custody will be unavailable. In those instances, there will be no need for a pre-sentence report. Alternatives such as absolute discharge should be available, but we will deal with that later.
<P>
At the other extreme, the offence will be sufficiently serious to justify custody, but not in the category of ``fixed by law'', such as murder. We view that as a separate category within the framework of the legislation. The Minister will acknowledge that, in the serious cases, pre-sentence reports are essential. We assume that clause 4(7) provides for when the court clearly believes that a custodial sentence is appropriate and requires a pre-sentence report for determination.
<P>
In the middle and thirdly, there could be cases for which the appropriate sentence is less obvious and the judgment between a custodial and a community sentence--a referral order is effectively a form of community sentence--is more finely balanced. Does the Minister accept that the court may need a pre-sentence report to guide its sentencing decisions? Our amendment seeks no more than to require the consideration of pre-sentence reports in such cases. Arguably, magistrates will not be able to make a judgment about imposing a custodial sentence without a pre-sentence report.
<P>
More worrying for Ministers is the fact that many magistrates may view a pre-sentence report as essential to determine whether to make a referral order and to decide whether the young offender's home life and circumstances are such that a referral order would be suitable and custody therefore unsuitable.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We also believe that it will be clear to the court if the young offender has already had a reprimand or a final warning and has therefore already had contact, under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 provisions, with the youth offender team. We suspect that, in practice, a pre-sentence report could become an essential tool in the referral order process. I acknowledge that there may be a better way in the Bill of securing that objective, but amendment No. 3 simply makes the point that the Bill should clarify to what extent magistrates should use the pre-sentence report to determine whether a referral order is appropriate. Given that, in many instances, a referral order will be appropriate because a custodial sentence is not appropriate, that can only be determined, I am told, with a pre-sentence report.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are more important. These amendments, which I alluded to in my earlier remarks, relate to the scheme of things that the Government have introduced in the Bill. If a first-time young offender has pleaded guilty--I assume that the Government will seek to reverse the discretionary nature of the referral order--unless the court intends to grant an absolute discharge or to impose a custodial sentence, or the sentence is fixed by law, it will be mandated to make a referral order. I think that clause 2 sets out which disposals are not available in any of those sets of circumstances. Community sentences of various kinds are referred to as being unavailable to the court; the referral order is there instead. However, two other disposals regularly used by courts are not referred to, and we believe that, even if the Government have their way and seek to change the discretionary nature to a mandatory nature, a court should have an opportunity to give a conditional discharge or to fine the young offender.
<P>
I discussed fines at some length on Second Reading. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), who, as the Committee knows, is a judge, in the expectation that he might have been able to serve with us on the Committee, has taken soundings from some of his friends in the legal profession and the probation service. I am not at liberty to refer to the source of what I shall say, but it confirms--[Interruption.] It is a chief probation officer. Knowing the county in which my hon. Friend serves, members of the Committee may come to a conclusion.
<P>
I do not think that I am building sand-castles. Certainly this probation officer does not think that I am. His reaction to what I am saying was to ask whether the Bill intends that if, for example, a 17-year-old appears in court for the first time and pleads guilty to a motoring offence--perhaps a drink-drive offence on his motor scooter or driving without L-plates when he does not have a full licence--the court should either give him an absolute discharge and say, ``Naughty boy, don't do it again'', or make a referral order to a youth offender panel. Normally, such a youngster would be fined. 
<P>
There may be other factors which a court would take into account but there must be many sets of circumstances in which young offenders do not have an obvious predisposition to commit crimes. They may have done something wrong--such as travelling on the underground without paying their fare--and been caught and prosecuted. Is it the intention that in such circumstances a court should be unable to impose a fine? That seems utterly nonsensical.
<P>
It could be argued, too, that before conviction a young person may be planning to leave the United Kingdom with his family or to travel to another part of the country, in which case a conditional discharge might be considered significantly more appropriate than reference to a youth offender panel.
<P>
For those reasons, even if the Government decide, as they probably will, that they want the referral order to be mandatory, we are not convinced that they will have given the courts sufficient other sentencing options. We do not believe, for example, that the ability to impose a fine or a conditional discharge would undermine their principles and objectives. We do not want to hinder the Government or to jeopardise what they want to do, as I promised the Minister in our first sitting that we would try to be constructive; but we believe that in those two respects the Bill as drafted is deficient. Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6 will be of even greater importance if, as we anticipate, the Government restore the Bill to its first published drafting and make the referral order mandatory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I want to make one or two brief points about these useful amendments. They are more than probing amendments; they go to the heart of some important principles.
<P>
First, on amendment No. 3, reports are always helpful in youth courts. They are mandatory in relation to many types of offence and the Bill should state that a report is required. In respect of the referral conditions set out in clause 2(4)(a) to (f), several circumstances must be taken fully into account in making a referral order. In particular, in respect of paragraph (f), a report would be necessary for the court to arrive at an appropriate decision. The amendment is a proper one and the Minister will no doubt say in due course if he thinks that it is otiose. If so, will he explain precisely how the panel will obtain the information necessary to take a proper decision so that the referral order has the proper effect?
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale is right about amendment No. 5. It is strange that conditional discharge is not included in the proposal along with absolute discharge. As a practitioner myself, I can tell the Committee that a conditional discharge has been a useful tool in many instances. Of course, it is not appropriate for serious or repeat offenders, but this clause does not deal with them. A conditional discharge is a useful sentence for a one-off offender who, for example, takes a milk bottle from a doorstep or commits another offence that might not even qualify for referral or justify the involvement of a range of authorities or the assistance offered by the referral order. I agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale that it is rather curious that that string to a court's bow has been left to one side. A fine may also be appropriate in certain circumstances.
<P>
I accept what the hon. Member for Ryedale said about a family moving from one area to another. A referral panel may not even be available in the area to which they have moved. Therefore, a conditional discharge would act as a shortened, if not as effective, version of the referral penalty. It puts a young person on trust by making it clear that if he behaves himself for a certain period, that will be the end of the matter. Without going through the judicial process, a referral order is meant to get a youngster back on the tracks without having a detrimental effect on his character.
<P>
It is a useful amendment, and I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I want to comment briefly on what has been said. In many circumstances, the remarks of Opposition Members would appear unexceptionable and, indeed, useful. However, they have missed the point about the essential radicalism and purpose of restorative justice.
<P>
Referral is not just another element of what might be a long sentencing tariff, but represents a different approach to young offending. When a problem arises, it will bring together all the agencies that can assist the young person and deal with the effects of an offence and with issues such as reparation and restoration. In that context, it is inappropriate to seek a pre-sentence report. It would add to the workload of those who will have to make a major contribution to the system. It would also introduce an unnecessary element to the tariff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I may have jumped the gun, because I thought that the hon. Gentleman was about to mention conditional discharge. If he does mention it, I should like to ask him a question.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that hon. Members will want their interventions to be relevant to what people have said rather than to what they think that they have said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
Opposition Members have tended to sweep over the role of an absolute discharge. We are considering how to bring home to young people the seriousness of offences. Therefore, it is important to recognise that an appearance in court, which may end with a young person pleading guilty and receiving an absolute discharge, can be an effective way of dealing with a young offender. That point has been overlooked. We have missed the significance of an absolute discharge.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) may want to come back on conditional discharge, but what we have before us is absolutely appropriate. If the court is not considering a simple absolute discharge which says, ``You are guilty: go away and offend no more'' and is not considering custody, here is a new and radical approach, which uses all the resources and the strengths of the community to deal with a serious matter that could be an intimation of all sorts of difficulties for that young person.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman has a lot of experience with young people and youth justice. He speaks with expert knowledge. Let us consider a case that is not at the lower end of the scale where an absolute discharge, a telling off and a sending home is appropriate. The referral order needs a more structured approach and we need to call in the parents and the agencies and to monitor the situation. There might, however, be a case in the middle such as a one-off theft which cannot go unpunished. The young person should be subject to some kind of monitoring, perhaps not as structured as the referral order. Why not preserve something that in some circumstances works? I am sure that the hon. Gentleman could confirm that. Why do away with it when it could be an extra string to the bow?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. Conditional discharge can indeed be an effective way of dealing with young people. But this does not prevent a conditional discharge from being made available to other young people in other circumstances. We should look at the whole new approach that the Bill introduces. It is a different approach to youth justice, which should be given the support of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It involves an expression by the community that it regards these issues as very serious and enables the community to take part in a whole range of measures to deal with that serious behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This has been an important debate, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for tabling amendments that prompted it. The contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy are important. The three hon. Members who contributed to the debate all have experience of the youth courts, whether as a serving police officer, a lawyer or a social worker--the person charged with producing the pre-sentence reports.
<P>
Having listened to the debate, I realise that I cannot emphasise sufficiently the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre. Deliberations here and in the other place concern the fashioning of a radical new approach to tackling youth crime. I think that the Committee will agree that the current system of youth justice has failed. By the time they are 21, one in three of our young men will have either a caution or a conviction.
<P>
That is a horrific statistic and stands as an indictment of our youth justice system. We must do something about it. [Interruption.] Opposition Members say that they disagree, yet they presided over a massive escalation of youth crime and we are picking up the pieces. In so doing, we are trying to fashion a system that allows for early intervention and that is designed to nip youth offending in the bud.
<P>
Clause 1 and clause 2 should be viewed holistically. We are in the business of diverting out of the criminal justice system first-time offenders who plead guilty; referring them to a youth offender panel; and providing an opportunity for a range of disciplines to be directed around their needs. A court may be considering absolute discharge or a custodial sentence, but the other option of commissioning reports is also open to it.
<P>
I stress that all matters--save for the exceptions that I mentioned--should be subject to the in-depth analysis and multidisciplinary approach that the youth offender panel is designed to bring about. The overwhelming experience of people who are working in this field in the pilot areas has been that the youth offender panel has made an important contribution to turning round young lives. It addresses some of the frustrations experienced by police officers, probation officers, social workers, voluntary sector workers and others working with and for young people within the current system. That system is letting young people down and, even more significantly, it is letting communities down.
<P>
The example of someone coming before the youth court for stealing a bottle of milk from beside a front door is significant. It would be wrong for someone charged with that offence to be left in any doubt at the end of the process that society does regard it as significant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> May I finish my point?
<P>
We should not forget that although the offenders will be appearing before the youth court for the first time, they will already have been through the process of a caution and a final warning. They would not be brought before the youth court unless there had been some pre-existing pattern of offending. Custody is not an option and the court will not require a pre-sentence report to determine that. An absolute discharge is, in my submission, also clearly inappropriate. What better way for the young person who has stolen the milk to face a multidisciplinary panel that will inquire into the reasons for such anti-social behaviour? That would also benefit society. It is right for the youth to face people around a table and to confront the reasons why he has offended in that way.
<P>
I have to share with the Committee my experience of 23 years of practice in the youth court. I never stopped practising in such courts until my final year of legal practice. Time and again I saw young people hiding behind the procedures of the court in order to avoid confronting their own offending behaviour.
<P>
I saw it when there were pre-sentence reports and when pre-sentence reports were asked for but were delayed although what was wanted was to get the processes disposed of in a manner that linked disposal and the activity that led to the young person coming before the court as closely as possible. That is how one enables young people to appreciate the impact of offending on their own lives and those of others. For that reason we are clear that we do not want pre-sentence reports to be called for in every case. We do not think that that is necessary. We believe that in-depth analysis of the appropriate programmes and interventions needed in a young person's life is best made in the context of a youth panel, with input from a youth offender team.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am sorry if the Minister thought that I said that theft is trivial at any time. I did not say that. In fact, I discounted the very thought of an absolute discharge for even the theft of a bottle of milk. But do we really need a multidisciplinary approach for a minor theft? We may be arguing about the same thing. I agree with the Minister that juvenile courts have been failing young people and that a different approach is needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I do not regard such an offence as minor, nor do the Government. Such a case would not be before a court were it not the tip of a pattern of offending.
<P>
It has to be addressed in a way that brings to bear the possibility of restorative justice--

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.41 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> If that young person has taken a bottle of milk from someone's front doorstep, what should be our response as a society? I am not unusual in wanting to live in a community in which people do not take milk bottles from people's doorsteps. I was lucky enough to have lived in my teenage years on a council estate in Hemel Hempstead in west Hertfordshire. At that time, in the mid to late 1960s, one could rely on the fact that when milk was delivered to one's door, it would still be there when one came back from work or school in the evening. That was the norm at that time, but in too many communities today that is no longer so.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Government have not given up on the project of restoring that situation in our communities, and I do not therefore believe that a conditional discharge or a fine is an appropriate response to such an offence, from whomsoever the milk bottle is taken. It is particularly important if it is taken from an elderly person or from someone who spends most of the day working and returns home only in the evening. Of course, it is important to them, but the milk bottle is important to everyone. The Government are determined to ensure that in those circumstances the young person will be drawn up sharp by a youth panel and reminded of the consequences of his offending.
<P>
When I appeared in the courts on behalf of young men in those circumstances, if we left court with a conditional discharge, that was ``a result''; the young person thanked me for ``getting him off''. It seemed not to matter that I had given him a homily beforehand about the significance of a conditional discharge and assured the magistrate that I had done so, and that the magistrate, too, had given him a homily; it was a result. He was off. There has been far too much of that. What would happen if such a young person was required in the next three months to engage in a programme that obliged him to sit down and reflect on what he had done or do some work by way of recompense? It might even, if the victim wished it, require the youngster to sit in front of the victim, who could say to him, ``I went out to work that morning expecting, when I got back, to find the milk on the doorstep and to have a cup of tea''; or the elderly person might have been without milk because she was housebound. The young person should be obliged to confront that reality. A fine or conditional discharge would not meet our objectives. The youth panel, as we envisage it, would do so.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is why we are taking away from the juvenile court, and we make no apology for doing so, an element of discretion. We believe that the current structure and practice of the youth court have not served society's needs as well as they should have done. In future, things will be done differently.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No Conservative Member would argue with what the Minister is saying, but that is not the case that I put to him. Neither I nor the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to crimes of serious dishonesty. We must try to end the debate by my putting a direct question to the Minister.
<P>
Is the Minister saying that he can envisage no circumstances in which a young offender before a youth court for the first time, pleading guilty not to an offence of dishonesty but to another summary offence such as a motoring offence or one involving a bicycle, must be subject to a referral order to a youth offender panelrand that the court should not give him a fine?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not intend to do anything other than confront that issue head on, and I now do so. However, I wanted <P>
to refer to the issue of the stolen milk in order to deal with the points that have been raised, legitimately and in a probing way and even, perhaps, in a way that demonstrates a philosophical difference of approach. I wanted to deal with fines and conditional discharge, because I do not believe that, in that case or others like it, they are a better option than the panel. We must keep that in the forefront of our minds. Save in the case of absolute discharge or custody, where pre-sentence reports will be available, we believe that the panel approach is better.
<P>
I now turn to the issue that the hon. Member for Ryedale raised at the instigation of an unnamed chief probation officer in a county which it does not take many powers of deduction to ascertain. In doing so, I make it clear to all in the probation service that they must understand the philosophy behind the Government's approach, because it will be their duty to ensure that the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Bill are implemented in a way that delivers results to the community that we all seek to serve.
<P>
I believe that there will be circumstances in which somebody who comes before the court for the first time charged with a traffic offence and who pleads guilty will benefit from referral to a panel. From time to time I, and anyone who has had to sit in my place, meet the victims. They are some of the most harrowing meetings that one can imagine. Even though they were not the recipients of an impact, they are victims because they have lost their loved ones, or seen them injured or maimed, in a road traffic incident and have seen the person responsible for that death or injury appear before the court charged with reckless driving. It is extremely difficult to explain to such a person how the criminal justice system works to deliver justice to him. 
<P>
A young person who speeds through a built-up area and believes that doing so is not a serious offence is but one step away from knocking down the young child who steps into the road, or one skid away from veering on to the pavement and into someone walking in a built-up area. A young person might benefit from referral to a youth offender panel. He would be obliged to consider the highway code and the consequences of accidents. He could undertake work that required him to consider the consequences of his actions if he had breached road traffic regulations. Referral would apply not only to reckless driving but to speeding, and to a range of motor traffic offences.
<P>
Some young people have an approach to the law and to driving that fails to have proper regard for the fact that vehicles should be driven with a full sense of responsibility and an understanding of what one does when moving half a tonne of metal at speeds greater than 15 mph, and of the possible consequences of an impact. I envisage circumstances in which referral to a panel would bring home the consequences of someone's actions. But, having heard the circumstances of the offence, if the court decided that that would not be the outcome, it would have available the option of an absolute discharge. Courts frequently take the view that few road traffic offences merit a teenager being given an absolute discharge. Few young people would fail to benefit from having brought home to them, through a referral order, the importance of the highway code and road safety, but if a conditional discharge were imposed, that would not happen. That, then, is the Government's answer to the chief probation officer and to any others of similar mind. 
<P>
All of us who participate in the criminal justice system as it affects young people are beginning to change our mindset. We are requiring all who work in the system to develop a certain attitude and response. To facilitate that we are giving them the institutional structures in which the primary focus will be to prevent, and reduce, offending. It is a hard focus, for which we make no apology. As my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said, it is a radical approach--and it is long overdue. For those reasons, I must resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has responded to a debate that never took place. He accused me of building sand-castles. He has been tilting at non-existent windmills.
<P>
I would not argue about any of the serious offences that the <P>
Minister mentioned being appropriate for a referral order. I said that our objective is not to undermine the Government's aims but to ensure that they succeed and do not fall into disrepute. But, given his answer, I fear that Ministers have not thought through the implications of imposing a referral order--or, if they have, there are a great many people in the criminal justice system who have yet to realise what is about to befall them. Perhaps because of the pilot experimental nature of the provisions, they think that all the difficulties can be ironed out. I have yet to come across an opportunity to make the changes other than through primary legislation.
<P>
I was going to make a point on the next group of amendments, but I shall make it now. I have sat on the Government Benches and I remember the Committee that considered the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Then Opposition Members argued about the nonsensical nature of some aspects of unit fines. They were right, and we were wrong. When we considered clause 2(1) of that Bill, as it then was, they also argued about the nonsensical nature of some of the sentencing provisions. In fact, within days of the legislation appearing on the statute book, it was in disrepute.
<P>
That experience should be borne in mind. We shall need to return to this issue on the Floor of the House. Perhaps, we shall have to take the amendments away and find another way of ensuring that a fine and conditional discharge are available in the cases that have been mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall give the hon. Gentleman the chance to clarify his point. Will he give a practical example of the sort of ``minor'' road traffic offence that would not benefit from the young person concerned being obliged to confront the consequences of his failure to appreciate road safety and to observe the highway code?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not have any difficulty in providing an example. If a 17-year-old goes through a red traffic light, is the Minister saying that the courts should have no option other than to refer him to a youth offender panel? The 17-year-old may be at university or taking A-levels, and he may come from an extremely good background and may have not broken the law before. However, the Government are saying that, in such circumstances, they wish to go through the rigmarole of setting up a youth offender panel so that that young person can address his criminal offending behaviour. That is nonsense, and practitioners in the courts can see that.
<P>
I have an inkling that Ministers and the officials in the Home Office who drafted the clause had no idea of the effect of their proposals. If the offender of 17 years and 11 months were just one month older, he could be fined. It is nonsense to suggest that someone of 17 years and 11 months cannot be fined when someone of 18 years and one day can be. The measure will bring the law into disrepute. We all know what will happen. The case against the 17-year-old will not be brought to court. The Crown Prosecution Service will realise that, if it were, the outcome would be referral to a youth offender panel.
<P>
The Committee has yet to consider the issue of resources. However, we must compare what it will cost to set up the youth offender panels, for which no money has been made available, with the costs involved in imposing fines on youngsters. Many of us have argued in these Committees and on the Floor of the House for many years about the need to take a really tough approach with persistent young offenders. I have no difficulty with what the Minister has said in response to this debate, other than that I do not think that his remarks have addressed the issue. Clearly we will need to return to this.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are not in a wrecking mood about this. On the contrary, as I said at Second Reading and as I shall say again throughout the Committee, we want the legislation to work. We do not believe in not allowing a court to fine a youngster or to impose a conditional discharge, as there are bound to be cases where the court will wish to do that. We may have to find an amendment that does not allow that to happen in cases of, for example, dishonesty. I would have no difficulty with that. In all probability, a charge of dishonesty will have been brought only after the youngster has been cautioned and given a final warning. I have no difficulty with the Minister's argument in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I follow the hon. Gentleman's argument and I agree with what he says. This is too stark. It is going from one extreme to the other and there is nothing in between. Will there not be tendency for benches to dish out absolute discharges like nobody's business in appropriate cases where they think that matters should not go through the whole gamut?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes, that is another way in which the law will be brought into disrepute. The sentence will be seen as wholly inappropriate. People will ask why the 17-and-a-half year-old got an absolute discharge while the 18-year-old and a day was fined 100 quid and got three points on his licence. Nothing that the Minister has said today convinces me, and it obviously does not convince the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy or any other Opposition Member or, I suspect, some Labour Back Benchers that the Government have thought this through.
<P>
Having had this important debate, I am perfectly willing to withdraw the amendment and to ask the Minister to look at other ways of dealing with this. However, if he is saying that on every occasion when a young offender pleads guilty to any offence, whatever it may be, he will go to the youth offender panel, the youth offender panel process will not be the success that we and the Government want it to be.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but he has missed the point. The great advantage of the panel system and the contract is that it has a degree of flexibility that allows it to be used in all circumstances. The hon. Member for Ryedale gave the example of going through a red light. He minimises the significance of that offence. Anyone who has had any dealings with road traffic safety knows that that is one of the most serious things that one can  do, because people crossing roads, be they in vehicles or on foot, are entitled to rely on the lights. I can introduce him to the parents of children who have been maimed precisely--
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is not the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is the point, because if people think about the possible consequences of their action they might not do it. The advantage of the contract is that it will introduce flexibility. There is a requirement that the panel be convened. At that stage, there is an opportunity for the panel to consider issues surrounding financial penalties, compensation and reparation.
<P>
A course of activities can be proposed and agreement entered into by the person who has broken the law by going through the red light--as a result of which himself and others have been put in danger. That person will have an opportunity to agree to the disposal, which may involve financial reparation, meeting an accident victim, or having to learn the highway code. The programme is completed: there is a final meeting and that is it.
<P>
That will have an infinitely greater impact on the young person than a fine. With a fine, the young person might say, ``Oh well, just another 50, 75, 100 or 150 off my grant'', and who pays for it at the end of the day? The parents, who time and again pick up the tab. That sort of financial penalty does not have an impact on the offender. We want to make an impact. Going through red lights and adopting a reckless attitude to the law and to the safety of others requires a proportionate response. A fine may not of itself do the trick. Suggesting that the panel represents an undue, burdensome approach to offending is to miss the point entirely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I do not know whether we are talking about the same issue here. Someone may go through a red traffic light in a temporary set of lights when he can see half a mile ahead and knows that nothing is coming. Yes, it is breaking the law, but it is not even endorsable. Is the Minister saying that a young person in that situation should have to go through the palaver of referral?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am saying yes, if the police choose to bring a prosecution. I make no apology: if it is serious enough for the police to exercise their proper discretion and bring the matter before the court, it is serious enough to be taken seriously by the bench. I have to tell the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy that the notion that lay magistrates would be so unmindful of their oath and their duty as to bring the system into disrepute by inappropriate use of absolute discharges is, I hope, fanciful. Were they to use absolute discharges in inappropriate cases, they would bring not only the law but themselves into disrepute. Lay magistrates would not want to do that, and I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale is not suggesting that the passage of the Bill would have that consequence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In response to the sedentary intervention of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, I said that it is indeed possible to seek to avoid the rigmarole of sending someone with an unblemished record before a youth offender panel. I view the practicalities of it in the same way. However, let me put a final question on motoring offences to the Minister.
<P>
A police officer patrolling a radar trap might stop a 17 year-old driver who has just acquired his licence and tell him, ``You were doing 52 mph in a 40 mph area''. Is the Minister saying that because the person is only 17, the police officer will be unable to give him an on-the-spot fine and can only summons him? His entire argument falls because many motoring offences, especially moving traffic offences which do not involve accidents, are dealt with by on-the-spot fines. People are given the option to admit their guilt and pay their fine by cheque to the magistrates court or to be prosecuted--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am conscious that we are discussing an important issue, but I beseech Members to keep their interventions brief and not to rehearse arguments that we have heard several times.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have finished, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about court disposals and that nothing that I have said in any way removes the discretion of the police. On the contrary, it underlines and underpins that discretion because if the young person gives an officer the impression that he is not prepared to take advice and the officer decides that a summons, rather than an on-the-spot fine, is appropriate, it is part of our job to ensure that the criminal justice system backs up the police officer in exercising his initiative. The remarks of the hon. Member for Ryedale may imply that that should not be the case. it is our view that the police should be supported by the criminal justice system as it applies to young people; too often in the past police officers have wrung their hands with exasperation when young people appearing before the youth court receive the very conditional discharges that have been presented in Committee as something that we should allow the courts the discretion to retain. Police officers know that their authority to deal with criminal and anti-social behaviour has thus been undermined. In future that will not be possible. That which was possible under the hon. Gentleman's Government will not be possible under this Government. That is why the police and the public support the measure unequivocally and why we will continue to resist amendments of this nature whenever the hon. Gentleman chooses to table them.
<P>
This debate is as important as the following one as it goes to the heart of the philosophy that underpins the measure. It may well be a watershed between us and the Opposition because we have a completely different approach. The Conservative party failed to act and that is why we are required to do so, with all the resolve at our disposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 16 in page 1, line 21 leave out `may order the offender' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall sentence the offender for the offence by ordering him'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:
<P>
Government amendment No. 17, clause 1 stand part, clause 2 stand part and new clause 1--Referral of Young offenders to youth offender panels--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.--This section applies where a court is dealing with a person under the age of 18 for an offence and--
<P>
(a) neither the offence nor any associated offence is one for which the sentence is fixed by law; and
<P>
(b) the court is not, in respect of the offence or any associated offence, proposing to impose a custodial sentence on the offender or make a hospital order in his case.
<P>
(2) If the referral condition is satisfied in accordance with subsection (3) and referral is available to the court, the court may order the offender to be referred to a youth offender panel.
<P>
(3) The referral condition is satisfied if the offender is convicted of or pleaded guilty to the offence or any associated offence.
<P>
(4) For the purposes of this section referral is available to a court if--
<P>
(a) the court has been notified by the Secretary of State that arrangements for the implementation of referral orders are available in the area in which it appears to the court that the offender resides or will reside; and
<P>
(b) the notice has not been withdrawn.
<P>
(5) In this Part ``referral order'' means an order under subsection (2).
<P>
(6) For the purposes of this section an offender who has been convicted of an offence in respect of which he was conditionally discharged (whether by a court in England and Wales or in Northern Ireland) shall be treated, despite--
<P>
(a) section 1C(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 (conviction of offence for which offender so discharged deemed not a conviction), or
<P>
(b) Article 6(1) of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (corresponding provision for Northern Ireland),
<P>
as having been convicted of that offence.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We had a good warm up for--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Our previous debates were not a warm up; I hope that hon. Members will concur with my view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Point taken, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
I can give the hon. Member for Ryedale the pleasure of having correctly anticipated what was, and remains, our intention: to ask the Committee to reverse the action of the other place and to restore the original intention of the Bill.
<P>
Our amendments reintroduce the compulsory referral conditions to the Bill. They will ensure that the referral order is an effective new means of dealing with the majority of young people who find themselves in court for the first time and have shown that they are in the right mental state to benefit from mandatory referral to a panel.
<P>
Such referral offers them the opportunity to examine their offending and address its causes; and it requires a willingness on their part to enter into a contract to undertake a programme of activity whose primary purpose is to prevent them reoffending, giving the public the protection to which they are entitled from the actions of young people who break the law. We believe that reference to the panel offers the best opportunity for effective early intervention to tackle the causes of offending by young people, thereby ensuring that they do not reoffend.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Opposition have shown in their contributions that they are at odds with us on this fundamental point. For them, referral to the panel is just another disposal. I hope that in  Committee and on the Floor of the House they reconsider their approach, which I believe is misguided and has contributed to the failures of the youth justice system to date. The Government are engaged in a radical reshaping of youth justice, at the heart of which is mandatory referral. Were the Opposition's new clause 1 accepted by the Committee, it would drive the proverbial coach and horses through our programme of reform.
<P>
The panel that will be the heart of the new system, with input from the youth offender team, will require the young person in an appropriate forum, free of the physical and other restrictions and obstacles of the youth courtroom, to sit with a range of people to examine it his offending and require of him commitment to a programme designed to address its causes and bring home the consequences of offending. Those people will include members of his own family and on occasion, where appropriate and if the victim wishes it, the victim himself, together with probation officers, the police, social workers, child and adolescent mental health specialists and, as is already happening in pilot stages, people from the voluntary sector.--The need to enter into an agreement, knowing what the consequences will be if it is breached, will cause a young person, perhaps for the first time, to take a step towards assuming responsibility for his actions and future behaviour.
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have sat through the process in the youth court. We have all been there, done that and got the T-shirt. We have collected the fee. We have seen how young people sit in youth courts and are utterly disengaged from the process. We go in, we spout, the lawyers come in with the mitigation the social workers and probation officers deliver the report. The magistrates, desperate to engage the attention of the young person, often have limited success, the layout of the court sometimes causing them to talk straight over the young person's head. It simply does not work; it has not worked, it has failed. The time has come for us to adopt an approach whereby, as a mandatory norm, first-time offenders who own up to their guilt, if the bench does not consider absolute discharge or custody to be appropriate, will be out of that room and in an entirely different setting where they sit down and engage with the process.
<P>
That is new, radical and different, and it is not an optional extra. It is fundamental to the process. That is why the Government cannot accept new clause 1, which goes even further than their Lordships did in proposing a course that we believe would undermine the purpose of the Bill. We must resist it and restore the heart of the Bill. That is what Government amendments Nos. 16 and 17 seek to do. For those reasons I commend them to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has again argued why referral orders and youth offender panels are a good idea, but he has not addressed the question why they should be mandatory in every case. We believe that, although referral orders should be the norm in general, they are not for everyone. An important issue of principle is involved. We believe that the Government are wrong to insist on mandatory referral.
<P>
The debate that we have just had, in which our substantive difference was more graphically illustrated than I had expected, was not a warm-up: we got to the heart of the problem. There would be no need to include in the Bill requirements to allow conditional discharges or fines if the referral order was discretionary. New clause 1 simply tries to put right the mess that the Bill was in, which the explanatory notes acknowledge, because at the last moment their Lordships changed ``shall'' to ``may'', but did not make the other necessary changes. I have no doubt that the drafting of new clause 1 can be improved, but it sought to achieve two objectives--first, to provide for a discretionary referral and, secondly, to apply the referral order more widely than simply to first-time offenders.
<P>
I shall come to that later.
<P>
Although I acknowledge that no big fuss has been made about the proposal, the Magistrates Association has made strong representations about part I of the Bill. It made it abundantly clear that it welcomed the Lords amendment and said that the Government's imposition of a mandatory penalty would conflict with the principles of justice whereby penalties are determined by a court after hearing all the facts. A mandatory referral order will lead to hard cases, and the Minister almost acknowledged that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> From his earlier remarks, I got the impression that that was the Minister's view. If it is not, I misunderstood what he said. However, there is no doubt that mandatory referral orders will lead to some hard cases. My worry is that the proposal will have the opposite effect to that intended. Instead of bringing a young person on to the straight and narrow path, it will create bitterness and resentment. The offender will be referred to a youth offender panel because the court will have no option. However, the offender will think that that penalty is inappropriate.
<P>
Concerns have been expressed not just by the Magistrates Association. The Standing Committee for Youth Justice has also expressed them. Many organisations interested in the welfare of young people and the criminal justice system as it affects youngsters are members of that committee.
<P>
The final piece of criminal justice legislation that the previous Government put through Parliament was the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. It introduced mandatory sentences for some offences, Therefore, it may appear unusual to the Minister and to Labour Members that we should now be arguing against mandatory sentences. However, I ask them to recognise that there is a world of difference between imposing a mandatory sentence on an habitual persistent criminal whose actions show that he is a career offender from whom the public need protecting and imposing one on a first-time young offender. The Minister shakes his head, but that fact has been pointed out by the penal reform group Justice. I also referred to it on Second Reading. The Government's own statistics show that about 80 per cent of first-time offenders do not reoffend after they have been dealt with by the courts.
<P>
I agree with all that the Minister said about the need to confront persistent young offenders. They need to be brought up short. I agree with him that the system has failed some offenders. However, it has not failed all of them, including the 80 per cent who, having been brought up short, do not reoffend. The kernel of our argument is that the Government have made a good case for the use of youth offender panels and referral orders for some young offenders, but they have not made the case for using them for all.
<P>
It may seem stark and brutal, but all that the Minister appeared was to say was that he did not trust the courts. He has told us that the Government will introduce referral orders, but suggested that they do not trust the courts to decide the cases for which the orders would be useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall not take up at this stage the point about whether I trust the courts. However, can the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee with his hand on his heart that he is able to identify the 20 per cent who will go on to reoffend? Does he honestly believe, on the basis of his years as a police officer, that the courts are able to identify that 20 per cent of reoffenders?
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I believe that in many cases they can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Then why have we seen such an escalation in youth crime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I will tell the Minister why. It is because we have not been tough enough on persistent young offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> And who was in power?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are fine but the Committee does not want a ping-pong match.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am only responding to what the Minister--both on his feet and from a sedentary position--said, which was silly.
<P>
We have not responded firmly enough to persistent young offenders. It is extraordinary that when our roles were reversed and we debated in the mid-90s other legislation that introduced tough penalties for persistent young offenders, not only did the Labour Opposition not support it, but they opposed it with all their might.
<P>
Of course the courts, the social workers and the probation service know who the persistent offenders are. That is why we support the Government's objectives. Our point is simply that referral orders will, without a shadow of a doubt, be made inappropriately against some young offenders. The Minister shakes his head, but the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, whom I regard as an independent interlocutor in these matters, is entirely right in his comments.
<P>
I do not wish to delay the Committee, which wants to make progress. However, the Minister will be aware of other concerns about the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, whose principles might be breached by the Government's proposals. I never thought I would see the day when I would stand up in Committee and make this point, but it is the job of the Opposition--as the Minister would surely acknowledge--to bring genuine concerns to the attention of the Committee.
<P>
The Minister knows that the United Nations standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice--the Beijing rules--include the points that any intervention should be kept to a minimum, that sanctions should be the least restrictive possible and, more important, that the police, prosecution or other agencies--including the courts--should be able to dispose of cases at their discretion. That is also our argument for discretion. A mandatory referral order means no discretion.
<P>
We support the concept and principle of youth offending teams and youth offender panels, but we believe that the court should judge when the referral orders and the use of those panels is appropriate. I could not have made that any clearer today. We understand the Government's objective and the high ideal that the Minister outlined this evening--to change the nature of the youth court process. We acknowledge that. It is very ambitious, but it should not override the interests of justice, the welfare of the child or the need for proportionality.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> Come on!
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister says ``Come on,'' but these are genuine anxieties. If the Government get their way and this is implemented, as sure as night follows day, these provisions will be challenged. That is why we must address these concerns. The Minister has the opportunity to tell us why the Government are right and everyone else is wrong. These concerns are genuine and it is not clear from the Bill whether the proportionality and welfare principles apply to youth offender panels. We may want to discuss that aspect later.
<P>
A better approach is needed which gives discretion but applies in addition to other offenders. Discretion is needed so that the court can decide, take full account of welfare interests, ensure proportionality and, without difficulty, meet any international obligations and human rights conditions. Above all, a referral order should be made only when it is reasonable and appropriate to do so. I cannot state more categorically how strongly we disagree with the Government's view that it is appropriate and reasonable in all cases.
<P>
The Minister will know that I spoke at length on Second Reading about the application to other offenders, and I do not propose to go over the arguments again. The idea of extending youth offender panels to offenders other than first-time offenders has now been enthusiastically endorsed by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice. Indeed, clause 2(3) allows the approach to be extended to other offenders. That clearly anticipates a wider application in the years to come.
<P>
New clause 1 meets both those objectives--discretion and the wider application. It also satisfies our view about the courts. I said earlier that I was not satisfied by the Minister's answer about the Crown court not having this disposal available to it. The new clause also clearly deals with the concern about the availability of fines and conditional discharges and it meets the Government's requirements for pilots.
<P>
New clause 1 also addresses another major concern--the need for a plea of guilty. Again, people in the youth justice system are challenging why the referral order is available only to someone who pleads guilty, because that creates the opportunity for perverse pleas. The Minister looks surprised, but he knows full well that if the referral order to a youth offender panel is seen as a sentence to be avoided, people will plead not guilty to avoid it. The way that this has been framed gives them exactly that encouragement.
<P>
We accept that new clause 1 could be redrafted to include a presumption and a requirement for the court to state why it is not making a referral order. We believe that the Government are wrong to reverse their Lordships' decision. We commend the principles behind new clause 1 to the Committee. We will not press the matter to a vote because this is such a fundamental part of the Bill that it should be considered again on the Floor of the House.
<P>
Given that we are dealing with clauses 1 and 2 stand part--I fully understand why matters have been arranged in that way--we should at this point put down our marker that we do not believe that the Government have addressed the issue of resources. We cannot see that the cost assumptions in the Bill are neutral, as Ministers suggest. That is another reason to avoid inappropriate referrals. A mandatory referral order is bound to lead to inappropriate referrals. The system that we are proposing is not only to be preferred but would bring about a greater chance of success.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> It is remarkable that there is an absolute gulf of misunderstanding between able, committed and experienced hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. What is being presented here is a radically different resource for children, and we must examine the meaning that children attach to the various disposals and the way in which the youth justice system operates. My hon. Friend the Minister correctly characterised the current youth court process as one of bewilderment. Young people go into a setting that is socially far removed from the circumstances in which they live and in which the offences have been committed, where adults operate in ways that are entirely outside their experience, follow opaque procedures and go through a process which they do not understand and cannot participate in meaningfully. As a result, we are lucky to get a disposal that means something to the young person.
<P>
Today we face a completely different approach. I thought that the comments of the hon. Member for Ryedale that the provisions could be outside the United Nations convention on children's rights were unworthy of him. It is an approach that offers a young person a huge range of disposals and interventions and the possibility of the most sensitive understanding and assessment of how an offence has come to be committed and what is going on in his life, with all the influences from family, social structure and school. With committed people working with the young person and the family, we have a remarkable opportunity to put together a disposal that faces the young person with the seriousness of his offence, focuses properly on the consequences of the offence, requires him to make amends and addresses the issues that have been assessed and defined over whatever time is needed.
<P>
It is a radically different approach, but there is no reason to suggest that it might give rise to inappropriate referrals, because all sorts of ways in which the circumstances can be addressed can be built into the system. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, it is far removed from the mandatory sentencing in the adult court.
<P>
There are hon. Members of good will on both sides of the Committee, and I hope that Opposition Members will accept the meaning and significance of restorative justice and try to appreciate its profound benefits for all young people. Frankly, my experience is that it is difficult to detect who will be a persistent offender. That course of action is doomed to failure, and if one embarks on it, one does many young people a great disservice. If young people have been through a series of interventions at court, through conditional discharges and attendance centres, and have been fined, by the time that we can do some serious work with them, we have lost. The proposal gives us the opportunity to win.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I say at the outset that I do not believe that there is as much of a gulf between the two sides of the Committee as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I speak for myself, but I hope that I reflect the feelings on this side of the Committee when I say that we argue for an element of flexibility. Law is often made badly because it is too rigid. The hon. Member for Ryedale referred to the unit fines scenario, which was, I remember as a practitioner, absolute nonsense and was bound to be so in a short space of time.
<P>
Equally, to prove that I am an independent interlocutor, I remember arguing with Labour Members about the rigidity in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, which again, in my respectful submission, does not provide enough flexibility. That is what practitioners say day in, day out. There are cases pending that will prove that point.
<P>
I agree entirely with the thrust of new clause 1 and cannot add to what has been eloquently said by the hon. Member for Ryedale. Suffice it to say that the Government have rightly identified that there are varied means of disposal of youth offences at present, but they are ineffective. No Opposition Members would argue with that. There should be a means of tackling the problem with an element of restorative justice, as the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre said. That is sensible and acceptable. It is best to deal with those often difficult cases by means other than bringing the criminal process down on the individual. As the hon. Gentleman said, we should not criminalise individuals but work with them before it is too late. I have no problem with that at all. I approach the Bill with considerable sympathy. The notion that a young offender's conduct can be monitored closely is good, laudable and useful, and will undoubtedly pay off in the long term. However, I want at this early stage to put some specific questions and concerns to the Minister, and I hope that he will reply to them at a further sitting of the Committee, if not today.
<P>
There are considerable fears and widespread concerns about the fact that the Bill might deprive people of their rights under article 6 of the European convention on human rights. I will not delay matters by reading the article verbatim today. I am also aware of the statement on the face of the Bill. The Human Rights Act 1998 will apply to youth offender panels, and the European Court of Human Rights has often held that article 6 has to be engaged in all proceedings up to and including sentence. The European Court has also frequently pronounced on the inalienable right to a fair trial: that every defendant, youth offender or adult, should be guaranteed the article 6 rights ab initio. The court is further of the opinion that a breach of article 6 at first instance cannot necessarily be remedied by subsequent review or appeal. The young offender is of course in exactly the same position as everyone else, and should, at first instance, be accorded with all the privileges of article 6 and the requirements thereof.
<P>
I believe that article 6 is not at variance with the received notions of justice and fair trial that have always characterised the judicial process in England and Wales. For instance, it cannot be said to introduce late or novel concepts into our proceedings. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, it is unlawful per se for a public authority to act in a way that is at variance with or in breach of a right enshrined in the convention. As a public authority, the youth offender panel must not act in a manner incompatible with article 6 rights.
<P>
In its parliamentary briefing, Justice states clearly that the youth offender panel must also have regard to those rights contained in the convention that may arise on the facts of a case. In particular, it mentions article 3, which deals with degrading treatment; article 8, which deals with respect for private life; article 14, which deals with freedom from discrimination; and a provision dealing with individuals' rights to enjoy property, which may be relevant, bearing in mind the context of the Bill.
<P>
Those are matters that have been forcibly raised by Justice. Justice also stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The operation of the panels will be governed by subordinate legislation. Under the Human Rights Act, the courts will be required to interpret secondary legislation consistently with the Human Rights Act unless the primary legislation prevents such a construction. A section 19 statement has been made in relation to this Bill stating that the Bill is compatible with the Human Rights Act. It is evident that the Government does not intend there to be any incompatibility with the convention in the Bill. Therefore, the subordinate legislation will be construed by the courts in such a way as to guarantee the young offender his or her article 6 rights when appearing before the Youth Offender Panel.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am pleased to have been able to raise such an important matter. I hope that the Minister will find time, if not today, at a later stage, to deal with the specific point. Several organisations have raised it, and it is worthy of being answered.
<P>
I return briefly to where I started. I do not believe that there is a gulf between the two sides of the Committee. It is right to probe legislation. The worst that we could do would be to enact legislation that was unworkable or that could bring the courts into disrepute. I say again, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said, that the Bill is too rigid. In some cases, individuals will be referred who, on any common sense view, and in any event, should not have been referred. Flowing from that are various problems. For instance, the courts may avoid referral by giving too many absolute discharges. It is also possible that the police may decide not to press charges because they may expect a case not to go to court.
<P>
I do not know how the Bill will work, but it should have an element of flexibility. The drift of the Bill is right; the thinking behind it is right. Virtually everything about part I of the Bill is correct, provided that the Minister can answer my queries about article 6. I stress again that we need to bring some element of flexibility to bear.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): I question what Opposition Members have said. First, the hon. Gentleman for Ryedale gave an example of a university student, with no record of misdemeanour, going through a red light. That set off alarm bells for me, because he seemed to imply that under the system that he advocates, the background of the person involved would be a criterion and could mitigate against his being referred to a youth offender panel. That is why referrals should be mandatory.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said, we are discussing an entirely different system of challenging youth offending. However, we are also discussing a structure that allows flexibility, discussion and appropriate action based on the needs of the individual and, in many cases, on the needs of victims harmed by that individual's crime. We are not discussing sending people into a rigid abyss in which everyone will be treated uniformly. We are engaging in a new process that recognises that we can develop a better system in which different agencies work together and, when necessary, conduct an on-going review of the individual's misdemeanour, and in which, when necessary, appropriate limited action may be taken.
<P>
The equality of the process is important, and we must be clear about that. On first offending and a plea of guilty, everyone should experience the same process and be treated equally, although the outcomes in determining how people should be treated in the system and what reparation should be paid could be different for each individual. We must recognise why that is important, and I am not convinced that we should veer away from mandatory referrals to youth offender panels.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This has been an important debate. Unlike the hon. Members for Ryedale and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, I do not accept that the Bill conflicts with international law. It is profoundly misguided to present the welfare principle as conflicting with the Bill's provisions. On the contrary, the welfare of children is nowhere better served than by the prevention of youth crime. Youth crime undermines the welfare of children. The Bill, along with the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, introduces the overarching principle of a commitment on the part of all agencies to reducing youth crime. That is the best protection that a child can hope for. There is nothing as corrosive of young people's welfare or the rights of a child as youth offending. We are absolutely determined to bear down on it, and the principles of the Bill do just that.
<P>
It has been suggested that we may not have paid sufficient regard to the impact of article 6 of the European convention on human rights, especially in drafting the provisions in clauses 1 and 2. I have had an opportunity to reflect and consider the representations made by Justice and the legal opinion on which they are based. That opinion does not conclude that the panels are contrary to article 6. It says that some issues to be decided by the panel may require the offender to have access to legal representation. I do not want to be uncharitable, but when lawyers gather together to tell the public that the best way to secure the public interest is to involve lawyers, the public can, understandably, have some scepticism, based on previous experience of the involvement and intervention of lawyers. I can think of nothing more destructive to the objectives of the Bill than involving lawyers in youth offender panels. That would add nothing to their operation and would  seriously obstruct the panels' objectives. The panels should be seen in terms of those objectives: they are designed to reduce the barriers between a young person and his or her offending.
<P>
After years of practice--we must take personal experience into account--I can say that the role of the defence lawyer is to be such a barrier between young people and their offending. I see some Opposition Members looking sceptical--what world do they live in? When, in any court context, has a defence lawyer seen it as part of his or her function to cause the young person that he or she is representing to confront the offending? Of course one does not do that. 
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The very opposite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> As my hon. Friend says, the very opposite. He speaks with the vigour of a layperson.
<P>
Lawyers would add nothing to the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> There is no need for quite such enthusiasm.
<P>
We have carefully considered the implications of article 6 of the European convention on human rights. It is important to understand that the referral order is not designed to pass responsibility for sentencing from the court to the panel; the court passes sentence and the young person will have the opportunity to be represented before the court. Reference is then made to a youth offender panel, which will have responsibility for ensuring that a programme is devised, much as the person responsible for a supervision order must ensure that a programme is devised, from which the young person--and therefore society--gains maximum benefit. The process by which that is done is, of its nature, best carried out in the absence of <P>
lawyers. However, it will be for the court to determine the length of the order--which reflects the seriousness of an offence--because that is part of a sentence. In that context, of course, the court should hear representations from lawyers. Nothing that I have said is meant to diminish or disparage the proper role of lawyers in the process, which is within the context of the youth court. The youth offender panel is a separate process and the principles underlying it are distinct from those underlying the judicial processes of the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister's arguments beg two questions, which we should briefly address. What does he say to those who argue that the lack of representation of the young offender on the youth offender panel means that the process of drawing up the contract will be coercive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, it will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That argument has been advanced. I do not necessarily agree with it, but it is the duty of the Opposition to make such points. If there is coercion and the young offender's only option is to refuse to enter into the contract and the matter is then referred back to the court, will punishment be deemed necessary for failing to meet the terms of the contract when the court decides what to do?
<P>
<B>Mr Boateng:</B> The whole point of the panel process is that it should be as consensual as possible. Having been involved in youth court processes--as other members of the Committee have--I must say that the notion that, when the advocate operates in the court, there is a constant interplay to secure consent between the advocate and the youth client is a misreading of the dynamics of a youth court.
<P>
The sad thing is that the youth surrenders him or her self interest to the lawyer the minute that he or she goes into the court. The lawyer rolls with that and does what he or she has been trained to do. The young person then disengages from the process. What will be different about the panel is that it will have an appropriate adult, who will usually be a parent. If the youth is in care, it will be someone who has the child's best interest in loco parentis at heart. That is a different dynamic from that which exists in the court with a lawyer.
<P>
The whole purpose of the panel is to engage the young person, so that he or she makes an informed consent. What happens in a youth court is not an informed process in terms of a young person's input into it. We have seen what happens. The young person is a thousand miles away and the court process enables him to be so. The panel will be different from that. It will be multidisciplinary. It will be intimate; it will require and demand that the young person engages in the process. If the young person feels that the process is unreasonable and he is not prepared to go along with it, he will be able--nay, encouraged--to say so because the purpose of the event is to engage that young person.
<P>
It will always be open to the young person to seek a further meeting of the panel; if that is not the young person's wish, there will be a prompt return to the court where there will be legal representation. It will not be automatically assumed that the young person has failed to comply with, or breached, the order. The court must make its own findings a fact, at which time the lawyer will be present, and only when there has been a breach will the court have an option to re-sentence. Lawyers will be involved in that process because it will be part of the court process after the referral back. There will be no automatic assumption.
<P>
On that basis, I hope that the Committee and those who follow our proceedings will be reassured that we have taken article 6 into account. I am anxious to put clearly on the record my response to the important points made by the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Ryedale. They were serious and made effectively and I want to answer them in the best way that I can. We are satisfied that the Bill is in accordance with international law and in the best interests of children and young people. That is why I commend the provisions to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 6; after first ``the'', insert ``local authority''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 15, in clause 3, page 3, line 23, after third ``the'', insert ``local authority''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I want to make a brief point. If the Minister does not listen, he will miss it; I shall be very brief. How will the areas in which the pilot schemes will be introduced be defined? We suggest using the words ``local authority'' as being one way to create the definition. Will magistrates court areas, police districts or local authority areas be used? It would be helpful to know how the areas will be circumscribed, because the pilot scheme will obviously take place only in those areas. However, as is often the case in such pilot schemes, some young offenders who live outside the pilot scheme area may go before a court that is inside it. Perhaps the Minister cannot give us an answer now, but we shall not labour the point; we simply want to know how the areas will be defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I welcome the amendment because it enables me to share with the Committee our approach to the issue. There are arguments for two approaches: reference could be made to petty sessional areas, or to local authority areas. We have chosen simply to refer to ``areas'' because we intend to pilot referral orders in selected areas. We know that pilot schemes are a desirable way to proceed; they have proved to be so in relation to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
The new court orders introduced under the 1998 Act have been introduced on different bases for various places. For the purpose of the youth justice pilot schemes, reference was made to petty sessional areas. For the purposes of parenting orders and child safety orders, reference was made to local authority areas. In due course, we shall decide which approach to take in the pilot schemes for referral orders. We have not yet taken a firm view. We are open to representations from whomsoever they may come.
<P>
Defining by petty sessional area is more convenient for the youth courts, while defining by local authority area could be more convenient for the purposes of determining the appropriate youth offending team, especially in areas where the youth court is served by several youth offending teams. The current formulation in the Bill allows for both possibilities, and I would not want to exclude either at this stage. That is why I resist the amendment and hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale, having heard my response, will withdraw it.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I will withdraw it, and I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. The Committee has, through the previous group of amendments, restored the mandatory nature of the youth referral<P>
 order, so I hope that the Minister agrees that it would help the Committee to know, by the time that we conclude consideration of the Bill on the Floor of the House, which option the Government intend to take. When it comes to a mandatory referral order, there must be no doubt about whether it applies in particular cases. With those few comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
