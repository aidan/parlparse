Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 37, in page 6, line 39, after `individual', insert `with relevant qualifications'.
<P>
No. 40, in page 7, line 22, leave out

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> At this morning's sitting I pointed out that the clause was part and parcel of the effort to set, monitor and enforce local authority standards. I do not want to repeat what my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health (Ms Jowell) said this morning, but it would be helpful if I explained that the same reconsiderations that apply to clause 11 will apply to clause 14. In a nutshell, that is exactly the point.
<P>
I recognise that clause 14 is tougher than clause 11, but the same considerations regarding who signs the order will apply--not the chairman or deputy chairman, but a member of the board. Frankly, the agency would be laughed out of court if its people were perceived as unqualified or unfit for the job. We therefore agree with the thrust of the amendment, but we do not want it built into the Bill.
<P>
As to amendment No. 40, subsection (5) of the clause is primarily aimed at officials from the European Commission engaged in the audit of member states' enforcement, who can accompany an authorised person. It may be a shock to outsiders to find out that people from the European Commission can come over here without warning--or with warning and agreement--to check on what we are doing, particularly regarding meat hygiene directives. I had better say that quickly to the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) and be done with it. We, the Government, have been caught red-handed because of under-implementation. That is one of our difficulties with the Commission because we have to overcompensate in order to restore good will. It may be helpful to allow those officials to accompany an authorised person.
<P>
As I said, specifying a particular qualification would be too limiting. Given the general thrust of what I said about clause 14 a propos clause 11, we will return later with the same arrangements and table some Government amendments, so I hope that the Opposition will rest their case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I am pleased to hear the Minister and am greatly reassured that any order under the clause will not be issued unless it is signed by a member of the board. That is a good safeguard. I am also grateful to the Minister for clarifying that he would expect people to be suitably qualified to carry out the enforcement powers. It would certainly bring the agency into disrepute if that were not the case. When the agency is formed, I am sure that that will be taken into account.
<P>
As the Minister said, it is not generally realised that the European Union already has powers, without the necessity to legislate for them in the Bill. In auditing, the European Union has greater access to Government Departments than our own Comptroller and Auditor General and the National Audit Office. That is a problem. The public do not realise the very wide powers that are given to European Community enforcement officials.
<P>
With the reassurances from the Minister, especially on who signs the orders and appropriate qualifications, with the leave of the Committee we seek to withdraw this set of amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Only the mover of the amendment can withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 7, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`that are materially relevant to any ongoing investigation, but shall provide a receipt in respect of any such samples taken'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 39, in page 7, line 6, after `premises', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`that are materially relevant to any ongoing investigation'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
No. 42, in clause 16, page 8, line 30, after `obstructs', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`without reasonable excuse'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The amendment mirrors discussions about powers of observation that we had on previous clauses. Therefore we need not make a great meal of amendment No. 38.
<P>
As the Minister said, we may take it that the degree of seriousness will have increased for there to be this second area of activity--the monitoring of enforcement action. So it becomes all the more important that amending the clause to include the giving of a receipt--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> If we accept that monitoring of the enforcement might, as the explanatory notes suggest, entail entering laboratories of the enforcement authority which may house valuable equipment, the confiscation of which the Food Standards Agency might consider necessary for the purposes of its investigation, the Minister will understand why we feel that it would be important to give a receipt for samples or equipment. With a laboratory setting or any other specialised facility belonging to the enforcement authority, it is important also to constrain what may be taken to what is relevant purely for the purposes of investigation. For the same reasons that we rehearsed earlier, records in laboratories or other offices of the enforcement authority might often be of serious significance, so we feel strongly that it would be good practice to issue a receipt for them.
<P>
On the requirements relating to the power to observe, which we want in the Bill, we think that it is not unreasonable to include a provision that if the enforcement authority were to obstruct the operations of the Food Standards Agency, it should at least be allowed to give a reasonable excuse for doing so. These arguments were advanced when we talked about observation. We merely feel that, given the seriousness of what the agency would be doing, the monitoring exercise could be extremely important. As the Minister has shown genuine consideration for the import of our amendments, and as the Government intend to table later amendments that would address our concerns, I am confident that when we have heard the Minister's response, we shall not feel it necessary to press the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) is correct in that in so far as the amendments mirror those that we discussed on clause 11, we make exactly the same commitment. However, this is a different class of monitoring. I must point out that there would not be a power to confiscate laboratory equipment. The issue that the hon. Lady raised would be completely outwith the clause. The power applies only to samples or records.
<P>
Clause 14(3)(b) states that any authorised person may:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``take samples of any articles or substances''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Laboratory equipment will not count as a substance, so I can assure the hon. Lady that there is no power to confiscate such equipment under the clause.
<P>
The requirement to provide on request receipts relating to samples is wholly reasonable and fits in with our remarks on an earlier clause. I do not want to repeat myself, as we are making progress. However, the Government will give the same considerations and degree of commitment to amendments relating to clause 11 as they will to amendments relating to clause 14.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 would impose a requirement to demonstrate the relevance of samples that are taken and records that are copied. In principle, that is an attractive proposition, but it is not practical. We are, however, examining matters raised by clauses 11 and 14 in the context of comments made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health. We shall take both clauses as a package during further consideration of the Bill.
<P>
I trust that that answers the request of the hon. Member for Meriden that we examine the same matters in relation to clause 14 that we have agreed to examine in relation to clause 11. I am certainly happy to give such a commitment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We look forward to the Government's amendments. I remind the Minister that we suggested that perhaps such matters  ought to be enshrined in a code of practice. However, in view of his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 7, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) any official laboratory,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 125, in page 7, line 14, after `any', insert `non-official'.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> The need to reach the highest standards has been emphasised many times in this Committee. Scientific and medical evidence will clearly play a major part--indeed, almost a total part--in making those standards stick and convincing consumers that we have the best knowledge.
<P>
There can be no other basis for that, so we must ask where that knowledge comes from. We must ensure that the people who provide it are world-class, scientifically and medically. Their laboratories should contain state-of-the-art equipment. The days of broken test tubes and pipettes are over. Laboratories must be equipped with highly sophisticated apparatus for infrared spectroscopy, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and so on, which is costly.
<P>
The people working in such laboratories will be exceptionally honest and will have provided information at a world-class level for some time. They will talk to the international scientific and medical communities about their work and results.
<P>
There have been one or two cases of malpractice in laboratories. However, I do not want to talk about that because court-case controversies about forensic tests or testing urine samples for alcohol levels have been exceptionally few. This country has a huge record of excellence in the field of providing information to the public, which must continue.
<P>
It may not be crucial, but laboratories should have open days, on which the public can be shown what goes on. That has been important in other scientific and medical debates that have taken place prior to the passing of Bills and regulations, so it is apt in relation to the Food Standards Bill.
<P>
The Bill contains a deficiency in relation to official laboratories, which must be addressed if the Bill is to be improved. Official laboratories are different from other laboratories. I pay tribute to the Royal Society of Chemistry for providing the following information. There are 31 public analyst laboratories, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, the Central Science Laboratory, which serves MAFF and which has recently moved from my constituency of Norwich to York, and approximately 33 official public health laboratories are defined as official laboratories. Those laboratories are also exceptionally important because they are defined by directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993, which is entitled ``Additional Measures concerning the Official Control of Foodstuffs''. Official laboratories are legislated for under that directive. Therefore, they have status, are audited annually and standards are kept very high.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The laboratories must also comply with the criteria of other Departments, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and territorial Departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are accredited to the highest level and are recognised as such. That is important politically if we are to develop standards across Europe.
<P>
Official laboratories do not just carry out analytical chemistry, physics and biology and identify organisms. They have a wider responsibility than that. They have to interpret results and assess them, which is all part of the enforcement decisions made by other individuals and bodies. Therefore, they have a key role to play,
<P>
I do not wish to decry the non-official laboratories. Their expertise will have to be used in certain cases, such as longer-term research projects. It is important to recognise that, although the professionalism, skills and talents of those who work in official laboratories may be different from those used in non-official laboratories, they are all important. It does analysts a disservice to lump them altogether, and European legislation has differentiated them for us.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I shall briefly oppose the amendment. It does a disservice to those laboratories that may carry out sampling and testing to a very high standard, but are not, in the words of the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), ``official laboratories''.
<P>
An approved scheme for laboratories was set up a few years ago. I cannot remember its name, but it sounded like NABOBs, NACAPs or something like that. It did not matter whether it was a public analyst, a Government laboratory that received massive investment or a university or private laboratory. Provided that quality control methods were in place, the machinery was tested, it did things according to a detailed protocol and was inspected regularly by the national association of approved laboratories--I cannot remember the ghastly acronym--the Government would accept it as an approved laboratory. It did not matter whether the laboratory was in the private sector or was a tiny one in a university and specialised in a small area, the Government would approve it as one capable of carrying out research or analytical work to the highly satisfactory standard that other public laboratories and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist could achieve.
<P>
I am slightly worried that the amendment might be rather protectionist. I might do the hon. Member for Norwich, North a disservice, but it might mean jobs for the boys in official laboratories. I do not like the idea that only official laboratories should be involved. The agency must be able to bring in any laboratory to do work.
<P>
The Minister or the members of the new Food Standards Agency may wake up the day after its investiture and find that there is a problem of lead in animal feed. That problem occurred 10 years ago, and the milk of tens of thousands of cows in the west country was contaminated. There were hardly enough laboratories in the United Kingdom to analyse half a million milk samples a day. It was vital in those circumstances not to restrict oneself to 10, 20 or 30 Government-approved laboratories. One had to go to any laboratory in the country which proved that it could work to an acceptable standard according to the impartial organisation which approves laboratory standards. One should not tie the FSA to official laboratories, provided that the laboratories that it uses have passed this quality control standard, the name of which I shall find out in a few seconds but for the life of me I cannot now remember.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall come to the point raised by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) in a moment. We are not able to accept the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North but it is important to put a few points on the record. We accept the principle behind the amendments; we do not overlook the critical role played by the official laboratories as set out by my hon. Friend. I certainly wish to put on record our appreciation of the excellent work of those laboratories and the high standards maintained, particularly by the public analysis laboratories and the Public Health Laboratory Service. That is not to say that we knock the others, but the official laboratories carry out important work to a very high standard.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's point that this was jobs for the boys is not valid and is a little unkind. The Royal Society of Chemistry of which most of the laboratory employees are members is a world-class professional organisation. Indeed, at one point I was hoping that I could say that I got these amendments from a man I met in the street. I met one of the key members of the Royal Society of Chemistry as I was walking between Norman Shaw and this building and he said, ``Ah, I've got some amendments''. He opened his case, and sure enough there they were. They had not been tabled and there was no number on them, but they have appeared as amendments Nos. 124 and 125.
<P>
When the clause was drafted, the official laboratories were very much in mind concerning the enforcement of related premises. Official laboratories are included within the meaning of any laboratory or similar premises at which work relating to the enforcement of relevant legislation has been carried out. We are not convinced, therefore, that there is a legal case for making a separation in the Bill simply because of the unfair and false signal that it would send to those non-official laboratories. I am meeting the points made by both my hon. Friend and the right hon. Gentleman. We would not wish to give a false impression. There are many laboratories in this country doing very good work.
<P>
We will shortly consult on changes to code of practice 7. I do not want to mislead the hon. Member for Meriden, but it deals with enforcement sampling. This code will emphasise the role and importance of the official laboratory and, as with other statutory codes, food authorities are required to have regard to it. There is a precise process for taking enforcement samples: they are taken for the laboratory to do the work on, as a back-up and to be given to the person from whom they have been taken so that he can go to his own laboratory to get matters checked. It is important to have a code, particularly when dealing with enforcement sampling.
<P>
The point that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border made was absolutely right. I am at a complete loss to understand the full acronym, but I visited the laboratory. It is a MAFF agency. It was buried away at the back of the building in Norwich of the Central Science Laboratory, which has been moved to York. It earns some £600,000 to £700,000 a year. This MAFF agency--NAMAS--accredits laboratories from as far away as Africa, America and China. I cannot remember the total number of laboratories that use the service, but it is several hundred, an enormous number of which are outside this country and the European Union. NAMAS provides material to those laboratories and asks them to find out what it contains and whether it is contaminated. In other words, it checks the quality of service that those laboratories provide.
<P>
NAMAS does not receive any publicity because, by and large, it works. Things receive publicity only if they do not work. I do not know when the service was set up, but we did not do so. [Interruption.] The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border obviously set it up, and I pay tribute to him, because it is a public sector body, part of the much maligned MAFF, and does class work to protect the food chain around the world. It is so good that laboratories in America queue up to be accredited by the service. They can tell their customers that they provide a good service because that British organisation, which has tested their work and checked them out, says so. The service does vital work.
<P>
The people who work in the official laboratories and members of the Royal Society of Chemistry will understand why we cannot accept the amendment, although we entirely agree with the principle that lies behind it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the words of praise that he heaps on that organisation. However, I am disappointed that he did not read the press release issued when I went to Norwich to launch NAMAS in 1991. I was about to call it napalm. I am glad that the Minister is proud of something that I did in my past life at the Ministry, and that he has said that the laboratories used will be accredited to the NAMAS standard. Public and official laboratories must meet the NAMAS standard, otherwise I suspect that they would be closed down. If laboratories are at the NAMAS standard, the Minister can be happy to let the FSA use them for testing purposes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> I am happy to withdraw the amendment given my hon. Friend the Minister's confirmation of the richness that we have in the scientific and medical community in this country. We should be rightly proud of all those involved in it. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave. withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 7, line 26, after `person' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any person accompanying an authorised person under subsection (5)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 121, in page 7, line 27, after `information' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or releases or exposes any sample'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 122, in page 7, line 28, after `premises', insert `or thereafter'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We come to the last set of amendments to clause 14. I hope that the debate will not take up too much of the Committee's time given that we have already covered similar ground. I understand that the Government have agreed to accept amendment No. 127, which will accelerate the process considerably. We are grateful to the Government for giving us notice that that is the case.
<P>
These amendments simply reflect our attempt to restrict the accompanying person under clause 11 on the agency's power of observation. We want the same restrictions to apply to the accompanying person involved in the monitoring of enforcement for exactly the same reasons. Amendment No. 127 relates to the accompanying person's authorisation. We understand that the wording is acceptable.
<P>
Amendment No. 121 deals with the release or exposure of any sample. I have previously explained similar matters in relation to business premises, but it is easy to understand that the accidental or deliberate exposure or release of samples in relation to the enforcement authority's own premises could be extremely serious in terms of why the agency was monitoring the enforcement authority in the first place and what that might mean for the enforcement authority's performance.
<P>
The third amendment in the group is designed to control the period in which the accompanying person has access to information and what he or she should do with it after leaving the enforcement agency's premises.
<P>
Our amendments are an attempt to include safeguards in the Bill so that the enforcement authority is protected in exactly the same way as we sought protection for premises to be observed by the agency. Given the concessions that we received in relation to the power of observation, I have every confidence that we will be told that the same is true in relation to an enforcement authority

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall deal with the amendments in reverse order. Amendment No 122 is similar to amendment No. 119, which related to clause 11, so the same arguments apply. Information that is gleaned subsequently from a sample still counts as information obtained on the premises, so authorised officers could not do anything else with that extra information; they would still be forbidden from disclosing trade secrets at any time in any circumstances. The clause provides that back-up provision, so we do not see the need to repeat it.
<P>
Amendment No. 121 would not add anything new to the clause. I am advised by the lawyers that the scope of the word ``information'' is already wide enough to include samples, so information that is obtained from the analysis of a sample is information that was contained in the sample when it was removed from the premises. Obviously, work is done on samples and substances are taken from them in the laboratory as opposed to on the premises, but the restriction on the release of information still applies Indeed, if we accepted the amendment, doubt would be cast on the broad meaning of the word ``information''.
<P>
Now for the good news. We are happy to accept amendment No. 127. The original Opposition amendment, amendment No. 120, drew to our attention a flaw in the Bill In the spirit of giving credit where credit is due, we drew to the Opposition's attention the flaw in amendment No. 120 and said that, if they retabled it, we would accept it. The provision should include people who are accompanying the authorised person; as I said, that might include a commission official carrying out an audit inspection. Such people must be covered by the Bill. After a re-„examination of clause 14(7) and the equivalent, amended provision in clause 11, we feel that there is some ambiguity in the current drafting. After further consideration, I may table a further tidying-up amendment on Report. That in no way undermines the fact that amendment No. 127 is acceptable to the Government, and I shall ask my hon. Friends to support it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We are pleased to hear of the Government's concession. We perfectly understand that clause 11 must mirror clause 14, so that an accompanying person is subject to, for example, the same fines if they are in breach of the restrictions on information. They should be treated in exactly the same way as the authorised person. We are delighted to hear that the Government are considering removing that ambiguity as well.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 14, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``enforcement authority'' and related expressions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Some clauses may not need any debate, but not those in this part of the Bill. Clause 15 fits in with and relates exclusively to clauses 12, 13 and 14, with which we have just dealt, and which define the terms used outwith legislation. I say that so that we do not set any hares running outside.
<P>
We always ask for individual elements to be considered in the context of the whole Bill. Legitimate questions may be asked concerning some clauses, but it is also legitimate for us to say that answers are given elsewhere in the legislation. Clause 15 defines the term ``relevant legislation''. Enforcement authorities are defined as those identified earlier in the Bill, and the Agriculture Act 1993 is also invoked.
<P>
Subsection (3) makes it clear that the monitoring of an authority's enforcement can include monitoring whether that authority has the capacity to enforce the law--whether it has sufficiently qualified inspectors. Not just the mechanics of the operation are involved--the provision goes beyond whether authorities have made enough visits and whether those visits were of a sufficiently high quality. It asks whether the local authority has the capacity--the resources--to do the job.
<P>
The monitoring of enforcement action was identified in the report by Professor Philip James that set all this running and which we published just a week after the general election of 1997. That is a key part of the raising of standards and work is already under way in advance of the establishment of the agency.
<P>
The joint food safety and standards group has established a local authority enforcement liaison group. Someone might be able to find a way of saying LAELG, but I shall not try to pronounce it. That advance process involves the group and local authorities, plus the territorial officials and enforcement representatives discussing how links with local authority enforcement can be strengthened and developed, and how proper mechanisms to underpin that may be put in place. They began to meet in May 1999.
<P>
That liaison group is currently focusing on developing options for a national audit and monitoring scheme, and is considering what can be done to make local authority business planning arrangements more consistent and effective. That is to make the identification of local enforcement priorities and objectives more transparent and open to discussion. The local authorities have been fully supportive of the measures, and the Government are keen that the agency should work in close partnership with them. We are pleased to see that that is already happening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I did not intend to pay much attention to the clause, which I had assumed would go through on the nod. It may be an aspect of Celtic paranoia, but when a Minister makes a speech in favour of a clause that the Opposition are not against when one does not expect him to, I instinctively get slightly suspicious about why he has. Listening to the Minister, I became more worried. We may come on to the point on a later clause, perhaps on clause 18, but it seems that the Minister is gently paving the way towards saying, ``We in central Government will force people in local authorities to do things more our way, or up the enforcement level to a level that we consider to be satisfactory.'' There may or may not be merit in that. However, the one thing that is clear is that complete autonomy used to be enjoyed by environmental health officers--although they were guided on some matters of interpretation by the Department of Health and their professional association--and trading standards officers, who were often guided by MAFF on labelling issues.
<P>
There is a slight smell about what the Minister is telling us. He implies that in future there will be a bit more guidance from the centre and a bit more control over how local authorities enforce the law. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) is nodding. Perhaps he thinks, ``A good thing too--it is about time that these local authorities were controlled by the Government.'' Whether or not that is so, let us be under no illusion but that that is what the Minister is saying.
<P>
It may be about time that the Local Government Association woke up and paid a little more attention to what the Minister has been saying in Committee and what the Bill is about. The situation may have changed completely since my day--many things have, of course. Environmental health officers, trading standards officers and their professional bodies--the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Food and Trading Standards and so on--used to be adamant that they were the enforcing authorities. They felt that we, as Ministers, did not need to take some of the powers that we took under the Food Safety Act 1990 because Ministers do not know how to enforce the law, that local authorities did that rigorously, assiduously and independently, and that Government should keep their sticky fingers out of the pie. The Minister now seems to be saying that the Government will have their sticky fingers in that pie. That may be a matter for debate, but it is the message that I got from his speech, and very helpful it was too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee, because frankly the whole of the past hour and half of our proceedings has been exactly that. Clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 are not about getting control or bringing in a national enforcement operation, but making sure that we monitor and raise standards of enforcement. There is nothing secretive about that. I am determined to explain every clause in the Bill, because we have nothing to be ashamed or defensive about--there is no hidden agenda. We are being completely open. There is to be a raising of standards, and the one sure way to bring that about is, firstly, by monitoring existing standards to see that they are carried out to a sufficient degree across the country. I make no apology for that. Local government is awake and on board, and very supportive of the contents of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Conservative Members have no intention of opposing the clause, because to do so would be to condone lawbreaking. However, it is useful to have this opportunity to probe the Minister a little on some of the intentions behind clause 16. To some extent, the debate mirrors our consideration of clause 11(7).
<P>
Under what circumstances could someone intentionally obstruct under clause 16(1)(a) without reasonable excuse? For example, if the situation involved dangerous machinery in a factory or pathogens in a laboratory, would that be viewed as intentionally obstructing, or would there be a reasonable excuse? Subsection (l)(b) refers to complying with the requirements of the agency. Again, there is a reasonable excuse provision built into the clause. Can the Minister give the Committee a few examples of what it might be? Subsection (l)(c) is strangely drafted, because the last two lines are much more serious than the rest of the clause. They apply to a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``recklessly furnishes information which is false or misleading in any material particular''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a highly serious matter, and yet it is lumped in with a whole lot of less serious matters. I wonder whether applying one fine to two categories of offence is practical or sensible, when they are of different seriousness. Will the Minister give us a clearer explanation of his thinking on the clause?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall try to deal with the points made by the hon. Gentleman, who said that he would not oppose the clause. It is specific, and relates only to offences in clauses 13 and 14, as set out in its title. There might be some interesting legal definitions of ``reckless'' and other such words that we could discuss at some length, although, as a humble non-lawyer, I am not qualified to do so.
<P>
The clause deals with offences of obstruction, non-compliance or misleading the agency during its enforcement monitoring. It does not affect the powers of local authority enforcement officers, and it is not related to the agency's powers to make observations. That is dealt with by another clause--my comments relate only to clauses 14 and 16.
<P>
There are three ways of committing the offence, and I shall stick to my brief in outlining them, or the lawyers will have to trawl over my remarks. ``Obstruction'' means intentionally and not recklessly obstructing someone who is, A, lawfully entering premises specified in accordance with the Act, B, taking samples on those premises or, C, inspecting or copying records found there or requiring computerised records to be made available in a legible form. That is one way of committing the offence of obstruction.
<P>
The second way of committing the offence is by withholding facilities, records, articles, substances, assistance or information without reasonable excuse. The third way is by providing knowingly or recklessly misleading information. I cannot give examples, as I do not know how often difficulties will arise. The clauses and work on local government monitoring is brand new legislation, and such provisions are not currently in force. They form one of the new aspects of the Bill.
<P>
Intentionally obstructing means preventing an authorised person from carrying out his or her functions. ``Authorised'' means authorised under the Act and carrying necessary documentation. It will be reasonable if someone cannot find the documents that are sought, but it would not be proper for a door to be deliberately locked to stop somebody looking for them in a room where those documents were thought to be held. If someone were to go to a room to look for documents but could not find them, it could not count as obstruction. That is the clearest way in which the difference can be explained. If the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) remains unsatisfied, I have no doubt that he will return to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Our amendment on the matter was not selected, although I do not imply any criticism of you, Mr Hood. Where the clause states ``intentional obstruction''--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment to which the hon. Gentleman refers was considered during debate on a group of amendments considered previously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Thank you, Mr. Hood. Clause 16(1)(a) refers to ``intentionally obstructing'' and no reasonable excuse clause is built into the Bill. I gave two examples. Dangerous machinery could be operating in a factory, and an official could turn up and ask for access to a particular part of the premises. He could be told that it was not was a convenient time because no one was available to accompany him into the area. Would that be intentional obstruction? The same circumstances might arise in a laboratory that contained dangerous pathogens. Somebody might be in the middle of an experiment that involved them. An official might turn up and say, ``I want to get into that laboratory now,'' and the employee might say, ``No, you cannot go in now. We are in the middle of a dangerous experiment. You will have to wait.'' Is that intentional obstruction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. I have simply taken the approach of a reasonable person. I have visited such laboratories, and it was made abundantly clear to me that visitors and people who dealt with some substances must take extra precautions. The same is even true of visitors to some areas of food factories. It is not just a case of putting on white wellies; in some cases, a complete change of outfit is needed when visitors move from one area to another. That is not classed as obstruction. No reasonable person could construe waiting in a queue or the examples that the hon. Member for Cotswold gave as obstruction--intentional or otherwise. If the work that is going on poses a health and safety risk, there is a duty of care on the person who runs the establishment, the people who work there and visitors. Such a duty applies to an enforcement officer who is on the premises as much as it does to an employee. Nobody could claim that enforcing it was obstruction.
<P>
We are not looking to give a whole list of areas in which obstruction would be classed as okay; that would probably not be in the enforcement authority's interests. The examples that the hon. Gentleman gave would not be obstruction, and I can say that without fear of contradiction. I have not been contradicted while I have been on my feet, so I must be right.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Delegation of powers to make emergency orders</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 9, line 1, at end insert­
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) After making such an order the Agency must publish its reasons for doing so within 14 days.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We come now to clause 17 and powers to make emergency orders. Of course, it is right that the agency should have powers to issue such orders. After all, the Government have made it abundantly clear that the agency will be best placed to put them into effect, given the wealth of scientific information from advisory committees that it will have at its disposal and the calibre of scientists whom, we are assured, it will employ and who will advise it.
<P>
The amendment is a bid to improve and protect the agency from any charge that it lacks openness or transparency or that its independence is compromised in some way. It is a bid to reduce the Secretary of State's influence, which is neither necessary nor desirable.
<P>
He should not have the whip hand in saying whether an emergency control order should be imposed. There have been suggestions--the Select Committee made this point--that such intervention by the Secretary of State is not desirable. We urge the Government to be more decisive.
<P>
Earlier, we discussed powers of observation. In a small number of cases, it might be necessary to make random spot checks on premises where the nuclear option had occurred and something had gone so seriously wrong that the agency needed to intervene in the way that we are discussing. The Minister referred to the powers that were available under an emergency order. The problem is that the agency does not appear to be sufficiently free from the possibility of intervention by the Secretary of State. The explanatory notes make that clear.
<P>
They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State will retain this power, and in addition the Agency may be empowered by him''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is still a lack of clarity in the clause.
<P>
In the amendment, we propose a time constraint on the agency's publication of its advice. Fourteen days is a reasonable period. It is an important statutory requirement that the agency should know that its information will become public knowledge and that period will give it a chance to work out an implementation strategy before the advice is published. The amendment is important because it would limit the power of the Secretary of State to change or interfere with the advice before it enters the public domain, and that could only enhance the independent standing of the agency.
<P>
Our second amendment--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dealing only with amendment No. 43.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I apologise, Mr. Hood. I thought that the amendments were grouped.
<P>
I wish to restrict this part of the debate to the question of the emergency control order and the role of the Secretary of State in relation to the agency when such an order is made.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> I had hoped to be reasonably soothing and consensual in my response to the hon. Member for Meriden, but it is clear from what she said not only that we disagree wholeheartedly with the underlying reasons for the amendment but that the amendment is unnecessary. I shall explain why.
<P>
In general, emergency control orders are measures of last resort which, rightly, are rarely taken. The emergency control orders under the Food Safety Act 1990, of which there have been only a handful since 1990, are made in circumstances of grave and imminent threat to public health. They can have a profound impact on the businesses or individuals affected and accountability requires that that power rests with the Secretary of State. I shall come back to that issue when we debate the next amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): Will those powers be handed over to the agency as a general rule or only for specific instances after the agency has come to the Minister?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The clause gives the Secretary of State power to delegate that responsibility to the agency in certain circumstances, but we expect that the kinds of circumstances in which it is used would be ones where action were needed in a situation of utmost emergency. In other words, it would be an unusual occurrence; the presumption remains that the orders would be signed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
To move on to the main point of the amendment, the requirement that an order made by the agency would be followed by publication of reasons is unnecessary, for several reasons. When made, the orders will be laid before Parliament, but that will not provide information about the reasons; the reasons would be published shortly after. It is highly likely that the powers will apply on the sort of occasions that we read about in newspapers, such as the case of dioxins in chicken and other foodstuffs. They are emergency powers to be used in circumstances of potential risk to public health. The agency will have a responsibility to act transparently and to publish information about its actions. The fact that an order had been made and the reasons for making it would quickly--mostly within 14 days--become a matter of public knowledge. We cannot accept the amendment for that reason, so I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I probably have less experience than some members of the Committee in the practice of emergency orders because, as the Minister said, not many of them are made. We are concerned that they may become more frequent if the capacity to make them is delegated to the agency. It will be important to its credibility for everyone to understand why it is being given that power.
<P>
The dioxin example that the Minister used was one in which there was a considerable delay between the first circulation of information about the scare and any publication of advice about it. Perhaps it is not the best example to illuminate the discussion.
<P>
I am advised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border that the present practice is for reasons to be published. If that were systematically done in the 14-day period that we want, our fears would be allayed and I could withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have a suggestion for my hon. Friend. I recall in my day suddenly being told one Whitsun weekend on a lovely sunny day, ``Minister, we've got paralytic shellfish poisoning''. My first reaction was that someone was taking the mickey, until it was explained. Emergency control orders had to be made. As soon as that is done, there is merit in informing the public; they have to be told, as do the media. When the agency takes action on an emergency control order, the House of Commons should as a matter of practice be informed informally through the Library or some other mechanism at the same time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. Judging from the nodding by Labour Members--
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> It is an eminently sensible suggestion and one that we certainly take on board.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> On the basis of that reassurance, along with many that we have received about what will become good practice for the agency, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave. withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 9, line 8, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
I was inspired to try to link amendments Nos. 43 and 44, although they were not grouped together. However, amendment No. 44 mirrors the concerns of amendment No. 43. The clause appears to give breathtaking power, and we thought that there should be a clearly perceived distance between the Secretary of State and the actions of the agency so that it should be seen to be as free of ministerial interference as possible. The clause presents a risk of the agency's freedom being suffocated, which is why we propose giving the agency more freedom. The Government try to persuade us that they are ready to cut the umbilical cord from the agency that they are creating, because it is important that the agency be seen to be free in the public eye. Some of the response to our previous amendment meets our anxieties, but I should nevertheless be interested to hear the views of the Minister for Public Health on this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire) rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Maclean.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was perfectly willing for the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) to go first, although I accept your selection, Mr. Hood.
<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Nothing in any such arrangements prevents the Secretary of State exercising any power.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean? If it means a similar power, it is redundant. The agency should have that. The provision refers to ``the Secretary of State'', which must mean the Secretary of State for Health, rather than the Minister for Agriculture who, I presume, will have no power. I can only assume that it is a caveat to provide that the Secretary of State shall continue to exercise control over matters not relating to food and emergency control orders, such as national health service drugs, non food related cancer scares or medicinal products.
<P>
If the provision relates to food, it is redundant. It is double banking, because the agency is supposed to be in charge of food safety and standards by making regulations and exercising its powers. However, the subsection appears to provide that nothing in any such arrangements prevents the Secretary of State from doing so if he or she so wishes. It cannot apply to the same subject matter--I hope--because otherwise the Minister is officially creating an independent FSA while retaining control, saying that if the agency does not do something, the Secretary of State will exercise his powers. I hope that my other interpretation is the correct one, and that the provision is merely a legal cover-all to ensure that, in giving such powers to the FSA, the Secretary of State for Health retains his other emergency powers relating to medicines and other health responsibilities, as opposed to those relating to food.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> My interpretation of the provision and its application to the Secretary of State's powers is that it relates specifically to emergency powers. The provision will give the Secretary of State the right to carry out the function that would otherwise be delegated to the FSA. Discretion has been provided to place the powers in the hands of the FSA, but the Secretary of State will retain the option to exercise those powers and make emergency orders himself. My point relates to that assumption. We shall learn whether that is correct when the Minister replies.
<P>
In what context would the Minister exercise the powers if he were to do so rather than the agency because the Secretary of State had chosen not to delegate them? My oft-quoted clause 23(2) provides that the FSA will exercise its powers using the concepts of proportionality and risk analysis, by which it will judge whether an emergency control order would be the most appropriate way to deal with a particular food hygiene risk. I am not clear whether the Secretary of State would have to exercise the powers in the same context as the FSA. If he decided not to delegate them to the FSA, would he nevertheless be similarly bound in having to decide whether the risk of an outbreak was sufficiently great that an emergency control order should be imposed and whether that response was proportionate to the costs and the benefits--and, as the Minister said, to the substantial impact that it would have on the business and the livelihoods of its workers.
<P>
I would welcome a clear definition. Are we correct in our assumption that the clause allows the Secretary of State to decide whether to exercise those powers or to delegate them and that, if he chooses to exercise the powers directly, he would be bound by the same constraints as the agency in carrying out those authorities?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> It is an extraordinary amendment, and I was interested in the comments of the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. Clause 17(4) is about democratic accountability. The clause does not suggest that all powers should be handed to an agency. The agency should be obliged to give advice to Ministers, and Ministers should be obliged to publish that advice; but democratic accountability should still rest on the shoulders of Ministers. Deleting subsection (4) would neuter the Government. It would allow Ministers to slip away from their responsibility and say, ``We appointed the agency and it has all gone wrong, but it is not our fault.'' I should be worried if anyone suggested deleting the Government's ultimate responsibility for food safety.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The key point is that nothing in the Bill transfers to the agency the power to make emergency control orders that is currently vested in the Secretary of State under the Food Safety Act 1990 and under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Under the well-established Carltona principle, the responsibility can, with agreement, be delegated to the agency, but the presumption is that, because of their potential impact and seriousness, the orders will continue to be signed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
To answer my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire, the Secretary of State is not constrained by the provisions of clause 23. However, if it were felt that he had acted unreasonably in signing such an order, his decision would be open to judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for that useful explanation. I shall explore the matter a little further. Clause 23(2) would apply if the power was delegated to the FSA. Is there not an inconsistency in the way in which an emergency control order--as my right hon. Friend says, it is a severe instrument--could be applied because of the two different routes through which it might arise?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> Yes, there is an inconsistency, but it is deliberate. When responsibility is delegated, the agency's actions will be required to be proportionate to the risks. The importance of the power being retained by the Secretary of State is that it is conceivable that he may want to take action that is more far reaching, on the basis that evidence is provided to him. The safeguard in relation to the Secretary of State's actions is, as I have already said, that the decisions that he makes should be subject to judicial review.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister is saying, in effect, that the agency may come across another example of paralytic shellfish poisoning in the North sea, and conclude that it should ban fishing from areas X, Y and Z, but that the Secretary of State may conclude from the evidence that, in addition, areas A, B, C and P, Q, R should be included. The Secretary of State can then make an order on exactly the same subject, but which is wider ranging than the one made by the agency.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right. I hope that I have made it clear why we are unable to accept the amendment and the reasons why the Secretary of State is retaining such powers in these important matters. I hope that the hon. Member for Meriden will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. She has used an example of the Secretary of State exercising the power to go one better than the agency. I am a little concerned that, in the eyes of the public, who need to have confidence in the agency, it might make it seem a little weak. We have not discussed an example of the agency using a delegated power to make an emergency order and the Secretary of State using a second power to override it because they are at odds with each other in some way. In that instance, the Secretary of State will want to undo the order originally made by the agency.
<P>
We all appreciate and understand the necessity to have an emergency order and the even more rare occasions when the agency will have to use that power. For that reason, we shall not press the amendments, even though we have some residual concern about how the provision will work in practice. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have three brief points to ask the Minister before disposing of the clause. It is an important clause and people's livelihoods could be severely at risk in its exercise.
<P>
First, will it be the normal presumption that all voluntary steps will be taken before the emergency powers are issued, which would be wholly sensible? Secondly, I should like an assurance that home produced produce will not be subject to the order that would not otherwise be applied to imported foodstuffs from the European Union. Home-produced foodstuffs should not be at a greater disadvantage by gold-plating the regulations than imported produce from the European Union. Thirdly, is it the presumption that the order will be in force for as little time as necessary to sort out the problem? What will be the procedure for cancelling the order when it no longer applies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I do not want to be churlish as the Minister was kind enough to accept the suggestion that Parliament should be informed at the earliest opportunity when a delegated body makes delegated legislation. This would be delegated legislation in the true sense of the term.
<P>
So much delegated legislation goes through the House. It increases under all Governments and it is difficult to keep up with what is going on. I am not talking about the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly, which have their own powers. We are giving powers to a new quango to make subordinate legislation, so we should have special procedures to ensure that the attention of the House is drawn to it. It was suggested earlier that a notice should be put in the Library. Government Departments swamp the Library with material every day. Unless one knows something is coming, or and checks it out often, it is impossible to keep up to date with what is going on. I do not have a suggestion to make about that now, but I may have one on Report. I appeal to Government to think of mechanisms when, on the rare occasions when emergency control orders have to be made to deal with dioxins, the Belgian scare regarding Coca-Cola, and so on.
<P>
We hope that such orders will not have to be made too often, but we must ensure that, when they are, the House of Commons is alerted before it states in the Order Paper three days later that an emergency control order was made. We may need to live without changing the regulations in the standing procedures of the House, and we do not necessarily want statements, unless on big, important issues. For routine emergency control orders, the Government must think of a mechanism whereby Parliament is alerted that an outside body is exercising a power that Parliament and the people of this country have granted to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> First, I assure the hon. Member for Cotswold that, of course, before an emergency control order is made, all steps will have been taken to avoid it. The nature of an emergency control order is just that. It is designed to protect the public from urgent and unforeseen risks. On his second point, precisely the same tests apply to both home-produced and imported food. Two of the orders signed by my hon. Friend the Minister of State related to imported peanuts and imported pistachio nuts.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's third point referred to the length of time that an order will apply. Orders under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 cease to have effect after 28 days, unless they are approved by affirmative legislation. From my experience of the emergency control order with which I have been involved, I know that every effort is made to ensure that the circumstances that gave rise to the order are resolved as quickly as possible because of the commercial consequences to those involved.
<P>
On the point raised by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, to talk about a routine emergency control order is something of an oxymoron. They are, by definition, unusual and invariably unexpected matters of last resort. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman about the parliamentary scrutiny that he seeks. The orders will always be laid before the House, so it will be informed when such an order is made.
<P>
Despite the legislation having existed for about 10 years, these orders are used infrequently and we want to ensure that there is not an undue and unjustified increase in their use as a result of the new arrangements. We would expect this matter to be reported regularly in the annual report, but the key point is that there must be proper provision for parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<H4><center>Functions under other Acts</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I do not wish to let the clause pass without a few brief comments. It seems an innocuous little clause, but it implements schedule 3, which lifts, lock, stock and barrel, some sections of the 1990 Act, which the Government are incorporating--in rather an odd way--into the Bill. Schedule 3 implements legislation that the Government, along with local authorities, fought vigorously when the 1990 Act was going through Parliament. The Government have chosen to give themselves power to take over the responsibilities of food enforcement authorities and environmental health and trading standards officers, and be the enforcing authority that makes the regulations. Rather than building free-standing clauses to the Bill--which might stand out a mile--the Government have decided in this short clause to implement schedule 3, which lifts verbatim some of the wicked sections of the 1990 Act, which as the then Opposition they hated at the time.
<P>
The Government are giving the agency, which is to be a regulatory body, the right to take over, if it wishes, all the enforcement powers of the local authorities. As I said at the time of the 1990 Act, we do not expect local authorities to fail in their duties or for the power to have to be invoked, and if they did start to fail, we would chivvy them along, monitor them and encourage them to exercise the law. Everyone at the time said that it was wicked for the Government to take such powers, and that Governments knew nothing about the practicalities of enforcement and should confine themselves to the general regulatory role of taking 180,000 food samples a year, giving general guidance, passing and implementing the law, leaving it to the experts to enforce it--the experts being the EHOs in all the district councils, aided and backed by their professional bodies, with advice from MAFF or the Department of Health.
<P>
I wish merely to point out to anyone who has not spotted it that the Government are taking exactly the powers, admittedly by a slightly more obscure, back-door route, that they severely criticised 10 years ago. In what circumstances do the Government see the FSA marching into Eden district council or Perry Barr district council--rather like the hit squads that will be sent into local authorities that are failing to educate our children properly--and announcing, ``You are not doing a good enough job and you are not up to scratch; we, the Government, are now taking over your responsibilities and your lousy environmental health officers and will enforce the law''? I would like an assurance from the Minister on that. The schedule implements section 6(4) of the 1990 Act, which the Government will use to make regulations to transfer full control of the Meat Hygiene Service to the Food Standards Agency. We may, if we are fortunate in the selection of amendments, deal with that later so I shall not labour the point, other than to say that, if the Government do that, they will be going down the wrong route.
<P>
I remind anyone unfortunate enough to be following our proceedings closely, or who may not yet know what the Government are doing, that they are taking the same powers to interfere, control and do the job of EHOs for which they severely criticised the previous Government, which took those powers as a fail-safe measure to cover all circumstances. No doubt the Minister will explain why those powers are essential to the Government--although, of course, they have no intention of using them or of further controlling how local authorities do their important enforcement work.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I, too, would like to say a few brief words on this small clause. Although short, it will have a significant impact. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border pointed out, it implements schedule 3, which contains provisions from clauses 6 and 42 of the Food Safety Act 1998. I have a nasty suspicion that the clause could signal the demise of environmental health officers. What effect will the clause and schedule have on their work? I suspect that their functions will go the same way as those of the Meat Hygiene Service, because the agency will say, ``Those unprofessional local environmental health officers all apply different standards, and it would make much more sense if we combined their functions into one agency.'' Is that the intention?
<P>
I believe that those functions are better carried out locally. Many stages could be carried out before an order to take away the powers of the environmental health officers has to be made under clause 18. They can be given advice and they can be trained; only as a last resort should their powers be taken away. Indeed, even if their powers were subsumed in the agency, I hope that it would be only temporary while the local authority sorted itself out. It should then be possible to repatriate the powers to the local authority. Nothing in the Bill suggests that those powers will be repatriated. If that is so, I am sure that, one by one, the environmental health officers' functions will all be taken away and subsumed into the agency. I hope that the Minister can give us some guidance on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall do my best. First, I must tell the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border that, many years ago, when researching the history of my urban constituency, I came across the Perry Barr urban parish council. However, it was abolished by the Tory landowners about 150 years ago, and it no longer exists.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Bring it back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am all in favours of parishes in our larger cities.
<P>
We shall debate schedule 3 later, but I want to make it clear that neither clause 18, nor any other part of the Bill, removes powers from local authorities. Clause 18 simply adds the agency's functions to the provisions of other Acts of Parliament that have takeover powers. All those powers exist now. Nothing has been invented. Schedule 3 deals only with existing Acts, and they all contain takeover powers. Clause 18 simply adds the agency to the list of bodies that can act under those Acts, so that, in appropriate circumstances, the agency can take on those powers. Those powers already exist. They are not created by the Bill. The concerns expressed by right hon. and hon. Members, though genuine, are misplaced.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Can the Minister reassure me that at no time will a non-elected agency sit in judgment and take powers from an elected authority? The Special Select Committee thought that the agency should advise the Minister, but that only the Minister, who was democratically accountable, should be able to override the actions of a democratically elected local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Without giving the hon. Gentleman a highly detailed and refined answer--[Interruption.] Yes, I was about to say that. The agency is accountable to the House of Commons and the devolved Parliaments through the Secretary of State for Health. The accountability buck stops on the Floor of the House. If the agency's monitoring showed that enforcement by a local authority was an utter failure, the nuclear option could be used to transfer those functions to another authority. However, the agency will be unelected and a department of Government; if it said that the powers of one local authority should go to another, we could bet our bottom dollars that the Secretary of State for Health would be answering questions about that and justifying it. It could be done only if he agreed to it, as he would be in a position to prevent it from happening.
<P>
I made clear the Government's respect for local government earlier. Local government is elected to make mistakes--that is what it is all about. The question is how to learn from them. The agency, an unelected authority, will not walk in and take over powers. The agency is accountable to the House through the Secretary of State, and accountable to the elected bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is no dislocation of the democratic chain. It is a slightly different shape, but the links are all present. One could make a connection between the actions of the agency and the democratic accountability of those decisions, as we would soon find out with questions, Adjournment debates and statements in the House.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Publication etc. by the Agency of advice and information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 9, line 19, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 111, in page 9, line 19, leave out from `Agency' to `publish' in line 20 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall (unless it can justify specific considerations of confidentiality why it should not)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 83, in page 9, line 31, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The clause allows the agency to publish any information in its possession. Amendment No. 45 would strengthen the agency's position by using ``shall'' instead of ``may''. We know that laws crafted with ``may'' do not have the same force as those with ``shall''. One of the agency's primary and important roles is to gather information on food safety and standards and to provide that information to Government, the public and other bodies. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) will probably argue that there are instances in which information should not come out. However, our purpose in tabling the amendment was to reinforce the informing role of the agency, which will be a key aspect of its being perceived as open, transparent and bringing what it knows to the public so that standards of food safety can be raised.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Amendments Nos. 111 and 83 would change the emphasis of the way in which the agency will operate, so that there would be a presumption of openness and reports would be published unless there was an overriding reason otherwise. We accept the legal reasons set out in clause 19(2), but we feel that subsection (3) emphasises the ability to suppress publication rather too heavily. Therefore, we propose the addition of a small qualification in parentheses to illustrate that the times when the agency's advice may not be published should be extremely rare.
<P>
That is important, because this debate relates to public confidence and advice to Ministers not being concealed. It was disappointing to discover yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading report on milk production was not published when it was first available, because it would have enabled people to evaluate the advice given to Ministers. If the agency is to work, the advice on which Ministers will act and the basis on which the agency will use its delegated powers should be published. It makes sense to accept amendments Nos. 111 and 83 rather than amendment No. 45, which seems designed to achieve the same thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> All the Opposition amendments are designed to achieve the same result and to shift the balance slightly. The Government may need to return to the matter on Report.
<P>
I support amendment No. 45. The clause contains the word ``may'' in line 19 and a caveat in subsection (2) that the agency may publish information but not if the information is prohibited by enactment, relates to a European matter or would constitute a punishable offence. Under subsection (3), the agency does not have to publish the information if it judges that confidentiality considerations outweigh the public interest. The clause contains a lot of factors that might lead a reasonable chief executive or press officer of the agency to conclude that the agency does not have to publish on a particular occasion. Both in presentational terms and as it will be used in reality, the cause is stacked against publication.
<P>
I argue in favour of the word ``shall''. The Minister will say that if he were to insert the word ``shall'', subsection (3) would not make sense, because it would not be possible to retain the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Before deciding to exercise that power''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
if the word ``shall'' appeared in the clause. ``Shall'' means that information must always be published, so the agency would not have a chance to decide whether to exercise its power.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider the strong representations of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden and the Liberal Democrats, and will return on Report with an amendment to insert the word ``shall'' in line 19, and with a revised subsection (3) that states that subsection (1) will not apply in the event of strictly limited circumstances in which questions of confidentiality outweigh the public interest in publication. That would put the onus on ``shall'', and would create an expectation that in all cases the presumption would be that information shall be published in the absence of overriding considerations that it should not be.
<P>
The clause gives the impression of being 55 per cent. stacked against publication in the absence of good reasons for publishing. I suggest that the Minister check with parliamentary draftsmen how it could be reworded. In presentational terms the clause would look better; several outside organisations will be suspicious of the wording of the clause because it gives the agency an awful lot of excuses not to publish if it does not want to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> In an alert democracy, people should always be suspicious of the Government. That is how I operate, even as a Minister. That is what open democracy is all about. People who make decisions must be open and accountable, and people should take things with a pinch of salt and always be inquiring.
<P>
We know what appears in the Bill and what appeared in the White Paper. Page 15 of the notes on clauses states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is envisaged that the Agency will normally wish to publish much of its advice and information.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The default is to publish. That is what people will be told when they are interviewed for jobs. In effect, the background documentation says: ``This is an open and transparent operation. If you don't want to be accountable for decisions, open and upfront, sorry, this is not for you.'' That is the culture, and it is not like what has gone on before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths </B>(Edinburgh, South): Not only is that stated in the guidance but, under clauses 6 and 7, the agency will have a duty to comply with any reasonable request from public authorities or private individuals and organisations.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, notwithstanding other clauses, especially clauses 19 and 22. No one can know what the final form will be, because the draft freedom of information Bill may change, as happened with this Bill. That is the purpose of publishing a draft Bill. The draft Bill, published in January, has been much improved as result of consultation, not least with the Special Select Committee. Nevertheless, the agency will be subject to the rules and conditions of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and those on freedom of information.
<P>
The Bill will not be outwith freedom of information legislation, and the agency will not have the power to publish everything, including advice to Ministers. However, the big difference is that the agency will have the power to put the submissions that go to Ministers into the public domain. That is the test of its independence on day to-day functions and of the fact that it will be truly at arm's length from Ministers. It is not the intention under freedom of information legislation that submissions to Ministers in other Departments will be published. The intention is that submissions to Ministers will be published in this case.
<P>
I am slightly angry--I had better contain myself--about all the recent stories and unjustified attacks on the draft freedom of information Bill because it was said that nothing on food safety issues would be published. All the expert, highly paid journalists did not take the time and trouble to check what was in the draft Bill that we published in January or what the Special Select Committee had considered in the spring.
<P>
As a result of the Bill, food safety issues will be in the public domain, because they will be dealt with by FSA. That is absolutely clear and unambiguous. I shall deal with the qualifications that are built into the clause in a moment, but all the stories about food safety issues being covered up and no one being able to get at them are totally and utterly untrue.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> May I press my hon. Friend further on that matter? Those rights will be established under the Bill. What rights of redress will the public or interested organisations have if those requirements are not complied with and they do not get the reasonable information that they request?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The public will have the same rights of redress that they will have in relation to other Departments under freedom of information legislation. The same right of complaint to the ombudsman will exist. The agency's default option will be to publish, rather than not to do so. Therefore, its culture will be different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will anything in the clause make it more difficult than now for a Member of Parliament to obtain information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Good Lord, no. The exact opposite is the case. Tabling questions about the internal workings of government is difficult. The FSA's internal workings will be open, subject to the caveats in clause 19. I shall deal with the point about the use of the words ``may'' and ``shall'' later. More information will be available. Parliamentary questions can be asked. The Public Accounts Committee will be involved in inquiring into the body, as will the National Audit Office and the relevant Select Committees, such as the Health Committee. The Agriculture Committee will probably be involved from time to time.
<P>
Absolutely nothing that I am aware of in the Bill--if there is, I shall take it out--curtails the seeking of information by Members of Parliament, because more information will be available than ever before. In fact, it may assist the authorities of the House, because fewer parliamentary questions will need to be asked. However, that has never been an excuse for not asking questions. I was advised by Willie Hamilton when I first came to the House never to ask a question on the Floor of the House to which I did not know the answer, because my surprise at the answer might ruin my supplementary question. That early teach-in, in a Room like this 20 years ago, was, ``Get your information, then table your question. That way, you do not get caught out.''
<P>
I digress, but I am trying to give members a flavour of how the body will work. Although nothing has been said about it, I freely admit that we want people to be comfortable working in that environment. In Opposition, we said that we wanted to open up Government, but we were told that no one would write Ministers' submissions because they would be in the public domain. The fact is that the people working in the agency will soon have to become comfortable with their work being in the public domain. That will be a change in culture. People from other Government Departments will be seconded to the FSA to show what open government is all about, which is not a bad idea.
<P>
I come to amendment No. 45. We have already debated the question of ``may'' or ``shall''. If we impose on the agency a duty to publish everything, the commercially confidential information that it necessarily requires will dry up. It will not be able to work for the public if it cannot work in partnership and co-operation with its clients. Like the joint food safety and standards group now, the agency will receive an enormous amount of co-operation from industry. Nothing new has happened.
<P>
It has always been the case that the co-operation of industry and the enormous amount of information that it gives the Department assists us in making policy and in policing the system. Sometimes we are able to release that information; sometimes we cannot because it would be commercially damaging. If we ever released such information, we should not receive any more. It would affect the agency's ability to function efficiently and effectively if we put ``shall'' rather than ``may''. We must allow some discretion, and not fetter people.
<P>
We are looking for class people to run the agency. Given the culture of the legislation, and given what has been said in Committee and elsewhere, they will know how we want the agency to work. If the flow of information dries up, the agency will be sidelined. People would instead feed material to the Government, probably the Department of Health, where the rules are different. That would present a considerable dilemma. If the Department rather than the agency had the information, the agency would not be able to fulfil its functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am following carefully what the Minister says. Obviously, confidential advice given to the agency should not be published. We fully accept that. Will whistle blowers be encouraged to go to the agency with confidential information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> As a departmental Minister, one can get enormously out of touch, but I believe that legislation has recently been passed to protect whistleblowers. It is greatly to be encouraged, but one reason why the House approved that legislation is that the whistle is often blown on something that is crucial. One case that comes to mind is the pit-prop scandal in the National Coal Board.
<P>
The person who blew the whistle never worked again, as far as I recall. That is outrageous, but legislation has gone through to protect people in that situation.
<P>
People can give information to the agency, which will be a recipient of information from all and sundry, as happens now. They write in saying that a sandwich bar should be checked, or that we should find out about someone unloading sandwiches from the back of a car to an office block. They want to know where the sandwiches have been made and why a dog was in the boot of the car at the same time as the sandwiches. Constituents want to know who is checking up on such things. If people are buying cheap food, it has to be prepared properly and hygienically, so there may be questions to ask.
<P>
People should be encouraged to give information about what needs to be investigated. The agency will then report the complaint to the appropriate enforcement authority--the local authority That is the function of the agency in this change of policy, which is born from being more open with information.
<P>
We need to control publications on continuing negotiations. Throughout proceedings on the Bill, a constant theme of our debates has been our relationship with the European Union. The agency will be negotiating on behalf of the Government, on the Government's instructions. It cannot publish everything. To do so would mean publishing negotiating positions. They change, so it would be nonsensical to do so.
<P>
I do not rely on the resource implication arguments, as that is not a factor that we should hide behind. Resources are important, but they are not the central nub of the reason why we are not giving the agency the duty that the amendment suggests.
<P>
I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Isle of Wight was speaking to both amendments Nos. 111 and 83. The name of the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) is on amendment No. 83. I detected a slight Liberal Democrat division when I read those two amendments, but as they are voting with us, I do not want to make too many difficulties. Clause 22, which we shall come to later, requires the agency to keep records of its decisions and the information on which they are based, which they must make available to the public so that journalists can do their trawl under the existing code of practice. From a practical point of view, that could cause difficulties.
<P>
There is a clear test, requiring the agency to take account of reasons of confidentiality, which must outweigh the public interest before publication can be prevented. It is possible for the agency to publish information that it obtained in confidence and which was not expected to be published. If it meets the public interest test, the agency will have the right to publish it. It is right for the agency to decide to do that. We should not set out rules in the Bill and run the risk that the agency will not receive information in the first place.
<P>
The agency will have its own website and information. The third new area of the agency's work is a more direct and specific information and education role on top of local authority monitoring, enforcement and surveillance. Those are the three new areas, as all the rest is already being done. Part of the operation involves the agency's being able to communicate its thinking and carry out its duties in such a way that the public have greater confidence in the food supply chain than hitherto.
<P>
One of the food safety research bids, which is out for tender at present, is a project on communication of risks relating to food. The aim is to find out how we can better understand how to communicate a risk to the public without causing unnecessary scares or closing down part of the food industry. I have covered the points raised by amendment No. 83 tabled by the hon. Member for St. Ives.
<P>
A pattern will form after a while in the agency's working. We shall have to judge each item of information on its merits and circumstances. Unless anyone has some other points to make, I suggest that the amendments be withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 19 is one of the most important clauses in the Bill because it goes to the heart of transparency and accountability and shows the difference between how the agency will operate and what happens now.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister has been characteristically open. He is one of the few Ministers who might share his bit of the brief which says, ``If pressed'', or ``Not to be read out in any circumstances''. Taking us into his confidence is always disarming.
<P>
He said a couple of times that the default setting for the agency was openness. It set me thinking about my computer, which reverts to the default setting on far too many occasions when I least expect it. It is not necessarily the case that the agency will revert to a default setting of openness unless the legislation says so. The civil servants in the agency will always abide by the legislation. Unless it gives a presumption of ``shall'' rather than ``may'', the default setting may not be according to the guiding principles, or the wise words spoken by the Minister in Committee. There could be a slightly different interpretation.
<P>
This is a matter to which I shall want to return on Report. I was not suggesting putting in the word ``shall'' in every circumstance; I gave the caveat that it should be ``shall'', but subject to not publishing when considerations of confidentiality were involved. The Minister cannot say that all information will dry up. I was not suggesting ``shall''--full stop. Information will not dry up if we build into the law a presumption to publish and state that the agency shall publish, unless there are circumstances when, for reasons of confidentiality, it is more important to keep it secret and when the public interest is not served by publication. That is what I was suggesting and I hope that the Minister will think about it.
<P>
Despite the Minister's protestations--I had the feeling that he was protesting a bit too much and trying too hard to persuade us on a wide range of grounds--he is on shaky ground. I see no harm in the word ``shall''; it would add weight to the Minister's assurances that the default setting is publication. We could have a redrafted subsection (3) providing that in certain circumstances information need not be published. I can see none of the disadvantages that the Minister suggested.
<P>
I encourage my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden to have a look at the subject again on Report, unless the Government beat us to it.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I heartily accept the advice offered by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. Having listened intently to the Minister, and in view of his recognition of the paramount importance of the clause, the desirable course of action is to reserve the right to come back to the matter on Report. In the interests of moving the debate along, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Barron </B>(Rother Valley): As parliamentarians and not simply as supporters of the Government, we should recognise a national security issue that came up when the Special Select Committee considered the original draft Bill. It was in what was clause 11(3) and looked like the restriction on publication that is now in clause 19. In our unanimous report, we recommended that the national security issue should be removed as there was no ground for it. I suspect that it and things like it are creatures of Whitehall, but as a group of parliamentarians we proved that that was not the case on that occasion. The Government took up our recommendation and removed the national security issue, although clearly it was to be covered elsewhere and by other agencies.
<P>
Listening to parliamentarians, even if the Government do not always do so in Standing Committees, is a way to develop our legislative process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Before I reply to that, I must say that I appreciate why the hon. Member for Meriden did not move some amendments to the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) is correct. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and I were probably at our most uncomfortable in front of the Special Select Committee--we did five hours--when we tried to defend the national security aspect of the proposal. We made suggestions such as the threat of biological terrorism, which could be covered elsewhere with no difficulty. The national security aspect set the wrong tone for the clause, which convinced us to remove it.
<P>
The Opposition might insist on ``shall'' on Report. The agency must have some discretion. There is some advice to Ministers that it might not want to publish. Not a day goes by when someone does not write to invite us to visit somewhere. It does not matter whether it takes our fancy or not--we need advice. We do not always see ramifications. Occasionally, one may be advised not to attend a certain organisation's annual conference because, frankly, it is not a big enough player, we do not have enough contact with it and it is not worth one's time. We are advised that its representatives can come in for coffee.
<P>
Sometimes we are advised not to visit a certain area because it has had too many ministerial visits, which gives the wrong signals. When something looks okay as a media opportunity and good policy issue, our advisers are there to say, ``Hang on, Minister. Your colleagues were there three months ago, and this could give the wrong impression of the Government. Keep clear.'' Frankly, I would not want such an impression in the public domain as it would be counterproductive. [Interruption.] Visits can be fun, but they can be a chore, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> From a sedentary position, I improperly said that that was the juicy sort of information that was fun to get into the public domain. I understand why Ministers do not want it to become public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I try to find reasons to say yes rather than no, but sometimes one must say no even when one wants to say yes. One does not always accept advice, but one listens to it. That may be a minor point.
<P>
The default is to publish. Clause 22, which we will discuss later, has the default of being open and transparent. It is a substantial clause that reinforces clause 19. If the two are taken together, no one can argue that the ethos in the working arrangements of the agency is not to publish all the information that is at its disposal, unless it meets the tests that we have made. However, it will not be able to get over those hurdles.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to issue guidance on control</center></H4>
of food-borne diseases
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 10, line 28, leave out `of humans'.
<P>
This important clause expands the agency's general functions of providing advice. The Opposition recognise that that is an important role, given some of the bad experiences of the past in containing outbreaks of diseases. We do not want to restrain the agency's ability to act quickly and effectively to contain outbreaks of food borne diseases. The purpose of the amendment is to enhance or strengthen the agency's ability to carry out that function.
<P>
The amendment is born of our experience in government. A disease presented itself in the animal population, but no one was aware initially that it could transfer to other species and to humans. Of course, I am talking about the previous Government's experience of BSE. The amendment is intended to prevent this or any subsequent Government from falling into that kind of trap.
<P>
It is sometimes difficult at the onset of a disease to identify precisely where it has come from and the vectors of its transmission. Other diseases in the animal population might be capable of jumping the species gap, as it appears that BSE has done. The amendment is designed to help the Government and the agency deal far more effectively with the disastrous outbreaks of disease that are unfortunately a feature of the relatively recent past.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The clause deals with the agency's power to issue guidance on the control of food-borne illness. It will not significantly change the existing position, but it will put beyond doubt the fact that the agency will have the power to issue guidance to authorities on matters of human illness, rather than on food safety alone--a distinction drawn in section 40 of the Food Safety Act 1990.
<P>
We cannot accept the amendment because it would extend the definition in the clause to cover diseases of animals as well as those of humans. It is extremely important to ensure that the agency's remit remains well defined. Extending the definition of food-borne illness to include animal diseases would extend the agency's remit into animal health, and there is no good reason for doing so. Arrangements for exchanging information and co-ordinating action on food-borne zoonoses are dealt with in clause 28.
<P>
The Animal Health Act 1981 already provides comprehensive powers to issue guidance and control animal disease outbreaks. The State Veterinary Service is organised to act and offer guidance on animal disease outbreaks. Having given that clarification, I hope that the hon. Lady will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. Of course, we are aware that extending the agency's remit to all animal health matters would require many more people to be employed at public expense. Our intention was not to expand the work of the agency into animal health matters, but to ensure that if a disease were present in the human population the agency would not preclude rapid action to discover the source of the outbreak.
<P>
If it should turn out that the disease came across species from the animal population, having been ingested with food, that would not constrain the agency in acting promptly to stop its spread. I think that we have made that point clear. We never intended to expand into animal health; it was an exploratory amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 10, line 33, leave out subsection (1).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 48, in page 10, leave out line 38.
<P>
No. 49, in page 10, line 40, after `Wales', insert `in Scotland'.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I have been looking forward to reaching this clause all afternoon. The Opposition refer to it as the Martini clause, because the well-known slogan for Martini--``Any time, any place, anywhere''--is a good description of its wide range. Although on a hot afternoon such as this, we might imagine with rather more excitement the real thing in a glass, I should like as swiftly as possible to start serious debate on this wide-ranging clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 is designed to flag up to the Government our anxiety that the clause does not provide sufficient restraint. We understand the Government's good intentions for the agency, but I should like to discuss the powers that the clause will confer.
<P>
We have fewer reservations about education and training, because we know that environmental health officers are positive about the prospect of working with the agency on education and training, which is the good element of the Martini clause. However, subsection (2)(b), which refers to giving
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``financial or other support to activities carried on by others''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is insufficiently defined. It is not beyond the realms of imagination to envisage a pressure group involved in the same issues as the agency being successful in securing ``financial or other support'' for its own, fairly narrowly defined aims. As the use of public money is involved, that power should be constrained.
<P>
We should like to probe the Minister on what is meant by the power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to acquire or dispose of any property or rights''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our guess is that that is, we hope, confined to property and rights that pertain specifically to the agency. However, it crossed my mind that, if under its other powers to enter, monitor and observe, the agency were to encounter premises in which food safety was being seriously undermined by the way in which commercial operation was being carried out, and if as a result of observation and enforcement that commercial operation failed and was forced to close, the agency's wide-ranging powers might enable it to dispose of property pertaining to such a business. Will the power pertain to the enforcement authority? I suspect that the use of that power will be a good deal more constrained than the wide-ranging use that I have outlined, but in the absence of any safeguards, the Opposition are worried that the powers could be abused.
<P>
We are less worried about the agency's power to institute criminal proceedings, because we understand that the agency must have that direct power to enforce the law effectively and help raise standards of food safety throughout the UK. We were concerned about whether the absence of Scotland from subsection (2)(d) might entail greater risk for people travelling to Scotland from other parts of the United Kingdom, but there is probably a simple explanation for its omission from lists of parts of the United Kingdom in which the agency has the power to institute criminal proceedings. I hope that the Government will accept our argument for more restaints--in the clause so that the powers of the agency cannot possibly be abused.
