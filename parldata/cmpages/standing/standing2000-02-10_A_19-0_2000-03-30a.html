<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker (Lewes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 246 in page 53, line 3, leave out ``may'' and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall, within one year of the entering into force of this Act,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 747, in page 53, line 10, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> This morning's amendments on renewable energy have been tabled predominantly by the Liberal Democrats. I hope that other members of the Committee will join us in supporting them. I can hear a murmur of assent from Labour Members.

<P>
Amendment No. 246 is a standard amendment that is tabled to many Bills. The clause allows the Secretary of State to impose on an electricity supplier-or another supplier-an obligation to generate electricity using renewable sources, or to ensure that between suppliers they have done so. However, the use of the word ``may'' means that the Secretary of State is not obliged to do so. Further more, no time limit is specified. The amendment would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to give effect to the commitment.

<P>
I shall develop that theme. We have heard fine words from the Government about renewable energy, and they have published documents that state their commitment to it. However, a close reading of the Bill suggests that, once enacted, it may have no effect, because such commitments have become aspirations couched in modal verbs such as ``may'' rather than positive verbs such as ``shall''.

<P>
As the Government are clearly committed to the policy of developing renewable energy, which they have rightly espoused, they should have no objection to the amendment. It would give strength to their intentions and send a clear signal to the industry. If the word ``may'' remains, it is possible that nothing will change. I therefore hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs Helen Liddell):</B> I appreciate the desire of the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker), for the Government to set the new renewables obligation as soon as possible, and very much share his enthusiasm for that. The Government will lay a new renewables order before Parliament as soon as is practicable, and I wish that to be within one year of the Bill coming into force, as the amendment would require. It may assist the Committee if I put the matter into context, so that I do not have to delay our proceedings by doing so later.

<P>
In pursuit of our manifesto commitment to a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>new and strong drive to develop renewable energy<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we are proposing a major and fundamental shift in renewables policy. That follows a far-reaching review with extensive public consultation. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have moved away from the old non-fossil fuel obligation structure. The NFFO mechanism was not a failure; it was successful in bringing down the price of renewable energy. However, it had failings, including a poor implementation record on renewables projects and excessive Government involvement in the selection of projects and technologies-the Government were put in the position of having to choose winners, which, historically, Governments have not been terribly good at. Another failing was the intermittent nature of the NFFO bidding process, which did not provide the continuity that the renewables industry requires. As we were about to implement-under a clause that I hope that we shall discuss later today-broader changes in the structure of the electricity market, we had an opportunity to do something about the NFFO structure.

<P>
The Bill will provide the necessary powers to place an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to supply a fixed proportion of their power from renewable sources. That firm obligation will allow generators to invest in renewable energy technologies with confidence that they will have a market for their product.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Given the history of renewables in this country, some investors are cynical about the way in which the investments market has been made available to them. Will my right hon. Friend assure those investors that the Government's commitment to renewables means that they will have a marketplace in which to invest?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I can certainly reassure investors. Committee members are discussing the policy of supplying 10 per cent. of power from renewable sources by 2010. Our view is that the programme should continue until 2025-a long way away-and place specific obligations on electricity suppliers.

<P>
I want to consult on the details before the order setting the 10 per cent. target for renewables by 2010 is made, to ensure that, in the light of the state and market readiness of much of the technology, the target is achievable and the cost to the consumer is acceptable. That will win consumers round to the idea of renewable energy-cost is an important element in that regard.

<P>
I intend to leave it to electricity suppliers to choose the renewables technologies that they use to meet their obligations. In that way, the Government's intervention will be kept to a minimum and ensure that we work within the framework of a competitive market to minimise the additional burden on consumers.

<P>
The obligation will sit alongside other measures that the Government are taking, including the exemption of renewables-generated electricity from the climate change levy, an expanded research and development programme, and the development of a regional strategic approach and targets to help overcome some of the planning obstacles that are associated with renewables projects. We are also examining the scope for limited additional support for longer-term technologies, such as offshore wind and energy crops.

<P>
Against the background of the Government's strong support for renewables, there is an exciting opportunity to develop the renewables industry and to turn it from a fledgeling industry into a mainstream business activity. That will be good for business, for the diversity and security of supply and for the environment. I want to consider the amendment in that context. It would not be wise to prescribe a time limit in the Bill or to introduce an obligation to do something that we shall do anyway-amendment No. 747 would have that effect.

<P>
We are already a long way down the road towards preparing an order, but more needs to be done. We have got to get our approach right, not least in co-operation with the industry. We intend to consult on a draft order before we lay it before Parliament. I hope to be in a position to do that within the next few months. We also have to implement the new framework of electricity licensing before we can impose the new obligations. In particular, we have to achieve the separation of the public electricity suppliers into separately licensed supply and distribution companies.

<P>
That wil be a complex process and it would not be responsible to legislate without allowing for the possiblity that the timetable might slip. Our intention is to present an obligation within a year but, as any rational person will realise, risks are associated with our approach. I am sure that the hon. Member for Lewes did not intend to complicate the situation further. Amendment No. 747 would preclude the possibility of the Secretary of State making further orders, but we might want to increase the obligations in future.

<P>
In view of my explanation, my firm undertaking to press ahead with the preparation of the order as quickly as possible and my desire to implement it within a year of the Bill reaching the statue book, I hope that the hon. Member for Lewes will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her lengthy explanation and her commitment to press ahead with preparation of the order. Those in the Public Gallery and elsewhere will note her comments, which are now on the record.

<P>
I am slightly concerned that the Government are building slippage into the process. A firm target and a firm date concentrate the mind wonderfully. Absence of a firm date and timetable suggests that, if slippage occurs, it will not matter too much, which is a dangerous message to send out. There is no substitute for a firm date in a Bill.

<P>
I was intrigued by the Minister's novel argument that it is not necessary to put in the Bill something that the Government will do anyway. That is a strange way of approaching matters and suggests that no legislation is necessary if the Government intend to do something. If they intend to do something, why not put it in the Bill? I am trying to help them to enact Labour party policy, but the Minister, wearing her Department of Trade and Industry hat rather than her Labour party hat, is resisting that. Nevertheless, I welcome her assurance and we shall return to the matter under the next group of amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> In the Liberal Democrat view, this is a crucial group of amendments and I shall spend a little time developing the argument for them. They have three strands.

<P>
Amendment No. 746 would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to have full regard to the environmental effects arising from any permission given for renewable energy generation capacity. That is important, because we must try to win hearts and minds for renewable energy. It is still thought, erroneously, to be wacky and not central to power generation in this country, but that is not the view in other countries where it is mainstream. It is important not to give opponents of renewable energy an opportunity to criticise developments and thereby undermine the Government's intention, which we support, to increase the amount of energy generated from renewable sources. Many hon. Members, including one or two on the Government Benches, criticise wind farms, for spoiling the landscape because they are environmentally messy and destroy the hill or valley where they are situated. The planning process has not been sufficiently rigorous is determining where wind farms are built.

<P>
The same applies to other forms of renewable energy. If the Government are to include energy-from-waste plants in their renewable energy policy, the siting of an incinerator or energy-from-waste plant in the middle of the countryside could lead to considerable opposition from local people and undermine support for the technology that the Government presumably want to pursue. To digress slightly-I must declare an interest-it has been suggested that such a plant should be built in my constituency in the middle of wide, open countryside in an area of outstanding natural beauty. That is attracting huge public opposition. If the Government want to make a case for energy-from-waste plants, the current proposals are not helping them.

<P>
The amendments would provide a clear requirement to take account of environmental effects. One would normally look for safeguards in the planning system, but that does not seem to be working. That is certainly the view of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, which has drawn the issue to the attention of other members of the Committee.

<P>
I am keen to see renewable energy prosper; I do not want easy targets to be set up for those who want to attack it. The amendment is intended to prevent easy targets from being erected.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
With amendment No. 745, the Liberal Democrats are trying to implement Labour party policy, so I hope that the Government will support it. The Government have done nothing firm to enact their manifesto, so, being a helpful person, I have tabled an amendment to enable that to occur. When Ministers of whatever party come to power their manifesto commitments tend to get watered down. Civil servants obviously have a secret mantra that enables them to find secret information that has been hidden in a box somewhere and say, ``Aha, but you didn't know this, Minister. Are you aware of this consequence?'' Suddenly all those manifesto commitments wither on the vine. I do not know whether the Liberal Democrats will do the same when we are in control. I shall await the day to find out.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): The hon. Gentleman is incorrect in believing that the Liberal Democrats are not sometimes in control of events. In Dorset, they decided to have an incinerator and spent a lot of money planning it and then, as soon as there was local resistance, promptly did a U-turn and banned it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting that on the record. It is clear that the Dorset Liberal Democrats, about whom I confess that I do not know much, respond well to public opinion. However, the edges of party policy, whether Labour or the Tories are in office, seem to get rubbed off when Members of Parliament become Ministers. Civil service policy seems to triumph rather than the policy of the elected politicians.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 744 and 745 are an attempt to tie the Government to their own commitment. Amendment No. 744 is Liberal Democrat policy. If the Government do not like that one, amendment No. 745 is Labour party policy, so one of them should be acceptable.

<P>
Government policy is contained in a document entitled ``New and Renewable Energy: Prospects for the 21st Century: Conclusions in response to the public consultation'', which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5 per cent. of UK electricity requirements should be met from renewables by the end of the year 2003 and 10 per cent. by 2010.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will note a close correlation between the Government's conclusion in that document and amendment No. 745, which mirrors those targets exactly.

<P>
That brings me back to the point that I made on the previous group of amendments: why do the Government not put their targets in the Bill? If they do not do so, how can we have any confidence that those targets will be delivered? The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) rightly said that there had been some slippage. The Minister, rather alarmingly, said the same on the previous group of amendments. She said that the Government wanted to measure whether the target is achievable. As the Labour party did a lot of work on the matter in opposition, and a document has been published with a target, that target must be achievable. If it is, why is it not in the Bill and why is the Minister now saying that it might mot be achievable? She also said that the target would be met if the cost was acceptable. What cost is that? Is it the environmental cost or the traditional, narrow Treasury cost?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I thought that I made it clear that I was talking about the cost to consumers. The hon. Gentleman has said that we must win the hearts and minds of people on renewables. A key way to do that is to ensure that such energy is affordable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful for that. It seems that we are talking about a narrow financial cost, because the cost to consumers, as we argued previously, includes environmental impact. The definition of gross domestic product is far too narrow, and consumers are interested in long-term costs as well. They are not interested in technology that gives them cheap electricity today and environmental pollution five years down the line. The Government must take all those issues into account.

<P>
I am slightly worried that the Government's targets are not firm. Targets for renewable energy from Conservative Governments over the years have not been met. The amount of remewable energy generated in this country-3 per cent.-is pitifully low.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Does the hon. Gentleman think that that target would have been achieved but for the privatisation of the electricity industry and the non-fossil fuel obligation contracts that arose from it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I believe that it could have been achieved without privatisation, but that is something of a red herring. It could have been achieved because the Atomic Energy Authority was responsible for developing renewable energy for many years. As soon as it appears that a project, such as Salter's duck, is successful, the AEA sinks it. For many years, money was poured into nuclear power and renewable energy was starved of investment, but this country is phenomenally well situated to develop renewables. There is potential for developing wave power and solar power, which is universal. We could develop tidal power through projects such as the Severn barrage, and geothermal power could be developed in Cornwall. The figure of 3 per cent., most of which derives from Scottish hydro power, is pitiful.

<P>
We in this country have not done very well, and I see no evidence that the Bill will bring about change. The Government are saying the right things, but the forces of the status quo suggest that little will change. The Government should inject some oomph into the Bill by establishing targets, although I have no confidence that they would be met. What are the Government's realistic targets? If they have none, can we be confident that there will be change?

<P>
I am also concerned that the Government will set a target and, on realising that it has not been met, desperately try to increase incineration capacity, so that they can claim that it has been met through energy from waste. That is an issue with which we shall deal in due course, but I do not believe that energy from waste plants is genuinely renewable. There should be targets for genuinely renewable sources of energy such as wind power, wave power and hydro power, but there are none.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that huge environmental benefits can be derived from energy from waste? If one burns waste, it need not be put in a landfill site.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> There are certain benefits but there are also disbenefits, and I shall deal with that issue later on. I do not necessarily oppose energy from waste per se, but it is not renewable energy and should not be classified as such.

<P>
Amendment No. 748 would require the Government to produce an annual report. It would give weight to the Government's intentions and enable Parliament to assess whether those intentions are being delivered and the targets-if they are accepted-are being met. If the Government will not agree to targets, they should agree to an annual report. The Government appear to be asking Committee members to say that we are in favour of the provision but do not want targets, and that we want the clause to use the word ``may'' rather than ``shall''.

<P>
The Government should produce an annual report, which would give hon. Members the opportunity to tell them, ``You haven't met any targets and there has been no development.'' Alternatively, the Minister might be able to reply, ``You were wrong. Look at all these fantastic achievements. I'm grateful for this opportunity to explain how wonderful we are.'' If the Government are serious about this issue they should not object to an annual report. They must do more to convince people that they are serious about delivering renewable energy.

<P>

<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Member for Lewes is right: this is an important group of amendments in the midst of an important group of clauses. Taken together, the clauses will empower the Secretary of State to impose the obligations on licensed electricity suppliers to which I referred on the previous group of amendments.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that the Labour party is resiling from its manifesto commitments. That is arrant nonsense. If he reads the document to which he referred-``New and Renewable Energy: Conclusions in response to the public consultation''-he will see the extent to which we are moving towards fulfilling our manifesto commitments, and our commitment to ensuring a proper foundation and strong future for the renewable energy industry.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman dismisses our target of 10 per cent. by 2010, but he is a little naive if he does not take into account our need to give the industries the opportunity to develop. The primary purpose of this group of clauses is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Clauses 58 and 79 also refer to environmental powers related to energy efficiency. It is clear, therefore, that we intend the Secretary of State, in exercising these powers, to have regard to the environmental aspects of what he or she is doing.

<P>
I shall deal first with amendment No. 746. The purpose of the power set out in clause 50 is to have regard to environmental effects, and the Secretary of State will be under a general duty under clause 12 to have regard to the environment when exercising powers under clause 50. Clause 50 must be read alongside clause 12. Clause 12 places the environmental obligation in the right framework for the legislation, whose primary focus is the conomic regulation of the gas and electricity utilities.

<P>
The amendment is unnecessary because it would duplicate the existing provisions. There are also other effects to which the Secretary of State will need to have full regard, including the impact on electricity prices. The hon. Gentleman dismisses that. Later, we shall discuss fuel poverty, and the cost of electricity is an important issue. We want to encourage people who can now choose to have green electricity. We do not want to disadvantage its provisions by not taking its cost into account. It would be illogical to proceed in the direction suggested in the amendment. Under clause 50, any order would be subject to an environmental impact assessment, so the Secretary of State would have to have regard to environmental effects in making such orders.

<P>
Amendments Nos 744 and 745 would prescribe the way in which the Secretary of State would exercise the power to make a renewables order. I know that the hon. Genteleman is acting with the best of intentions, and I understand his commitment to this issue, but I want to convince him that the amendments would be unnecessarily limiting. The Government have every intention of using the new powers to meet the declared target of 10 per cent. of renewables by 2010, provided that the cost to consumers is acceptable. I do not believe, on current evidence, that targets of 10 per cent. by 2003 and 15 per cent. by 2010 would help us. The target of 10 per cent. by 2010 is already a challenge.

<P>
The powers in the Bill set the framework for the obligation, but they should not prescribe it. The Government will shortly consult further on the profile of the obligation that we shall impose under clause 50 so as to reach our target. We shall consult on the rate of progress towards the overall target, the buy-out price-and important and interesting aspect of the renewables obligation-and the costs of achieving the obligation. The amendments would pre-empt that consultation, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to do.

<P>
Getting the profile right is not a straightforward exercise, and we can be sure of doing so only by listening carefully to the wide body of expertise in the electricity industry, especially the renewables industry, as well as to the views of consumers on the impact on prices. I am sure that members of the Committee, given the nature of our previous debates, would not want to ignore the views of the industry or of consumers.

<P>
I understand the motivation of the hon. Gentleman in tabling Amendment No. 748, but I expect Ofgem to publish regular information about progress towards the use of renewables under the obligations in the clauses, and about the promotion of renewable energy in general. However, there is no need to be prescriptive in the Bill or to require annual reports to Parliament by the Secretary of State. Many pieces of information relating to the Bill that Parliament may wish to know about are not covered by such specific duties. As an assiduous asker of questions, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that hon. Members are free at any time to question Ministers about an aspect of Government policy if they are not content with the nature of the information that is being provided.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman made some important points about planning, which can be a significant obstacle to the goals of renewable energy. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs has anxieties about wind farms in Wales, and I have seen some in America, where they can stretch for miles and miles. Driving past them is an eerie experience.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That is why it is important to have a positive and strategic approach to planning for renewable energy. It is essential that planning frameworks should help to meet the Government's targets for renewable energy and for climate change. At the same time, we have a responsibility to protect the countryside. That is why, on 9 February, my colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions published guidance on preparing regional sustainable development frameworks. The guidance stated that the Government hope that regional frameworks will be established that draw upon the work of the Government offices for the regions, which are initiating work to prepare regional assessments and targets for renewable energy provision, based on existing resource studies. That will allow us to establish the right kinds of planning frameworks, which we intend to be in place by the end of this year. The frameworks will work alongside regional planning guidance and regional development agency strategies to promote sustainable development. It is important to factor in planning considerations to the growth of renewable energies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am listening carefully to the Minister. Clearly, she does not accept that the targets should be included in the Bill, but I am no further towards understanding when the Government expect to reach the targets. I suspect that other people who are listening to the Minister will be equally unsure about the Government's intentions in that respect. Will she place that on the record, so that we can hold her to it?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I am glad to see the hon. Gentleman back from his peregrinations. I have said about half a dozen times this morning that the Government's target is that 10 per cent. of energy should be generated from renewables by 2010. I said that at the beginning of my remarks on the first group of amendments, and have repeated it at least two or three times since. We are trying, with the assistance of the hon. Member for Lewes, to tease out the issues related to the setting of that target.

<P>
Government amendment No. 711 is a technical amendment that does not affect the underlying policy. It makes it clear that a renewables order that is made under clause 50 may reflect all the flexibilities in the order-making power that are provided for in clauses 51 to 53. I ask the committee to support amendment No. 711, and hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw amendment No. 746. I regret that otherwise I shall have to ask the Committee to resist it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I was rather hoping for some contributions from other members of the Committee. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) for his intervention.

<P>
I thank the Minister for her response to the amendment. It is useful to have had that exchange. I am sorry that she is not in favour of an annual report, which would give Parliament a say on the matter and increase ministerial accountability. Given that an increasing number of provisions bypass Parliament, the amendment was designed to reinforce the power of Parliament to scrutinise Minister's decisions.

<P>
I was not convinced by the Minister's response to amendments Nos. 744 and 745. It is not difficult to meet the suggested targets, especially the lower target in amendment No. 745. Many years ago, when there was a Department of Energy and Peter Walker was Secretary of State, renewables targets were in excess of the current suggestion.

<P>
It was suggested that 40 to 45 per cent. of our energy should come from renewable sources by 2025. That would not be difficult for us to achieve, given our climate and other natural benefits. This country lends itself to renewable energy in a way that other countries do not. We should exploit that for the benefit of consumers, industry and the environment, but we are not doing so.

<P>
The Minister described the amendments as complicated, which they are manifestly not. They are simple amendments, which merely tie the Government down to their manifesto commitment. She said that the Government would engage in consultation and listen to people. The clear implication is that if industry, or someone else, expresses disapproval, expectations will be reduced and sights lowered. She is preparing the Committee for the 10 per cent. target to be undershot. She is trying to have the best of all worlds. She is saying to the environmental lobby, ``Here is a target, we are all committed to it'', while saying to industry, ``Don't worry about it, we'll consult you, it can be undershot if you're not happy.'' That is dishonest of the Government.

<P>
It is not impossible to meet the Government's target, which is well established in Labour party documents and has been repeated in government. If the Government do not give weight to that target in the Bill, it will not be met. The hon. Member for South Dorset is right to press the Minister on that point. Once all the factors are taken into account-consumer costs, the views of industry and so on-what will be achieved in terms of renewable generation by 2010? Will it be 10 per cent. or less than 10 per cent.? The Committee has not been given a clear answer, which is unfortunate, but I do not intend to press amendment No. 746 to a vote, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Government for accepting amendment No. 745.

<P>
Amendment No. 742 deals with a matter of principle. That matter has been raised this morning and on previous occasions, most notably by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. It involves the definition of renewable energy. The Government want the Bill's definition of the phrase to include energy that is derived from the burning of waste, but my contention is that that energy source is not renewable.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) asked whether I thought that obtaining energy from waste was a good thing. I have certain reservations about it, but it can be preferable to, for example, burning fossil fuels-it represents a move in the right direction. That, however, is not the point of the amendment, which is designed to establish not whether obtaining energy from waste is a good thing but whether energy that is obtained from waste should be regarded as renewable.

<P>
A simple definition of renewable energy refers to those energy sources that for all practical purposes are continually replenished. It can be defined in other ways-as energy that is obtained from the continuous or repetitive currents of energy that occur in the natural environment; as energy flows that are replenished at the same rate as they are used, including, more broadly, the use of any energy storage reservoir that is refilled at a rate that is comparable to that of extraction; or as those energy flows that occur naturally and repeatedly in the environment and can be harnessed for human benefit-the ultimate sources of most of that energy are the sun, gravity and the earth's rotation.

<P>
Those definitions of renewable energy do not refer to energy that is obtained from waste. I am sure that all Committee members respect the science and environment section of the Library. That section reported that a strict definition of renewables
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would exclude incineration of municipal solid waste, given that some of its content comes from non-sustainable sources-such as plastics derived from petroleum.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the Bill's definition does not agree with that. I hope that the Minister will reflect on and respond to my argument.

<P>
We also need to consider the fact that energy-from-waste plants emit carbon dioxide, which means that they are not sustainable and do not, in a true sense, produce renewable energy. Recent rulings in the United States Supreme Court established that the ash from energy-from-waste plants should be treated as hazardous waste. How can a renewable source of energy create hazardous waste? The Bill's definition suggests that the Government believe that renewable energy involves the creation of hazardous waste, but that is nonsense.

<P>
The definition of renewable energy should not include energy that is obtained from waste. We should establish whether we should promote the policy of obtaining energy from waste, but that is a separate issue that falls outside the scope of the Bill. The Government's definition would pull the rug out from under genuine renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power.

<P>
It is not clear whether the Government's target is actually a target-

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> It is a target.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that. The Government will doubtless tell us how much of the 10 per cent. target involves energy that is obtained from genuinely renewable sources, and how much is obtained from energy from waste.

<P>
I await the Minister's response with interest.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I tabled new clause 1 because my reading of the Bill suggests that there is something missing from it. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that I have misread it. However, I shall first ask a question relating to amendment No. 742. I understand that the European Union's definition of renewables does not include waste. If that is the case, how is the conflict between that definition and the Bill to be resolved?

<P>
Members of the Committee have referred to debates on the Electricity Bill about 10 years ago, and to the resistance shown by the previous Government towards a series of amendments on energy efficiency and environmental issues, which resulted in inflexibility being incorporated into that legislation. I am worried that that inflexibility might mean that, if we did not achieve an increase in combined heat and power, the Government would be powerless to do anything about it. The new clause would give them that power.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The use of combined heat and power is increasing rapidly, as we have already discussed. However, the energy technology support unit-the Government's advisers-suggest that we might fall short of the target set for 2010 by between 60 and 70 per cent. If that happens, how are we to rectify the situation? I am a supporter of the new electricity trading arrangements; I believe that they are the right way forward and I congratulate the Government on their introduction. However, the transitional period is creating uncertainty in the market. For example, Shell is pulling out of the photovoltaics market, giving the reason that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>While Shell Renewables recognises that the UK has as good a natural resource for photovoltaics as many neighbouring countries, current market constraints and the lack of financial incentives to stimulate consumer demand make the UK market less attractive than elsewhere.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am worried that the Bill does not give the Government sufficient powers to intervene to stimulate that market. The new clause would give them those powers. It would not place financial constraints on the industry, nor would it seek to prescribe what should happen, but it would empower the Government to make an order similar to a renewables order during the transitional period.

<P>
The Minister might say that combined heat and power was an established technology, that those objectives could be achieved under clause 58 and that everything would be wonderful. If I have misread the Bill, and that is indeed the case, perhaps she will allay my fears in her response. If not, will she consider new clause 1, which would give the Government a power to make orders for combined heat and power similar to that given in clause 50 for renewables?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Opposition are broadly supportive
 of the clauses relating to renewable energy. The Conservative party has an environmental agenda known as the blue-green agenda, which involves harnessing the market to provide more environmentally friendly approaches and more renewable energy. We as a nation have committed ourselves to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases of 12 per cent. below the 1990 level by 2010, and set a domestic target of 20 per cent. below that level. Those targets provide a philosophical justification for a mild intervention to encourage and nudge the free market to provide more renewable energy. Clauses 50 to 55 provide a well-balanced approach to achieving that.

<P>
I have spoken at some length about the benefits resulting from the privatisation of the electricity and gas industries, especially in terms of consumer prices, which are 30 per cent. lower in real terms since privatisation. Other benefits include wider share ownership, expanding competition, and more innovative and consumer-focused products and services. One of the major benefits of privatisation has been the enormous expansion and development of electricity generation from renewable sources. It does not provide a huge percentage of overall electricity generation yet, but we have made a start. There have been enormous technological developments in this country following the NFFO contracts that arose from the privatisation process. Wind power is developing into viable commercial ventures and energy from waste, which the Liberal Democrats seem to oppose, not only produces electricity without recourse to fossil fuel, but reduces the need for landfill sites.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> To clarify the matter, I did not say that we oppose energy from waste; my point was that it should not be classed as renewable energy. I accept that there are benefits in energy from waste, but there are drawbacks also.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I think that energy from waste should be encouraged. It will not encourage people to dispose of more waste, but it will deal with problems arising from landfill sites. The hon. Gentleman referred to hazardous waste, but there is nothing more hazardous than some of the waste that is sitting in our landfill sites.

<P>
Since privatisation, more hydro power stations have been built, as well as many more combined heat and power plants, which, by combining heat production with electricity generation, can produce around 86 per cent. efficiency savings in CO2 emissions. That is a tremendous achievement. Renewable energy is moving away from being the esoteric interest of a few sandal-wearing eccentrics-no offence to the hon. Member for Lewes. It is now a respectable and commercial industry with a viable future. Many major multinational United Kingdom companies have made a considerable investment in renewable energy. Inland wind power can now be produced at a cost that is commercially viable.

<P>
The problem concerning planning consent reflects people's concern about the beauty of the areas in which wind power is most cost-effective. Windswept landscapes tend to be the areas that we want to preserve for country walking and enjoyment of the environment. Offshore wind power is more likely to obtain planning consent, but it is relatively expensive to produce and the industry is concerned that ending future NFFO contracts will jeopardise its development. They fear that the obligations under clause 50 will not provide sufficient long-term certainty to enable that form of renewable energy to develop further. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that concern, because it will be a long time before the price of offshore wind energy per kWh can be reduced to a level at which it would be marketable under the new arrangements.

<P>
The original consultation document on renewable energy states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>obtaining 10 per cent. of electricity from renewables by 2010 appears to be feasible at a cost of around 3.5p per k/hour. In the long run, there is clear potential for renewables technologies to compete on an equal basis with other forms of generation and to need no subsidy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The response to the document referred to a buyout price premium of 2p per kWh, which at current market rates should be sufficient to take the price received above the 3.5p cost. It would be helpful if the Minister would comment on that, and especially on the 5 per cent. target that is being incorporated into law under amendment No. 745. The target of 5 per cent. by 2003 and 10 per cent. by 2010 is commendable but ambitious. How confident is the Minister that the industry can meet the 2003 target?

<P>
The response to the consultation document states on page 9:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The proportion of supplies which must be supplied from eligible renewable sources is expected to be set at a level consistent with increasing the contributions from all renewables from around 5 per cent. in 2003 to around 10 per cent. in 2010, and remaining at that level in subsequent years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, it appears to be an imperative that those targets are met. In view of the progress that we have made so far, it would be helpful if the Committee was informed about that.

<P>
Amendment No. 731 would include combined heat and power in the definitional section of new section 32, which covers the definition of renewable sources. That would be an important contribution towards reducing CO2 emissions, because it would ensure the use of the by-product of heat, which is usually lost in the electricity generating process. That in turn avoids the production of CO2 emissions by conventional methods. As the original consultation document says that combined heat and power is an important source of renewable energy, I hope that the Government will be able to accept the amendment. If they do not, perhaps they will explain why they have actively taken provisions for combined heat and power out of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> It is good to be back in Committee. I have had a chance to use photovoltaics on my skin and recharge my batteries. It is surprising to come back to find that the Bill is more or less as I left it a week ago. It is interesting to note that the Government, with their usual light-footedness, talked against amendment No. 745 and then promptly allowed it to go through. No doubt they will explain what they were up to.

<P>
I suspect that, when Labour Members suddenly realised that by 2003 they would not be in government, just as they know that they will not be in government in 2010, committing the next Conservative Government to those targets probably seemed like a good idea. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who is keen on ensuring that we deliver, was not unhappy to see those targets imposed on the next Conservative Government.

<P>
Looking through my e-mails, I noticed that we had a commitment from the Government, made by none other than the Prime Minister. When he came back from Lisbon, he said that the summit marked
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a sea of change in European economic thinking. It points Europe  away from heavy-handed intervention and regulation, towards a new approach based on enterprise, innovation and competition.-[Official Report, 27 March 2000; Vol. 347, c. 21.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps, then, there will be even more changes to the Bill before the day is out.

<P>
Part of our problem in discussing these clauses arises from the terminology. We can all more or less understand what non-fossil fuel is, but renewable energy keeps having to be redefined, because in many cases it is not really renewable energy. People want to use buzz phrases and, having made a commitment to the buzz phrase that renewable energy will constitute 10 per cent. of our electricity generation, the Government have to keep redefining what they mean by renewable energy.

<P>
Amendment No. 731, which suggests that combined heat and power should be included in the definition, is sensible, because CHP promises a more efficient way of generating electricity, reducing CO2 emissions. It would be helpful if the regulators were told what the Government are trying to achieve. Saying ``CO2 reductions'' would clearly be better than trying to list all the ways of reducing CO2 because new ways of doing so may emerge.

<P>
I am also worried about the nuclear side, because nuclear energy is never included in the definition of non-fossil fuels. Technically, uranium, which is dug up, may be regarded as a fossil fuel, but nuclear energy must be used to reduce the production of CO2. BNFL is experiencing problems. Rather than supporting BNFL, the Government are hanging it out to dry, and I and other Committee members are worried that the nuclear industry will be run down even further.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government could discover that 10 per cent. of electricity is produced by technologies other than nuclear. At the moment, nuclear power is responsible for approximately a quarter of our electricity generation. Were that figure to decline, we would take two or three steps backwards and offset the small amount of progress that has been made through renewable energy and non-fossil fuels.

<P>
The Bill should make it clear to regulators that we are trying to reduce the production of CO2, without getting hung up on the figure of 10 per cent. While trying to find ways in which to generate 10 per cent. of our electricity from renewables we should produce less CO2. That is why the cross-subsidy of CHP, which would reduce CO2 production, would be the right way forward.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Under amendments Nos. 742 and 743, energy generated from waste would not count towards the fulfilment of a renewables obligation under the clause. It is not Government policy to rule out the recovery of energy from waste, which is an essential element of our waste strategy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am not asking the Minister to rule out the recovery of energy from waste; I am asking her to rule out regarding energy from waste as a renewable source of energy.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> I have to disagree with the hon. Gentleman: in many respects, energy from waste is an effective renewable. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out, it is also a very effective option in respect of recovery of materials unsuitable for recycling.

<P>
The hon. Member for Lewes referred to ash. Energy from waste allows ferrous metals to be recovered from the ash remaining after generation, which can usefully be incorporated in construction materials. Energy from waste therefore contributes to our recycling objectives and our energy objectives.

<P>
If the UK is to meet its 10 per cent. target by 2010, energy recovery from waste will be an important resource, and the amendment would put at risk our chances of meeting that target.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Is the Minister telling us that a process that results in hazardous waste, with bottom ash and fly ash, is genuinely renewable? Will she also deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East, who said that the European Union definition of renewable energy excludes energy from waste?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> On the second point, I was about to deal with the attitude of the European Union. It is a source of irritation that the European Union has yet to introduce a directive on renewables, so my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East is a little ahead of himself. The UK would certainly argue against an EU directive that sought to exclude waste. The matter should have been dealt with in the Energy Council last year; and it will not be dealt with in May, as we had hoped.

<P>
On the overall issue of the use of waste, aspects have to be abstracted, but do larger landfill sites constitute the more attractive option? My constituency is ringed by landfill sites, which create a considerable hazard. Often, one does not know what is contained in those sites, which is a source of great irritation to my constituents.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am not against energy from waste per se. I am aware of the problems of landfill sites, because there is one half a mile from my house. I am not suggesting that such energy should be ruled out, but that it should not be classified as renewable energy and thus benefit from the regime that the Government are establishing.

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I will have to agree to disagree about that, because I regard it as a renewable source.

<P>
Amendment No. 731 and new clause 1 are aimed at extending the renewables obligations to combined heat and power. The Government have done a considerable amount to assist CHP. We fully appreciate the contribution that it makes to environmental and energy efficiency objectives, and we are making the right provision for it.

<P>
However, CHP and renewables require different approaches that reflect their different market positions. CHP is not renewable and is an established technology, whereas we want to help new technologies that can deliver, in the long term, new sources of energy that do not produce greenhouse gases. By no stretch of the imagination can fossil-derived CHP be classed as a renewable source, and it is therefore not appropriate to include it in the renewables obligations.

<P>
The energy efficiency targets, which we have also discussed, are an important way of encouraging CHP. I shall not go through the whole raft of measures that the Government, through the DTI and the DETR, have introduced to support CHP, but I do not think that the clauses on renewables are the right place to encourage CHP.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton got quite excited about the targets for 2003. I am surprised at him, because he is famous for doing his homework. If he checks the NFFO4 and 5 obligations, he will find that we are on target to reach about 5 per cent. of electricity generated by renewables by 2003. The Government will consult industry and consumers on the order, because that is important in finding a way forward that encourages renewables. We want to work with the renewables industry to move ahead, not to limit the possibilities of new technologies, and especially technologies that are not close to market.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman talked about offshore wind. That has a much longer lead time than certain other technologies in terms of being close to market. At the beginning of my remarks, when I described the Government's support for renewable technologies, I referred to our intention to give further assistance to the development of technologies such as offshore wind.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right about the fact that a key signal of the extent to which renewables are becoming a mainstream technology is the degree to which some of the major energy companies are becoming involved. Mainstreaming renewable energy is a significant move forward-it must not continue to be viewed as a peripheral issue.

<P>
Although, I understand the determination of the hon. Member for Lewes, he is misguided about the inclusion of waste. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East is a great supporter of CHP, but the Government are acting in other directions to assist it, and that is not the right place in which to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> If this is not the right place, will the Minister confirm that she has the powers under clause 58, or another clause, to support CHP should it become necessary?

<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> Support for CHP extends right across the Government. At the DETR, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will shortly publish a draft strategy for CHP to 2010. In the Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor confirmed an exemption for CHP from the climate change levy, and a negotiated agreement will give energy-intensive industries an 80 per cent. reduction in the climate change levy in return for agreed reductions in energy use. CHP is in an ideal position to benefit from that approach-it benefits from 100 per cent. first year capital allowances for energy savings investment.

<P>
I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East not to press the new clause to a vote, not because we oppose CHP but because we do not regard it as a renewable-some CHP is generated from fossil fuels-and if the amendment is not withdrawn, I shall urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> It is interesting that the Government are keen to declare that CHP is not a renewable source of energy but that energy from waste is a source of such energy. Theirs is a topsy-turvy approach. As I said earlier, the amendment is designed to establish not whether obtaining energy from waste is a good thing but whether it is a renewable source. That may appear to be a technical and narrow point, but it is important. If energy from waste is classed as renewable, that will swamp all the other developing renewable technologies. We should lose those necessary developments discussed by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>
The Government have been extremely generous and allowed me to add Labour party policy to the Bill, so I had better not push my luck too far this morning-although I may try to do so this afternoon. Although I fundamentally disagree with the Minister on this matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
