<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 5 May 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/148/1998148.htm">National Lottery Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I do not feel strongly about such issues, but some Chairmen do. To preserve convention, may I say that members of the Committee may remove their jackets if they wish to do so.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provisions supplemental to section 6</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [30 April]: No. 16, in page 10, to leave out lines 15 to 23. (Mr. Spring).
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Spring </B>(West Suffolk): At our previous sitting, we received assurances from the Minister. He said that he understood our arguments. I accept that, but I should be grateful if he and his officials would give further thought to the matter because we regard it as a potentially serious problem. The definition under subsection (2) needs tightening up. During the next few weeks or on Report, the Minister might like to return to the matter and comment on it further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>The New Opportunities Fund: Schedule 6A to the 1993 Act</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 26, line 37, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Application to Scotland <P>
11. Paragraphs 7 and 8 do not extend to Scotland.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 35.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to provide that paragraphs 7 and 8 of schedules 2 and 4, which are concerned with the appropriate method of executing deeds on behalf of the New Opportunities Fund and National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, do not apply to Scotland. Express provision dealing with the execution of documents is not required for Scotland as the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 applies there.
<P>
The 1995 Act makes general provision for the execution of deeds and other documents under the law of Scotland. It allows for the signature of a member, secretary or other authorised person on behalf of a corporate body, such as the fund, to be effective if supported by the signature of one witness or the application of the body's seal. Given the existence of that Act, if separate provision were also included in the Bill, it would mean having two separate and slightly different provisions dealing with the same subject matter, which is legally unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister implied that the matter is technical and we have no difficulty with that. Rejoicing as I do in a considerable number of Presbyterian forebears, I am always delighted to hear about how the law applies to Scotland.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 2, as amended, agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of distributing bodies to solicit applications</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): The Bill will give power to the national lottery distributing bodies to solicit applications for lottery grants. Opposition Members appreciate that the distributing bodies are in favour of the new power. However, whatever benefit the Government claim that the power would have, in facilitating the soliciting of applications by a distributing body for lottery money, it would be more than outweighed by the scope of further political control that the power would give the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Committee will soon have the opportunity to debate clause 12, which will give the Secretary of State power to require the distributing bodies to draw up strategic plans for his approval. Given that proposal, we consider that it is wholly undesirable that the distributing bodies should be given the means by which to pursue the political agenda that they will no doubt be required to set out in those strategic plans.
<P>
We have already argued that the sole purpose of the Bill is to allow the Government to get their hands on money from the lottery we have debated that at some length. The Minister sought to dissuade us from that opinion, but we are not convinced. His denials have been undermined by outbursts from Government Back-Bench members of the Committee, who have gleefully welcomed the prospect of the Government taking control of the lottery and using it for their political ends. I have been amazed by the silence of Labour Members in Committee. Their contribution to the Second Reading debate was more interesting than what we have heard from them in Committee. While Conservative members of the Committee have roundly condemned what the Government are doing, the Minister for Arts has had to fight a lone battle on his side. The contributions made by Labour Committee members on Second Reading prove the Opposition's case in respect of our objections to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman should be so worried about the isolation of the two Ministers on the Committee. If he were sitting here as he will not be for many years to come he would find the weight of goodwill, enthusiasm and support to be like a bolster. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"]
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> It is interesting to hear that enthusiasm is on tap for the Minister when he asks for it, rather than being offered, as it would normally be.
<P>
Labour Members want political control of the lottery. That will allow more money to be directed by the Secretary of State to their constituencies. The power for the distributing bodies to solicit applications enshrined in the clause is an essential mechanism to enable such gerrymandering of the distribution of grants.
<P>
On Second Reading, there was much talk of more equitable distribution of lottery money I referred to that during our previous sitting. I assume that that phrase was issued in a departmental briefing, or has been beamed to the pagers of Labour Members from Millbank. I rather doubt that they thought it up themselves, but they obviously understand exactly what it means. With the exception of the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry), who was preoccupied with attempting to claim credit for the success of the lottery and with criticising the Government's attitude to sport, every Labour Back-Bench Member who spoke on Second Reading demonstrated why the clause should be omitted from the Bill.
<P>
During our previous sitting, I referred to the fact that Labour Members have made specific requests for money to be spent in their constituencies. Each of them has welcomed the fact that the Bill will enable the Government to push more money in their direction. The hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will forgive me, I shall use the example of my constituency to make points about distribution. It is necessary to highlight the way in which my constituency has or rather has not been the recipient of lottery funds."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Many other ideas and projects in the Forest of Dean have not been so fortunate, and, due to the lack of expertise in the application or because those involved were not so well connected they have failed."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is crucially important.
<P>
The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am a little sad to report that Crawley is in the bottom 80 both in terms of the cash amounts received and the number of bids."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She thus unconsciously pointed out the probable explanation for the imbalance to which she was attempting to draw attention. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Although I am concerned about the poor allocation to my constituency, the awards that we have had have been valuable and well received."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The funding for out-of-hours schools-based activity is also welcome, as some of my hon. Friends have said. In my constituency, only a few schools have been able to establish some effective after-school provision so far."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He lamented that in a speech that was so remarkably fluent that I suspect that there was some influence from Millbank on its presentation. It was so close to the Government line that it might have been written by civil servants in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
<P>
The hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I share the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mrs. Organ) about the"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
comprehensive
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"lack of success of bids from rural areas. Although we have had some success in my constituency, the Peak District rural deprivation forum, which is a worthy cause, has had three bids rejected."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy), showing a twinge of conscience, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I hope that the debate is not simply one about right hon. and hon. Members who feel that their constituencies may have had a raw deal in lottery allocated and who complain about that."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the conscience disappeared because he also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I represent Eastwood, which is one of the 50 areas throughout the United Kingdom that receive the least in terms of the sums granted through the National Lottery Charities Board."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is also Laurieston" 
</UL></FONT><P>
I apologise if I pronounced it wrongly 
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
"senior citizens' welfare hall, which has applied three times for lottery funding to do something with the hall. It is run by volunteers, purely on subscriptions and charity, for the older people in the village, who have not been able to get access to funding." [Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 192, 201, 206, 211, 217, 222, 228-9, 240.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I make no direct comment on those bids.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Connarty </B>(Falkirk, East): Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that organisations, such as voluntary senior citizens organisations, should not be encouraged and helped to get money from the lottery?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> The point of my drawing the Committee's attention to those points is not to discuss the merit of an application; it is about how applications will be serviced under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): I want to help the hon. Gentleman, who seems to be reading other hon. Members' speeches. Is he saying that he disagrees fundamentally with the clause and the pro-activity of distribution bodies given that they have clearly identified needs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> The point that I am making is that, if people can solicit applications, the Government will become involved with the application mechanism. I shall deal with that point later.
<P>
I was saying that I had no knowledge of those actual applications. We know that the number of the bids to the existing good causes is growing and that, therefore, there are likely to be more and more disappointed bidders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth R. Thomas </B>(Harrow, West): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind words about my speech on Second Reading. In addition to all the support that Labour Members gave the clause on Second Reading, it also had the support of the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley), who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I also welcome the fact that more soliciting ... will be allowed." [Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 209.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman think that his party is split on the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> First, I congratulate Labour Members on turning up so early in the morning to listen to my comments on the speeches that they made on Second Reading. I should also like to congratulate them on bothering to speak today, because we have heard precious little from them before in Committee.
<P>
As I have said, the fact that the number of bids to existing good causes is growing is all the more reason for the Government to stop subsidising public expenditure from the lottery. What a dreary process and what a poor advertisement for Government, but at least those speeches show us what is really going on.
<P>
The crucial point is that Labour Members would not have such high hopes if the Government were not giving themselves the power to deliver. There should be strict political impartiality in the distribution of money lottery the best bids should win. If the Government are involved, money will be distributed according to a political agenda and they will require distributors to solicit bids according to their own priorities. The Government have tried to dress the bill in nonsense about the evolution of the lottery and about the need to restore public confidence so they claim. That is absolute rubbish. After 18 years of whining in opposition, Labour is now in power. The Government have taken on the spending commitments of the previous Conservative Government, but cannot achieve what they want on the money. Of course, there is a way round that. Chris Smith, The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is customary to refer to the right hon. Gentleman either by his ministerial title or by his constituency, not by name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale. I have read the Secretary of State's name so many times in the information given to us that I was tempted to personalise. I shall not do so again.
<P>
The Secretary of State will give hon. Members the opportunity to spend money on whatever they feel is appropriate. He will give himself and his Department the power to do so. If that means ditching the additionality principle, so be it. Indeed, the Government have made up a new definition and a range of devices has been introduced to allow the Secretary of State to control the spending of that money.
<P>
It seems not to matter that the Government want to ditch the arm's length principle, on which the lottery was set up. Who cares? The Labour party in opposition stood by the principle of additionality and, as we heard in Committee, sought to enshrine it in the original Bill. That was then. During a recent interview on the BBC programme "On the Record", the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I think what we said in Opposition was clear, and it was right at the time that the lottery was introduced. But what we have now is a situation where the Budget spending level is set, and we have said that we are going to stick to that level for two years. I think it's right that a Government can say: We have a different view of how the lottery should operate."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also pointed out that the Government had consulted on that. We all know about the bogus consultation exercise.
<P>
I beg the Committee's indulgence for quoting again, but it is important to our consideration of the clause and what we believe the clause stands for to hear what has been said. During the same interview, the hon. Member for Hove said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We've received the consultations back and we're now developing a Bill to reflect those priorities, so I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I don't think they're compromising the lottery in any way".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman would be wise not to draw further attention to that outburst. That was a clear admission that, whatever the Labour party may have said in opposition, it is now in government and means to make use of the money from the lottery. The Government have their priorities and it seems not to matter if lottery money has to be used to enable them to fund them. The Government are breaching the arm's length and the additionality principles and they seem not to care. The powers in clause 9 will provide the Government with an incentive to apply pressure on all good causes to carry out their agenda.
<P>
One of the biggest successes of the lottery has been its promotion of initiatives within local communities. It has encouraged groups to come together to apply for grants to improve the quality of life in their communities. The clause will have the reverse effect. It will promote dependency at the expense of initiative. It will increase producer power. It will increase the role of the growing breed of voluntary and public-sector consultants who lobby those who distribute Government largesse of whom Labour Members affected disapproval in previous sittings.
<P>
As with everything that the Government do, the change will mean more centralisation and less power in the hands of local people. It will mean that more money from the lottery will be used to promote the Government's agenda. The Secretary of State already has the power to appoint board members of the distributing bodies and to give them directions on how money should be disbursed. The power to solicit bids means that the distributing bodies will now be better able to carry out the political agenda of the Secretary of State. Is that not simply another example of the Government operating in a bossy, centralised way, which they are tending to do more and more? That is not good for the lottery or for the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. He makes a powerful point. Has my hon. Friend considered how his argument was reinforced by Lord Skidelsky in another place, when he said that the clause could have been made workable if the Government had accepted that the Secretary of State's powers should be restricted to the proper management and content of money paid to the distributing body? The Government chose to reject that proposal, which shows how much power they want the Secretary of State to have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I appreciate that intervention because it highlights and illustrates clearly the point I am making about the power of the Secretary of State. The clause[Mr. Fraser]
also puts power into the hands of an elite few, which is contrary to the idea behind the lottery.
<P>
By what criteria will bids be sought, other than political priorities? Is it not the case that the lottery has been a source of funds for numerous small projects that would never have attracted the attention of the insiders who decide where public spending should be dispensed? Is not it inevitable that a great proportion of lottery money will go to bids that have been solicited? Bids made on the initiative of local people will decline and, in all probability, dry up. Is not it inevitable that bids that are solicited will be successful, whatever their merit, and will succeed at the expense of better bids? Those are important questions that I should like the Minister to answer.
<P>
Will not the Secretary of State's power lead to a two-tier system that will bring the lottery into great disrepute?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Prior </B>(North Norfolk): When we talk about the people's lottery, we tend to think of giving more power to individuals, small groups and community groups and less power to the "We know best" brigade at the centre. Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause flies totally contrary to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> It does precisely that. It gives more power to the centre and to the Secretary of State.
<P>
I have made points of genuine concern to Conservative Members, which we have articulated throughout the Committee stage of the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will treat them as such when he replies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ronnie Fearn </B>(Southport): In his reply, will the Minister for Sport explain proposed section 2B, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In determining whether a decision of a body concerning its distribution of money under subsection (1) was unlawful, it shall be immaterial whether or not the body, or any person acting on behalf of the body, solicited an application from a body or person for such money"?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who will do the determining? Will it be the Sports Council or the Arts Council? Who will decide whether or not something is unlawful? What do we mean by "unlawful"?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Sport (Mr. Tony Banks):</B> First, I shall deal with the remarks of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser), who seems to see conspiracies all around him not least in the silence of Labour Back Benchers, when, in fact, they are content with the Bill [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] Quicker! Opposition Members should not assume that because Labour Members are not jumping up and down we are not content with the Bill. It should not be too surprising that we are content with it after all, it is our Bill.
<P>
Nothing is perfect in this world, and we have all paid lip service to the lottery's success. However, we also know that it has weaknesses and failings; it needs to be constantly examined and, I hope, improved. I cite as evidence all the examples that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole quoted when he gave us a quick reprise of what was said on Second Reading. Hon. Members are concerned about the way in which the lottery's resources are allocated. Many hon. Members feel that causes and schemes in their constituency do not receive the attention that they deserve from the distributors I suspect that every hon. Member thinks that.
<P>
For my sins, Mr. Gale, I have to read what feels like countless letters although they number in their hundreds from Members of all parties complaining that project X or project Y did not receive any money, and they ask, "Why not? What can be done?" Hon. Members are doing their job by making those complaints and by trying to put pressure on the lottery distributors. We all do that, because we want to see our constitutency gain as much as it can. However, to suggest that that involves central Government control over the distribution of lottery funds is grotesque.
<P>
In effect, the present system allows distributors to publicise grants that they are keen to support but it does not allow them to approach an organisation. I know from discussions with the lottery distributors that with regard to the distribution of funds and in the absence of strategic plans and of the power to solicit, they operate, as it were, their own ad hoc strategy. They are bound to do so they cannot simply sit around and wait for bids to come in. Certain groups are far more active and proficient at presenting bids than others.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean complained that organisations in her constituency were not well connected. I have visited her constituency and I know that she did not mean that they do not have a telephone line or other ways to contact the lottery distributor or the relevant Minister. The difficulty is that they are unable to advance their own interests because of problems with resources, for example. It is absurd for distributors to receive large numbers of applications from groups that are good at making applications when they know that although there is obvious need in other parts of the country no one will relay those needs to the distributors for them to meet. I want to give a classic example

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> One issue that has not been discussed in this context, but which was raised when the lottery was set up, is the fact that if a body is not capable of putting together a coherent bid for lottery money, there must be doubts about whether it is competent to spend that money efficiently and well. Therefore the danger of involving people who cannot even put together a bid is that one might distribute money that may be spent wastefully. I assume that that genuine concern has not gone away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I shall deal with some related points. There is no requirement for lottery distributors to accept a solicited bid and no guarantee that they will do so. We must see how the system works in practice. The idea that a solicited bid will ergo be successful is not correct; it will also have to stand the test of quality. We should avoid the situation in which a local group is told, "You need a new swimming pool," to which they might agree and submit a bid. A bid will have to stand comparison with other bids because, as the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) suggested, legal challenge is possible. There is always the possibility of legal challenge in the courts and judicial review, and distributing bodies will have to bear that in mind when comparing the quality of solicited and unsolicited bids.
<P>
To pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, that the best bids should win, the best bids will win that is the important point but they will not all come from the same area. I was about to give an example.
<P>
On considering distribution of sports lottery funds in London, I looked to see why the borough of Newham was so conspicuously successful in its bids. I should like to think that it had something to do with me, but unfortunately that is not the case. If my constituents wish to believe that, so be it, but it is not true.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I found that Newham, which has problems similar to those of Lambeth, was conspicuously successful, whereas Lambeth was not. Why is that? It is because Newham borough council is so much better at formulating lottery applications because it has a very active sports development section. Lambeth, in its wisdom or otherwise, has disbanded or at least downgraded its sports development section, so it is not in a position to make applications. However, no one could possibly say that Lambeth does not have needs. I do not know whether that reflects the way in which the lottery board will conduct itself, but it is an obvious point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister offers an appalling indictment of the shambolic way in which local authority in Lambeth has conducted itself. He illustrates the fact that within London, local authorities such as Islington, Lambeth and others have brought local government into disrepute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I really hoped that the hon. Gentleman would have taken my example a little more objectively rather than responding with a low-level, cheap political point. Of course councils vary in quality; Labour councils, as well as Conservative and Liberal Democrat councils. That is hardly a stark revelation. I was explaining why certain areas are successful and others are not. There are other reasons, but that is one of them.
<P>
It will be for distributors to decide whether to use the new powers in the Bill. No one will tell them to solicit in a particular area or for extra resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I hear what the Minister says, but I want to clarify the point that I made about the high hopes of Labour Members. The fact is that they are pinning their hopes on the Government's being able to deliver on their requests. Will the Minister comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> If it is worthy of comment, which frankly I do not think it is, the answer is no, the Government will not do that. I believe that, at some time or other, all hon. Members have identified that such powers are necessary. It becomes somewhat tiresome when Conservative Members say one thing in public, in Committee, and something quite different in private to me, either verbally or in letters, about what they would like to happen in their constituencies. I do not restrict the charge of hypocrisy to the hon. Members I see in front of me; plenty of others, who are not here, adopt exactly the same approach. I find that distressing because we are trying to make the lottery more efficient. We are trying to ensure that the Bill deals with people's criticisms of the lottery for example, by introducing the ability to solicit, so that there will at least be more rationale behind the way in which lottery grants are awarded. Otherwise, there will be a ridiculous imbalance of resources across the country, which is not in the interests of the reputation of the lottery or of the country.
<P>
The matter does not relate to central Government control; lottery distributors will decide how to handle it. The fact that a lottery bid is solicited does not necessarily mean that it will be successful. When considering solicited bids, it will obviously be necessary to build a defined wall between those responsible for soliciting and those responsible for processing.
<P>
We intend to issue revised policy and financial directions to distributors to make it clear that solicitation should be used only when it is the best way to address an important element of the distributors' strategy, and to ensure that there is fair consideration of solicited and unsolicited applications, through a division between those who solicit and those who decide.
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole asked according to what criteria bids would be sought. It will not be a question of political priorities, as he suggested. The lottery distributors will decide the criteria, and will always be open to such a challenge, as is any government body. They will therefore ensure that such criteria can be tested and proven in court.
<P>
We shall address the question of small initiatives later. The Bill will not diminish such initiatives, but is intended to encourage them, as later clauses will show. Distributors will be able to establish agents to distribute, which will mean that money can more quickly arrive at the locality from the centre. It is absurd that every lottery bid, however small, must be considered centrally.
<P>
I believe that I have already responded to the charge that decisions will favour solicited bids and discriminate against those that are unsolicited. That is not so. Solicited bids will not always win. The clause will not lead to a two-tier system, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole alleged. I hope that it will lead to a more coherent system that will meet the approval of all hon. Members. If that does nothing else, it will mean that they will not write to me in such large numbers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> It is a delight to hear the Minister for Sport again. We have seen much of him in the press recently; two weeks ago he was photographed with a well known public figure renowned for his acting ability I do not mean the Prime Minister. Last week he was again photographed, in a sort of canine embrace. Although I fully accept the Minister's desire to spread the Labour message to parts of the country that have not been reached hitherto, does he not think that that takes inclusion a little too far?
[Mr. Spring]
<P>
The power of solicitation, as expressed in the clause, is part of a block-building process of garnering additional powers to the Secretary of State, to which we object. Taken in isolation, the measure could have some merits, especially for bodies that seek small sums and find it difficult to secure them. Any help, encouragement or guidance that can be given to such bodies is a powerful factor.
<P>
However, if such a power of solicitation derives from the Secretary of State, it simply increases and enhances his powers. That is the essential difficulty. We already know that the New Opportunities Fund is being used essentially for political purposes. As a result, we will see a growing tendency to move from good causes to areas of Government responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman substantiate his claim that the New Opportunities Fund will be used for political purposes? My hon. Friends the Ministers for Arts and for Sport and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have made it clear that there is no evidence of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's inability to absorb what we have been discussing in the past few weeks. If he has not understood our principle objection, he has understood nothing. Members of Parliament have to be very cautious in guarding the independence of those who receive lottery money, and we must not give additional powers to Ministers, whether of this Government or any future Government. That is the point of our objection.
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee further. The point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, who summed up our objections. The proposal is part of a seamless flow, as the Minister might say, of granting enhanced powers to the Secretary of State, and we object to that in the overall context of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It is nice to know that the hon. Gentleman is my main publicist in the Committee by pointing out my press cuttings. Indeed, he painted a rather charming and fetching picture of me being kissed by a dog. [Interruption.] I do not wish to be offensive, but if that was an attempt by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole to solicit a kiss from me, he is going to be very disappointed. I do not wish to be offensive, Mr. Gale, but I would rather kiss the other end of a dog than the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Life is a lottery, but I am not certain that those comments fall within the scope of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I was merely responding to the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole whom I must further disappoint by saying that his attempt to see a great Government conspiracy of centralisation does not stand any test. Indeed, if he feels so strongly about that, why has no amendment on this clause been tabled? That is the real test. The hon. Gentleman may wish to vote against the clause, but he has not made a case he has merely given the usual tissue of half-truths and misleading statements about our intentions. However, we accept that as a small change of politics. Those who consider the matter objectively realise that the power to solicit is important because it will enable us to make the successful lottery even more successful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): Briefly, does the Minister for Sport think that the clause might enable distributing bodies to subcontract or delegate part of their functions to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, which has shown great competence and ability in dealing with small funds? Its functions and purposes are quite similar to those of the lottery distributing bodies. In his reply to our discussion of the preceding clause, he mentioned that it would be absurd if every lottery bid, however small, were administered centrally. I wondered therefore whether the distributing bodies might delegate to bodies created by themselves and to existing outside bodies, especially to the foundation, which has such a notable track record of unbureaucratic expenditure on sport and the arts.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> The answer is yes if the lottery distributors decide to do so. Our intention is that the Bill should allow distributors to delegate decisions to sub-committees and to their staff in line with sensible practice in central government, local authorities and elsewhere, thereby cutting down on bureaucracy so that the full lottery board does not become logjammed. We also intend the Bill to allow other bodies with relevant expertise or local knowledge to deliver grant programmes on behalf of the distributors. The hon. Gentleman's example would therefore be perfectly valid if the sports lottery board were to decide to delegate spending powers to such a body. There are many other such examples.
<P>
The amendment is sensible. It cuts down on bureaucracy and enables money to be moved faster, as it were, through other bodies with known and recognised expertise in specific areas. Without actually saying that the body mentioned by the hon. Gentleman will be so used that will be a decision for the distributors I am delighted to say that his example is perfectly valid.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Strategic plans for distributing bodies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 14, line 42, leave out from "(1)" to "in" in line 43 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A body which distributes money under section 25(1) may."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 24, in page 15, leave out lines 9 to 37.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Clause 12 is the "We know best", nanny state, dirigiste clause in the Bill. If the arm's length principle had not already been fatally undermined by clauses 5 and 6, clause 12 certainly undermines it. In eroding the arm's length principle, it also erodes the additionality principle. Far worse than that, it extends the principle beyond the New Opportunities Fund to all the other distributing bodies, as clause 12 applies to every distributing body.
<P>
On first reading, the clause seems fairly modest. On the face of it, who could object to a strategic plan? If distributing bodies want strategic plans, Opposition Members are in favour of them having them. We want a more open and transparent lottery and it is right that people should see the basis on which distributing bodies come to decisions. Nothing prevents the distributing bodies from doing so under the existing legislation.
<P>
This clause, however, is highly prescriptive and authoritarian. It transfers significant powers over policy from distributing bodies to the Secretary of State. We should begin by looking in detail at clause 12.
<P>
Section 25 C(1), which is the subject of amendment No. 36, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the Secretary of State instructs it to do so, a body which distributes money under section 25(1) shall... prepare and adopt a strategic plan".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes beyond the preparation and adoption of a strategic plan. If the distributing body has adopted a strategic plan, the Secretary of State can insist that it adopts another one if he is not happy with it. Therefore, the strategic plan is not within the distributing body's remit, but is directly within that of the Secretary of State.
<P>
If one reads on through the clause, one sees in subsections (2), (3) and (4) the extent of the Secretary of State's powers. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In this section `strategic plan', in the case of any body, means a statement containing the body's policies for the distribution of the money".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is clear that the remit does not relate to the way in which the money should be spent but to what it should be spent on. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A strategic plan must also contain 
(a) a statement of any directions given to the body by the Secretary of State".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, we should be in no doubt about what the clause does. It transfers significant power away from what were independent bodies to the Government, which Conservative Members regard as thoroughly undesirable.
<P>
I refer the Committee to Lord McIntosh's extraordinary and hilarious suggestion in another place. During the Committee stage of the Bill there, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is not an interference with the arm's length principle. The strategies we require will be developed by, and belong to, the independent distributor bodies." [Official Report, House of Lords, 22 January 1998; Vol. 584, c. CWH 87.]
<P>
At best that is a disingenuous statement. If the Government came clean and said that they wished to have more power over the way in which the money was spent because they were not happy with the way in which it had been spent, that would be fair enough; but to pretend that there is no interference with the arm's length principle when there clearly is, is to be dishonest with the people.
<P>
Again, the Government's position is given away in the notes to the Bill, which they prepared. The notes on clause 12, which rely heavily on the White Paper, say:
<P>
"The White Paper, The People's Lottery, says that the Government wishes to ensure that Lottery money `is spent according to a clear strategy which takes account of need'. It proposes that the Bill should require distributor bodies `to draw up strategic plans which reflect identified needs, the Lottery funding available to them, and the Directions issued to them'."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whose needs? It is the Secretary of State's and the Government's needs, not necessarily the independent bodies' needs. The transfer of power away from distributing bodies to the Government is the nub of the clause.
<P>
It might help the Committee if we spent a little time looking at the origins of the clause, so that we can see where the Government are coming from. I begin by drawing the Committee's attention to the attitude of members of the Government Front Bench when they were in opposition. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham), who was then the shadow Heritage Secretary, chaired a lottery advisory group comprising six Labour Members, including the Minister for Sport, I believe, and a number of other worthies such politically impartial figures as David Puttnam and Helena Kennedy and such august bodies as the Association of District Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. It is largely on the basis of the group's report that we had, first, the White Paper and now the Bill with, of course, clause 12.
<P>
The report says that there must be a coherent strategy guiding the distribution of funds to good causes and that such a strategy should be the responsibility of Government. That makes it clear: this is the Government's strategy, and it is time the Government accepted that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not misunderstand. That committee took evidence from a great many people, who all pointed to the need for strategic planning. It was not asking the Government to do the strategic planning themselves; it was asking the Government to give the lottery board power to do it. Those are totally different and ensure the arm's length independence that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I accept what the Minister says as far as it goes, but when the Government set out the remit for the strategic plan as tightly as they have in clause 12, they are determining the outcome of the strategic plan. If the independent body draws up a strategic plan that is not acceptable to the Government, it must change that plan and, presumably, continue to change it until it is in accordance with what the Government want. The Minister was not being straight when he drew his spurious distinction.
<P>
The lottery advisory group stated in its report that the strategy should be the responsibility of Government not the distributing bodies and that although the lottery has effectively doubled public spending on sport, art, heritage and culture 
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Does not the retort sum up the whole mindset? The Government refer to the doubling of public spending, but no distinction is made between money from the Government via taxpayers and money from the lottery, which is seen as something that can be used to implement Government policy. That is the point at issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, which we have tried to stress in almost every debate on the Bill and which runs throughout the Bill. The distinction between taxpayers' money and lottery money has virtually ceased to exist. The Minister for Sport made that criticism only a year ago when in opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> This is another fine-line argument. If anything were to go wrong with the lottery distributor, the Government would undoubtedly be blamed. Lottery money is public money, not Government money from central taxation, and the Government must ultimately take responsibility for anything involving public money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I shall give an example to illustrate our argument. The purchase of the Churchill papers was very unpopular [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] I do not deny that, but that is different from saying whether it was right or wrong and it was done because the independent body thought it was the right thing to do.

<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It was wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> That illustrates our point. The independent body, because it was independent of Government, was able to do things that the Government thought were wrong at the time. That would not be possible under the new system because the independent body will not longer be independent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We just had a defining moment of the Committee. The Minister said from a sedentary position, "It was wrong". The Bill will give him the power to make decisions and the lottery will no longer be independent. The Minister has validated every objection we have to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I entirely agree that the Minister has given the game away. Who do people ultimately trust Lord Rothschild and his committee, who made a decision independently, or a Minister? It will in future be the latter who decides. The danger of the Bill stacking up powers for the Government will undermine the credibility of lottery distribution decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Hon. Members may think this statement rather grand, but that illustrates the difference between populism on the one hand and parliamentary democracy on the other. [Laughter.] I prefaced my remark by saying that it might be interpreted as rather a grand statement, but it is true none the less. Independent bodies ensure a degree of remoteness that is necessary when making important decisions, but which will be fatally compromised if the clause is agreed to.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
To recap, a few moments ago I tried to set out the background to and origins of the clause. I shall quote again from the report of the Labour party national lottery advisory group, of which the Minister for Arts was a member. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Although the lottery has effectively doubled public spending on sport, art, heritage and culture, this huge quantity of money is being spent with little sense of strategic purpose. In fact, the courting of bids is prohibited and most lottery revenues are distributed on a solely application-led basis. If the benefits are to be maximised, there must be a coherent strategy guiding the distribution to `good causes' in place of the almost complete abdication of responsibility which the present Government has shown."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement is revealing and is not one from which Labour Members would disassociate themselves now [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a fundamental difference between legitimate reaction to controversial statements and the ripple of private conversation. The former I am prepared to permit; the latter I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I do not think that Ministers would disassociate themselves from the statement by that group. I can see the argument for a coherent strategy and greater Government involvement, as long as it is accepted that there is more Government involvement. It is not acceptable to say on the one hand that there will be more Government involvement but, on the other, that the distributing bodies will be as independent as they were before.
<P>
I would like to draw three points from that quotation. The first, which was made by my hon. Friends the Members for West Suffolk and for Ashford a moment ago and in last week's edition of The Economist, is that the lottery is becoming part of public spending. Public spending and lottery spending are being merged. The lottery advisory group accepted that. The Government are trying to deny it, but that was the origin of clause 12.
<P>
My second point concerns what I would call the nanny state. The Government are fond of using expressions such as "the people's priorities", when what they really mean is their priorities. I do not ascribe base motives to the Government; I do not think that they are ascribing motives to the people which they do not think that the people have. We contend that the people individuals and small groups around the country and not Ministers, know the needs of their communities.
<P>
The history of this country and that of the continent shows that when the Government start deciding what is best for the people, they inevitably get it wrong. That is not because they are badly intentioned often, they are well intentioned but it is better to allow individuals to reach their own decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> I know that the hon. Member for West Suffolk enjoys making comments whenever a Labour member of the Committee rises, but can the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Mr. Prior) explain the comments that he has just made in relation to the policy directions laid down by the Conservative Government under the leadership of the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) in 1992-97?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman mean the policy as recently laid down or as laid down when we were still in government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> When the Conservatives were in government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> We would draw a clear distinction between setting the framework of how the lottery should operate and getting involved in how the money should be spent. Where you have crossed over the line 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not crossed over any line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> I apologise, Mr. Gale. I am sure that you would never cross over that line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The hon. Member for Hove was implying that such action is identical or comparable to what we did when we were in government. If so, why was the Bill drafted in the first place? The answer is that the Labour party was not satisfied that it had sufficient control over the national lottery and its proceeds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> That is the answer, is it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> That is the very powerful answer and it is one to which I subscribe. If clause 12 will not add anything to what was there before, what is the reason for it? As I said, the reason is that it will give the Secretary of State far more power over the distribution of funds that had been independent hitherto and working well. When the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 first came before the House, Labour Members took the same view that we are taking now.
<P>
The implicit criticism in the statement to which I referred earlier was that the previous Government had no coherent strategy or control over where the lottery funds were going. Conservative Members believe that there should not have been overall detailed Government control of where the money was going and that that should be left to independent lottery distributors. That is the difference between our party and old Labour. Conservative Members trust other people to spend money, whereas old Labour and possibly new Labour want to spend the money itself. That is the fundamental, philosophical difference between our approach to the distribution of lottery proceeds and that of the Labour party.
<P>
Those are the three aspects that I wanted to draw from the origins of clause 12. I am sure that the Government will insist on it being in the Bill and will ignore our amendments and that reflects the complete change in how the lottery will be run. It will be seen by those who play the lottery and people who want to receive lottery funds to be a creature of Government rather than an independent organisation. Over time, that will flaw and undermine many of the attractions of the national lottery.
<P>
I shall demonstrate how the proposed changes to the lottery and the introduction of strategic plans were greeted by those on the Government Front Bench. That will provide the Committee with a clue about how important the Government regard such plans. In praising the plans for the introduction of after-school clubs funded by the lottery, Harriet Harman who, at the same time, launched 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must refer to Ministers either by their title or their constituency, not by their names.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The Secretary of State for Social Security launched a great attack on the Conservative cuts on the lone parent premium and one parent benefit. However, the right hon. Lady has now certainly changed her tune about that. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Today, Jack Cunningham has set out Labour's plans to make children and young people a priority for the Lottery's New Millennium Commission."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was clear, in the right hon. Lady's view, that the New Opportunities Fund would have a political agenda. The same goes for the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Homework centres and after-school clubs can start to tackle the growing problem of children watching too much television, and finding themselves as latch-key kids, waiting for parents to come home. Tackling the TV culture is crucial to raising standards".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We agree with the right hon. Gentleman 100 per cent., but we believe that that policy is a core part of the Government's political programme, which should be funded properly from tax revenue.
<P>
Clause 12 is a further massive extension of political control over the distribution of lottery funds, which the Opposition oppose wholeheartedly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Opposition are making heavy weather of the clause. It is disingenuous to talk about the Bill and this provision as if it were some great new centralising tendency being introduced by an old-fashioned, old Labour Government. I do not recognise it as such. Such criticism comes ill from a party which, in the words of Simon Jenkins, who is usually seen as a correspondent and commentator of the right, introduced legislation that effectively nationalised the betting and gaming industry. It has had that effect, in that it has considerbly diminished the profitability of certain private sector industries. There is no evidence that Conservative Members are coming to terms with their[Mr. Maclennan]
sins of the past. They would do well to recognise that as the lottery progresses in age, and more and more money pours in from the public, it is necessary to consider and plan how that money will be spent.
<P>
Part of the lottery's virtue in its early days was its ability to respond ad hoc to attractive propositions for funding. It did not have to fit into a complex pre-ordained strategy. I should utter at least one note of warning about strategies for distribution in the arts, in particular. Too many arts funding bodies devote too much of their time in their administrative towers to devising strategies that are perfectionist and Utopian, and which are not always closely in touch with the possibilities. They are often not as responsive as they might be to new initiatives and innovatory possibilities.
<P>
When dealing with a substantial sum of money although it does not belong to taxpayers, it is, in a sense, publicly fostered giving it is necessary to consider accountability. The judgment on how the lottery distribution bodies spend their money should not be simply on the basis of special interest or ad hoc decisions flowing from the particular enthusiasm or interest of recipients. It is helpful to have opportunities to judge whether the lottery distribution bodies know where they are going. That is all the clause would provide for.
<P>
I suspect that even under the originating Act, it might have been possible for the Secretary of State, using his powers of direction, to require a strategic plan. There is sufficient doubt about that, so it would be wise for Conservative Members to be a little cautious about being so dismissive of the power under this Bill, which is a perfectly reasonable one to include. No one could imagine that it would be a sensible use of lottery resources to set up a great hierarchy of planners to get down to the business of making plans for all the arts, sports and regions of the country and the different groups of beneficiaries, such as disabled and handicapped people, and so on. That approach would turn the lottery into a bureaucracy and too large a proportion of its resources would be spent in ways that were far from the objectives that most of us favour.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> The debate on the amendments has thrown up some core issues, which get to the heart of many of the objections that Conservative Members have to the Bill. We had an interesting discussion about whether the "control freak" element of the clause is an old Labour phenomenon. I disagree with the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) on that point. I think that the measure is wholly at the heart of new Labour, whose philosophy is that if something can be controlled, it should be; it should be centralised and controlled by Ministers, and independent decision and thought should be snuffed out wherever possible. I rather regret that with his distinguished history of opposing some of the nastier tendencies inside the Labour party, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross has chosen not to oppose this particular unpleasant tendency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The underlying additionality and arm's-length principles have been flouted by the clause. In isolation, there may be some merit in the proposal, but taken in the context of the Bill, there are considerable dangers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend has anticipated the point that I was about to make. The overall purpose of the Bill is to accrete control to the Secretary of State, and this clause is the key in the lock, allowing the additionality and arm's-length principles to be flouted.
<P>
Our amendment would leave the desirable parts of the clause provisions that might improve the day-to-day operation of the lottery in place, but would remove the undesirable parts about strategic plans being drawn up at the behest of and under the control of the Secretary of State. New subsection 25C(5)(d) is the key. The distributing body will have made all its decisions, drawn up its strategic plan and done all the "motherhood and apple pie" things that we all think should happen. However, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it has to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make such modifications to the draft as it considers necessary or expedient."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is not the first time that I have admired the Bill's drafting, because it is quite clear that any modifications to the draft will be those considered by the Secretary of State to be "necessary or expedient". It is inconceivable that a distributing body, appointed by the Secretary of State and working to him, would be able to do things that the Secretary of State did not consider necessary or expedient. That lever will give the Secretary of State the power to exercise undesirable, detailed control over the operations of the grant-giving bodies.
<P>
The point is made rather more starkly in the notes on clauses, which state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"subsection (1) requires distributor bodies to prepare and adopt a plan, or review, modify or replace a strategic plan if the Secretary of State instructs them to do so."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are not many loopholes for independent thought. It is quite clear that every last beacon of independence will be stamped out. I note with some amusement that the only body exempt from that extreme Stalinist form of control is the Millennium Commission, which is hugely under the influence of the Minister without Portfolio and therefore requires no further central control to be exercised over it.
<P>
I previously criticised the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross; I now agree with him that one of the attendant dangers of the new structure to be set up by clause 12 is that of excessive bureaucracy. One of the good points about the lottery, which has not been broadcast sufficiently in our debates, is that without more than the usual number of difficulties and rough passages, the distributing bodies have not added massively to the bureaucracy; they have managed to distribute the money without setting up expensive new rafts of people to deal with it.
<P>
The serious danger is that if the distributing bodies are required to produce plans, and to modify them at the behest of the Secretary of State, their first reaction will be to hire a large number of planners. Those who play the lottery, who want their money to go to good causes, will find that the proportion of that money going on expenses which they doubtless regard as dead-weight will increase markedly as a result of clause 12. The Ministers should ensure that that does not happen. The detailed guidance that the Secretary of State is meant to give to the distributing bodies should include a provision that they are not allowed to increase the proportion of the money that passes through their hands that is spent on internal expenses.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is not to rip the heart out of clause 12. Strategic planning is not necessarily a bad thing. Obviously, good distribution bodies will already be working to a strategy. It would not be controversial to say that, broadly speaking, the distribution bodies have done a good job over the past four years. We hope that they will continue to do so. We do not seek to remove that element; we seek the removal of that element of control by the Secretary of State.
<P>
In principle, we support any measure that will make the operation of the lottery more open and the decision-making process more transparent. The production and publication of strategic plans would therefore be wholly welcomed by the Opposition. Indeed, such matters could be the subject of a short annual debate on the Floor of the House. On Second Reading, it was clear that many hon. Members wanted to air particular constituency concerns.
<P>
Perhaps the Government will consider using the preparation and publication of strategic plans as an opportunity to enhance continued parliamentary scrutiny of the lottery's functions. That would at least help to row back from the increased Government control of the lottery under the Bill. I assume that the Government will reject the amendment, although I hope for a deathbed repentance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> In my hon. Friend's experience, are the distributing bodies responsive to public opinion and the needs of local people, or are they unresponsive and require more central direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> In my experience, all the distributing bodies are conscious of the need to be responsive, and of the need not only to ensure the fairness of original distribution, but to be seen to be fair. They are aware that they are responsible for distributing large sums and are in a position of trust. They have striven hard to achieve that trust over time, and having a strategic plan plays a part in that, although the plan does not need to be called that name, or to be defined in the clause. Clearly, the distributing bodies work on the basis of some sort of plan, and to that extent, the clause will prove unnecessary.
<P>
I simply seek to point out the parts of the clause that are not only unnecessary but likely to be actively damaging in future. When the clause is analysed, it becomes clear that it is much more about Government control than about strategic planning. Every subsection contains the explicit or implicit involvement of the Secretary of State. Therefore it is obvious that, although the strategic plans will nominally be produced by the bodies, they will be the Secretary of State's plans. It would be better if the Government could bring themselves to be honest about that.
<P>
As I have said, I assume that the Government will reject the amendments, but I hope that they will make a deathbed repentance. If they are genuinely committed to the arm's-length principle, as they have said repeatedly, they will accept the amendments because the amendments do not remove the need for strategic planning; they simply remove the Secretary of State's direct control. Indeed, the amendments would not completely remove the Government from the process. The Secretary of State could review and comment on the strategic plans, and hon. Members and other interested bodies could also comment on them.
<P>
We do not seek to stifle discussion of the strategic plans; we simply aim to remove the Secretary of State's detailed control. Indeed, the bodies could still undertake all the processes under the clause. They could adopt a strategic plan and review or replace it. If there were a wave of public criticism of any distributing body's draft strategic plan, nothing in the amendment would stop it reacting to that criticism. Surely that is how it should be. Under a properly run people's lottery, that is how it would be. The clause is another example of how a Government lottery, not a people's lottery, will be created under the Bill.
<P>
All that the Minister thinks desirable strategic planning, and the responsiveness of strategic plans to public concern could be achieved under the amendments. The only change is that the distributing bodies would not have to do all that under instructions from the Secretary of State. He would not have the power to reject the strategic plan and require the distributor to produce what would be to him a more acceptable plan in other words, a more politically acceptable plan.
<P>
The problem of political acceptability is that the Government are allowing their short-term desires to override the long-term interests of the lottery. That is bad government. In their own narrow, partisan, short-term interests, they wish to exercise the political control that the clause will allow, Over time, however, people will notice what the Government are doing. We have already debated the difference between populism and parliamentary democracy. I draw another distinction to the Government's attention: the difference between populism and long-term popularity. Short-term populism does not often lead to long-term popularity. That part of the project will fail, and to pursue the original thoughts behind the clause is politically unwise. It will produce bad government.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall now speak specifically to amendment No. 24, which would remove a raft of additional powers that the Bill confers on the Secretary of State, under which he can interfere in the operations of the distributing bodies. Subsection (3), which is particularly iniquitous, requires the plan to contain details of the directions given to the distributing bodies; it requires an assessment of the money that they have available to be distributed, and statements of the needs that they will have the power to deal with and the priorities that they must address.
<P>
Such measures are more or less lifted wholesale from the White Paper. "Needs" and "priorities" pace the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross are good new Labour weasel words, and are code for what the Government regard as politically[Mr. Green]
expedient at any one time. It is wrong that lottery money should be used in that way. If Labour Members think that I am being unnecessary cynical or paranoid about their motives, all they have to do is accept the amendments. That would still leave the bodies capable of reacting to needs and priorities but it would be the distributing bodies' needs and priorities rather than those of the Secretary of State. Our amendments would achieve that crucial distinction.
<P>
Clearly, such a power is a response to the special pleading by many Labour Members who consider that their constituencies have been hard done by under the lottery. I am not denying the validity of such complaints, but pointing out to Labour Members that they will be putting not only their heads but their constituents' heads in a noose, if they rely for the distribution of funds on the Secretary of State's decisions. One day they will wake up and see a Secretary of State who does not belong to their party. Moreover, during the next few years, although the Secretary of State does belong to their party, Labour Members will have to stay on message. They will not be allowed to exercise independent thought.
<P>
An agonising moment may arrive for Back-Bench Labour Members, when they will have to decide what it is best for them to do. Their constituents could urge them to rebel on certain matters, and their consciences may tempt them to do so. When a large number of lottery bids are made, the Secretary of State will decide the needs and priorities and whether they will be successful. I would not wish to be in the position of those individual Back-Benchers, who will have to decide whether to defend the interests of their constituents or support the Government's policy. Should they rebel or not? The fact that they will have to make such a difficult decision shows how bad the clause is, and the control that it will give to the Secretary of State. Members of Parliament will to an extent be tainted by the control that the Government are arrogating to themselves under the clause.
<P>
The underlying argument about regional imbalance misses the point. The lottery was designed to stimulate communities to bid. One of the side effects of the way in which money is distributed is that communities are encouraged to get together to construct bids. I am sure that many other hon. Members have experience, as I have, of examples in which the act of getting together to make a lottery bid builds partnerships that go on to do good things in the local community, even if the bid is unsuccessful. The process forces people to talk to each other and to get into the habit of working together. I expect that the Committee agrees that it is useful that such things happen. Greater centralisation of distribution is in danger of damaging that process, which has stimulated good work at local level.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is not to damage strategic planning or the greater transparency that it may allow, but simply to remove the unacceptable degree of centralisation and accretion of power to the Secretary of State. I urge the Government to accept the amendments, which are tabled in good part.

<P>

<B>Mr. Banks:</B> The clause is an important part of delivering the commitment that we set out in the White Paper to ensure that lottery funds are spent according to strategies based on an assessment of need put simply, getting the money to where it is most needed and can most effectively be spent.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) that we will not accept the amendments. [Hon. Members: "Shame."] I may be looking a little rough this morning, but I am not on my deathbed, so there will be no deathbed repentence on my part or anyone else's. In fact, we feel surprisingly chipper. [Interruption.] It is not too late for hon. Members to put some money on me even at odds of four to one it is worth a few quid. For the record, I am referring to the odds offered to me by a local bookmaker on my becoming mayor of London.
<P>
We cannot accept the amendments because amendment No. 36 would make the production of a strategic plan optional and amendment No. 24 would remove the entire provisions stipulating minimum contents and the requirement to consult. The hoary old argument has been raised again that the clause is about centralisation and the Secretary of State imposing his or, who knows, at some stage, her will on the lottery. That is not so. A careful reading of subsection (5) makes it clear that the Secretary of State must be consulted, but that the plan is not subject to his approval that will be a matter for the distributors.
<P>
As the distributors themselves have all welcomed the idea of a strategic plan, it is surprising that Conservative Committee members should make such a fuss about it. I suppose that it could be argued that given that some distributors are already making such a plan the National Lottery Charities Board, for example, has run a succession of themed rounds of applications we do not need the powers. Such arguments are often raised about Bills. We must anticipate the fact that a lottery distributor may choose not to have a strategic plan; that is why the Bill has been drafted to ensure that they must produce one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the Minister agree with the comments of the Heritage Lottery Fund, which hoped that the Government would confirm
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the primary responsibility for the strategic deployment of lottery funds will remain with the Trustees of the Lottery distributors?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Of course. That deployment will be made according to the strategic plan that the distributors draw up. It will be their strategic plan. They will have to consult on that. They do not have to consult only the Secretary of State. Under subsection (5)(a), distributing bodies shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consult such other bodies as it thinks fit for the purpose of identifying the needs mentioned in subsection (3)(c) and formulating the policies to be adopted for dealing with those needs".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members seem to have confused the needs of the lottery distributor with the needs of those who will receive lottery funds, which is the more important. It seems perfectly reasonable that the distributing bodies should consult. The way to draw up a strategic plan is to consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The suggested consultation seems to be a loose element of conversation, discussion and exchange of ideas, but I understand that the distributing bodies will be required to modify their plans at the behest of the Secretary of State once consultation has been completed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> Of course, that is so. The Secretary of State and Parliament will consider the consultation process 
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> That was exactly the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> It is perfectly reasonable, that they should consider the consultation process and the plans, even if modified, will be the plan of the body itself.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point, but nothing in the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to say, "You will make that change." The Secretary of State is entitled to be consulted, along with every other body, but in the end it will be for the lottery distributor to take into account those views. That is not inappropriate. What on earth is a consultation process, unless one takes account of the result? Not everything that is said will necessarily be embodied in the plan, but at least there is a requirement to consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> What happens if the lottery body has consulted and drawn up a strategic plan but the Secretary of State disagrees with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> I understand that the lottery body will proceed with it plan. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] The lottery body does not have to seek the approval of the Secretary of State. The strategic plan is not for the Secretary of State, but for the distributing body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Clause 12 makes it absolutely clear that the Secretary of State can instruct the lottery board to replace any strategic plan and to prepare and adopt another one. It is clear that the Secretary of State has that power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Banks:</B> No, I do not accept that the Secretary of State can impose his will upon a lottery distributor. The distributors are required to consult, but in the end the strategic plan is not for the Secretary of State's approval; it is for them to take into account those things that the Secretary of State and other bodies have suggested, but the plan is that of the body itself, not that of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Hon. Members are trying to suggest that it is a form of centralisation. However, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross is right to say that, as the lottery develops and as the money increases as we all hope and believe it will it will be necessary to give the lottery some shape. One of the things that I have discovered, in the area in which I am most involved, is that the problem is not a shortage of money but a surfeit of money going to an area that, for too long, has been short of the necessary funds.
<P>
The fact is that a member of the bodies applying for lottery money are not up to handling the sort of money that is coming their way, so it will be necessary to give the lottery some shape. That is the reason for the strategic plan. It is not true that the strategic plan masks some hideous centralising plan by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Under the 1993 Act, the Secretary of State was given enormous powers. Under section 29, he has the power to remove a distributing body. So it is not as if existing legislation does not give the Secretary of State powers to impose his will. The clause is about giving guidance and steering, and giving shape and form to the way in which public money I make no apologies for repeating that it is public money, although not Government money is spent. It is wholly appropriate that some strategic guidance be given to assist not the lottery distributors but the applicants. They need to know what the parameters are and what the forward thinking of the lottery distributors is, so that they can shape their applications appropriately.
<P>
In rejecting both amendments, I make it clear that the clause has been welcomed by the lottery distributors. Given that fact, I am surprised that Conservative members of the Committee are being so churlish in their attitude to it.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Of course I understand the point made by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that the lottery will evolve. It is important that the lottery adjusts to new realities. We made it plain that over time there would be an evolution from the capital side to the revenue side, and it is appropriate that that be constantly monitored. There is nothing to stop a distribution body from drawing up a strategic plan and considering how best to distribute the moneys that it receives. There is no problem with that but there is a difference between that and the provisions of the clause.
<P>
The Minister talked about guiding and steering. I remind him that new section 25C(1) states that the distributing body must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) review and modify any strategic plan which it has adopted, or
<P>
(c) replace any strategic plan which it has adopted by preparing and adopting another."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That must be done under the influence of the Secretary of State. The Minister suggests that there will be benign consultation; but the Government do not work like that. The authority of the Secretary of State and his ability to influence what an arm of the lottery is willing to do is already significant, as the Minister said.
<P>
The Minister will recall that when the Secretary of State invited Peter Davis to come and discuss the problem with GTech, Mr. Davis, who in the morning had announced that he was happy, felt that he enjoyed the Secretary of State's confidence and would be staying on, had resigned by the afternoon. Some sort of spontaneous combustion appears to have taken place during his conversation with the Secretary of State; the two of them somehow arrived at that view, and the inference was that it was the result of what the Secretary of State had said.
<P>
The Secretary of State obviously has considerable influence, direct or indirect, with which to impose his view. The amendments are intended to ensure that what powers he already has are not enhanced in a way that adds to the centralising tendency of the Government as manifested in the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk quoted part of the Heritage Lottery Fund's response to[Mr. Spring]
the White Paper, which I should like to read out, because it sums up the point. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The White Paper recorded the original intention that Ministers should influence the approach of Lottery distributors through policy directions, rather than through involvement in decisions on individual applications. We believe that this approach is right and has worked well. We hope that the Government will feel able to continue this approach in the future, and that the primary responsibility for the strategic deployment of lottery funds will remain with the Trustees of the Lottery distributors."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly the point.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would remove the Secretary of State's power to require distributing bodies to draw up strategic plans. Amendment No. 24 would remove a plethora of additional powers that will be conferred on the Secretary of State.
<P>
I repeat that the clause cannot be seen in isolation from the Bill; it is an integral part of the centralising process and the transfer power from the distribution bodies to the Secretary of State. Regrettably, we cannot accept the Minister's response and shall press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 18, line 4, leave out from "potential" to "and" in line 8.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 26, in clause 24, page 22, leave out lines 12 and 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Few countries have produced the talent that this country has produced over many generations. It is fair to say that in contemporary Britain there has been a tremendous flowering of the arts, music, fashion, theatre and interest in the cinema. All that has happened within the past few years, which, as all hon. Members will agree, is very gratifying as we approach the millennium. This country has a vibrant cultural scene. Even British food, which traditionally has not been regarded as being as fine a cuisine as some, is now regarded as desirable and something of a fashion statement. There has been remarkable success in other areas, such as Nobel prizes, medicine, physics and chemistry. It has been a great success story for these small islands. It is right that all hon. Members should seek to develop, enhance and exploit that talent to the advantage of the individuals involved and society as a whole.
<P>
An entire generation of people of considerable talent and ability simply left the country, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. We suffered a terrible loss in that enormous brain drain. People skilled in entrepreneurial activity, medicine and science simply left the country because they thought that there was no future here and because they were not prepared to pay a tax rate of something like 98 per cent. Countries such as the United States and others certainly benefited. Happily, there is now a consensus that that was a terrible mistake and that it should not happen again. At least we have learnt something from that matter.
<P>
I want to make it plain to members of the Committee that Conservative Members have absolutely no objection to a national fund for talent. We applaud the idea in principle, for all the reasons that I have stated. In this country, we have been successful in developing products and carrying out scientific experimentation and research. However, there has also been some valid criticism that such research has not always been successfully translated into commercial applications. For example, Japanese companies have made an enormous contribution to the economic life of this country, but there is some evidence that a certain amount of their success was the result of the research, scientific work and product development that has taken place in the United Kingdom.
<P>
The Conservative party's 1997 manifesto stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will encourage the use of Lottery money to train young athletes and artists, with revenue funding for bursaries, concessionary tickets to professional performances and support for young people's organisations and productions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That accords with the views of most people. Indeed, in April 1996, my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey announced an initiative that similarly concentrated on the development of young people's talents.
<P>
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, the former Prime Minister, stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is the prospect of moving rather more from capital funding to revenue funding, which was always envisaged at the outset and, again, is perfectly sensible. The only points at issue are the specific details of what is proposed and the timing." [Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 377, c. 187.]
<P></UL></FONT>
I would certainly subscribe to all those views, as would my hon. Friends.
<P>
The difficulty with the establishment of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts is that the devil lies in the detail. Conservative Members accept the principle of a national foundation for the endowment of talent, but we are concerned about the way in which that body is to be framed and how it will work in practice. I hope that the Minister will address our concerns. In another place, my noble Friend Baroness Rawlings described NESTA as something of a mongrel because of its position in the public sector. Conservative Members object to the form of NESTA. We are sceptical of the way in which it has been described as having quasi-governmental status. It should be removed from Government influence and I shall talk about that in a moment.
<P>
Why should NESTA take that form? The policy document produced by the Labour party on 23 April 1997, "The People's Money", set out the raison d'\ketre of NESTA. It was to be
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>
"A national endowment for science, technology and the arts. Our immediate objective will be to have NESTA-supported ideas earning copyright revenues by 2001. The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts will be a national trust for talent, helping to turn bright ideas into successful and innovative businesses. It will be constituted as an independent charity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I repeat that.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It will be constituted as an independent charity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"NESTA will invite successful figures in the arts, technology and science to contribute part of the value of their copyrights and patents to help the young talent of tomorrow. These contributions will go into a permanent endowment fund. To give NESTA an initial boost limited contributions will be set aside from the new lottery fund to add to this endowment."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Only four days later and in a similar vein, the Prime Minister, as he is now, said in a press statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We propose to give a lottery aided launch to our proposal for a national talent Fund the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts. Nesta will be an independent charity" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to repeat that point 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which will encourage successful people in the arts and sciences to donate part of the proceeds of their talent to an endowment fund which will foster new talen for the future."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, we are perplexed about the move away from independent charitable status in the proposals for establishing NESTA. I hope that the Minister will deal with that point, which raises serious questions about how the proposal will work and about public acceptance.
<P>
We detect a genuine conflict in giving a quasi-governmental body commercial aims. A clear message about charitable status was given before the general election. It was floated before the election as a promise. Now it has apparently disappeared from the horizon.
<P>
I accept that charitable status is for the Charity Commissioners to determine. However, if some of NESTA's objectives make that impossible, why have they been set? It is important that charitable status, the advantages of which are clear, should be secured.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As constituted, NESTA will not be fully independent of the Government. As a result, it may well not be able to attract money from independent sources. That is likely to be a flaw in the way it works. Amendment No. 37 presents the Minister with an opportunity to explain the issue more fully. Amendment No. 26 draws attention to another unwelcome departure in lottery funding. My hon. Friends and I will later argue that the Secretary of State's increased powers over NESTA's operation are undesirable and will impinge on its ability to attract independent cash.
<P>
I am concerned about the obligation to seek out and sponsor commercial success. I do not believe that this matter even involves party political controversy. There is a great danger in effectively giving Government the opportunities to pick winners. Governments are notoriously poor at doing so. The post-war history of this country is filled with examples of Governments' attempts to do it not working out. My noble Friend Lord Skidelsky suggested on Report that we do not want the endowment fund picking winners or taking on a quasi-venture-capitalist role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem with the fund is that it is neither fish nor fowl? It falls bang in between being a venture capital operation and a charitable operation and consequently suffers the worst of both worlds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Yes; my hon. Friend is right. The principle behind the endowment is correct, but as I have said, the devil lies in the detail. The proposal has not been sufficiently thought out. It has contradictory elements, as well as the worrying notion of playing venture capitalist.
<P>
Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale, speaking for the Government on Report in the other place, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As these reports show, there are imperfections in the current UK venture capital market, serious gaps in the market about which we cannot afford to be complacent. The provisions in this Bill will allow NESTA to address this in a number of ways: by providing limited seed capital to help turn a good idea into a proven concept; by providing guidance on the protection of intellectual property rights; by helping to raise awareness amongst banks and venture capitalist companies about technological entrepreneurship; by promoting networking support for creative individuals; by setting up mentoring schemes to help to improve the management and marketing skills of our investors; by developing links, and perhaps partnerships, with what are called `business angel' networks, affording them greater visibility; and by providing a one-stop source of information and advice about seed capital funds, incubators and grants.
<P>
The kinds of activities we have suggested for NESTA will make a real difference to ensuring that our best inventions and ideas are not taken up overseas but are exploited in this country, where their benefits can be enjoyed to the full." [Official Report, House of Lords, 9 March 1998; Vol. 587, c. 55.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a considerable flaw in that argument. I take Baroness Ramsay's point about not wanting our inventiveness to be exploited by others and I support some of her other remarks. That brings me me back to the point about acting as some sort of business angel. With the best will in the world, whether in respect of politicians or their advisers, Governments are notoriously bad at picking winners. Ultimately, they will sink or swim by what is determined in the marketplace.
<P>
The Minister will be aware that the previous Government made a considerable attempt to attract seedcorn capital into the private sector. Tax incentives were given to individuals to encourage them to put money into venture capital operations. There has been an extraordinary flowering of small business activity, especially in technology as a result of such incentives. It[Mr. Spring]
is difficult to understand why, instead of advising or encouraging such an operation, perhaps less directly through tax mechanism or other incentives, it should be necessary to go further along the lines suggested by Baroness Ramsay and along the route of a business angel and venture capitalist. That would be a mistake.

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I have seen the figure and the percentage is too low. Nevertheless, there has been a considerable cultural change. The next great phase in commercial industrial activity will be information based. The considerable upsurge in telecommunications and IT activity has greatly benefited employment and job creation in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is understandably reticent to mention the figure. He knows it well, but he will not tell the Committee what it is. In 1995, the European Venture Capital Association put the figure at 1 per cent. That is too low and hardly reflects what he described as flowering activity under the previous Government. Such a figure is ridiculous and we must do something about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister made the point for me. It was precisely in response to such matters that substantial tax incentives were given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is the appropriate way to deal with such problems. I accept that there has been a problem, but it is a matter of how it is dealt with. That should be done through the private sector, not through the sort of Government activity that is implicit in the setting up of NESTA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The Minister did not make the position clear 1 per cent. of what? Does he mean 1 per cent. of total capital available for business of 1 per cent. of development capital? The figure of 1 per cent. was just plucked out of the air.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that America is the most successful country for start-ups and new ventures, especially in information technology? The reason for that success is not merely access to venture capital, but access to the cluster developments at Massachussetts Institute of Technology and Stamford university. There is a mass of reasons for its success, for which the Government played no part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. At an educational institution that he and I attended at a certain point in our lives, there has been a tremendous flowering in the linkage between the academics at the university and the development of science-based technology. That has happened because of a framework of low taxation and other incentives. My hon. Friend makes that point extremely well. If we identify the problem, the question is how to deal with it. The example of the United States is a good one. There was no need for an approach such as NESTA. The matter was handled very much by the private sector.
<P>
The definitions inherent in the establishment of NESTA are sloppy. The encouragement of seedcorn capital should come through the private sector; it should not emerge from a state-sponsored enterprise as if somehow the Government know better. On the point about a charitable trust, will the Minister explain why the change was necessary? If it is to be fully independent as it should be it should have that sort of trust status.
<P>
The National Trust, which enjoys considerable public esteem, is wholly independent of Government. Another example is the Prince's Trust, which we all accept has been wonderful, encouraging seedcorn small businesses and start-ups. Yet, it has not become involved in commercial risks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> May I assist the hon. Gentleman? We took advice from the Charities Commission about whether NESTA should apply for charitable status. Its view was that NESTA will not develop in a wholly charitable way; it has an economic base. Although it is up to NESTA to seek charitable status it is perfectly entitled to do so the commission felt that it would probably not qualify. However, we have sought to give some of the advantages tax exemptions, for example that would come from charitable status. Clause 23 covers that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but he is making my point for me. The advantages of charitable status would be substantial. I understand what the Charities Commission has said, but it did so because NESTA has commercial elements. The point that I am trying to make is that it should not. If a national endowment, or a national trust for talent is set up properly, NESTA fulfils that function admirably. But difficulties will arise when that same NESTA runs into areas of seedcorn capital development or venture capital and becomes a business angel.
<P>
That aspect should not profitably involve Government. The role of Government is to encourage such activity by giving tax breaks, providing a macro or even a micro-economic environment. Government should not confuse the two elements. My noble Friend Baroness Rawlings described NESTA as a "mongrel" because it is neither one thing nor the other. Those two elements could damage each other its charitable status on one hand, and, on the other, its practicable application, which is to encourage seedcorn capital, further technological development and the progress of talented individuals in our society to make the best of themselves. Indeed, as the Minister said, because its aims are not charitable, NESTA cannot benefit from that sort of status.
<P>
When any sort of Government initiative is undertaken, it is important that we should consider its effect on the public. For example, because of its independent status, the public draw considerable comfort from supporting the National Trust. The public are generous to a fault in giving money to the charities that they believe do good in the various areas of our national life. If they are presented with a Government-sponsored, lottery-funded endowment, with the power to straddle the public and the private sectors, they may be dissuaded from supporting it. That is at the heart of our objection.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, I move to the matter of sport. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In our sports manifesto `Labour's Sporting Nation', we promised that the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts would offer support for sportspeople. Page 10 of that document states:
<P>
`The endowment will not focus solely on excellence, it will be inclusive in its approach, encouraging access and partnership across the whole range of earth sciences, humanities, sports and arts.'" [Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 185-186.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is probably the most distinguished individual in the House when it comes to knowledge of, and understanding and interest in sport 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> What about my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport?
<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I admire the loyalty of the Minister for Arts. My admiration for the Minister for Sport is profound, but even he will be generous enough to say that the role of the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde in promoting an interest in sport in this country has been quite exceptional. The hon. Gentleman feels that the role of sport has been downgraded by the exclusion.
<P>
I shall summarise our principled objections to the clause. We accept that there is considerable validity in what the Government are trying to do. It is the manner of how NESTA will be set up and how it will operate that really concerns us. Governments in all parliamentary democracies have a miserable record of picking winners. Ironically, the United States Government have taken a hands-off view on the development of new technologies. They have instead provided tax incentives, which is why there has been such an explosion of activity in that area.
<P>
NESTA is not a national trust for talent and productivity. As presently proposed and constituted, it will be a quango. Its board will be appointed by the Secretary of State, its money will be invested with the National Debt Commissioners, and its employees will be civil servants. The distance between the Secretary of State and NESTA is not sufficient.
<P>
It is with sorrow rather than anger that I sum up. I feel that the Government have missed an opportunity to do something free of political involvement or possible interference. It would have preserved the arm's length principle and sent out a message that the Government were taking a real interest in sponsoring the flourishing of science, technologies and the arts, instead of which NESTA has been constituted in a way that gives too much power to the Secretary of State. An opportunity has been missed, a quango has been created and it is greatly to our regret that that should be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I support the amendment because several opportunities have been missed, and there are several causes for genuine unease about the current constitution of NESTA, despite the general good will that one has for such a project. I note in passing that the Government's nerve in ignoring Parliament has cracked with the clause and that when, and if, the Secretary of State significantly changes NESTA's operations, Parliament will at least get a look-in and some kind of vote. That makes the clause refreshingly different from some of the previous clauses, under which Parliament will get no look-in and all power will go to the Secretary of State.
<P>
The principal problem, which the amendments are intended to address, is that too many things in some cases, the wrong things are being poured into NESTA. I am concerned that it sits uneasily and that its boundaries will be peculiar. During debates on other clauses, we have discussed whether core public spending will be replaced by lottery moneys under the New Opportunities Fund. NESTA appears to have an even more problematic set of boundaries. Some of its activities will butt up against existing charitable activities, some against general public spending and some against straightforward private sector commercial activity. NESTA will be swimming in murky pools; it will not be clear whether any particular grant or activity is appropriate to it. I hope that the Minister will tackle those boundary problems when he replies to the debate.
<P>
Our critical objection, with which the amendment is intended to deal, is to clause 16(2)(b) and to the idea that NESTA can somehow help individuals to exploit their ideas and protect their rights in the fields of science, technology and the arts.

<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a vast pool of capital is available in the United Kingdom to support new businesses and that the real problem for many entrepreneurs is not the availability of capital but access to it? Paragraph (2)(a) takes account of that, so, paragraph (2)(b) is superfluous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall attempt to get through this speech without making a (2)(b) or not (2)(b) joke. I can resist anything except temptation, as Oscar Wilde said.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right. There are many complex problems involved in bringing new products to market and with the venture capital industry. Whatever those problems, NESTA is not the answer. If NESTA is the answer, we are asking the wrong question. The clause appears to create a Christmas tree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth R. Thomas:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman review his comment that NESTA is not the answer? William Waldegrave, the former Cabinet Minister, who I assume the hon. Gentleman still supports, in an article in The Daily Telegraph of 23 March described NESTA as welcome, imaginative and wise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is educating himself by reading not merely The Daily Telegraph but William Waldegrave's articles in it, because he will certainly learn a lot from them. If he had been listening more carefully, he would know that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I issued a general welcome to NESTA. We seek to improve it by the amendment, by removing an element that will damage it and may bring it into disrepute.
[Mr. Green]
<P>
As I was saying, the clause provides a Christmas tree. Everyone agrees that broadly speaking NESTA is a good idea everyone is in favour of supporting struggling young artists, or scientists and technologists who cannot get their products to market but various good ideas have been lumped together in the fund in a rather unhappy way. In particular, NESTA will fall down in trying to act as a quasi-venture capital fund to enable inventors to use the traditional term to bridge the gap between producing good ideas and commercial products. It is well known that this country has had problems in that area. Indeed, the contrast is often made between our failure in that area and the relative success of the United States. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I were part of a culture Select Committee visit to the west coast of America [Hon. Members: "Oh."] I feel the politics of envy rising from both sides of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southport was also on the visit. We learned the reasons why the venture capital industry in the United States is more successful, particularly in the area discussed in subsection (2)(b) in the areas of science and technology, especially in information technology.
<P>
Nothing coming out of NESTA will begin to address the problems that the American venture capital industry thinks that it has solved. It would strain you patience, Mr. Gale, if I went into detail. However, two particular examples include a much larger home market and a greater level of wealth, particularly of individual wealth, and a tax system that encourages people to use that individual wealth in certain ways. If the Government are serious about tackling the problem of venture capital for high-tech industries, there are many things that can be done and were done under the previous Government. NESTA is not the answer to that particular problem.
<P>
A further problem is connected with the issue. The clause that we seek to delete refers to science, technology and the arts as though the same problem exists in all fields. The Government have two slightly romantic ideas, both of which are rather out of date. One is of a starving artist in his garret, producing great work, but unable to bring that work to the public and living a miserable life a "La Boh\geme" view of artistic life in Britain today. The second is of the nutty professor in a laboratory, again coming up with many good ideas that, somehow, never make it on to the market. Both of those caricatures are untrue. Even if either of them were true, the setting up of one fund that tries to deal with both is bound to misfire. It will be too broad brush an approach.
<P>
Of those caricatures, the one that has no validity is that of the individual inventor. Sadly, for those of uswho wish to romanticise science and scientists to try to make them interesting and to involve more people in that field, the vast majority of scientific breakthroughs are made by collaborative teams. It is not a matter of rigging up some equipment in a garage and making a breakthrough. To that extent, the heroic age of science has no past, which is regrettable. Most breakthroughs are collaborative efforts, require a large amount of capital and are done under the aegis of relatively large companies. The idea that public money should be pumped in that direction to solve the problems seems peculiar. I am not sure what the Minister seeks to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the most successful venture capital funds are those that specialise in certain areas and often employ a significant number of highly trained specialist engineers, as well as more traditional bankers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right and illustrates my point about boundaries. There are already private-sector bodies working in that area, trying to solve the problem. Either NESTA will try to compete with them, in which case it will fail the Minister is shaking his head, so I am pleased about that or it will try to seek out new forms of science that it can help and which the venture capital industry does not want to help. Venture capitalists differ in the fact that they are putting up their own or their shareholders' money, rather than public money. That is why they are better at picking winners than Governments.
<P>
There is a long and sad history in this country of Governments thinking that they know better than the market and stepping in. Our history over the past 40 years is littered, not with products that have proved themselves to be commercial successes, but with white elephants that should never have been brought to the market and have proved to be a huge drain on the public purse. One of the great fears about NESTA, as it is constituted without the amendment to this clause 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon Members may leave their papers in the Committee Room if they wish to do so the Room will be locked.
<P>
It may be for the convenience of the Government and Opposition business managers if I indicate now that the Officers of the House and I are at the service of the Committee tonight until whatever hour they choose. However, it will be my intention to adjourn the Committee between 7 pm and 8.30 pm for dinner.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
