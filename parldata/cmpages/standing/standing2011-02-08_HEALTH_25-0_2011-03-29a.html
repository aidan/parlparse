Hood. In the press this morning we have again seen reports that there
will be significant changes to the Bill. A senior adviser is quoted as
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
report stage of the Health and Social Care Bill has now been delayed

reached on reforming the
reforms.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000424">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
article goes on to say that the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives
are having a bit of battle about who will bring forward the reforms.
One quote
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Will
the Minister be making a statement on the Government’s proposes
reforms of the Bill? If he cannot make it today, perhaps he will make
it towards the end of the Committee to give us some

                        <p class="tabbed">In some areas,
although in many ways not enough, there are good integrated
arrangements between councils and primary care trusts. As drafted, the
clause makes no reference to the existing legal arrangements between
councils and PCTs that have integrated council and PCT functions.
Herefordshire and Blackburn provide good examples of such integration.
On 23 March, Blackburn with Darwen borough council was named council of
the year by the <em>Local Government Chronicle</em>, and one of the
reasons cited for the award was its joint working arrangements on
health. Another example is North East Lincolnshire council. Those two
councils have moved towards full integration between local authority
and PCT functions. They have taken advantage of the fact that many PCTs
and local government organisations have coterminous boundaries, which
is not the case under the Government’s new
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such
integration of social care has been done with the full agreement and
full support of the Department of Health. Councils have done such
things as integrate research, human resources, finance and management.
In Herefordshire there is full integration between the PCT and the
local authority with a joint chief executive and backroom
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a further, lower tier of local authorities— 15 or 20
councils—which, although they have not gone as far as
Lincolnshire, Herefordshire and Blackburn, have gone some way down the
same path. One of them is my local authority of Islington. I have
spoken to members of staff at Islington, and they say that they might
be sitting next to someone and have no idea whether that person is
employed by the primary care trust or by the local authority. All they
know is that they are working together for the good of the people of
Islington.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
concern is that the Bill is driving a coach and horses through the
attempts that local authorities and PCTs have made to develop properly
integrated social care and care services for the people they serve.
Whether or not there is truth to the rumours that the Bill will be
taken apart root and branch by the Government, in the interim people
have to operate on the assumption that the Bill will be enacted in its
current form. As a result, the clustering of PCTs is being encouraged
by the Department of Health. The difficulty is that if there is a
clustering of PCTs, how can a PCT, or such staff as are left in a PCT,
continue to work alongside the local authority? Many of the
arrangements that have been made have been made on the basis that there
will be joint management structures between PCTs and local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000044">&#160;</a>

signals are coming from the Department of Health. My hon. Friend the
Member for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell) asked Sir David Nicholson
about this in the Public Accounts Committee and was assured that there
would not be disruption, but, frankly, there is. I assure the Minister
that Blackburn with Darwen borough council feels strongly about it. I
will not necessarily read what it has said, but the council expresses
its view in strong language. The council is not alone—it is
supported by many other local authorities. It feels that it is

many ways, the experience of councils such as Blackburn with Darwen is
a lesson for us all. When the Opposition are considering how we would,
in a few years time, put back together the damage that this Government
has caused, we need to bear in mind such local authorities. When local
authorities have taken the initiative and are at the forefront of
initiatives that are promoted by politicians, we do not think that it
is right that they should suffer as a result of their bravery, their
boldness and their vision.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000047">&#160;</a>

Wow—their braveness, their boldness and their vision. That is
all well and good, but under the previous Administration there was an
absence of that in too many places, because the Government lacked that
boldness, that vision and that desire to see it happen in practice.
That is why the hon. Lady is able to refer to only a very small number
of places where what she describes actually happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
the concern that Blackburn with Darwen borough council has expressed,
and officials and I will certainly consider the points that she has
made on its behalf. In reality, where care trust arrangements already
exist we are anxious—indeed, it is the intention behind the
clause—to ensure that they can continue, but they need to be set
in the context of the overall reforms that the Bill puts in place. What
does that mean? It means that a care trust must choose whether to be a
commissioning organisation, which brings together health and social
care and commissions those activities that it decides should be covered
by the care trust; or a provider care trust that provides services to
its community across health and social care. That is very clear and
straightforward. The PCT clusters are working through that process in
the relevant areas with their colleagues in local authorities and in
the emerging GP commissioning consortia, so the picture that the hon.
Lady tries to paint is not entirely borne out by the process and the
work that is taking place on the ground.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I agree entirely with the hon.
Lady’s observation that such collaborative arrangements are most
successful when the working relationships on the ground are effective,
and her reference to the fact that colleagues working alongside each
other on health and social care in Islington would not immediately know
whence they had come shows the change of behaviour and culture that we
seek to engender through our reforms. She suggests that it is not
possible for such things to happen at the moment, because of the
“uncertainty”, but let us look at the evidence for that.
The royal borough of Kingston upon Thames, for example, where progress
is being made on a number of fronts towards a more integrated approach
to provision and commissioning, has recently agreed with its PCT
cluster the delegation of public health functions to the local
authority. That has taken place ahead of the introduction of the Bill,
which will give local authorities those responsibilities. It is a
far-sighted approach, which commends itself to other areas, to enable a
smooth transition of those responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that individual local authorities may encounter some problems on the
ground. The Government are determined to ensure that such concerns are
examined and properly dealt with, but the clause addresses the hon.
Lady’s concern about the need for continuity and

social workers do and what social work is about. It is insufficient for
the Bill to state that social work is simply what social workers do. At
a time when social workers feel undervalued and somewhat besieged, it
is incumbent upon us and the Department of Health to give them support
and such assistance as is necessary. It is in that spirit that
amendment 472 is intended to define social work. The definition comes
from the British Association of Social Workers, which has established a
college of social work. I understand that that college is one of two
social work colleges, but that is a long tale, which I will not go into
today. The definition was developed internationally: it was adopted by
the International Federation of Social Workers at its general meeting
in July 2000 and approved by the United
Nations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000080">&#160;</a>

473 is another attempt to clarify. Having defined social work, it is

                           </strong> As the hon. Lady says, the amendment is inspired
by the BASW, and it is intended to provide a definition and to set out
the functions of social work. First, let me make it clear that the
Government value the important job that social workers undertake. The
definitions proposed in the amendments articulate the high aspirations
that the social work profession rightly has; however, they do not have
the necessary precision and detail required of legal
definitions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me explain our concerns. To ensure that the Health Professions
Council—the name of which we propose to change and the Committee
will debate later—has the necessary powers to undertake its
functions effectively, the definition that we use in clause 193 must
reflect what social workers actually do, not what they may aspire to
achieve. The definition of social work in England that we have used,
which has been used for some time to establish the scope of powers and
functions relating to the regulation of social workers in England,
meets those criteria. It links social work to the practice of social
work in England that is required in connection with health, education
or social services provided in England. There is no definition of the
functions of social workers in England in the Bill apart from the
provision
that<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“‘the

                        </p>
                        <p>That
is a deliberate choice to apply a consistent approach to regulation
across a range of professions. At the moment, there is no detailed
definition of the functions and so on associated with the title of
doctor or other health professions that are regulated by other health
profession
regulators.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000084">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My point is that we are not providing in the Bill
a detailed list of the sort that the hon. Lady proposes on behalf of
BASW and social workers. We are not going down that route because that
list is aspirational. Also, in having a long list, there is a danger
that anything omitted is excluded from the role of social work. To take
the point one step further, by including a list as long as she proposes
and protecting the title of social worker by assigning it to those who
perform that list of functions and tasks, there would then be a
question whether practitioners in the police force or mental health
services who discharge some of the same duties could continue to do so.
That why we are reluctant to go down the route the hon. Lady proposes
and why, when the House has examined other areas of professional
regulation, it has not sought to put detailed definitions and functions
of professional groups into
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000086">&#160;</a>

under later amendments and new clauses, so I will not go into more
detail now, other than to flag up that that is exactly the point.
Social workers need to have an idea of what professional skills are
recognised as theirs in particular, and some acknowledgment of that.

receive some inspiration shortly and put that on the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000087">&#160;</a>

work, we have the report of the social work taskforce, and the social
work reform board is progressing work on a range of aspects of the role
and contribution of social workers. We also intend later this year to
publish a White Paper on the reform of social care. We expect a number
of the issues that are of concern to BASW and other social workers,
including the recognition of the valuable work they do and the status
they should have, to be addressed in those documents. Having a detailed
and elaborate list of specified functions has consequences that I am
sure were not intended by the hon. Lady and so I urge her to withdraw

the Bill for a chief social worker for England. The devolved nations of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a chief social worker, so why
is there not one in England? The Conservatives recently made a
commitment to extending that role to England in a document by the
Conservative party commission on social workers, “Response to
Lord Laming’s Inquiry”. That was published in February
2009, so what is in the Bill may be a broken promise. That
long-standing commitment by the Conservative party was not only
mentioned in 2009: “No More Blame Game”, published in
October 2007, also by the Conservative party commission on social
workers, stated on page 11:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000099">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 6
is about a college of social work. As the Minister knows, I am sure,
there is a lack of clarity about where the main college of social work
rests, and the new clause attempts to rectify that. The social work
taskforce recommended the establishment of a college of social work to
raise the standing and status of the profession. BASW originally
promoted the idea of a college of social work, and the taskforce and a
referendum of its members in April 2010 confirmed that social workers
require a powerful body to advance their profession. If there is no
statutory duty on the Government, local government, regulators and
others to consult the college, it will have no power. On the other
hand, the college of social work will need to demonstrate its
continuing credibility by obtaining and retaining 51% of all social
workers in membership.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 15
is about care standards, and it brings us back to the debate we began a
few minutes ago about what the role of social workers is, who should be
doing it, and how we define it. There is grave concern among social
workers that their very profession is being undermined by current
trends. Protection of the title of social worker, as established by the
Care Standards Act 2000, was an important measure to ensure that those
who had job titles that include “social worker” are
registered and regulated. There are however, myriad job titles in place
and under development that relabel work done with the most needy and
vulnerable people when such people are at the most needy and vulnerable
times in their lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The concern
is that the regulation of the role of social worker is being bypassed
by people simply giving themselves another name, and so not needing to
be regulated or to adhere to the high professional standards that are
required of social workers. In any circumstances, that would be wrong,
but given the kind of job social workers have and the trust that we
give them, as well as the fact that they have to work with the most
vulnerable, it is very worrying. The new clause seeks to correct that
trend. The argument of far too many employers is that if someone is not
described as a social worker, they do not need to register, which,
therefore, denies the public the protection that Parliament has decided
is required. What is the point of regulating and reforming the function
of social work if people can flagrantly get round the measures by
simply calling themselves something else? I am interested to hear what
the Minister has to say about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 18 is about the first year of a newly qualified social worker
being assessed and supported. Again, the concern, which I certainly
found in my previous profession, is that qualifying is all very well,
but a person needs a certain amount of time to practise and be given
assistance by others more experienced, to ensure that they develop
necessary the level of professionalism. At the Bar, we certainly needed
our year’s pupillage, and I am sure that those in many other
professions also benefit from a year spent newly qualified and
practising but being looked after by others. In social work, the last
thing we want is someone inexperienced making mistakes, because the
result could be catastrophic.

                           </div>Given the high turnover of social workers, it is important that newly

                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would set up intermediate, provisional registration for
newly qualified social workers, so that someone would a social worker
but on a “provisional licence”, if I can put it that way.
Newly qualified social workers would complete an assessed and supported
year in employment, during which they would have a smaller case load
and more experienced social workers would look after them. That would
leave them time to develop skills and receive further training when
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000105">&#160;</a>

assessed year in employment for new social workers was a recommendation
of the social work taskforce in 2009—the Minister will be able
to find it on page 6, paragraph 4 of the report. I have a spare copy
for him if he does not have one by his bedside. The recommendations
need to be addressed, but unfortunately they have perhaps been
overlooked. They are not addressed in the Bill and the new clause
offers an opportunity to put that right. I urge the Committee to agree
to accept new clause 18 so that we have provisional social workers who
are given the support and training they
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000106">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In Northern
Ireland, we need legislation similar to that for Scotland, and I want
to explain why. Health professional regulation is currently a devolved
matter in Northern Ireland, and a partly devolved matter in Scotland.
Any profession regulated after 1999 is within the Scottish
Parliament’s competence—for example, dental assistants
and pharmacy technicians. The Health Act 1999 created new powers for
the Secretary of State for Health in Westminster to make changes to
health professional regulation by means of secondary
legislation—section 60 orders. Respecting devolution
in Scotland, any such orders for new professions must be accepted and
approved by resolution of the Scottish Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We now have a
provision for the Scottish Parliament in relation to matters that come
from Westminster, but we do not have that in place for Northern
Ireland. The reasoning for that is quite simple: it seems that the
Northern Ireland Assembly was in suspension. I am glad that things have
moved on since then, and that we now have an Assembly that works
continuously, and involves all the devolved parties. However, the
provision fully to devolve health professional regulation was not made.
The new clause would give the opportunity for that to
happen—indeed, it would correct that very mistake. It is not a
controversial issue; it brings the law in Northern Ireland into line
with what happens in
Scotland.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
what way would the new clause be beneficial? Devolution of health
professional regulation does not necessarily mean taking different
approaches to regulation across the UK. However, it does mean that the
opinions of Scotland and Northern Ireland should be guaranteed in the
process of developing regulation where it has major impacts on the
health services, patients and professionals in those countries. For
example, revalidation and the Medicines (Pharmacies) (Responsible
Pharmacist) Regulations
2008.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
the Secretary of State can institute large-scale changes to health
professional regulation without statutory reference to the Northern
Ireland Assembly. That is what happens at the moment. It does not
happen for Scotland, but the provision is not there for Northern
Ireland. The new clause would have the benefit of guaranteeing the
voice and opinion of Northern Ireland Assembly Members on a level equal
to MSPs. Alternatively, in the words of the BMA for Northern Ireland,
it would ensure all health professional regulation is
devolution-proofed:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
amendment brings Northern Ireland into line with the status of
Scotland. This seems eminently sensible, given that medical regulation
is a fully devolved issue to the Northern Ireland Assembly.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000431">&#160;</a>

this is the third part of the so-called Presbyterian

presented to the Scottish Parliament Scotland Bill Committee suggests
not. It has been done through the Scottish Parliament without any
difficulties. Committee members there have recently been investigating
the operation of section 60 order approvals in that legislation since
1999, and have taken evidence from many stakeholders. Duncan Rudkin,
chief executive of the General Pharmaceutical Council for Great
Britain,
remarked:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000120">&#160;</a>

experience so far is that, in our set-up phase during 2010, the section
60 order under the Health Act 1999 that created the General
Pharmaceutical Council and set our framework, and the subsequent
subsidiary instruments that needed parliamentary approval in
Westminster and the Scottish Parliament, were handled efficiently and
did not cause us any practical problems. We are perfectly content to
work within the current system.”—[<em>Scottish Parliament

devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament ensures that the
Scottish Government has a formal and robust position in the
inter-Governmental negotiations. It also ensures that the final result
is satisfactory to the democratic representatives of the Scottish
people…Devolved regulation has clear benefits for Scotland,
enabling regulation to be tailored to the needs and circumstances of
the Scottish health service. It also ensures that Scotland has a voice

new clause corrects a mistake, or perhaps an oversight, in the Health
Act 1999, and I believe it is entirely within the spirit and purpose of
devolution, helping to ensure that health professional regulation is
fit for purpose across the whole United Kingdom. We in Northern Ireland
are very proud to be part of the United Kingdom. The amendment
guarantees the Northern Ireland Assembly a formal say in all major
changes to health professional regulations that impact upon the
Northern Ireland health service, patients, and

the issues that have been brought to the Committee’s attention

clauses. I will be straightforward with the Committee: the Government
understand and are sympathetic towards the intentions behind the new
clauses. However, the exception is the measures around section 60
orders, which we will come to in the context of the new clauses of both
the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury and the hon. Member
for
Strangford.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000124">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government propose to give further consideration to the role of a chief
social worker, which the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury
raised on behalf of BASW and other social workers. I must say that I
have not avidly read all the documents that the hon. Lady listed in her
opening remarks, but they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1124<a class="bkMark" name="Column1124">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are also
clear that a college of social work can and should and will, in future,
play a critical role. For too long, the voice of social work has not
had such a powerful representative body, and, for perhaps too long,
there has been an expectation that the General Social Care Council
would somehow fulfil that role on the behalf of the profession. That
was always a misguided understanding of the role of that body, but now,
by having a social work college, we can begin to see that being put
right. That is something that the Government are putting their full
weight and support
behind.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000126">&#160;</a>

regard to the chief social worker and the further development of the
status of the college, it is our intention to address in greater detail
the Government’s policy and agenda for legislation in the next
Session in the White Paper that we intend to publish later this year.
The reason for that is quite simply that the Law Commission will
shortly publish its report on social care law reform, and it seems that
the opportunity to look at all aspects of social care law and the role
of social workers is not in the Bill, which has a primary focus on
health
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000127">&#160;</a>

levels. First, the Bill, as its name implies, is a health and social
care Bill. I appreciate that there is little social care in it, but
health and social care must always go hand in hand. Secondly, the role
of social workers is not just in social care and health. Social workers
also work in crime and other areas, so it will always be difficult,
when looking at legislation, to know where reform of the social work
profession sits neatly. It strikes me that this is as good a place as
anywhere

remarks were intended to reassure her about the direction of travel
that the Government are taking, which involves seeing the value of the
office of the chief social worker and backing the development of a
college of social work with hard cash. That work is proceeding, and I
am merely suggesting an orderly way to do it that will result in the
best possible outcome for social workers and
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 5 would create the office of the chief social worker. There is
already a significant programme of work, as I have described, to
address issues around how we can reform and strengthen the social work
profession. In particular, Professor Eileen Munro has been charged with
reviewing the child protection system in England, and, as part of her
review, she has been asked to consider the merits of there being a
chief social worker in England. To be clear, that post would cover not
only children’s services, but all social workers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000130">&#160;</a>

we are currently considering the wider framework for adult social care.
We would certainly not rule out the possibility of creating an office
of the chief social worker in the future. If the findings of these
reviews indicate that the creation of such an office should be part of
the reform of the social care system, we will need to give careful
consideration as to how the office would be established, what duties
and powers the office holder should be given, the costs and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000131">&#160;</a>

out requiring specific bodies or organisations to consult with and
respond to the advice provided by the college of social work, once it
has been properly established. But as the hon. Lady has alluded to on a

specific duties in the Bill as suggested by the hon. Lady. She asked me
about definitions earlier, and let me say one other thing about that. I
was hoping to convey the fact that we do not disagree with BASW about
the definition it has come up with in concert with others. While those
definitions set out in amendments 472 and 473 are good, they are not
suitable for the legal purpose of that part of the Bill. That was why

clause 15 seeks to protect the functions as well as the title of social
work. I have touched on this a bit already. We have covered the issue
of protecting functions in legislation and the unintended consequences
of doing that. Indeed, in regulating social workers in England, we need
to ensure that the legislation is flexible enough to enable the
regulation of all activities that a social worker may undertake.
Indeed, the whole issue of protection of title is the approach that
successive Governments have generally taken to the regulation of
individuals in both the health and social care sectors. It has ensured
that the regulation of professionals can readily adapt to changing
roles over time.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000138">&#160;</a>

point, the Bill amends section 61 of the Care Standards Act 2000 so
that an offence under that section applies only to a person in Wales.
The protection of title for social workers in England is provided for
in article 39 of the Health Professions Order 2001. So it makes little
sense for the new clause to be inserted into section 61, as it would
apply only to Wales. From a technical point of view, it probably does
not do what the hon. Lady intended.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000139">&#160;</a>

the work that the social work taskforce has done is critical to the
future of social work. We support it. We continue to work with the
board and very much support its work. So new clause 18 would enable the
introduction of provisional registration for newly qualified social
workers under section 60 of the 1999 Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000140">&#160;</a>

make such a case if it thinks it appropriate. If regulatory changes are
necessary, however, section 60 of the 1999 Act, as amended by clause

want to address his points. The new clause would require an order made
under section 60 of the 1999 Act to be laid before and approved by the
Northern Ireland Assembly where the order includes provision on
devolved matters. Legislative competence on the regulation of health
professionals and other health care workers is fully devolved to
Northern Ireland, so the Northern Ireland Assembly is free to legislate
on such matters through an Act of the Northern Ireland Assembly, should
it wish to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000142">&#160;</a>

how devolution works. In the coalition agreement, however, the
Government set out their intention to implement the recommendations of
the Calman commission on Scottish devolution. We are seeking, through
the Scotland Bill, to make the regulation of all health professions a
matter reserved for the Westminster Parliament. We oppose the amendment
because it would introduce an unnecessary delay to a system that needs
to be responsive and flexible in dealing with emerging risks to public
protection and because it would create a situation similar to the one

                           </strong> I want to raise a number of concerns about
this clause. Concerns have been expressed in the social work sector
that moving social work regulation to the Health Professions
Council—soon, perhaps, to be called the Health and Care
Professions Council, although we will discuss that later—which
has no experience of social work or social care, risks damaging the
distinct role of social work and losing it in an organisation that is
dominated by other professions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
considerable amount of debate has taken place in the sector about that,
and the Minister may be aware of an article from <em>Community Care
</em>on 3 August 2010, in which a number of people were interviewed
about the matter. One of those was Des Kelly, the executive director of
the national care forum, who
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“There
is a real risk that merging improvement bodies will lose the
distinctive contribution of social care. Social care provision,
although still largely a publicly-funded service, is different from the
NHS, with more than 40,000 employers and with even greater diversity as
personalisation develops new services and
employers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000435">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>David
N. Jones, who was an Ofsted inspector from 2007 to 2010, and who was
general secretary of the British Association of Social Workers, said in
the
article:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Some
social workers are in healthcare settings, others are in, say, criminal
justice and children’s services, so there has to be a huge
change in the healthcare body to engage with the whole
spectrum.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000436">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed,
I have made that point in relation to an earlier clause. Although some
social workers work within the social care spectrum, not all of them
do. The expertise that it is necessary to develop as a social worker
means that people sometimes work in criminal justice or sometimes work
in children’s services, each of which has a distinct ethos and
is an important part of the profession; it is recognised that social
workers are engaged in a whole spectrum of work. Huge change is
required in the health care body if it is to engage with that
spectrum.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
article from <em>Community Care, </em>Mr Jones
continued:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Social
work is crucial to supporting health and education but, because social
work is a small profession, has fewer people involved and only deals
with some of the most difficult cases that come before universal
services, there’s a risk that it becomes dominated by other
professions.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000437">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Social
workers are concerned that they will be swallowed up by the Health
Professions Council and that other professions will dominate the body.
At a time when we should be building on the professionalism of social
workers and increasingly recognising them, the arguments made by the
profession are valid and they deserve some clear answers from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister also explain the benefits of abolishing the General Social
Care Council and transferring social workers to the Health Professions
Council? What criticisms 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1129<a class="bkMark" name="Column1129">&#160;</a>
                           </div>does the Minister have of the General Social Care Council? In what way
was it not fulfilling its role properly, and why does he expect the
Health Professions Council to do a better job? Does he agree that there
is a real risk of resources being wasted in rearranging those
structures? There is concern about the future of social care reform. As
the Minister knows, the Social Work Reform Board has been tasked with
putting in place recommendations made by the social care taskforce, and
it is in the process of doing that. However, the reorganisation caused
by the legislation could prevent the recommendations from being put
into place as quickly as they should be. The concern, therefore, is
that the legislation could get in the
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
a letter to Ministers in the Department for Education and in the
Department of Health, as well as to the Minister for Universities and
Science, members of the Social Work Reform Board expressed their
disappointment at the decision of the review of arm’s length
bodies. The chair of the reform board, Moira Gibb,
wrote:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“While
we note the rationale for such a change we were disappointed that the
contribution GSCC has recently been making to our work was not
recognised. We would advocate for the GSCC changes to be timed to
maximise their contribution to the speedy delivery of the Task
Force’s recommendations. In particular the GSCC has been working
to deliver the Task Force recommendation on more transparent and
effective regulation of social work education, to assure greater
consistency and quality. It would be unhelpful to lose this improvement
because organisational change is required.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000438">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The concerns that have
been raised about this part of the clause are legitimate and we need a
detailed answer, because there are worries about where the change will
take us.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Concerns have
also been expressed about fees. Previously, social workers had paid a
fee of £30 to the GSCC for registration, but they are now being
asked to pay £76 to the Health Professions Council. Social
workers joining the college of social workers will also be asked to pay
a fee. Comparisons have been made with teachers, because their annual
registration fee will rise to £36, and for permanent teachers in
the state sector, that cost is usually met by the employer. Has the
Minister considered how those higher costs to a profession that is
hardly the most highly paid can be phased in?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another area
of concern is students. The GSCC currently registers students on a
voluntary basis, and student registration is at very high
levels—around 95%. The GSCC argues that students should continue
to be registered as they are now. Moving away from registration at this
time would give the wrong message to people aspiring to become social
workers and to the public, whose trust and confidence in social work
requires development. The point that is being made seems sensible, and
we urge the Minister to provide a considered answer. The Health
Professions Council does not currently register students, suggesting
that there is insufficient evidence to say that it is necessary to
protect the public. Simply, we respectfully disagree with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Registering
students is an important part of the GSCC’s remit, because
social work students, within weeks of beginning a course, can be placed
in front-line teams with access to vulnerable children and adults. As a
representative of an inner London constituency, I do 

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1130<a class="bkMark" name="Column1130">&#160;</a>
                           </div>not think that I should overestimate the importance of that point. The
Minister represents a London constituency, too, and he knows that
social work departments are under considerable strain. Far too often,
students are given too much responsibility, too early. The idea that
they will not even be registered is a cause of legitimate concern. Will
social work students continue to be regulated, and if so,
how?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000171">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making those
points. It is useful to put such issues on the record. I have discussed
them with many people in the field of social work and social care over
the last nine or 10 months, as I have worked with colleagues on the
oversight groups that are dealing with the transition from the General
Social Care Council to the new Health and Care Professions Council,
which will take on social work in the future. I have also met Moira
Gibb and her colleagues on the Social Work Reform Board.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Public
confidence in health and social care professionals is underpinned by a
system of regulation, which ensures high-quality education and
training, controls entry into the profession and enforces codes of
conduct and ethics, which help to foster, develop and sustain
professional values and individual accountability. Currently, social
workers in England are regulated by the General Social Care Council,
which is an arm’s length body subsidised by and answerable to
Government and, as far as discipline is concerned, it is limited to
looking at individual conduct when concerns are raised about
someone’s suitability to continue to undertake social work. That
model contrasts with the one adopted by health regulators, which are
self-funded and answerable to Parliament through the Privy Council.
They operate full fitness-to-practise systems that enable them to
consider an individual’s conduct and competence in the
round.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">An
independent review by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence
of the conduct functions of the General Social Care Council in 2009
recommended that the regulation of social workers in England follow the
model of health regulators. The previous Government accepted those
recommendations. We considered these issues when looking at the GSCC as
part of the Department of Health’s review of arm’s length
bodies. In “Liberating the NHS: Report of the arms-length bodies
review”, we concluded that the regulation of social workers in
England should be transferred to the Health Professions Council, which
is an existing health regulatory body, and that the GSCC should be
abolished. To reflect the HPC’s new remit across social care,
the Bill will rename it the Health and Care Professions
Council—we will come back to the name a little
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause makes provision to abolish the GSCC. Before coming to a view on
abolition, we looked at all the options for making the GSCC independent
of Government, as per the recommendation of the CHRE. Figures provided
by the GSCC at the time suggested that to become fully self-funded, it
would need to raise the fees of registered social workers in England to
between £250 and £300 a year. In the same way that the
hon. Lady is concerned about the costs of registering with the HPC, we
believed that it would be unrealistic to expect individual social
workers in England to meet those costs. By contrast, the HPC charges
its registrants 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1131<a class="bkMark" name="Column1131">&#160;</a>
                           </div>an annual fee of £76. It is an experienced and effective
regulator of 15 health professions, including some, such as
occupational therapists, who work across health and social care. It
operates a well- established fitness-to-practise system and has
experience of taking on the regulation of new groups of professionals,
the latest being psychologists in
2009.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000175">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about transition, and I shall be brief in responding to
her concerns. As part of the transition work, we established a social
work regulation oversight group. Its role is to advise the Government
on planned, cost-effective action to transfer the regulation of social
workers to the HPC. The group provides assurance on the work to
maintain the safety and well-being of children and vulnerable adults
through a smooth transfer of statutory functions, and it provides
support to the programme. It includes Moira Gibb, chair of the Social
Work Reform Board, and senior members of the GSCC, the HPC and the
Department of Health and the Department for Education, and it is
chaired by the chief executive of the CHRE. It has made good progress
in addressing the issues of transfer, and it has enabled us to be
confident that the transfer will progress successfully.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked about the HPC’s knowledge and expertise of social
work. The HPC has long experience of working with a range of
professions and developing its knowledge and skills as necessary to be
an effective regulator. Its standards of proficiency for professions
are developed by a professional liaison group, which includes
representatives of the professions, employers and educators. In
addition, to ensure that it has good professional input into what it
does, it uses contracted partners to provide the expertise it needs for
its decision making. Partners will take on roles including assessing
continuing professional development and sitting on fitness-to-practise
panels. That goes some way to addressing the
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
ensure that there will be no gap in the assurance of the standards of
social work students, we intend to provide for the transfer of the
voluntary register of social work students to the Health and Care
Professions Council, pending full consideration of the best approach to
assuring the safety and standards of student social workers. In other
words, we have a voluntary arrangement in the GSCC and we intend to
transfer that lock, stock and barrel to the HCPC in future. The HPC
wrote to me following a meeting I had with it last week, and it
committed to undertake a review of the risks in relation to students of
all the professions that it regulates, including student social
workers. That process will result in it setting out the risks and
issues relating to social work
students.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
HPC has assured me that it will continue to make every effort to
maintain current close working relationships with the field and to
ensure that social work expertise and evidence inform all decisions.
With those assurances I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that the
clause should stand part of the

                           <strong> </strong>This is about the name. Although on the
face of it, it seems a superficial concern, it has caused a great deal
of anger among social workers. The General Social Care Council will be
abolished. It regulates social workers, who will be brought under the
wing of the Health Professions Council which may or may not change its
name to acknowledge that and other changes. Social workers are not
happy with the new name. They would like to know what other care
professionals it is envisaged the Government will regulate.
Registration will be looked after by the Health and Care Professions
Council, if that is what its name will be, but it will be voluntary and
very light touch, which we think is
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
one non-health body that emphatically will be regulated by the new body
consists of social workers. Why can its name not reflect that fact?
There is a great deal of anger about this and words such as
“insult” have been used to describe the
Government’s proposal. Perhaps I can give the Minister a taste
of how strongly social workers feel about this by reading a couple of
lines from my briefing note, which says that<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“changing its
title to the Health and Care Professions Council is absurd because it
will have no ‘care professions’ under its control and
disgraceful because it doesn’t even mention the profession whose

regulates.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000443">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is how strongly the profession feels about this. The amendment attempts
to change the name so that it properly reflects the outstanding
professionals who will be part of this body and need to be regulated by
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000189">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am always cautious when words like
“anger” are used when an amendment is moved. I can well
understand that there is feeling and concern but it is almost too
strong to suggest that there is anger about the name when what we
should focus on is its purpose. The purpose is very clear and it is one
that we share: it is to make sure that we have the most effective set
of arrangements as possible for the regulation of professional
standards and the setting of educational standards to protect the
interests of the public. Had the concern been as substantial as is now
suggested perhaps in the 10 years since the introduction of the Care
Standards Act 2000, some consideration might have been given to

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is curious to suggest that the name should be such a touchstone, as the
reality should be how we ensure that the measure delivers what the
profession needs, which is certainty, consistency and greater status
and standing. However, the issue of the name is not unimportant, and
over the past few months I have spent many meetings discussing those
concerns. The name of the new organisation has been a matter of
considerable debate, and we have made it absolutely clear that the name
of the Health Professions Council will change to reflect its wider
remit across both health and social care. The Government sought advice
on a preferred new name from the social work regulation oversight group
to which I referred in an earlier debate, and which is there to advise
Ministers on the smooth transition. The oversight group proposed two
options: the “Care Professions Council”, which I suspect
falls foul of the concerns that the hon. Lady has just described, and
the “Health and Care Professions Council”. The
Government’s view was that the latter name would reflect the
functions of the council as a whole more
accurately.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Health Professions Council regulates 15 professions, each of which
makes important contributions to the well-being of people in England
and the wider UK. None of those professions are specially mentioned in
the name of the Health Professions Council, as it would not be right to
single out one profession and place it above all others. However, the
Health Professions Council has acknowledged that, given the increasing
breadth of professions that it will regulate, greater public clarity of
its role is needed. It has confirmed to me that its new name will be
supported by a very clear strap line, “Regulating health,
psychological and social work professions”. If the hon. Lady has
not been reassured by my comments, I urge my hon. Friends to vote
against this alternative name change and support the change proposed in
the clause. On that basis I hope the hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000192">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> While the clause deals with functions of the
council in relation to social work in England, perhaps of equal
importance is the fact that it deals with different care regulators and
their relationships across the UK. How will the Health and Care
Professionals Council co-operate with Northern Ireland, Wales and
Scotland?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
registration of social workers is a devolved matter in Scotland,
Northern Ireland and Wales, while registration in England is reserved
to Westminster. Consequently, each of the four countries has its own
registration council. However, it has been the policy of the four
Administrations that the councils should, as far as possible, align
their policies and practices so that there are no barriers to social
workers moving within the UK, and so that no public protection issues
arise with cross-border working. To that end, the registers of the four
care councils are stored on a single database, and data are shared as
appropriate and where necessary. As a result, social workers are able
to register and move easily throughout the four nations of
Britain.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
199 places a duty on the Health and Care Professions Council to
co-operate with the other care councils. The Bill also permits social
workers to register with care councils outside England in order to
practise elsewhere. Social workers can register outside England, but
they will be able to work here without re-registering in England. For
example, it will be possible to register in Scotland and work in
England without registering, as long as that is temporary. We need more
clarity, however, about how the arrangements will work in practice,
including a definition of “temporary” and the cost to
social workers of any transfer or additional
registration.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
should be noted that the regulatory models of the care councils in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland differ significantly from that
operated by the Health Professions Council, and the proposed model for
the Health and Care Professions Council. Under the proposed model,
social workers could be held to account based on an assessment of their
fitness to practise, including their professional competence. In the
rest of the UK, however, they may be held to account according to their
conduct, which could be different. As a result, there is a possibility
that social workers operating in different parts of the UK will be held
to account in different
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Different
fees could also be charged. It might be to the advantage of a social
worker to register in Wales and work in England because it would be
cheaper.

                           </strong> Let me deal first with the broad point about
there being a difference between the arrangements in England and in the
devolved Administrations. It is perhaps worth reflecting on the fact
that when the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence reported on
the performance of the General Social Care Council in 2009, one of its
recommendations was that we should move to full cost recovery with the
GSCC, while another was that we should move to a fitness-to-practise
regime of the sort already adopted by the Health Professions Council.
Both those recommendations were accepted by the previous Government.
They have also been accepted by this Government, and we are giving
effect to them through the Bill. The difference that the hon. Lady
describes would therefore have emerged as a result of the changes that
the previous Government were putting in place following their
acceptance of the
recommendations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked how the care councils will co-operate, and the clause
actually provides for issues around co-operation in the future. She
also asked about the definition of “temporary”, which I
shall explain. There are many reasons why a social work registrant in
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland may work in England on a short-term
basis. For example, they might work in England occasionally to carry
out urgent social work interventions when necessary. We do not want
inadvertently to create a situation in which a social worker registered
in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland would be committing an offence
when undertaking legitimate and necessary temporary work in England. It
is therefore not right to define “temporary” in the Bill,
as the hon. Lady
suggests.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked how we will ensure that the Health and Care
Professions Council will work with its colleagues in the care councils
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is important that that
takes place, so we have included in the Bill a new duty on the Health
and Care Professions Council to co-operate with the care councils in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We would expect them to work
together to ensure that issues around information sharing are properly
dealt with. The remit of the social work regulation oversight group,
which I described earlier, includes consideration of the four-country
aspect of social work regulation, and we would expect the group to
advise Ministers on the actions that it thinks are necessary to ensure
that the transfer is developed with regard to these crucial
relationships, which will be an important part of the work that will be
taken forward over the next period. With those reassurances, I hope
that the hon. Lady will feel able to support the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000230">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendments 647 and 648 deal with the same
concern. As Committee Members are presumably aware, given our debates
this morning, the Bill heralds a significant change for social workers
who are presently registered under the GSCC but will in future have to
register under the Health and Care Professions Council. The question is
about the right of appeal. The change is that the right of appeal will
be only to the High Court, rather than to the first-tier tribunal for
care standards. Such a detrimental change is causing great disquiet
among social workers because the permissible grounds for appeal will be
narrower and less responsive to the complexities of social work cases.
It will be more difficult to appeal, and pursuing an appeal will be
more expensive and risky.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
seems to have been drafted without a proper understanding of the real
nature of social work. Unlike other health professionals, social
workers often work with people who do not want to work with them. Such
people can be hostile and resistant to social workers’
interventions into their lives. They do not want to be seen with social
workers, and feel that social workers are doing things to them and
their family that they do not want. Social workers must therefore
exercise fine judgment in complex situations. There can be either
deliberate or real misunderstandings between social workers and those
whom they are attempting to look after.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To make life
even more difficult, there are well-established staff shortages,
excessive case loads, chaotic systems and widespread use of agency
staff in many social work departments. It is the experience of Unison
and many others that social workers frequently do not receive the
necessary supervision and support from their employer to be able to
practise safely and effectively. Given the cuts that are now taking
place as a result of this Government’s reckless behaviour
towards the economy, it appears that there will be even greater
pressure on social workers over the coming years, so things can only
get
worse—<em>[</em>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is great concern that the new system will reduce access to justice, as
parties have to instruct barristers and solicitors, which involves
higher costs, and social workers who pursue appeals run the risk of
having costs awarded against them. That will act as a deterrent to
social workers. The care standards tribunal has proved itself to be
accessible, efficient and cost-effective in ensuring fair outcomes for
social workers. Does not the Minister agree with that? What has he got
against the existing system? If he does not agree with it, will he
please give a full critique of the perceived problems? In the opinion
of many staff, the system is not broken and certainly does not need
fixing.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have a
couple of examples of first-tier tribunal decisions for the edification
of the Committee. They demonstrate decisions that could not have been
made by the High Court, and yet are just and fair decisions for the
social worker involved. Given that appeals to the High Court may be
brought only on very narrow points of law, or on a finding of fact, it
will be difficult in some circumstances for social workers to appeal at
all, leaving aside the cost, difficulty and, frankly, intimidation of
needing to go to the High Court. The existing first-tier tribunal on
care standards provides a valuable service. If I may cite my two
examples, I believe that I will persuade the Committee that the changes
are
unfair.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
tribunal accepted the factual basis of an incident in the case of
Forbes <em>v.</em> General Social Care Council, but it formed the view
that the sanction imposed was too severe. The tribunal was concerned by

the Appellant has learnt her lesson and that there is very little risk

                        <p>The
tribunal can step in to say that a penalty is too far and set aside an
appeal. Instead of a social worker losing their job, there are
alternative ways of dealing with circumstances in which they are
overworked, under-helped, undermanaged and given insufficient
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">May
I give the further example of LA <em>v.</em> General Social Care Council,
which is case 985.SW from 2007? The tribunal had to bear in mind the
professional environment in which the social worker was operating. The
department was chaotic, she had no detailed supervision and there was
no obvious benchmark against which she could self-assess. The tribunal
assumed that there was no appraisal scheme in place. The tribunal
decided that the case against Ms A’s good conduct was not made
out. On issues of competence, the tribunal arrived at a similar
conclusion in favour of Ms A. For instance, on failing to challenge a
medical opinion, the tribunal
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Casting

                        </p>
                        <p>On
other poor practices, the tribunal found that there was a lack

                        </p>
                        <p>Again,
Ms A’s appeal was allowed, and I am sure that the Committee will
agree that the result was just. However, such an appeal would not be
available if the tribunal was abolished, as under the Bill, and people
instead had to go to the High Court with representation from a
barrister and solicitors, and the attendant costs and difficulties
associated with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady rightly talks about the pressures faced by social workers.
Those pressures are not new; they have been well documented over many
years in this country. She is right to identify that social workers
often have to deal with people who do not wish to work with them, but
she would be wrong to imply that they are the only professionals who
find themselves in that situation, and I suspect that other
professional groups would find it odd if she did. The groups that come
immediately to mind as facing similar circumstances are probation
officers and mental health workers, who might well encounter such
difficulties from time to time. Although we should acknowledge the
special contribution that social workers make, we should not build a
whole argument, as I think the hon. Lady is trying to do, around their
being unique in every aspect, when clearly there are other professions
that have to confront similar
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000251">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Given what the Minister says, I would be
interested to know what the appeal process is for probation officers,
for example. Having gone through a first-instance hearing, do they have
to take any appeal to the High Court? Is it not the case that other
layers of appeal are available to probation officers? Part of my
argument is that social workers will have to proceed too quickly to the
High Court, which will involve attendant costs, time wasting and
intimidation. That is unnecessary if we can keep the first-tier
tribunal available.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000252">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me come to the hon. Lady’s central
argument, which is at the heart of these amendments. Amendment 647
would provide for all appeals against fitness-to-practise decisions
that are made by the Health and Care Professions Council, or certain of
its committees, in relation to social workers who are registered with
it to lie with the first-tier tribunal. Amendment 648 would make
changes to the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence’s
powers to refer final fitness-to-practise decisions of the regulatory
bodies that it oversees to the appropriate court, so decisions relating
to social workers in England would instead be referred to the
first-tier tribunal.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government oppose the amendments because we believe that a flawed
understanding lies behind their drafting. Amendment 647 would retain
the current position whereby all appeals for social workers would go to
the first-tier tribunal. Accepting the amendment would be contrary to
two recommendations of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory
Excellence’s independent review of the General Social Care
Council’s conduct processes, which was published in 2009. That
review recommended
that<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000254">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“the

                        <p class="hs_brev">“the GSCC and DH

                        <p>The hon. Lady describes
the change that I have just set out, which was recommended by the CHRE,
as detrimental, but that prompts the question of why Ministers in
the previous Labour Government accepted that recommendation.
I think that they did so for good reasons, and I want to explain what
those reasons are and why we intend to carry through that policy
intention in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Health and Care Professions Council’s fitness-to-practise appeal
process is, in fact, more flexible in its operation than the General
Social Care Council’s conduct appeal process. The Health and
Care Professions Council will internally review all appeals to
determine whether they should be defended in the High Court. It will
also have internal mechanisms to deal with review of suspension orders,
conditions on practice orders and striking off orders. The important
point to remember is that the Health and Care Professions Council,
unlike the General Social Care Council, will be able to give full
consideration to the range of social work practice in relation to both
conduct and competence. At the moment it can deal only with matters
relating to competence.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Health
and Care Professions Council will also not be limited to removing,
suspending or admonishing a social worker, as the General Social Care
Council currently is. Instead, the Health and Care Professions Council
will be able, when appropriate, to support social workers in England to
improve their practice, for example through the use of conditions on
registration. Under the Health and Care Professions Council’s
fitness-to-practise regime, social workers can therefore be confident
that their cases will be fully considered and that suitable sanction
can be imposed without a frequent recurrence of the need to go to
court.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The appeals
to the High Court need to be seen as part of the Health and Care
Professions Council’s overall fitness-to-practise system, which
will look at social workers’ conduct and competence in the
round, and include a wide range of sanctions of the sort that I have
described. In addition, the council has a number of internal systems to
resolve such concerns before any need to go before a court arises.
Indeed, in 2009-10, only five appeals were made to the High
Court—or the equivalent in the relevant UK country—by
registrants of the Health Professions Council following a
fitness-to-practise decision. The number of people going to court is
relatively small as a result of the process that the Health Professions
Council has in place, which was recommended by the CHRE.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Taken as a
whole, we accept that the costs of a small number of social workers who
appeal to the High Court will increase as a result of the new appeals
process. At the same time, however, the cost of appeals for other
social workers is likely to decrease. In making this change, it is
clear to us that the Health and Care Professions Council processes
offer many more advantages than those that are under the General Social
Care Council. For those reasons, we do not accept amendment
647.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
turn to amendment 648. If the Committee accepts that the High Court is
the most appropriate court to hear appeals against fitness-to-practise
decisions relating to social workers in England made by the Health and
Care Professions Council, it follows that the High Court is also the
appropriate place to hear referrals by the CHRE of such decisions. For
those reasons, and

Bill renames an existing body the Professional Standards Authority for
Health and Social Care. It is what I would call the regulator of the
regulators. Clause 208 states that the authority must consult the
first-level regulators before it decides what its charges will be,
which is fine and we certainly do not disagree with that, but those who
are ultimately to be regulated should be consulted as well. Amendment
649 proposes consulting representatives of the professions regulated by
the authority on the fees paid by their groups. Where a voluntary
register is being established, amendment 650 provides that
representatives of workers must also be
consulted.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000352">&#160;</a>

CHRE, which the Bill renames the Professional Standards Authority for
Health and Social Care, as we have heard. The intention is that the
authority should have a duty to consult representatives of the
regulated health and care professions before making a proposal to the
Privy Council on the funding that it considers is required to discharge
its functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000353">&#160;</a>

specific duty to consult, amendment 650 elaborates on the proposed duty
on the health and care professions regulatory bodies to consult such
persons as they consider appropriate before establishing voluntary
registers. Although the Government certainly agree with the principle
behind the amendments—that the views of relevant regulated
professionals should be taken into account on matters regarding the
funding of the authority—I will explain why we do not believe
that the amendments are necessary and why, if the hon. Lady presses
them to Division, we will oppose them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000354">&#160;</a>

a first step in the levy-setting process, the authority will be
required to make a proposal to the Privy Council on the funding that it
considers it requires. Before doing so, it is required to consult with
the regulatory bodies. However, nothing in the clause prevents the
authority from consulting more widely on its funding proposals to the
Privy Council. The authority will have the power to consult the public
and regulated professionals on its proposals under its existing powers
to do anything that it considers necessary or expedient in connection
with the performance of its functions. The Government’s view is
that it should be for the authority, as an independent statutory body,
to determine with whom it should consult, other than the regulatory
bodies. For that reason we oppose the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000355">&#160;</a>

amendment arises from concerns expressed by the British Medical
Association. It is designed to remove medical students from the
provisions of the clause, which allow regulatory bodies to establish
voluntary registers for health care students and unregulated health
professionals. Clauses 212 and 213 take forward the Government’s
intentions as outlined in the Command Paper, “Enabling

February 2011. It set out the Government’s plans to introduce a
system of assured voluntary registration to be developed for
professionals and occupational groups, as well as certain students, who
are currently not subject to statutory professional regulation. So far,
so good.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000362">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The assurance
on the equality of the voluntary register will come through the
accreditation by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, to
be renamed the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social
Care. The amendment is intended to remove medical students from the
list of professions for which voluntary registrations of students may
be kept. Unlike students in other health care professions that the Bill
seeks to regulate, medical students do not practise medicine. As
undergraduates, they do not meet the requirements for entry to the
statutory General Medical Council register, which is the requirement
for anyone who wishes to practise medicine in this country. There is
therefore no public risk that makes a compelling case for a register of
medical students.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
introducing an accredited voluntary register for medical students in
addition to the statutory register of all doctors has the potential to
increase public risk by confusing the public about who is entitled to
practise medicine. In the worst-case scenario, being on a voluntary
register could offer someone the opportunity to misrepresent themselves
to the public, deliberately or otherwise, as being qualified to
practise medicine. There is concern that it would be inappropriate for
medical students to be on the register and that they are an exception
to the usual need to register students. Although there is sympathy for
the idea that students should be registered, it is inappropriate for
medical students in the circumstances. For those reasons, we have
tabled the

professions regulatory bodies having the power to establish and
maintain a voluntary register for persons studying to become members of
professions regulated under the Medical Act 1983. Although the
amendment’s drafting is not sufficiently clear to ensure that it
would have its intended effect, in practice it would mean that the
General Medical Council would be unable to establish and maintain a
voluntary register of medical
students.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000369">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me set out the reasons why we do not believe the amendment should be

enabling power to establish and maintain voluntary registers, and it is
likely to consider the matter later this year. To be clear, the
provision is enabling; no regulatory body would be

                           </div>compelled to establish a voluntary register under the clause. The
Government view is that there is no reason to deny the GMC the same
opportunities to establish voluntary registers as are afforded to other
regulatory bodies. We want to establish parity of treatment between
regulators in the Bill. It will be for the GMC to decide whether, and
if so how, to exercise the powers the Bill
grants.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000370">&#160;</a>

consult appropriate parties and individuals, and it would have to
conduct and publish an impact assessment. For those reasons I urge the

Department of Health claims that voluntary registers will encourage the
development of professional conduct and ethical practice. They will
also set high standards of performance in groups providing services

provides that the regulatory body must consider in

potential registrants and users of health care, English social care and

assessment in deciding whether to establish a voluntary
register.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000378">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
duty is therefore placed on the Professional Standards Authority for
Health and Social Care and other regulators specifically to take into
consideration the risk to patient safety proposed by the various health
care professions and whether, following such an assessment, voluntary
regulation is deemed sufficient in protecting patient safety. A duty is
put on the Secretary of State to take forward statutory regulation
where the regulator’s impact assessment ruled out voluntary
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000379">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a risk to patient safety. Where patients are put at high risk,
because of the sensitive nature of certain health care professions, a
voluntary register is simply not adequate to protect patient safety.
There are clinical physiologists who develop and deliver a wide range
of sensitive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures directly to patients
in disciplines such as audiology, cardiology, gastrointestinal
physiology, neurophysiology and respiratory
physiology.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000380">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was thinking about that in advance of the sitting today, Mr Hood, and I
wondered whether I should make a confession to the Committee.
[<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span> “Go on!”] Actually,
I should. I am one of those who have been asked to swallow a camera,
and, when I have met clinical physiologists in the past, I thought that
they were doctors. Many members of the public think that such people,
who put cameras up them and down them and who run all kinds of horrible
and intrusive tests, are doctors, but they are not. Furthermore, they
are on a voluntary register only. That is quite extraordinary, and that
is what the amendment is intended to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000381">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
clinical physiologists work independently, and while the overall
standard of practice is high, there is a high level of risk posed to
patients due to the close one-to-one work that is often undertaken in
sensitive situations. A statutory system is much better placed to
safeguard patient safety, because only clinical physiologists who are
registered with the relevant statutory regulatory authority would
legally be eligible to practise. The provision would make it easy for
the public to determine who is a properly qualified practitioner and
would give the relevant professional body the power to determine who is
eligible to
practise.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
measure is also in line with the recommendation from the Health
Professions Council in 2004 that clinical physiologists should be
included in its regulatory regime, and the Secretary of State
subsequently accepted that recommendation. In other words,
physiologists have been waiting a long time to be put on a compulsory
register. They thought that it was coming; they were working with the
Department of Health to make it happen; but it seems to have been
snatched from their grasp at the last moment once again. The amendment
is intended to address that. It seems only fair, not only for
physiologists, but for the public that that is changed, and we should
ensure that some form of risk assessment is done before deciding
whether there is a voluntary register. I am not stating that, at the
moment, there is any risk to the public, but given the changes that are
happening and the fracturing of the health service that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1146<a class="bkMark" name="Column1146">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is an obvious consequence of those changes, there may be an increased
risk to the public. Frankly, the amendment is something that good sense
dictates should
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000383">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are shortcomings to voluntary registration. The CHRE scheme is intended
to focus on the promotion of good quality care, rather than on the
avoidance of harm. That suggests that the voluntary scheme is therefore
only adequate for those health professionals who do not pose a
significant risk to patients when not doing their job properly. The
system is clearly designed for professions where people do not
undertake risky, sensitive procedures, which is highlighted by the fact
that entry to the scheme is not dependent on the level of harm posed to
patients. Although the voluntary scheme may not be deemed to be
problematic for those health professionals who are not a high risk to
patients—those involved in diagnosing and treating patients, or
those involved in the close, one-to-one work that clinical
physiologists undertake, which often involves sensitive
situations—it is insufficient for certain professions where
patient safety is a

voluntary registration scheme will not provide an adequate safeguard.
Therefore, when deciding whether the scheme should be inclusive and
encompass a broad range of occupations, or whether it should be
exclusive, serving a defined minority, the CHRE should give a great
deal of thought to the protection that can be offered to patients by
the voluntary scheme. It should measure adequately the specific health
occupations that are best suited to a voluntary system of regulation,
based on the level of engagement with patients and the level of harm
posed to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000385">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point of concern particularly relates to
physiologists, who have been working towards a compulsory system of
registration for, I believe, more than 10 years. They thought that they
were getting there, but instead of having a compulsory system of
registration, the Bill shows that there will continue to be a voluntary
register. Given that their work becomes increasingly intrusive,
personal and developed as a body of work, it seems to us that there is
an increasingly strong case for physiologists to be on a compulsory
register. There are those people who, over the years, ought to have
been on such a register. They have been moving towards it, and the
shame of the Bill is that it is a slap in the face to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000387">&#160;</a>

subject of a solid body of evidence demonstrating the benefits of
compulsory statutory regulation, on the basis that mitigating a public
safety risk outweighs the potential costs across the system. That is
why the clause provides for requirements for consultation with affected
groups, and why it also requires an impact assessment. Such issues will
be addressed through the process that we are putting in place, in a way
that hitherto has not been the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000389">&#160;</a>

Government agree with the hon. Lady that the risks to patients or
service users should be considered as part of the impact assessment, we
do not accept the amendment for two reasons. First, the clause, as
drafted, already imposes a duty on a relevant regulatory body to
perform an impact assessment before establishing a voluntary register,
and it requires the regulator to have regard to that assessment when
deciding whether to establish a voluntary register. That would ensure
that the relevant regulatory body considers whether the costs of
establishing and operating a voluntary register are justified by the
benefits in terms of improved standards to workers, employers and,
importantly, people who use the services. That would ensure that the

are up to a certain standard, and who do not mind being regulated and

they carry out functions such as those carried out by physiologists, it
is entirely sensible that they should be on a compulsory

point a tad further? I was going on to say that there is merit in
providing for the possibility of voluntary registers in the Bill. She
has focused on the medical profession and medical interventions of one
sort or another, but the Bill also contains provisions to allow for
voluntary registers in the care sector, and we may return to that.
However, if it were found to be proportionate and appropriate to
introduce such a register, one issue would be that care users and those
who commission services would be having conversations about whether
staff were, indeed, on a voluntary register. There are, therefore,
other checks and balances in the overall system to drive certain
behaviours.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000395">&#160;</a>

compulsory register has been ruled out for them—that is the
point. Having put as many people as they can on a voluntary register
for the time that they have, and having worked on the basis that they
would get a compulsory register, they have been told at the last minute
that they will not. That is a concern, which is why they have addressed
the issue and why I have had conversations with them. I welcome the
opportunity to raise the issue again with the Minister, because he
should and, I am sure, will re-examine it. Perhaps we will see some

to the second reason why we oppose the amendment, which relates to the
proposal to remove responsibility from the Secretary of State for a
decision to extend compulsory statutory regulation to new groups of
workers. That would effectively fetter the Secretary of State’s
discretion, which is entirely inappropriate. It is for the Secretary of
State, who is, in turn, directly accountable to Parliament, to consider
whether compulsory statutory regulation should be proposed to
Parliament for any new group of workers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000398">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In making
such decisions, the Secretary of State cannot be bound by the outcomes
of a single impact assessment performed by a single regulatory body.
The Secretary of State may wish to take account of the views of a wider
range of individuals or of other policy factors, such as the costs to
that part of the economy, Government resources or the impact that
over-regulation might have on economic growth more generally. Such a
provision would also create a potential conflict of interests for the
relevant health profession’s regulatory body, given that it
could be argued in some cases that that body had an interest in
extending compulsory statutory regulation, because that would generate
income for it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000399">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For those
reasons, and because of an express duty on regulators to assess risk in
their impact assessments, it is unnecessary to include the amendment

in the debate on the previous amendment. How appropriate is it for

concern about this issue. There is a suggestion that those who are the

no problem with going on to a voluntary register and that it is the
others about whom we are concerned. The concern is how we will regulate
those whom we do not

given how fractured the service has become, the development of personal
budgets and so on. The number of people working in social care
increases, but they do not necessarily stay there for very
long—it is the Cinderella end of the business. People are not
necessarily very well trained, and they may not have a great deal of
experience. The level of management is sometimes not always what it
should be, yet we expect those women—largely women—to
fulfil some of the most personal tasks on the most vulnerable, at the
most vulnerable stage of their life. I would strongly argue that there
is a very strong case for ensuring that all those who fulfil a role
within social care should be on a register, so that we know who is
fulfilling those tasks, and that if they are not on a register, they
simply cannot do that job.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000405">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There needs
to be some form of regulation. The Minister might not like that as an
argument, but I would like to know what other form of regulation is
available if we are not going to have everyone on a compulsory
register. It may be that the Minister will say that the Care Quality
Commission can play a role, and that an old people’s home would
not be accredited by it if the staff were not on a register. It may be
that that is part of the Minister’s argument. As I understand
it, however, not everyone who works in a home needs to be on the
voluntary register, and I seek the assurance of the Minister that they
will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000406">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">How
will this work? The Government have expressed their intentions on
regulated health and social care workers joining the voluntary
registers, which will be overseen by the Health and Care Professions
Council. I have already spoken in relation to the case of
physiologists, but there are number of other health professionals who
also want compulsory registration in order to have some pride in the
work that they do, so that not anyone and everyone can just roll of the
street and claim that they share the professionalism of those who have
worked in one particular area of care for many years. I have spoken to
many people who are on compulsory registers at the moment. They work
with other colleagues in the health service who are not on compulsory
registers, and they feel that their colleagues do not have sufficient
recognition as a result of not being on a compulsory
register.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000407">&#160;</a>

Government are going in completely the wrong direction. Instead of
increasing the registration of people working in the health service and
in social care, increasing the recognition of the professionalism of
those people and focusing policy to ensure that we raise standards of
care, they are moving towards voluntary registration and are not
pushing for compulsory registration, which, as I understand it, was the
policy push until recently. That seems counter-intuitive and it is of
concern, particularly when it is embedded in the Bill that will
definitely—there is no argument about it—lead to a
fracturing of the health service. We will, as I understand it, be
getting more providers—we will be getting a wider choice. In
those circumstances, if there is going to be wider choice, we wish to
have a wider of choice of good quality. In the end, quality of care
comes from the quality of staff and ensuring that we are properly able
to regulate our staff and not simply employ anyone and everyone in the
health service and in social care without

would be grateful if the Minister were to put on the record his
response to concerns expressed by the UK Council for Psychotherapy that
the Bill allows statutory regulators to establish voluntary registers
in competition with existing professional voluntary registers. In other
words, the UK Council for Psychotherapy already has a voluntary
register. Is it likely that the legislation will result in another
register being established in competition with that, which will also be
a voluntary register? Will the Minister explain how that will
work?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000409">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also want to raise concerns about the approach to social care workers,
which I have mentioned in earlier debates. It is right to pray in aid
that the Governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland are moving
towards a mandatory system of registration for those involved in social
care. The experience in Wales, where there was a voluntary register of
those involved in social care, shows that it simply did not work. Those
involved with that register have said that it does not offer the
clarity and simplicity that service users and carers require. As a
result, the Welsh Government have also decided to close their voluntary
registers and move towards a compulsory register. The rest of the UK is
moving towards a compulsory register for care workers. Why is England
being left behind? Will the Minister explain why there are particular
circumstances in relation to England that mean we only have voluntary
registers of those who perform the most intimate tasks? Why is it that
other countries in the United Kingdom have a compulsory
register?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition to adding confusion, voluntary registration is not going to
drive up standards in social care. Skills in the care sector can be
improved through compulsory registration or through requirements on the
employer. I have asked the Minister if, instead of there being a
compulsory register, any rules will be imposed on employers to ensure
that those whom they employ are at least those on the register. Social
care workers are in favour of mandatory regulation, but it is unfair on
social care workers, who are on very low wages, to pay a fee when it is
not mandatory and might not be a condition of their job. There may be
voluntary registers, and the Minister may be allowing for social care
workers to move on to a voluntary register, but if there is a fee and
the people concerned are earning hardly anything and hardly making ends

public want us to professionalise social care and this aspect of work
with the most vulnerable. If the Minister does not ensure that
registration is compulsory within the legislation—as it is in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for social care
workers—what other levers, if he has any, is he going to use to
ensure that there is a compulsory registration of those who look after
our elderly and our most vulnerable? Why are the Government not
listening to the views of workers and learning from the recent
experience of the other Governments of the devolved countries in the
United
Kingdom?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000412">&#160;</a>

points, it is worth reflecting on what the past few years teaches us in
terms of how one translates well-intentioned

                           </div>commitments into reality. When it comes to the regulation of various
parts of the health and social care work force, the previous
Government, of whom the hon. Lady was a supporter, were certainly full
of good intentions. However, they had a tendency to over-promise and
under-deliver when it came to getting regulation to take place. In
fact, if all the commitments of the previous Administration to extend
regulation to new groups of workers had been delivered on time or,
indeed, at all, an additional 1.3 million workers, many of whom are in
relatively low-paid support roles, would be obliged by law to pay
registration fees. That is the very point that the hon. Lady has
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000413">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is worth noting that in 2000 the NHS plan gave a commitment to the
introduction of proposals for regulation of health support workers,
which did not happen. In 2001, there was a reference to herbal
medicine. In 2005, there was a reference to social care workers. In
2007, there were references to health care scientists and
practitioners, psychologists, counsellors and so on. The previous
Government entered into commitments for all those groups, but they did
not follow through on them. It is one thing to come to this Committee
and raise concerns about the introduction of voluntary assured
registration. What we are trying to do and intend to do is to have a
proportionate response to risk, to have a mechanism that can properly
assess, in a transparent and open way, the level of that risk and to
put in place, where it is appropriate, voluntary assured
registers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000414">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked how that might sit in the context of other changes
to the environment in which social care in particular is delivered.
There are a number of relevant factors that she should take into
account. She mentioned herself the role of the Care Quality Commission.
It will shortly be consulting on a scheme for a new excellence rating
in the social care sector. One possibility—the commission will
consult on this as a matter for consideration—is that the
excellence rating would include having regard to the fact that an
organisation was employing staff who had been included on the voluntary
assured register for social care
workers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000415">&#160;</a>

Lady has put to me, because of course all care homes that are
registered with the CQC can be registered

                           </div>to provide care only, if they meet the standards set out in the
legislation that established the CQC on its current basis, which was
passed by the Administration whom she supported. If she has concerns
about those standards, they could have been addressed in the past. I do
not share the concerns that she has tried to advance
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000417">&#160;</a>

just not asking my question sufficiently clearly. Is the Minister in
favour of care homes providing services for the elderly and the
vulnerable where there are staff who are not on any register? Would his
legislation stop that if it were a
possibility?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000418">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I find that question truly breathtaking, because
in 2005 the previous Administration committed themselves to introducing
changes but they never did. There was never a sense of urgency or
drive, and the General Social Care Council did not deliver on that. If
the hon. Lady now feels that to be an issue, why did not the Ministers
who were responsible for it feel that it should have been addressed at
that
time?<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000419">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are moving from a situation in which there is no regulation whatever to
a situation in which there will be assured, accredited voluntary
registration of care workers in all settings. That is a change from the
current arrangements, which we inherited from the previous
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000420">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the Minister asked me a question, may I
take the opportunity to say this to him? For anyone working in an old
people’s home not to be on a register seems to me to be entirely
wrong. If the Minister is using the Bill to develop levers that are
made of foam and will do nothing and will not stop people who are not
on a register working in old people’s homes, that is wrong. That
is my opinion. This is a golden opportunity to put that wrong right.
Never mind about the previous Government or whether the new Government
should be building on the achievements of the previous Government. We
are scrutinising this Bill now and a situation now in which elderly and
vulnerable people may be being looked after by people who are not on
any register. If that is correct and the Minister anticipates that it
will continue under this legislation, it is his responsibility, I
respectfully suggest, to ensure that he changes the Bill to stop it
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11032969000421">&#160;</a>
