David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
pleasure to welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. As
I am sure you would expect, Sir Nicholas Winterton kept us
in order this morning in his inimitable way, but we are delighted to
see you back.</div>
<a name="09052163000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I stated
this morning, and as Sir Nicholas pointed out, we debated clause 9,
which deals with the temporary cut in VAT from 17.5 per cent. to 15 per
cent., on the Floor of the House, and I have no intention of running
through all those arguments again. I will merely add that those of us
who were concerned about the state of the public finances take no
reassurance from this morning&#146;s news that public sector net
borrowing has increased substantially for April and is at record
levels, and that the ratings agency Standard and Poor&#146;s has
revised its outlook for the UK to negative, due to borrowing concerns.
The agency has said that Britain&#146;s triple A rating for its
Government bonds was at risk if the next Government did not produce a
credible plan to put Government debt on a &#147;secure downward
trajectory&#148;. Our concerns about a discretionary fiscal stimulus
appear to be further vindicated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div><a name="09052163000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000392"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> The hon. Gentleman will know that Standard and
Poor&#146;s has reaffirmed the triple A rating for the UK, but has he
also seen that, since the publication of the Standard and Poor&#146;s
view, both Moody&#146;s and Fitch Ratings have also reaffirmed their
view of a stable outlook for their triple A rating? Standard and
Poor&#146;s is on its own on
that.</div><a name="09052163000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000393"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for that intervention; none the less,
the announcement from Standard and Poor&#146;s this morning is a
timely warning that the public finances are in a perilous state and
that the current level of borrowing is clearly unsustainable. I know
that you do not want me to dwell on whether the VAT cut was wise,
Mr. Atkinson, so I will turn to schedule
3.</div><a name="09052163000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the changes in VAT and the fact that it will return to 17.5 per cent.
on 1 January, we accept that the Government&#146;s concern about
potential forestalling and their desire to prevent the advancing of the
time of supply on standard rated supplies are legitimate. Consequently,
and given where we are, we have no objections to the measures in
schedule 3, as they are perfectly reasonable.</div>
<a name="09052163000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
Law Society has brought a couple of concerns to our attention, and it
might help the Committee if I outline them. We have sought to bring the
Committee&#146;s attention to those concerns by tabling amendments 5,
6 and 7. If the anti-forestalling provisions in schedule 3 are to
apply, certain conditions that need to be fulfilled, which are set out
in paragraph 2. The first condition is
that</div><a name="09052163000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
supplier and the person to whom the supply is made are
connected&#148;.</div><a name="09052163000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second condition is that the relevant considerations come to more than
&#163;100,000. The third condition is that</div>
<a name="09052163000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a prepayment in
respect of the supply is financed by the supplier or a person connected
with the
supplier&#148;</div><a name="09052163000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am simplifying the matter a little, but that probably serves the
purposes of the Committee. The Law Society&#146;s concern relates to
condition A. It says that the test of connection, already wide, has
been extended by a recent case, Kellock Brown. Indeed, the society has
raised the possibility that some banks in partial public ownership and
indeed, the state may be connected for the purposes of the test. I will
be grateful if the Minister can respond to that
point.</div><a name="09052163000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
may be a danger of condition A applying more broadly than is intended.
Our amendments are intended to solve the potential problem of the
provision applying where the supplier had no intention or knowledge
that they would become connected to the person to whom the supply is
made&#151;people may find themselves caught up in the provisions when
that was not the intention. We tabled amendments 5 and 6 to highlight
that issue and obtain the Government&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09052163000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
second concern relates to paragraph 10 of the schedule. Our first point
is that we are back in the era of Henry VIII clauses, in that it will
be possible to amend primary legislation by order. That is something
about which, traditionally, the House as a whole has always been
concerned. Those of us who served on the Committee on the Banking Bill
will remember similar concerns being expressed, and the Economic
Secretary and I debated Henry VIII clauses at some length. There is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>recognition of the potential problem with parliamentary scrutiny arising
from any Henry VIII clause. In the case of the Banking Bill, the
Minister set out his reasons for why there might be a need to amend
legislation to deal with particular cases&#151;indeed, if I recall
correctly, that section of the Banking Act 2009 is now being used quite
extensively in relation to the rescue of Dunfermline building society.
The use of Henry VIII clauses is, none the less, a concern that hon.
Members on both sides of that Public Bill Committee raised, and I raise
it again
here.</div><a name="09052163000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second element of concern about paragraph 10 is that there is nothing
in the paragraph that would prevent the Treasury from making an order
that is, to some extent, retrospective&#151;nothing that would
prevent an order from applying to a supply that occurred before the
date of the order. That concern was also raised  by the Law
Society, which we attempt to address in amendment 7, which
provides that any order made under paragraph 10 should apply only to
supplies made after the date of the order, or where there is a
contractual provision enabling it to be varied subsequently. We think
that that answers the concern. It may well be that the Government would
not, in any circumstances, use the order in a retrospective manner, and
we would welcome an assurance to that effect. Otherwise, I would be
grateful if the Minister outlined the circumstances in which the
Government would make an order that was not in compliance with
amendment 7. That would be helpful to the
Committee.</div><a name="09052163000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subject
to those technical points, we have no particular objections to schedule
3, for the reasons that I outlined earlier. However, we think that we
have expressed legitimate concerns that we hope the Minister will be
able to answer, perhaps by accepting the
amendments.</div><a name="09052163000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000394"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I shall not speak at length,
Mr. Atkinson, because the points that I had wished to make
were either made in detail in the main Chamber of the House, or made a
few moments ago by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire.</div>
<a name="09052163000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My party also
did not approve of the temporary VAT cut. We did approve of a fiscal
stimulus, but we thought that the money could be better spent than on a
reduction in sales tax. That reduction is worth approximately
&#163;1 billion a month, depending on what people choose
to buy. That is a substantial amount of money, which, as I have said,
we felt could have been spent more constructively. Having said that, we
are where we are. The Government have implemented that policy of a
reduction in sales tax and it seems reasonable to us that the
anti-forestalling measures outlined in schedule 3 be put into effect to
ensure that people pay the tax that they are expected to
pay.</div>
<a name="09052163000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative amendments strike me as reasonable, but I would be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to them. He may feel
that there are practical difficulties and that the amendments are too
loosely defined in their scope. If that is the case, they may not be
appropriate. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on
those amendments, but my party supports the schedule as a
whole.</div><a name="09052163000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000395"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I only have a couple of questions
for the Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire mentioned the concerns 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>of the Law Society. I would like to mention the concerns of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.</div>
<a name="09052163000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
institute&#146;s concerns overlap with those of the Law Society, such
as the wide definition of &#147;connected persons&#148;. However,
the ICAEW raised another question that is valid to ask here. What is
the basis of the assumptions underlying the schedule about the
potential scale of abuse? The ICAEW makes a very good point that,
without that type of evidence, the nine pages of anti-avoidance
legislation that are before us seem a disproportionate response to what
is only a 2.5 per cent.
adjustment.</div>
<a name="09052163000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000396"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Welcome back to the Chair of our Committee,
Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09052163000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to all the hon. Members who have spoken today to express general
support for the measures in the schedule. As we have discussed, the
reason for the temporary reduction in VAT was to deliver a fiscal
stimulus to the economy in a timely, targeted and temporary way, and
that stimulus is working. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
drew attention to some economic news this morning. He may also have
noticed the Office for National Statistics&#146; retail sales figures
published this morning showing continuing&#151;indeed, I would say
remarkable&#151;strength. Retail sales volume is up 2.6 per cent. on
the year. In very stark contrast to what happened to retail sales
figures in the last recession, over the past six months retail sales
volume has grown by almost 2 per cent. In the last half of 1991, which
is a comparable period to now, that figure fell by 2 per cent. So that
4 per cent. difference in retail sales volume over a six-month period
is the difference.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000400"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am delighted to do so, Mr.
Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09052163000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
introducing a temporary VAT reduction&#151;the benefit has been
explained&#151;businesses would have advance notice of a rate rise,
so they could attempt to arrange their affairs so that they paid VAT at
the reduced rate on goods and services provided after the rate goes
back up. Hon. Members have rightly acknowledged that that is what the
schedule addresses.</div>
<a name="09052163000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09052163000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
respond to the hon. Member for Henley, on previous occasions when the
VAT rate changed, we saw arrangements providing for prepayments of well
over &#163;100 million covering future supplies over many years.
Recent comments from businesses and tax advisers made it clear that
anti-avoidance rules were needed to thwart those arrangements. We
estimate that &#163;400 million of revenue could be at risk if such
measures are not taken. On 25 November, I announced that legislation
effective from that date would be introduced in the Finance Bill to
protect the public finances from such artificial avoidance. We intend
to stop arrangements designed to avoid payment of tax, but to leave
genuine 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>commercial transactions unaffected. I hope that I will be able to
persuade the Committee that we have achieved
that.</div>
<a name="09052163000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000401"></a>John

consultation took place with various professional bodies to ensure that
the schedule captures the problems that he wanted to address and is not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000402"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> What the schedule does is enact what I said in my
statement of 25 November. Our intentions and approach were set out in
that statement. The draft of the schedule was published, I think, a
couple of weeks before the Budget, so there has been ample opportunity
to respond, and so far, as far as I know, no one has come forward with
alternative proposals. Of course, if there were some alternative ideas,
we would be interested in seeing them. The schedule contains the
distillation of learning from 20 or more years of experience, and I
think the judgment has been got right.</div>
<a name="09052163000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We listened
to a number of comments that were made and we have made some changes as
a result.</div>
<a name="09052163000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000403"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09052163000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000404"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Let me just underline this point because it helps
to deal with the concerns raised. As a backstop safeguard, there is a
power in paragraph 15 of the schedule to remove transactions from the
scope of the provision by order, so that unintended effects can quickly
be rectified. If someone came forward with a particular kind of
perfectly legitimate commercial transaction that would be impeded by
the schedule, we could use that power to remove such transactions from
the scope of the schedule.</div>
<a name="09052163000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000405"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have a genuine query. The Minister talked about
experience in this area. The focus is principally on the return of VAT
to 17.5 per cent., but did any problems arise when VAT was reduced from
17.5 per cent. to 15 per cent.? Was there a loss to the Exchequer
because the equivalent of that type of provision was not in place at
the time?</div>
<a name="09052163000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000406"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not think that there were
difficulties&#151;certainly not along the lines referred
to&#151;when the rate was reduced. When tax is going to go up,
opportunity arises, and there is clearly a benefit for people who can
organise their affairs artificially so that they can do the transaction
now, rather than after the tax increase. The difficulty arises in cases
where the base of the tax is expanded, which is what happened at the
end of the &#146;80s when there was quite a lot of forestalling. As I
said, some &#163;400 million of revenue could be at risk, and the
Committee will accept that we would be negligent if we allowed
loopholes to be created, or doors to be opened to avoidance.</div>
<a name="09052163000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick
up the point that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised
about whether there would be an impact on banks part-owned by the
Treasury. We are not aware of any prepayment or similar transactions
between the banks now partly in public ownership that could fall within
the scope of this legislation, nor is there reason to think that such
transactions are likely. His point about connectedness might arise, but
there is no transaction that is likely to cause any difficulty and, as
I said, if there were we could use paragraph 15 of the schedule to deal
with it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="09052163000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 5
and 6 would limit the connected parties test in certain circumstances.
It would not be difficult to set up prepayment arrangements,
particularly between connected parties, to enable large amounts of
transactions to escape the effect of the VAT rise. When parties are
connected, it is not clear in which circumstances there would be a need
for prepayments as opposed to any other method of financing that they
might arrange between themselves, so the legislation needs to provide a
robust defence against such artificial arrangements. I suggest that the
amendments would weaken the protection of the connected parties test
and could open the door to
avoidance.</div><a name="09052163000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
5 would introduce an intention test into the legislation. I understand
the reason and the fairness argument for that, but in practice it would
be very difficult to assess intention. For obvious reasons, we cannot
be sure that tax avoiders would be wholly frank about their intention
if the success of some tax avoidance depended on it. Introducing such a
test would create uncertainty for taxpayers and for Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, and the circumstances for which
the amendment is designed are unlikely to be common. I hope that the
Committee accepts that it would not make sense to introduce uncertainty
when the number of transactions is small. In any case, as I have said,
the schedule allows transactions to be excluded by order if we come
across transactions that would be
effective.</div><a name="09052163000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
7, as the hon. Gentleman has set out, prevents retrospective orders
from extending the scope of the measure. I think that I can give him
the reassurance that he seeks, making the amendment unnecessary.
Paragraph 10 does not permit retrospection&#151;it would not be
possible. To have the power to amend legislation by order
retrospectively, the primary legislation needs to give a power of
retrospection which the paragraph does not explicitly give. We do not
intend to apply such orders retrospectively. Perhaps the fact that I
have said that might help the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09052163000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have covered the issues raised by  the three
amendments, and that I have persuaded the  hon. Gentleman that
he can safely withdraw the
amendments.</div><a name="09052163000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000407"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Financial Secretary for his response. I
note his remarks about connectedness and about how amendments 5 and 6
might weaken the provisions, although proponents of the amendments
might say they would &#147;narrow&#148; the provisions. I recognise
his point about an intention test resulting in some uncertainty, but
the amendments have helped to flesh out the Government&#146;s
position.</div>
<a name="09052163000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks about paragraph
10, for his comments that it is implicit that there is no retrospective
right to amend unless the primary legislation allows that, and his
assurances that the paragraph will not be used for retrospective
purposes. I am still uneasy about such a Henry VIII clause, but the
argument that presumably he would make&#151;that it could only apply
in narrow circumstances&#151;may be reasonable here. Consequently, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09052163000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000409"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon,
Mr. Atkinson, and to make my first contribution to the
Committee stage of the 2009 Finance
Bill.</div><a name="09052163000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
2 September last year, the Government introduced a one-year stamp duty
land tax holiday applicable to all residential purchases worth
&#163;175,000 or less. The holiday was introduced at a time of
falling house prices and a volume of transactions far below that seen
in recent times. The holiday is a short-term measure to support home
buyers many of whom, despite falling prices, are finding it harder to
enter the housing market. The holiday ensures that more than 60 per
cent. of all residential purchases in the UK are currently exempt from
stamp duty. Approximately 90,000 transactions have already been
exempted from stamp duty over and above those falling below the
original &#163;125,000 starting threshold. We expect that a total of
210,000 transactions will be exempted from stamp duty because of the
holiday.</div><a name="09052163000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Budget
2009 announced an extension of the holiday to 31 December 2009, to
coincide with the end of the temporary VAT reduction and provide
further support for home buyers. We expect that approximately an extra
60,000 transactions will be exempted from stamp duty as a result of the
extension of the holiday. The decision to extend the holiday reflects
the continued difficulties facing the housing market since it was
introduced in September 2008. For example, transaction volumes are down
by two thirds from their peak in mid-2007 and prices have fallen
considerably in the last year.</div>
<a name="09052163000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 10
provides for the extension, which should be seen in the context of the
other action taken in the Budget to support home owners, home buyers
and the housing supply. Those measures include continued support for
home owners in difficulty, through maintaining the standard interest
rate for support for mortgage interest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>at 6.08 per cent. for a further six months; support for housing supply
through a &#163;600 million fund to stimulate or kick-start
development in the short-term and boost capacity in the house building
industry for the recovery; and support for home buyers with the
extension of HomeBuy Direct and the launch of a guarantee scheme for
residential mortgage-backed securities.</div>
<a name="09052163000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that,
new clause 3 appears to exempt first-time buyers from stamp duty land
tax when they purchase a residential property worth &#163;250,000 or
less. The Government do not believe that raising the stamp duty land
tax starting threshold to &#163;250,000 for first-time buyers would
be an effective use of public money. The new clause does not indicate
an effective date or give an indication of whether the measure is
intended to be permanent. A permanent increase, which I understand is
Conservative policy, would cost the Exchequer approximately
&#163;290 million in 2010-11, rising to &#163;430
million in 2012-13. A temporary increase in the threshold for
first-time buyers, extending only until the end of December this year,
would cost &#163;50 million on top of the &#163;340 million cost of
the existing
holiday.</div><a name="09052163000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government also estimate that, as a result of the existing stamp duty
holiday applying to transactions worth less than &#163;175,000, some
75 per cent. of first-time buyers are already exempt from stamp duty
land tax. In addition, on 2 September 2008 we launched HomeBuy Direct,
which offers first-time buyers an equity loan of up to 30 per cent. of
the value of a new home to assist them in getting on the housing
ladder. Budget 2009 announced an expansion in the provision of HomeBuy
Direct as part of the wider kick-start housing delivery programme to
unlock sites that have stalled. We estimate that the shared equity and
shared ownership products being offered as part of that delivery
programme, including HomeBuy Direct, will provide approximately 5,000
properties to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder. Given
the action that we are already taking, we do not see a need to raise
the threshold further specifically for first-time buyers. Existing
measures, including the holiday at its current threshold, are a more
appropriate and targeted use of public
funds.</div><a name="09052163000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09052163000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should add that new clause 3 does not provide a definition of a
first-time buyer. That introduces problems that themselves mean that we
cannot accept the amendment. Defining a first-time buyer is not
straightforward, and an exemption explicitly for first-time buyers may
give rise to new avoidance opportunities. For example, is an individual
who has previously purchased a property overseas to be considered a
first-time buyer? If such individuals are not to be treated as
first-time buyers, the definition of a first-time buyer could be
difficult to enforce or open to
exploitation.</div><a name="09052163000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of the difficulties of defining a first-time buyer, the potential
avoidance risks and the help that the Government are already offering
first-time buyers, raising the stamp duty land tax threshold to
&#163;250,000 would not be an effective use of public money. The
action that we are taking, as reflected in clause 10, is
important.</div><a name="09052163000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000410"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I welcome the Economic Secretary to his first
participation in this year&#146;s Finance Bill. As he has stated,
clause 10 raises the stamp duty threshold from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>&#163;125,000 to &#163;175,000. More precisely, it extends the
existing holiday to 1 January 2010, rather than 2 September 2009. It is
not a dishonourable action for the Government to try to help the
housing market, so our criticisms are not of the proposal&#146;s
intention. However, I wish to voice a number of concerns before
discussing new clause
3.</div><a name="09052163000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must highlight how the policy of a stamp duty holiday emerged. <i class="I">The
Sun</i> headline on 5 August read, &#147;Brown to scrap stamp
duty&#148;. It was very clear that the proposal was a personal
initiative of the Prime Minister&#146;s, and I am sure that the story
caused much delight in No. 10 Downing street, if not in No.
11 too. One suspects that Mr. Damian McBride may have been
involved in the story&#146;s publication, as it was written in a way
that reflected well on the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, however, the
policy had a disastrous effect on the housing market that August; a
number of transactions collapsed throughout the country. An estate
agent in Berkhamsted in my constituency told me of a number of
transactions that had collapsed. Why would people have wanted to enter
into a transaction when house prices were already falling and when they
knew that a more beneficial stamp duty regime was just around the
corner?</div><a name="09052163000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
details were not very clear at that point. <i class="I">The Sun</i> headline, as
I have said, read, &#147;Brown to scrap stamp duty&#148;, which
seems exaggerated to say the least. I did not buy a copy of <i class="I">The
Sun</i> that day, but I recall listening to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer being interviewed by James Naughtie on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme on the proposal for a stamp duty
holiday of some sort. The Chancellor, for understandable reasons, gave
a non-committal answer and, as a consequence, there were criticisms of
the confusion within the
Government.</div><a name="09052163000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000411"></a><b class="B">Mr.

winning the next general election delay buying a house valued at

agree on it this afternoon, will new clause 3 be introduced if the
Conservatives win the general election?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000412"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We would hope to be able to move quickly in
addressing that and we will be clear as to our intentions. It was
unhelpful for the Prime Minister to indicate at that point that a
policy to raise thresholds, or even to scrap stamp duty, was about to
be implemented, when the Chancellor appeared to give a different
message. When the housing market was as fragile as it was in August
2008, there was not only confusion but an indication that there was
going to be a change in the regime. That created a number of
difficulties that I experienced as a constituency MP, and at a national
level I know that concerns were raised by the Council of Mortgage
Lenders and so on.</div>
<a name="09052163000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000413"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Obviously, it is flattering that the hon. Member
for Taunton is so assured that the Conservatives are going to win the
next election that he is looking forward to it as a possibility.
Ultimately, there is an understanding that a change of Government will
bring a change of tax regime in a range of different ways, whether in a
manifesto or in some of the small print of the first Finance Bill. That
is a fundamentally different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>situation to the one that we experienced last August, when the
Government were making grandstand headlines that had an effect on a
fragile housing market.</div>
<a name="09052163000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000414"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Governments can
immediately implement their policies, but in opposition it is a
question of arguing for ideas. I will argue for the best parts of our
policy this afternoon.</div>
<a name="09052163000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
doubt that the Treasury was deeply wounded by what happened on 5
August. I raised that concern with the Economic Secretary when we
debated the orders that are being repealed as part of the clause. On 22
October, he referred to, &#147;Unhelpful press speculation&#148;,
and
added:</div><a name="09052163000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
speculation in August was unhelpful, and we worked hard to discourage
it.&#148;</div><a name="09052163000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went
on:</div><a name="09052163000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Speculation
in the press did not help our deliberations, and we worked actively to
discourage
it.&#148;</div><a name="09052163000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put it to him that the speculation was started by an article in <i class="I">The
Sun</i> that was clearly informed by a briefing from the Prime
Minister&#146;s office. The Economic Secretary responded</div>
<a name="09052163000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
repeat that that speculation was unhelpful.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, Third Delegated Legislation Committee, </i>22 October 2008; c.
7.]</div> <a name="09052163000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worth noting that the Economic Secretary has a mild manner, but can be
quite gutsy when he needs to in standing up to No. 10 Downing street. I
commend him for doing that in a rather subtle way during our debate of
22 October.</div>
<a name="09052163000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
area of concern is that when this measure was finally announced on 3
September last year, the Prime Minister stated that it was going to
save taxpayers &#163;600 million. At the time, that number was
questioned significantly. Robert Chote of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies questioned its plausibility and
said:</div><a name="09052163000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be interesting to see why the Treasury thinks it is going to be
as expensive as
this.&#148;</div><a name="09052163000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to say that he thought that the figure would be nearer
&#163;200 million. Indeed, the sums suggest that if the cost to the
Exchequer is going to be &#163;600 million, it would need to involve
400,000 house transactions of &#163;150,000 on average.</div>
<a name="09052163000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
the numbers from the Economic Secretary. He has updated the Committee
as to the number of transactions and said that there have been 90,000
so far. He gave a figure of 210,000 transactions in total, but 60,000
of those are as a consequence of the extension from September to
January. The number has actually turned out to be 150,000 transactions.
I think that &#163;270 million is the cost of the overall
package, including the extension. The Economic Secretary will correct
me if I am wrong, but the estimate given by the Treasury at the time
was clearly wide of the mark. The figures given by the likes of the IFS
appear to be much closer to reality&#151;they may be slightly
exaggerated, but the IFS has pretty much got them right. I return to
the question asked by Robert Chote last September: why did the Treasury
think it was going to be as expensive as it was? It clearly got the
number significantly wrong, and it would be helpful for the Committee
to know how that mistake
happened.</div><a name="09052163000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also worth considering how effective the policy has been. When the
Prime Minister announced the measure in September, he told the
BBC:</div><a name="09052163000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Home
owners need to know that we will do everything we can to keep the
housing market moving&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div><a name="09052163000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth taking a
moment for a small amount of textual analysis. It was not that it was
important to keep the housing market moving or to do everything to keep
it moving; rather, the important thing was that home owners needed to
know that the Government would do everything to keep the housing market
moving.</div>
<a name="09052163000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consequences have not, it is fair to say, been a dramatic success in
terms of turning the housing market around. To be fair, by way of a
test, we could ask what the policy would have been otherwise. However,
Nationwide says that, following the announcement, house prices fell by
1.7 per cent in September., by 1.5 per cent. in October, by 0.5 per
cent. in November, by 2.6 per cent. in December, which was a record
fall, level with that of May last year, by 1.3 per cent. in January and
by 1.9 per cent. in
February.</div><a name="09052163000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Halifax&#146;s
numbers show a similar pattern: a fall of  1.3 per cent. in
September, of 2.4 per cent. in October, of 2.7 per cent. in November,
and of 1.6 per cent. in December. January appears to be the outlier
here&#151;there was an increase of 2 per cent.&#151;but that was
followed by a fall of 2.3 per cent. in February, of 1.9 per cent. in
March and of 1.7 per cent. in April. As I said, it would be unfair to
say that the policy is therefore a bleak, dismal failure, but if the
intention was to turn the housing market around&#151;given the
Government&#146;s assumptions on how much the measure would cost,
that seems to be what they anticipated&#151;it has failed to
deliver.</div>
<a name="09052163000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
return to a technical issue on the stamp duty provisions that I have
raised before with the Economic Secretary&#151;we debated it in
October&#151;on disadvantaged areas. For some time, certain parts of
the country have been designated &#147;disadvantaged&#148;. In
those areas, there was a higher stamp duty threshold of &#163;150,000
as opposed to &#163;125,000. Presumably, the intention is that the
higher threshold in those areas will encourage and provoke more
economic activity. My point to the Economic Secretary in October was
that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs website stated that the
stamp duty threshold was &#163;175,000 except in disadvantaged areas,
where it was &#163;150,000. He provided assurances that that was a
mistake and, indeed, the HMRC website has been updated and my point has
been addressed. The website currently states that disadvantaged areas
relief will not apply for residential-only property purchases
between</div><a name="09052163000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;3
September 2008 to 31 December 2009
inclusive&#148;.</div>
<a name="09052163000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09052163000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for that clarification. It appears to address the concern
that I raised last October. However, I would be grateful if the
Minister could explain why that is the case. Why does the legislation
on disadvantaged areas relief not apply? There does not appear to be
any instrument that disapplies it. Is this merely something that can be
done at the discretion of the Government and HMRC? I do not argue that
there should be a different regime for disadvantaged areas and that
disadvantaged areas should have a lower stamp duty threshold, but it
would be helpful to have the legal justification. Why have we not seen
an order? Why is there is no reference in clause 10 to that
point?</div><a name="09052163000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 represents our proposal to increase the stamp duty threshold
for first-time buyers to &#163;250,000. As I am sure the Committee
will recall, this was part of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>the announcement made by my hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor in his
2007 party conference speech. He set out the argument for raising the
threshold to take nine out of 10 first-time buyers out of stamp duty.
The anticipated cost was &#163;400 million, which was going to be
paid for by a charge on non-doms. I note the comments from the Minister
and I anticipated that he would be able to provide the figure. The cost
of the policy has since diminished to &#163;290 million, but it is
fully funded. I also suspect, and the Minister did not give these
figures, that the proportion of first-time buyers who will be taken out
of stamp duty will be greater than nine out  of 10, given the
changes in house markets. It would be fair to say that the economic
situation has changed substantially since October 2007, but the
argument for this policy remains
valid.</div><a name="09052163000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern that my hon. Friend the Shadow Chancellor expressed in October
2007 was about how difficult it was for first-time buyers to get on to
the housing market because house prices were very high. They are lower
now, but it has continued to be difficult for many first-time buyers.
As a result of the credit crunch, it is generally necessary to have a
much larger deposit and the up-front costs of acquiring property can
deter many potential first-time buyers. One of those up-front costs is
stamp duty. An attempt to address that is a well-targeted policy to
assist first-time buyers and also to get the house market moving. I
come back to the intention behind the policy, which we do not
criticise. At a time when the housing market has been very slow and
when stabilisation in the housing market may well be a pre-cursor to
increased confidence in the economy as a whole, we think this remains a
timely, appropriate and beneficial
policy.</div><a name="09052163000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note the Minister&#146;s comments about there being no definition of
a first-time buyer in the new clause. We accept that this is a
complicated matter, but we do not accept that it cannot be addressed
within regulations. The Treasury could and should look at ways in which
first-time buyers can be helped through use of the stamp duty regime.
It is not included in the clause, but nor would one expect it to if the
Government were proposing it. It is the sort of matter routinely dealt
with in
regulations.</div><a name="09052163000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we will not oppose clause 10. We have concerns about the
way it has been presented as a policy by the Government. We rightly
question how effective it has been. We are doubtful about the way the
Government have made projections as to the cost of it, but its purpose
is admirable. However, it is not as effective and beneficial as our
proposal in new clause 3, which could provide an opportunity for a
first step on the housing ladder for hundreds of thousands of
first-time buyers. I commend new clause 3 to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="09052163000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000415"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Before I talk about clause 10 as a whole, I
will address a few comments to new clause 3, which has just been
introduced by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. We all wish
to help people who aspire to own a property, as so many in this country
do. It is a great rite of passage for many people; they regard it as
important not only as a financial investment but as a way to establish
themselves and their families in society as a
whole.</div><a name="09052163000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are genuine anxieties about how we define a first-time buyer. At the
moment, public finances are extremely stretched, to put it mildly. We
are borrowing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>roughly half a billion pounds every single day. Although the
Conservative party says that the policy is funded, it is reasonable to
consider whether we are achieving value for money with any tax
proposals. Without a definition of a first-time buyer, there is a
concern that people will exploit the opportunity entirely legally. I do
not mean that they will exploit in a bad way, but they will exploit it
in a way that is not beneficial to the taxpayer. The Minister gave a
possible scenario in which the beneficiaries were not those for whom
the clause was
intended.</div><a name="09052163000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also fear that there might be couples&#151;in middle age, for
example&#151;who bought a house in the man&#146;s name and who then
buy a second house in the woman&#146;s name, and she is a first-time
buyer. Unless I misunderstand the clause, she would be eligible to buy
a house under those criteria and, having never bought a house before,
would benefit. The couple could use the opportunity  to buy a
second property, which might supplement a  large first property
that was in the husband&#146;s name, in the scenario I have just
outlined. It is not clear that the beneficiaries would be people trying
to get on the housing ladder for the first time. They might, for
example, be people who live in multi-million pound houses for which the
mortgage is paid off but who fancy a second property&#151;perhaps a
holiday home&#151;and would benefit from the clause. That might be a
desirable way to spend public money in the view of other members of the
Committee, but I am not sure that it is the political pitch that is
being used to sell the clause to the wider
public.</div><a name="09052163000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000416"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): The hon.
Gentleman is a resourceful and intelligent man. It is not beyond him to
conceive of rules that would ensure limitations on this proposal in
order to target it more precisely at&#151;as he would
say&#151;those for whom we would most like to see that benefit. If he
acted more constructively, he would not oppose efforts to help
first-time buyers. He would help those of us who wish to help them in
the best possible
way.</div><a name="09052163000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000417"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
flattering comments. Even with all my wisdom, I do not think it is my
task to try to plug the holes in a Conservative party policy that was
dreamt up to try to put off the general election and win a round of
applause from an audience which was never invited to think how this
measure might work in practice. It is entirely reasonable to ask
whether the beneficiaries will be the people this policy is being
pitched at. It may well be that a large number of them are not. I do
not know whether there is an age threshold. If I, for example, had five
children, would I be able to buy each of them a new property at just
under &#163;250,000 each? Or does the person buying the property have
to be of a certain age? Would it be appropriate if they were adult
children? There are 
questions.</div><a name="09052163000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000418"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Will the hon.
Gentleman at least concede that there are international precedents for
discount on stamp duty for first-time buyers? I cannot recall whether
it is on a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>federal basis in Australia, but some of the states certainly operate or
have operated that system. If it can work in Australia in terms of the
definitional questions that he raised, it should work
here.</div><a name="09052163000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000419"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I suggest that the lesson to be drawn is that,
before he announces policy, the Conservative shadow Chancellor should
do his homework and speak to people in Australia and then we would not
be in the difficulties that we have talked about. This is all extremely
vague. I will move on to clause 10 in a moment.</div>
<a name="09052163000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know&#151;because the leader of the Conservative party tells
us&#151;that the 50p tax change is low in the list of priorities if
the Conservatives win the general election. What we have yet to find
out is where this item is in the list. It may be even further back in
the queue than the reversal of the 50p rate. I earlier asked a serious
question of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about someone
anticipating a Conservative win at the next general
election&#151;Conservative party members seem to think and behave as
if it were in the bag already. As there is only a year to go, someone
looking to buy property&#151;of course calculating whether the
property would change in value in the interim&#151;may delay the
purchase on the basis that they expect new clause 3 to be introduced
very soon after the general election. There is now uncertainty about
whether it will be so because these schemes and policies seem to be
revisited depending on how much scrutiny they are subjected to. It is
laudable for the Conservative party to try to help people in these
circumstances, but I fear that a little more rigour is required before
the party is judged worthy of office.</div>
<a name="09052163000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of clause 10 as a whole, the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire made the reasonable point, though with a generous caveat,
that the policy has not been a spectacular success if its purpose was
to encourage more people to buy properties for the first time at the
lower end of the market and so stimulate the housing market as a whole.
One could argue, in the shoes of a Government Minister, that the fall
in house prices would have been worse still had this measure not been
introduced last summer. Certainly, some very bold claims were made for
it. After that disastrous period when every estate agent in the country
suffered severe cash-flow problems while people waited for the
Government to introduce the policy which had been flagged up, there was
still a period when it was claimed that the policy was likely to be
successful; it was not.</div>
<a name="09052163000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is one big question we have to ask ourselves. There may be many people
on this Committee who own houses&#151;dare I say, more than
one&#151;but is it in the country&#146;s interests to keep an
overheated housing market overheated? The ratio of average salaries to
average house prices is big by any historical precedent. There is a
strong case to be made in the interests of people who do not own
property but aspire to do so and in the interests of the economy as a
whole for that ratio to be brought closer to traditional historical
levels. We are a lot closer now than we were seven or eight months ago.
Is it good use of taxpayers&#146; money to keep those ratios higher
than they have been historically and to encourage people to invest in
property rather than, for example, in innovative new
businesses?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000420"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for being so
clear, because he has laid out, as we approach a general election,
whenever it is, two policies that will obviously form part of the
Liberal Democrats&#146; manifesto. One is that they oppose support
for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder and, secondly, that
they support measures that will lead to a collapse in the already
fallen state of the property market, in order to close the ratios to
something that better fits the  hon. Gentleman&#146;s ideal
of the right mathematical
calculation.</div><a name="09052163000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000421"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Oh dear&#151;if that is the best that the
Conservative party can do, I fear that they are even further from
office than I had anticipated when I read new clause 3. I believe in
free market economics&#151;a shocking concept for Conservatives. I
break the news to the hon. Gentleman that the reason that house prices
are where they are is not that there is a man in an office in Whitehall
who comes up with all the prices; it is because of supply and demand,
and people deciding how much they will pay for a house. The person who
owns the house typically sells it to the person offering the most
money. That is how the system works. It is not decided by the Liberal
Democrats. We decide lots of things in this
country&#151;</div><a name="09052163000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000422"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Name
one.</div><a name="09052163000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000423"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> For example, the status of Gurkhas in the United
Kingdom&#151;many things. We set the pace in politics, as all members
of the Committee
know.</div><a name="09052163000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point&#151;a serious one&#151;is whether the policy of Government
should be to spend money on protecting the value of one type of asset
over another type of asset. Should money be taken from people who do
not own a house at all, in order to put an artificial floor under an
asset belonging to people who are in many cases far more prosperous? I
do not say that as Liberal Democrat policy. It is a reasonable question
for anyone to ask, and without asking it, proper consideration of the
clause seems
impossible.</div><a name="09052163000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000424"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I put it gently to the hon. Gentleman that not
taxing someone who is trying to get on the housing ladder for the first
is not the same as spending taxpayers&#146; money. Perhaps the
Liberal Democrats need to recognise that it is the people&#146;s
money that the Government tax and not the other way
around.</div><a name="09052163000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000425"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I take that point and understand what the hon.
Gentleman is saying. Equally, however, one could make the same point
about abolishing VAT on cars for people buying their first
car&#151;an aspiration that many young people have. In rural areas,
such as I represent, many people regard owning a car not just as an
aspiration, but as a social and economic necessity&#151;I shall not
go too far down this track, Mr. Atkinson&#151;after they
pass their test when they are 17 years old. One could say that that
would be a legitimate forfeiture of tax revenue. On the other hand, the
duty of people who cannot afford to own a car at all is not to
subsidise the cost of someone who is buying their first car. That was
my only point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div><a name="09052163000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">My wider point
was why first-time buyers are not buying property in the numbers that
clause 10 induces them to do&#151;new clause 3 seeks a similar
inducement. Is it because they are deterred by stamp duty levels? My
answer is: perhaps, to some extent. Clearly there is a marginal effect,
although in the overall scheme of things, when buying a new property,
it is not, I would contend, the biggest factor. I think that there are
three factors that cause more problems for people seeking to enter the
housing market than the deterrent effect of paying stamp duty at the
levels that we are talking
about.</div><a name="09052163000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first factor is the unwillingness of banks to lend money to people,
particularly those who do not already have a big asset. Under new
clause 3, the bank might be quite generous in its lending terms to a
person who has never bought a house and wishes to buy a holiday
cottage, but whose spouse owns outright a house worth &#163;1
million. However, what about first-time buyers, say, in their twenties,
who have managed to save up a bit of money? It is hard for people who
have left university and who are trying to establish themselves in a
place of work to accrue more than a few thousand pounds, unless they
inherit money or are given it as a gift. If they are looking to buy a
property for, say, &#163;150,000, they might need a deposit of about
20 per cent. of that sum&#151;&#163;30,000. I venture that the
inability of a person on typical wages or perhaps even double typical
wages to raise a &#163;30,000 deposit would be a much greater
deterrent to that person entering the housing market than a saving on
stamp duty. That is one reason why I fear that the provision will not
have the impact for which some might have
hoped.</div>
<a name="09052163000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I said I wanted to outline three factors that cause problems, but I
actually want to mention four. The second factor is that the market is
falling. Many people say that they aspire to get on the property
ladder&#151;they regard it as a rite of passage and something that
would be economically and socially beneficial to them&#151;but that
now is not a good time to buy because the properly market is falling on
average by the figures given by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire. The fall in the prices of some types of property, such
as one-bedroom or studio flats that might be particularly attractive to
first-time buyers, might often be greater than the
average.</div><a name="09052163000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite
a few people are choosing to rent until the market has picked up or at
least turned a corner, or they could be trying to save up a bit more of
a deposit. They would not be induced to buy a property because of the
stamp duty holiday. In fact, we could ask ourselves an interesting
moral question: should we want them be? I was citing the example of a
&#163;150,000 property. When the policy came into effect in the late
summer last year, the Government were trying to induce people to buy
that &#163;150,000 property. What is that property worth today?
Perhaps &#163;135,000. People were given a nominal incentive to buy
the house and their losses far outweigh the inducement they were given
by the Government to buy the house. I am not claiming that that is a
false prospectus, but if I had been lured into the housing market just
as it was falling rapidly, I might consider that the Government had not
done me such a big favour as they claimed to be doing at the
time.</div>
<a name="09052163000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000426"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am tempted to dwell on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the influence of the Liberal Democrats,
which suggests that they might be almost as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>influential as Joanna Lumley&#151;but by no means as pretty. He is
making an interesting observation, but it is very much a paternalistic
one, given his early remarks about belief in the free market. He now
seems to be arguing against individual responsibility for people making
house
purchases.</div><a name="09052163000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000427"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am not doing anything of the sort. Anyone who
has the money to buy property should be entirely free to do so. If they
judge for themselves that now is the time to make the purchase, that is
their decision. The question is whether our taxes should be used to
induce people to buy property, when we know with almost complete
certainty, as we did in late summer last year, that the value of their
asset would fall. People may think that it is up to the individual to
make that calculation, and it is. I was not saying that people should
be prevented from buying houses in those circumstances. They might take
a longer view and think that, in a 10 or 20-year scheme of things, that
is an intelligent purchase.</div>
<a name="09052163000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
my original point, I do not think that people were necessarily deterred
from buying houses primarily because of the level of stamp duty. They
were deterred, first, because they could not borrow enough money to
cover the mortgage costs and, secondly, because they were wary of a
falling housing market. I have two more
reasons.</div><a name="09052163000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000428"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> No one is suggesting that stamp duty is the key
component of anyone&#146;s decision not to buy a house at the moment.
As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire pointed out,
the hon. Gentleman contradicted himself by talking one minute about the
free market, and the next about inducements owing to the removal of
tax. If he were to accept that the forgoing of tax from first-time
buyers is a suitable policy instrument, would he not agree that the
time to implement it is when the housing market is in the doldrums, in
order to help to turn it around and to minimise the barriers to getting
on the housing market, rather than when prices are rising? Would he
introduce such an instrument then to further inflate a
bubble?</div><a name="09052163000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000429"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I apologise for my lack of clarity, Mr.
Atkinson. I was saying that I thought that the volume of sales and the
price of property are determined by supply and demand, not by the
state. The state can nibble away at the edges by giving tax
inducements, but primarily the factors governing price and turnover are
not in the gift of the state. Anyone can buy a house if they meet the
legal criteria and have the money. However, is the highest priority for
the taxpayer, at a time when the nation is borrowing &#163;20 million
every hour, to try to induce individuals to stretch themselves to buy a
property when the market is falling? Is that the best use of
taxpayers&#146; money?</div>
<a name="09052163000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
reasonable question, because someone is likely to have stretched
themselves a lot if the inducement of this stamp duty measure makes the
difference between making the purchase and not. We are talking right on
the margins&#151;those for whom that marginal benefit is sufficient
to make that decision. We are talking not about people putting down a
65 per cent. deposit and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>who are pretty secure in the housing market, but about people who might
have been lured into the market in late summer last year and now might
be facing repossession. That is a perfectly plausible scenario. Those
facing repossession might wonder why their money, as taxpayers, was
spent on luring them into those circumstances. My point was not about
the free market.</div>
<a name="09052163000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
reason is this: quite a lot of people are not only fearful about the
direction of the housing market&#151;indeed, some think that it is
beginning to turn a corner, although it is difficult to make that
judgment. One wants to be just ahead of the pack when coming to that
conclusion. However, there is a wider concern about the economy as a
whole and, specifically, about unemployment. Historically, there has
been a correlation between confidence in the housing market and levels
of unemployment. That correlation is stronger than the actual
percentage of the work force in unemployment would suggest.</div>
<a name="09052163000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the unemployed are not normally in a position to contemplate buying a
new property.  However, people&#146;s fear of unemployment is
often disproportionate to the statistical likelihood of their becoming
unemployed. For example, if one worked in a company with 100 employees
and it became evident that it was about to shed 10 per cent. of its
work force, all 100 employees might modify their behaviour accordingly
and hold back until they found out whether they were one of the lucky
90 or one of the unlucky 10. Of course, the reason that the Government
have temporarily reduced VAT is to try to give some sort of inducement
to people not to hold back because they are fearful of their future
economic prospects. In an earlier clause, the Government recognised
that there is that fear of the future in the population as a whole. I
contend that that fear is more likely to deter people from buying a
property, particularly at this level, than any inducement on stamp duty
that may or may not be given is likely to persuade them to
buy.</div>
<a name="09052163000345"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09052163000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final argument is more contentious, because it relates to what MPs
often say in their constituencies. They often say that, if we wish to
see property prices that are more affordable for more people who are
trying to get on the housing ladder, we need to see whether or not
prices will return closer to their historical ratio to average
earnings. However, in many parts of the country there is a shortage of
supply of housing. The reason why I say that this argument is
controversial is that a lot of MPs, of all parties, accept it in broad
terms, but then rush back to their constituencies to have their
photograph taken next to the site of any proposed housing development
on their patch, saying how hostile they are to any changes in their
constituency.</div>
<a name="09052163000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000430"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I was just wondering
if the hon. Gentleman would expand on what he said to his constituents
in Taunton, because he recognises the difficulty that
exists.</div><a name="09052163000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000431"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I shall not turn this into a very long speech
about Taunton&#151;unless people wish me to do so. However, Taunton
is quite a good case study, because the town is on a motorway and an
inter-city train line, with a population measured at 63,000 in the last
census. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Stick with me. Taunton has
been identified 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>by the Government as an area for potential extra development, because it
has some of those key transport infrastructure requirements.</div>
<a name="09052163000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
there is scope for extra development in Taunton. What I am
uncomfortable about is the type of top-down command view of housing
development. Because of the free market instincts that I talked about
earlier, I am not sure that what we need is not something a bit more
organic and incremental than an imposed target of 20,000 houses.
However, I do not doubt that there is a shortage of housing supply in
my constituency. People come to see me frequently to say that they
would like to see what we now call social housing, that they feel that
there is not enough of that type of housing and that they would like to
get on the housing ladder for the first time.</div>
<a name="09052163000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ratio of
wages to property values is particularly big in the south-west.
Although property values are quite a lot lower than those in London,
wages are a lot lower too. I think that the south-west may even have
the worst ratio of any region in the UK, in terms of the ability of
people who on typical pay to afford a typical property. Some people may
think that it is politically unwise of me to do so, but I often say to
residents in  my constituency that I support some extra housing
development, which should be mixed; it should not consist of one type
of property. There also needs to be an emphasis on property that is
realistically affordable for people who are seeking to get on the
housing ladder for the first time.</div>
<a name="09052163000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apart from in
some marginal cases, stamp duty is not a consideration that is the
determining factor for those people when deciding whether or not to
acquire a property. In many cases, it may be that the sheer shortage of
supply means that there are very few of those affordable properties on
display in the estate agent&#146;s window in the first
place.</div>
<a name="09052163000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000432"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I think that the statistic that the hon. Gentleman
cited is quite right, and that the south-west does have the widest
disparity between house prices and income levels. Does he therefore
agree with many of his parliamentary colleagues who campaign on banning
people from owning second homes in the south-west? Does he think that
such a ban might be a
solution?</div><a name="09052163000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000433"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am not in favour of the state telling people
where they can live. I suppose that the only caveat that I may add to
that statement is that there are some particularly unusual
circumstances, for example in national
parks&#151;</div><a name="09052163000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000434"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are going a little wide of the
clause.</div><a name="09052163000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000435"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Browne</b>: I shall not do a tour of national parks,
Mr. Atkinson. My central point is that in towns such as
Taunton many people seeking to become home owners for the first time
face the problem of a severe shortage of the types of property they
might regard as being in their price range, and that overrides any
considerations about stamp duty.</div>
<a name="09052163000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are my
four concerns: the difficulty of borrowing enough money; the falling
value of property, which means that the decision not to buy property
being taken 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>by many people is quite rational; the uncertainty about the future of
the economy, specifically with regard to unemployment, which deters
some people from buying property, and; the shortage of supply in many
parts of this country, particularly of the type of housing that is
attractive to first-time buyers. I maintain that those reasons weigh
more heavily with people trying to decide whether to buy than any stamp
duty holiday, be it that envisaged in clause 10 or that in new clause
3. We are having a perfectly interesting and worthwhile discussion, but
I fear we are labouring under the delusion that all those
considerations across the population as a whole can be influenced
heavily by tweaking a few of the knobs and pulling a few of the levers
available to the Government.</div>
<a name="09052163000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view is
that entirely rational decisions being made by millions of people,
combined with a free market in housing, are much more likely to make a
difference, and that is why I fear that some of the claims being made
by both Labour and Conservative politicians in that debate are rather
exaggerated.</div><a name="09052163000136"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000436"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> That was an interesting contribution from the hon.
Gentleman. I, too, shall be a little more candid than perhaps is
entirely wise. I hope that no one on this side of the Committee will be
too hard on me.</div>
<a name="09052163000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Luckily, some
of us do not have second homes&#151;well, actually, I do have a
second home, but it was paid for entirely out of my own resources
rather than anyone else&#146;s. About eight years after becoming a
Member of Parliament, I have discovered that there are some benefits in
representing an inner-London constituency that were not immediately
apparent when a variety of scams were being operated outside the public
gaze.</div>
<a name="09052163000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agreed with
much of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution, and if the under-30s
were twice as likely to vote as the over-55s, rather than the other way
round, I would bet that all Governments would do a lot more to tackle
the problems of housing supply. The reality is that it has been a
political issue, as much as anything else, to maintain a relatively
buoyant housing market, not least because those who are twice as likely
to vote&#151;the over-55s, rather than the youngsters&#151;also
tend to be home owners and their wishes have to be considered to a
large degree.</div>
<a name="09052163000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also agree
with the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument:
realistically, there is not much that most Governments can do. We have
a ludicrously complicated system of property in this country, and
adding layer upon layer of complication does not make things any
easier. I agree with our new clause 3 and think that it is fine, but it
would work only slightly, at the margins.</div>
<a name="09052163000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already
have in this country a capital gains tax exemption for main homes. That
ludicrous distortion has a knock-on effect, as the hon. Gentleman
rightly pointed out, in relation to investment for small business, and
it is in great contrast to the regime in many European countries. Many
elements of stamp duty land tax further distort the distortion, and
that is regrettable in many ways. For many people, property has become
the most important asset. I do not want to see peoples&#146;
aspirations cast aside, but let us be absolutely honest about it: home
ownership, given the chaotic lifestyles and earning patterns of many
people, should not necessarily be regarded  as a
right.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div><a name="09052163000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000437"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b><b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman is making an extremely
interesting speech, which I have to assume does not reflect current
Conservative policy. I am sure that he has read about extraordinarily
advanced societies in western Europe where home ownership is far less
prevalent and less sought after&#151;for example, Germany and
Switzerland&#151;and of very poor societies where home ownership in
is sought after but to no effect. We seem to have an unusual
fixation.</div>
<a name="09052163000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000438"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> We do have that fixation. Let us be honest, home
ownership provides stability and, potentially, collateral for doing
other things&#151;or it has done in the past. The crux of some of the
present financial problems is in the sub-prime market and the idea from
the mid-90s in Clinton Democrat America that home ownership should be
encouraged. The financial services industry in the United States
created products for people who should never have owned property, given
their chaotic earning patterns, and I sense that we risk the same
happening
here.</div><a name="09052163000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
Englishman&#146;s home is his castle&#151;a great aspiration. As
someone who bought their first property at the earliest opportunity, at
23, I would not say that people should not aspire to it, but we have to
realise that for many people it can be a mirage. They go down a path to
property ownership and quickly find that it is more of a shackle than a
benefit. Part of the difficulty has been that miss-selling and poor
returns has shattered the savings and pensions industry&#146;s
reputation, so it was logical for many
people&#151;</div><a name="09052163000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000439"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon.
Gentleman. He is making a very interesting speech, but it is meant to
be about stamp duty land tax.</div>
<a name="09052163000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000440"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> It is fair enough that you pulled me up,
Mr. Atkinson, but the point I was trying to make was that
there has been a herd-like mentality&#151;a logical one, particularly
for those in their 20s and 30s&#151;to aspire to own property. I am
not apportioning blame&#151;this is about the political
establishment, although probably not as far back as the last Liberal
Government. Even the hon. Member for Taunton will acknowledge that
successive Governments have found ways to complicate the system ever
more. I am not suggesting that we can start with a blank sheet of
paper, because that, inevitably, is difficult. We have a crazily
complicated system for housing. The notion that a main home is a
capital gains tax-free investment is not prevalent around the world and
is perhaps peculiar to this country. It has been a huge distortion,
which has, obviously, led to tinkering with stamp duty land
tax.</div><a name="09052163000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to make only a brief contribution. I am comfortable agreeing to
new clause 3, but ideally we, the whole political class, would have the
benefit of a more open and broad debate which considered the
distortions, the public&#146;s aspirations and why our system is
different. I suspect that historical reasons surround the disparity
between the situation here and that which pertains in other European
countries, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire points
out.</div>
<a name="09052163000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000441"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting
speech about not assuming that owning a house is a right and about
downsides as well as upsides to property ownership. However, I would
not wish anyone to infer from what I said that I was hostile to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>people&#146;s aspirations. I observe only that those who say how
desirable it would be for more people to rent rather than own property
almost invariably own property themselves.</div>
<a name="09052163000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000442"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I agree, and I am not downplaying people&#146;s
aspirations. If one reads <i class="I">The </i><i class="I">Sunday Times</i> money pages,
as we all do, every week people say that their best investment has been
property, and over a 30 or 40-year period that seemed to be the case.
With lower interest rates and political pressures, which make bringing
supply and demand together difficult, that may not be the case for
years to come. For the first seven of the 20 years that I have owned
property, between 1988 and 1995, there was no capital gain, and of
course since 1995 up until the last year or two, property has been a
terrifically good
investment.</div><a name="09052163000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
<a name="09052163000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
tinkering at the edges and there needs to be a more sensible debate,
beyond a slanging match between political parties that suggests that
one side does not look to help first-time or aspiring buyers. Such a
slanging match takes out some of the real problems that we all face
with planning applications in our constituencies&#151;well, I
probably do not. Many more properties need to be built, but ideally
some five or 10 miles outside my constituency, from where we will reap
the benefits but not get any of the downside. I hope that we can have
sensible debates on the matter in the future, and that sense will
prevail and new clause 3 will be added to the Bill. However, I suspect
that that will be another hope and aspiration that will not be
fulfilled, at least not
now.</div><a name="09052163000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000443"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall respond briefly and try to focus my
remarks precisely on new clause 3 and clause 10. I do not want to go
over old ground with the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire,
regarding some of the comments that appeared in the press last August.
However, I want to emphasise that, although the press speculate daily
on many aspects of Government policy, that does not make them right. As
I said at the time, the press comments were unhelpful. I do not feel
the need to say anything more on the matter, but I would
like to respond to some of the hon. Gentleman
more substantive
points.</div><a name="09052163000151"></a>
        <div class="hs_Para">I confirm that the estimated impact of the holiday 
          on the Exchequer is &#163;340 million, which includes the cost of the 
          extension announced in the Budget. It is right to say that we have looked 
          closely at the costs. It is not possible to estimate precisely the impact 
          on transactions because we are dealing with a counter-factual situation&#151;what 
          would have happened in the absence of a stamp duty land tax holiday. 
          In the pre-Budget report we said that the figure was &#163;280 million 
          and we revised that down in the Budget to &#163;250 million plus the 
          extra &#163;90 million for the September to December 2009 extension. 
          On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on disadvantaged areas, there 
          is no need to disapply the &#163;150,000 figure because the &#163;175,000 
          threshold makes that unnecessary. However, once the holiday ends, policy 
          will go back to what it was, and the limits will be &#163;125,000 generally 
          and &#163;150,000 in disadvantaged areas.</div>
        <a name="09052163000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also made some significant play of saying that it was
simple to define first-time buyers in regulation. That is not the
experience in Ireland, where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>we have been told that rules defining a first-time buyer run to more
than seven pages. There are some complex issues here, a number of which
were pointed out by the hon. Member for Taunton. There are issues
regarding divorcing couples, there is the overseas example that I gave
in my initial remarks, and there are issues regarding the
administrative burdens of potentially implementing this as a
policy.</div><a name="09052163000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000444"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Has the Economic Secretary looked at the example of
Australia? He mentioned Ireland, but I understand that Australia
successfully introduced a similar
scheme.</div><a name="09052163000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000445"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My officials are certainly aware of the
Australian scheme and have looked extensively at a number of
issues.</div><a name="09052163000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000446"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Economic Secretary give
way?</div><a name="09052163000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000447"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not saying that it is impossible to do so,
but I am pointing out that it is not as simple and straightforward as
was perhaps suggested by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
when he moved the new
clause.</div><a name="09052163000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000448"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Economic Secretary for giving way
again; he is being most generous. He says that his officials looked at
the Australian example extensively. Surely after such a considerable
look, they must have come up with some conclusions or lessons that
could be
learned.</div><a name="09052163000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000449"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We believe that the policy of the holiday that we
introduced on 2 September is targeted, temporary and timely. It was
right in the circumstances not to favour first-time buyers over other
buyers of properties with a value lower than
&#163;175,000.</div><a name="09052163000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton&#146;s interesting speech covered many areas
and not just his concerns over first-time buyers. He spoke of other
factors that people take account of when buying a home. Everybody
recognises that people take many circumstances into account when
considering a house purchase. Even following his lengthy speech, I am
not sure whether he is in favour of the principle of a stamp duty
holiday or even of a stamp duty threshold. The Government have made it
clear that we see this measure as temporary and
targeted.</div><a name="09052163000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will respond briefly to the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster. I do not wish to speak about his comments on capital gains
tax, but I do want to rebut his implied criticism of Government policy.
It has not been an instrument of Government policy, as he seemed to
suggest, to keep house prices high to help over-50s because they are
more likely to vote than under-30s. On the contrary, the Government
have set extremely ambitious house building targets, which have been
alluded to. We want those targets to be met. We want people to be able
to rent or buy the roof over their heads. That is Government
policy.</div><a name="09052163000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000450"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am surprised that the Liberal Democrat spokesman
did not leap to his feet. Just for the elimination of doubt, it was
clear to me from what he said that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>was utterly opposed to special relief for first-time buyers. He thought
that it was impracticable and we seem to be opposed to it in
principle.</div><a name="09052163000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000451"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Member for Taunton has put his comments
on the record. I happily give way to
him.</div><a name="09052163000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000452"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> For the avoidance of doubt, if the Conservative
party comes up with coherent, well-researched, thought-through and
practical policies that would be of benefit to my constituents, I will
be sympathetic to them. However, it would be embarrassing for the
Conservative party and the country if policies such as new clause 3
were included in the Finance
Bill.</div><a name="09052163000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000453"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> For the reasons I explained in my introductory
remarks, I do not believe that new clause 3 should be supported. It
would not be effective. If the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire
presses it to a vote, I invite my colleagues to oppose it and to
support clause
10.</div><a name="09052163000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000454"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I do not intend to go over the debate again. I
appreciate that we will not vote immediately on the new clause. I am
not persuaded by the Minister&#146;s comments. I note he said that it
is not impossible for first-time buyers to be defined. When there is an
opportunity, we will press new clause 3 to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000455"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> May I begin by welcoming you back to the Chair,
Mr.
Atkinson?</div><a name="09052163000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
12 relates to the levels of tobacco duty, which are superficially not
particularly controversial. We do not oppose the increases in duty.
However, a number of questions need to be asked about the
Government&#146;s approach to the structure of tobacco duty and<i class="I">
</i>I hope the Minister will provide some answers in her response. The
effect of duty increases on illegal supplies is also a concern,
particularly if sterling recovers ground against the euro.</div>
<a name="09052163000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
less familiar with the structure of tobacco duty, I will briefly run
through it&#151;partly because it is more complicated than one might
initially expect. I was a smoker for some years and used to await the
announcement of the Budget and the number of pence it put on a packet
of cigarettes. I imagined that the way it was arrived at was very
simplistic; it is actually quite complicated.</div>
<a name="09052163000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
specific parts to tobacco duty. The first is called a specific duty,
which is a set amount of duty. It translates into duty on a per-packet
basis, but is assessed on a number of pounds per 1,000 cigarettes. As
we see in clause 12, that is to rise to &#163;114.31 per 1,000
cigarettes, up from &#163;112.07 prior to 22 April. That is a rise of
two per cent., which translates to the average packet of
cigarettes&#151;an interesting concept that I will come back
to&#151;to approximately &#163;2.29 of specific
duty.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div><a name="09052163000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Added to that
is the ad valorem element, which is a percentage of the total price of
the retail price of a packet of cigarettes. That was increased in the
pre-Budget report from 22 per cent. to 24 per cent. That is important
for our considerations, because that percentage is calculated after
that has been applied to a packet.</div>
<a name="09052163000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with the
alcohol duties that we debated a couple of weeks ago, the context of
clause 12 is last November&#146;s pre-Budget report and the
Government&#146;s late-in-the-day efforts to offset the revenue they
were going to lose through the cut in VAT by increasing tobacco duties.
In the case of tobacco, it raised the ad valorem element of the
duty on cigarettes by 2 per cent. to a total of 24 per
cent.</div>
<a name="09052163000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
figures were designed to be roughly equivalent, with the fall in VAT
and the rise in ad valorem more or less offsetting each other when fed
through to a change in the retail price of a packet of cigarettes. The
pre-Budget report left the specific fix element of the duty unaltered
and that change corresponded quite well to the VAT loss. However, like
the alcohol duties when VAT returns to 17.5 per cent. in January 2010,
there will be some important and significant effects on the overall
pricing level of cigarettes.</div>
<a name="09052163000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
corresponded with the pre-Budget report because the ad valorem duty, as
I have explained, is a proportional tax on the retail price of
cigarettes. However, it has a unique feature: because it is a tax on
the price of a packet of cigarettes, including the margin for the
specific duty under VAT, this is a tax that taxes tax. In other words,
the percentage of ad valorem is applied to VAT and other charges. There
is therefore a consequent multiplier effect on the amount of tax paid
as the cost of a packet of cigarettes increases.</div>
<a name="09052163000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">That might
seem esoteric, and perhaps not particularly relevant, but it has
important consequences for the market price of a packet of cigarettes:
the ad valorem duty widens the differential between the tax on cheaper
brands and the tax on premium brands. That was true, of course, well
before the pre-Budget report came along. The price gap between the
cheapest cigarettes and premium brands, such as Marlboro or Rothmans,
has increased from less than a pound to nearly two pounds in the last
six years&#151;a considerable change so far this decade.</div>
<a name="09052163000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
increasing element to the ad valorem tax has incentivised the new super
low-priced brands that have either been around for many years, or those
that have entered or re-entered the market, such as Pall
Mall.</div>

packet of Pall Mall cigarettes retailed at around &#163;4.20 before
the increases in the Budget, and a packet of Marlboro cigarettes
retailed at around &#163;5.80. That was after the increase in ad
valorem, but before the increase 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>in specific duties. The sales figures show that there appears to have
been a general shift in consumption towards cheaper brands, which may
be expected because the tax regime changed, and people react against
duty rises that disproportionately affect mid-priced and premium
cigarettes.</div><a name="09052163000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
the Government appear to recognise that ad valorem duty has ratcheted
up the differential, which is where their problems begin. Members of
the Committee may be aware&#151;as a member of the European Scrutiny
Committee, I am certainly aware&#151;that the European Commission
recently consulted on the structure and rates of excise duty that are
applied to cigarettes and other manufactured tobacco. It subsequently
published a draft directive, which I will address in due course. The
Government submitted quite a lengthy document in response to the
consultation, which can be downloaded from the European Union website.
I think that it is also available on the European Scrutiny Committee
website.</div><a name="09052163000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document is called, &#147;Response to the Commission&#146;s
Consultation Paper on the structure and rates of excise duty applied on
cigarettes and other manufactured tobacco&#148;, and it is a detailed
and very well reasoned response. Referring to the problem that I have
just outlined, the Government&#146;s paper
states:</div><a name="09052163000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under
an ad valorem regime, this multiplier effect makes it more costly for
producers to raise the pretax price, which has implications on the
behaviour of producers in imperfectly competitive markets such as
tobacco, which is characterised by small numbers of large firms. The
multiplier effectively increases the marginal revenue a supplier in
such a market perceives and this means it is then profitable for the
supplier to lower prices and raise
output.&#148;</div><a name="09052163000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the Government&#146;s position is that a large amount of
ad valorem incentivises producers to raise profits by lowering prices
and raising output. That raises an interesting question as to whether
we want Government policy to make tobacco manufacturers lower prices
and raise output. That is exactly what is happening, which is surely
contrary to the health objectives of the tobacco duty
policy.</div><a name="09052163000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, the ad valorem element of duty is an EU requirement. This is
not a speech against the ad valorem element, but raising it is not an
EU requirement. Taxing the tax on cigarettes increases the price
advantage of cheaper varieties without any convincing rationale from
the Government in either revenue or health terms. Indeed, in revenue
terms, the sale of cheaper brands is, on the face of it, negative for
public finances, as less ad valorem will be brought
in.</div><a name="09052163000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
did the Government think that the higher ad valorem duty that they
introduced in November was a good idea? Reading their response to the
EU consultation, one would think not, because they made it clear that
they believed
that</div><a name="09052163000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is a strong case for specific duties as the only option for taxing
tobacco products.&#148;</div>
<a name="09052163000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">So suddenly the
Government were saying that we should only have the specific duty and
get rid of the ad valorem duty, just months before they bumped up the
ad valorem duty in the PBR. That makes no sense. Specific duties are,
of course, the other element of the tax on cigarettes and are based on
the weight of tobacco involved, not the price of any particular
brand.</div><a name="09052163000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
spell it out, by arguing for specific taxes as the only option in their
response to the EU, the Government argued that the ad valorem tax
should be scrapped 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>altogether when the EU approves a new directive on this subject. But in
the PBR, the Government went in completely the opposite direction,
raising the ad valorem part of the duty and leaving the specific part
where it was. I accept that the PBR was neutral on revenue and prices.
However, following the Budget, November&#146;s change to the ad
valorem rate has proved to be far from neutral. It altered the
structure within which other changes are now occurring like the changes
in clause 12.</div>
<a name="09052163000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The increases
in specific duty will now widen the gap between cheap and expensive
cigarettes by far more than would have been the case due to the
November steep increases in ad valorem. This will hold true for any
future increases in specific duty or in other matters such as
production costs. When VAT returns to 17.5 per cent., the gap will
widen again because the ad valorem duty taxes the tax on cigarettes. So
the VAT increase will lead to an even larger rise in the price of a
packet of cigarettes because of the increase in the ad valorem as it is
assessed on the VAT.</div>
<a name="09052163000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
clear to me why the Government are set to take this course. There are
no apparent health benefits associated with cheaper cigarettes. I have
even seen arguments that cheaper cigarettes may be less healthy than
premium brands. The justification for having the duty in the first
place ultimately rests on health grounds. When the Exchequer Secretary
to the Treasury justified maintaining prices in line with inflation
last year, she said that it was because it
would</div><a name="09052163000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;continue
to encourage people to smoke less or to give
up&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Finance Public
Bill Committee, </i>15 May 2008; c.
221.]</div><a name="09052163000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my view, increases in ad valorem duty encourage people to trade down in
terms of what they spend on a packet of cigarettes by changing brand,
as much as they encourage people to smoke less or to give up. That is
not just my argument. The Government even argue that the change will
encourage trading down more than it will encourage smoking cessation.
This is another line from their response to the EU consultation. They
said:</div><a name="09052163000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Specific
duties are the most effective way of maintaining high prices for
tobacco products and thus encouraging people to reducing smoking or
quit&#148;.</div><a name="09052163000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore
it is quite extraordinary that since the PBR the Government have done
exactly the opposite of what they themselves told the EU that they
regarded as being effective. This was not that long ago. It is just
over a year or a year and a half ago that they made this submission to
the EU. So the only charitable conclusion is that the PBR changes were
as hurried and botched in relation to tobacco as they were in relation
to alcohol. It may have seemed to make sense to offset the
Chancellor&#146;s cut in VAT by hiking ad valorem duty because as a
one-off short-term measure the correlation was close, but in the medium
term it simply is not and its main impact has been to widen the duty
differential between cheaper brands and premium
ones.</div><a name="09052163000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government stand condemned by their own words. As they said in their
submission to the
EU:</div><a name="09052163000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Substantial
evidence shows that younger smokers are more price sensitive, and the
existence of cheaper cigarettes tends to make individuals more likely
to smoke, and to make smokers less likely to give up. Specific duty, in
increasing the price of all cigarettes, deters the taking up of
smoking, and encourages smokers to reduce their consumption and
quit.&#148;</div><a name="09052163000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an absolutely clear-cut case for raising specific duty, rather than
ad valorem, a regime that the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>wanted to see abolished in their response. Specific duty is the one most
likely to lead to smoking cessation, not ad
valorem.</div><a name="09052163000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000458"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I wonder whether, like me, he hopes that the
Minister will be able to reassure us that lower price cigarettes do not
have a higher tar content on average than higher price cigarettes,
because that would certainly compound the already powerful case that my
hon. Friend is making against this obviously ill-thought-through
measure.</div><a name="09052163000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000459"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. With
the huge variety of brands out there&#151;some of them new, others
counterfeit or fake&#151;I expect that it might be difficult to make
that generalisation. However, I think that that is an important point.
Another relevant point is the example of revenue&#151;certainly,
lower priced cigarettes generate less revenue for the
Treasury.</div><a name="09052163000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000460"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> I am
happy to deal with the issues when I respond to the debate, but I say
now that it will be helpful for all of us, for all sorts of reasons, if
we did not mix up counterfeit with genuine, legally available
cigarettes&#151;the two need to be thought about separately. That
would help us deal with some of the issues raised by the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09052163000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000461"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Exchequer Secretary raises an important point,
but to be fair, neither my hon. Friend nor I were mixing up the two. In
terms of the actual impact of the amount of tar, I was saying that it
would be difficult to effect some kind of generalisation because some
fake brands do not tell us on the packet how much tar there
is.</div>
<a name="09052163000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000462"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The fake brands do not always contain what they say
they do, which is why it is important to separate the cigarettes made
and sold legally from the counterfeit products. They are totally
separate, and we will have a much clearer and more focused debate if we
do not mix the two
up.</div><a name="09052163000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000463"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Of course the Minister is right, but she is making
my point for me. In response to my hon. Friend, I pointed out that it
was difficult to effect some kind of generalisation about the overall
tar content for all the cigarettes that are consumed in the UK. Due to
those varied considerations, she is helping me to make my own
point.</div><a name="09052163000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nub of the matter is that the Government could have addressed the
weaknesses of the pre-Budget report in the Bill. The Budget was an
opportunity to replace a temporary measure with a sensible, overall
structure. Unfortunately, they appear to have missed the chance. The
Government can still consider re-balancing the structure of taxation in
January 2010, when the VAT rise kicks in. I will be grateful if the
Minister can confirm whether the Government intend to leave the ad
valorem duty at 24 per cent. in January 2010. As I said, the rise in
VAT will increase the tax on cigarettes by more than the VAT
itself.</div><a name="09052163000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
argument could be made for that position, but why would the Government
want to nurture super-low price brands at the expense of premium
brands? I am interested in the Minister&#146;s argument as to why she
thinks that that should be the case in our tobacco duty
structure.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div><a name="09052163000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also, as I
said, conflicts with the Government&#146;s own reasoning in their
response to the EU consultation. There is already a significant move in
this country to low and super-low price brands from premium ones.
According to ACNielsen, the market research company, the market share
of premium brands has fallen from 28.5 per cent. to 25.9 per cent. in
just the past two and a half years, between 2006 and 2008. Meanwhile,
the super-low market share has gone from 41.6 per cent. to 45.1 per
cent. in the same period&#151;a pretty big increase in less than
three years. That is most likely due to the changes in tax. Indeed, the
tax differential between premium and super-low brands has increased
from just 10 per cent. at the beginning of that period to 14 per cent.
now&#151;quite a significant change in a tax differential.</div>
<a name="09052163000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
thinking about the impact that all that has on tax yields. For every 1
per cent. of consumption that trades down from premium to super-low
brands, the Government lose approximately &#163;11.5 million in tax
revenue.</div><a name="09052163000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth looking at the EU consultation and directive again in more
detail because it will dictate the future of the tobacco duty regime in
this country. The Commission, when setting out its consultation,
broadly suggested four areas that it might pursue. The first one is
replacing the most popular price category&#151;the MPPC&#151;with
weighted average prices as a reference point for the whole European
Community, claiming that it would address health objectives in a more
efficient manner. It is saying that there should be higher specific
duty, which is the point I started with. Secondly, it talks about
aligning the taxation of cigarettes and fine cut tobacco or
roll-your-own or hand-rolling tobacco&#151;HRT as I believe it is
called&#151;to reduce the substitution effect. In other words, people
give up smoking ready-rolled cigarettes in favour of hand-rolling
tobacco. Thirdly, it talks about increasing the minimum rate
requirement for cigarettes and fine cut tobacco to combat illicit
trading&#151;which we have already talked about&#151;and to address
health concerns, and finally amending the existing definition of
cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco to deter tax avoidance and
evasion.</div>
<a name="09052163000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09052163000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of the EU consultation, there are broadly seven proposals in
the draft directive&#151;indeed, abolishing the MPPC as the reference
point, which is good news for those who prefer a higher rate of
specific duties, with the alternative of a cash minimum to be applied
to all cigarettes, not just to those in the MPPC, of around
&#163;50.50 for 1,000 cigarettes. It would not affect the price in
this country because we are already above that. There are various other
suggestions. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister what
response the Government had made to the draft directive, which was
cleared by the European Scrutiny Committee last autumn.</div>
<a name="09052163000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a related
topic, I wonder whether the Minister has looked at what various EU
members do and what consideration she has given to a minimum duty on
tobacco products. That is not a minimum price but a minimum level of
duty. Twenty of the 27 EU countries already have such a scheme.
Ireland, for example, has a minimum duty. What consideration has she
given to the Irish experience? In Sweden and Denmark, having a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>minimum level of duty actually raised tax revenue because it made
cheaper brands more expensive, thereby increasing the overall tax
revenue because the ad valorem part, the specific duty, would take in
more&#151;and indeed the ad valorem. It closes the differential
between the cheaper brands and the premium brands and, in Sweden and
Denmark at least, it showed an increase in tax revenue. It might also
curb the increase in lower-priced tobaccos and thereby raise more duty.
I would be grateful to hear whether the Minister had looked at the
experience, in particular in Ireland, but also in the other 19 EU
countries that have such a system.</div>
<a name="09052163000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning from
the structure of tobacco taxation&#151;although the structure does
bear on my next question&#151;we need to ask how close further duty
increases will take us to the revenue maximisation point with tobacco
duty. The Minister admitted in last year&#146;s Finance Bill debates
that we were close to this point, and I think she said the same in
relation to the PBR and the debate on the statutory instrument in
January this year that resulted from the PBR. In the Committee of the
whole House the Minister talked about whether we might have reached the
tax maximisation point with tobacco. We now have another increase, with
a further increase in prices expected as a result of the VAT rise in
January 2010. It would be helpful to have her current view on revenue
maximisation. Discussing the PBR changes in the debate on the statutory
instrument in January&#151;which raised the ad valorem element from
22 to 24 per cent.&#151;she
said:</div><a name="09052163000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
we are close to revenue maximisation, we might go closer to or just
beyond that point and, in that context, there is a risk that smuggling
might undermine the helpful revenue benefits of the real increase in
tobacco taxes.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Second Delegated
Legislation Committee, </i>13 January 2009; c.
22.]</div><a name="09052163000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
acknowledge that progress has been made on smuggling. HMRC and UKBA
have a joint strategy, although the tone of last year&#146;s launch
document was perhaps a little self-congratulatory given the levels of
illicit tobacco that remained in this country. For example, when
discussing hand-rolling tobacco, as loose tobacco is normally termed,
the document put the illicit market share at a huge 53 per cent. Its
estimate of a 13 per cent. illicit share for the much larger cigarette
market also needs to be placed in context.</div>
<a name="09052163000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Imperial
Tobacco, for example, suggests that 37 per cent. of the cigarettes
smoked in the UK fall outside the UK duty regime. When we are debating
the amount of duty that we might be taking in, that is an incredible
amount. Imperial Tobacco, which is, I think, one of the largest three
or four tobacco manufacturers, suggests that 37 per cent. of what is
smoked in this country does not have UK duty paid on it. In other
words, for more than one in every three cigarettes, the Treasury gets
absolutely nothing. Clearly many of those are not illicit&#151;the
Minister was right to draw that distinction&#151;but they all
represent lost revenue to the Treasury.</div>
<a name="09052163000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
also consider the effect of the exchange rate. Some of the pressure on
tobacco imports of all kinds&#151;illicit and legal&#151;has been
eased by the fall in sterling, which has meant that super-low brands
have become cheaper in the UK than in France. That must be the first
time that that has happened&#151;certainly for 20 years, but perhaps
ever since tobacco was discovered in the 17th century. Thinking about
all-time historic changes, it is worth remembering that, at the moment,
sterling is very close to its historic low against the euro and its
predecessor currencies, such as the French franc.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div><a name="09052163000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are living
in interesting times, but we cannot rely on sterling remaining very low
against the euro to reduce tobacco importation over a long time. I do
not think that smuggling has been stopped or eliminated. We have to be
aware of that. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
views about what the Government are doing. It would also be interesting
to know what effect the Government think any significant recovery in
sterling would have on the joint smuggling strategy and wider
policy.</div><a name="09052163000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
area of revenue loss that we should examine is the new threat of
so-called non-domestic brands&#151;or &#147;cheap
whites&#148;&#151;which we mentioned earlier. Those are brands that
are not counterfeits, but that resemble those available in the UK. They
are what I call in vernacular terms fake brands, which are ostensibly
manufactured for the home markets of the countries in which they are
produced&#151;eastern Europe, Russia, China and elsewhere. Duty is
often paid in those countries, even though it is never intended that
those products will be consumed there. Anybody who knows anything about
tobacco duty will know that it is very low in countries such as Russia
and China. It can still make sense to produce the product there, even
though it is intended for export from the very beginning. However,
instead of being smoked there, after manufacture, the cigarettes are
either smuggled directly to countries such as the UK, or moved
legitimately via other hubs&#151;particularly Poland, but also
Germany&#151;from where they find their way
here.</div>
<a name="09052163000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
November, which is the most recent month for which I have data from
HMRC, interestingly, 47 per cent. of seizures were of those
&#147;cheap whites&#148;. They are a significant part of the non-UK
duty paid part of the cigarette market. I do not know whether other
members of the Committee have come across those fake brands, but the
industry is finding an ever-increasing number of those &#147;cheap
whites&#148; when it conducts pack sampling of the rubbish left
behind at events such as football matches and concerts. That might
sound like an obscure thing to refer to, but it is standard practice in
the cigarette industry to do pack sampling exercises. People from the
industry go to somewhere where there has been a big assembly of people
and look at the detritus left
behind.</div><a name="09052163000215"></a>

real brand of cigarettes and I suppose, in a sense, they are a real

this topic. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> However, can he clarify
whether the sale of these fake brands or &#147;cheap whites&#148;
is legal or illegal in the UK?</div>
<a name="09052163000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000475"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> That is a very interesting question, which I hope
the Minister will respond to in due course. It is a very interesting
question about how we control this level of activity. The person who
has imported the produce is almost certainly committing an offence.
However, it is unclear if the person at the point of sale is also
committing an offence. I am told that most of the sales of these goods
happens in places such as pubs or street markets. I would be grateful
if the Minister gave a precise explanation of what illegalities have
been committed in the sale process and, if there have been any, when
and by who?</div>
<a name="09052163000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the issue of &#147;cheap whites&#148;, I am told that a brand
called Jin-Ling is the most prevalent, but there are dozens of
different brands. Oddly enough, it appears that smokers who buy their
cigarettes on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>black market still appreciate a bogus aura of authenticity, which I have
already referred to by giving the example of the lookalike B&amp;H
product.</div><a name="09052163000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the eastern European manufacturers of these products oblige their
customers by replicating the UK health warnings on the packet. I am not
sure what that says about the effectiveness of the health warnings.
However, it will be interesting to see if these manufacturers stop
copying the health warnings when they start to include images, which I
think will be used in due course.</div>
<a name="09052163000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
non-domestic brands are a serious problem. They cannot be tackled
through the agreement of the big UK suppliers that has helped to bring
down the quantities of illicit tobacco in recent years. Getting the
Governments who host these non-domestic brand manufacturers to take
action is difficult, but it will be crucial.</div>
<a name="09052163000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I will
just give the example of Jin-Ling, which I think is manufactured in
Kaliningrad. That itself raises an interesting question. Kaliningrad is
part of the Russian Federation but it has a very interesting legal
structure. I know that, having been there. I will not stray into the
realm of discussing my wife&#146;s family, but I happen to know a
fair bit about Kaliningrad. Consequently, I would be interested to know
what representations the Minister, or the Foreign Office on her behalf,
have made to other countries&#151;not only Russia but
Poland&#151;about strengthening the border controls near Kaliningrad,
with reference to tobacco smuggling.</div>
<a name="09052163000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another interesting question. Which Governments have duty receipts that
far outstrip the domestic consumption of these brands? That should
certainly act as a warning signal for those countries; they will know
at that point that they have a problem.</div>
<a name="09052163000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Treasury is aware of this issue and the joint smuggling strategy,
published by HMRC and  the UK Borders Agency in November,
identified it as the key threat in the future. It would be helpful if
the Minister could outline what steps have been taken since November in
relation to the products&#146; countries of
origin.</div>
<a name="09052163000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09052163000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the structure of tobacco taxation, there are important questions
outstanding to which we are owed a response. First, why have the
Government seemingly reversed their own policy on ad valorem duty?
Secondly, do they recognise the problems that has caused and which, in
effect, they predicted in their submission to the European Commission?
Thirdly, why did they not address them in the Bill? Fourthly, will they
re-band the structure of cigarette taxation in January 2010, when VAT
is raised
again?</div><a name="09052163000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ironically,
the Commission&#146;s draft directive supports the shift towards
specific duty that the Government outlined in their submission. The
draft calls for minimum rates of taxation to be increased and
proportional rates to be lowered. In conclusion, do the Government
still want what they asked for when they made their submission to the
EU as part of their consultation in 2008?</div>
<a name="09052163000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000476"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b>: I feel there is not much that I can add to
that rigorously researched contribution, although I thought it was thin
on the different types of tobacco 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>manufacturing in different parts of the Russian Federation. I would have
appreciated greater detail before deciding whether I wish to support
clause 12, but I will have to operate in the dark, so to speak, and
make that decision less well informed than it might otherwise have
been.</div><a name="09052163000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will ask three brief questions. The first is on the issue drawn out at
length by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham: differentials
between premium brands and lower-price brands. He put figures on them,
but&#151;anecdotally&#151;one can see displays of cigarettes in
shops and the prominence afforded to the lower-price brands compared to
10, 15, or 20 years ago, when the big household name brands such as
Marlboro would have been more prominent and consumed more space on
retailers&#146; shelves. That is a serious problem, partly because
young people who wish to smoke more are likely to be drawn to the lower
premium brands for price reasons, and partly because the Government are
losing revenue even if the total number of cigarettes sold is the same.
The Minister needs to address
that.</div><a name="09052163000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue is smuggling. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham
estimated that 37 per cent. of cigarettes smoked in the United Kingdom
had not had UK duty paid on them. Some of those cigarettes would have
been entirely properly brought into this country by someone returning
from holiday, for example, but it is well known that a large number of
cigarettes are smuggled into the country. A number of problems
associated with that. One is that the Treasury makes no revenue on
those cigarettes at all. The other problem is that smuggling penalises
legal retailers of
tobacco.</div><a name="09052163000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
must be extremely galling to sell cigarettes and comply with the law
only to have someone outside the shop or round the corner selling the
same cigarettes, or a very good replica, at a substantially reduced
price, which risks putting the conventional retailer out of business.
Even though it ought not to be a temptation, the inducement is for
legal retailers to sell non-legal smuggled products under the counter.
They might conclude that they would like to have a share of that
market. If all the people in that locality buy cigarettes illegally,
the only way that retailers can remain viable as a business is to seek
to move into that illegal part of the market. That puts them in a
severe moral quandary, and I do not want people put in that
position.</div>
<a name="09052163000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government decide that all cigarette displays are illegal, all
cigarettes will be sold under the counter. There will probably be even
less differentiation between smuggled, illegal cigarettes and legal
cigarettes, when all are being bought in such a surreptitious way. The
inducement to behave improperly, however regrettable, will probably be
greater.</div><a name="09052163000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note that the Minister and the Government
talk&#151;always&#151;about measures to strengthen border controls,
inspections and so on. That is important, but it would be interesting
if the Minister also engaged on the question of price, because the
biggest inducement for anyone to smuggle, or to behave improperly in
any other area, is the financial incentive for doing
so.</div><a name="09052163000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be interested if the Minister touched on what was not covered by
the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, who had to cut short his
remarks and was therefore not able to cover all the ground&#151;the
impact of the duties in clause 12 on different income groups. The
Minister touched on young people, who tend to have less money than
middle-aged smokers, but I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>be interested to know his assessment of the impact of clause 12 on the
top decile by income, as opposed to the bottom
decile.</div><a name="09052163000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
suspicion is that the duty brought about by clause 12 and similar
clauses in previous years has a much more profound effect on people in
the bottom decile, certainly in terms of the percentage of their
overall disposable income, but I suspect even in absolute terms. That
has a social impact on those people. It may be that the Minister
regards the adverse impact on people&#146;s finances to be justified
in terms of the beneficial impact on their health, but there are
problems with trying to effect behavioural change through pricing.
Everyone recognises that, whether the attempt is made through
congestion charges in London or the pricing of tobacco products, the
economic impact on people with low incomes can be profound. I would be
interested if the Minister touched on that point as
well.</div><a name="09052163000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000477"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Albeit late in the day, as it has taken a day or so
to get to my first response in the Finance Bill Committee, I welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, probably just as you are
dreaming of getting out of it as quickly as possible after a day of
duty.</div><a name="09052163000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
12 increases the duty on cigarettes and all tobacco products by 2 per
cent. Together with VAT,  that will add 7p to the price of a
typical packet of  20 cigarettes and 3p to a pack of five
cigars. The clause also puts into legislation the increases in tobacco
duty announced in the pre-Budget report. Tobacco rates will remain
unchanged after the VAT rate returns to 17.5 per cent. in
January
2010.</div><a name="09052163000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I go on to answer some of the specific points made in the debate, it is
wise to put on the record that smoking is the biggest single cause of
preventable illness and early death in the UK. It contributes
significantly to inequalities in life expectancy, which the hon. Member
for Taunton may take as a signal of my response to the last of his
points. Maintaining high levels of tobacco duty, alongside continuing
action to clamp down on the threat of smuggling, is a proven part of
the Government&#146;s strategy to reduce smoking prevalence. Tobacco
is also an important contributor to public
finances.</div><a name="09052163000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000478"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> We have heard varying figures, such as Imperial
Tobacco&#146;s that 37 per cent. of the UK market consists of
cigarettes on which duty has not been paid in the UK. Have the
Government looked at where illegal cigarettes&#151;in the social
deciles that the hon. Member for Taunton referred to&#151;tend to be
bought and sold? In other words, could it be that illegal cigarettes
are going to a particular area of society and perhaps exacerbating the
health impacts and social
injustices?</div><a name="09052163000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000479"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b><b class="B"> </b>There is more than one sort of illegality.
There are counterfeit cigarettes and those that have been smuggled in,
and they are not always the same. Legally produced cigarettes are
smuggled but they are also brought into the country legally through
cross-border shopping. There are also counterfeit goods, which, given
the lack of assurance about what has gone into them, we would prefer
were not available at all. There is a range of
issues.</div><a name="09052163000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only way of knowing in detail where the illegal product ends up is by
undertaking the surveys that the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham
talked about earlier, and some spot checks. There are various 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>ways to attempt to get a handle on what by its essence is an illicit
phenomenon and come up with a reasonable idea of its scale, but there
are no Office for National Statistics figures on counterfeit
products.</div>
<a name="09052163000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000480"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Can I come back
again?</div><a name="09052163000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000481"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> When I have finished answering the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s initial question, I shall of course let him
intervene
again.</div><a name="09052163000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are no rigorous official statistics about such things simply because
the phenomenon is illegal and underground. All we can do is have
surveys carried out. We all probably have our own view, because we have
had particular experience of what is going on in our constituencies or
what is available in the communities in which we
live.</div><a name="09052163000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000482"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Minister is making a very fair point. If
smuggled cigarettes were being used more extensively by the lower
income decile groups, putting up duty could, in fact, exacerbate that
tendency and thus the likelihood of such people, who are particularly
vulnerable to all sorts of other social and health problems, to
increase their smoking. It is a matter of teasing out whether the
Government have looked at the matter seriously and whether it could be
an issue, because it would go against all policy if it turned out that
the most vulnerable in our society were ending up more likely to smoke
as a result of the Government&#146;s policy, which all of us here
were thinking did the
opposite.</div><a name="09052163000256"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000483"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> That point overlooks the overall fact that all
smoking is dangerous to health, whether one smokes premium brands,
cheap brands or counterfeit brands. The Government&#146;s policy is
designed to reduce and minimise the number of people who
smoke.</div><a name="09052163000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000484"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> The previous intervention was good. People
in higher income deciles might carry on smoking premium brand
cigarettes, and that would be easily measurable through official
statistics. However, if cigarettes bought legally&#151;even lower
premium brands&#151;became prohibitively expensive for people on low
incomes, there may seem through official statistics to be have been a
reduction in smoking propensity in low income deciles, but those people
may actually be smoking more because they are financially induced to
buy smuggled or illegally produced cigarettes that are not showing up
in official statistics. That is the point that was being made, and it
is worthy of a reasonable
answer.</div><a name="09052163000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000485"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I have two observations to make. One is that the
way we measure the amount of smuggled or counterfeit products on the
streets is not the same as the way we measure smoking prevalence. In
other words, we know about smoking prevalence from social surveys
carried out by ONS, but we do not always have detailed knowledge of
precisely what brands are smoked. Some tobacco companies undertake
their own surveys with respect to that, and we receive pieces of
information that we put together to make an overall picture. I
understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but we should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>focus on the larger issue because we wish to discourage people from
smoking altogether and not lose sight of the big
picture.</div>
<a name="09052163000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000486"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> It is not the same
point.</div><a name="09052163000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000487"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Of course not, but reducing the prevalence of
smoking is the best way to tackle those inequalities, particularly in
life expectancy.</div>
<a name="09052163000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000488"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister has really got
to the heart of my question: is it Government policy to try to narrow
that differential&#151;to increase the specific amount of
duty&#151;or is it their policy to widen that differential by
increasing the ad valorem part? At the moment there are conflicting
signals between what they said in their response to the EU consultation
and what they did in the PBR, so which is
it?</div><a name="09052163000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000489"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I was going to come on to that. If the hon.
Gentleman and other Opposition Members would let me get on, I might be
able to answer some of the questions that the hon. Gentleman asked in
his speech. First, though, I should like to congratulate him on being
an ex-smoker. It is always an achievement when addictions are overcome,
and I am glad that he has managed to move into the category of
ex-smoker.</div>
<a name="09052163000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000490"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for her congratulations.
Coming from the hon. Lady, who is described as &#147;a saint&#148;
in <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i> today, I take that as a real
tribute.</div>
<a name="09052163000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000491"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I hope that many others who smoke will follow the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s example.</div>
<a name="09052163000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talked about the difference between the ad valorem and the
specific elements of the current tax on tobacco. There is a point about
sequencing. He quoted at great length from the consultation document
issued by the Commission and our response to it. We are trying to
change the structure of EU directives on tobacco to deal with some of
the points that he made and to try to ensure that the specific element
becomes more important than the ad valorem element. To do that, we have
to persuade all member states to agree to change the directive. For the
reasons that he read out as part of the Government approach to this
renegotiation, that is clearly extremely important. However, while we
attempt to achieve that very desirable shift, we have to work within
the current directives.</div>
<a name="09052163000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
changes were announced at the PBR, they were, as the hon. Gentleman
pointed out, designed to try to keep the price of tobacco as broadly
neutral as possible in the context of a temporary VAT cut. VAT is an ad
valorem tax, and we got the closest fit to achieving the price
stability that we wanted in that context by using the ad valorem parts
of tobacco tax.</div>
<a name="09052163000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
successful in the EU directive negotiations, we want more concentration
on the specific element of tax on tobacco across the whole of the EU,
not just in the UK. For the reasons that the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>quoted, it makes sense for us, as a Government, to put the matter to the
EU Commission as part of that process. We will be able to make progress
there, but he must recognise that there are 27 EU member states, with
different tax rates on tobacco and many different approaches. The hon.
Gentleman is a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, so he will
know that trying to get agreement on EU directives is sometimes quite
difficult&#151;it can be like herding ferrets, especially where tax
is concerned. However, we are doing our best to come up with a
structure for tobacco tax that allows us more successfully and
accurately to pursue some of the social and health issues that we
talked about.</div>
<a name="09052163000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether we had thought about minimum excise taxes. Our
lowest taxes are much higher than a lot of the minimum taxes in the EU.
We are negotiating within Europe to give us more flexibility to levy a
higher proportion of specific duty on cigarettes, as we wish to do. We
are awaiting the development and evolution of those negotiations and
their outcome before deciding how to change the structure of our own
cigarette
duties.</div><a name="09052163000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000492"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Can the hon. Lady answer the question about the PBR
and the 2 per cent. ad valorem rise, on which we will also vote today?
Surely the Treasury could have structured a rise in specific duty that
would have raised the equivalent sum across the whole sector on a
revenue-neutral basis, because it still appears that the ad valorem
rise is entirely contrary to the policy&#151;at least, the policy
submitted to the EU and that she has just outlined&#151;that she
wants, which consists of a higher specific duty and lower ad
valorem.</div><a name="09052163000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000493"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> As I mentioned earlier, because VAT is an ad
valorem tax, as is that part of tobacco taxation, when trying to have a
simple approach to a temporary reduction in VAT, it makes sense to deal
with it in that way, which is what we
did.</div><a name="09052163000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned revenue maximisation. It is certainly
true that we would wish, as a matter of policy, to be somewhere around
revenue maximisation, and he is right to quote the statements I have
made in that context on earlier occasions in relation to previous
pre-Budget reports and Budgets and in Committee. However, there are
indications relating to our judgment, which is based on the available
evidence, that we are close to that point, but can still expect some
increase in revenue from the increases in clause 12. Some of those
indications are: a strong receipts performance, a falling tax gap and a
continuation and tightening of the anti-smuggling strategy. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned another indication: the weak pound and the reduced
demand for overseas travel, which change the elasticities around
revenue maximisation calculations. Our best assessment is that we have
not yet gone beyond revenue maximisation, but I have always made it
clear that, as a matter of policy, we wish to stay as close to that as
possible for the social and health reasons we talked about
earlier.</div><a name="09052163000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000494"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for being so generous in
giving way. She said we have not reached maximisation point, but are
quite close. It sounds as though she has a fixed idea of where that
point is. It would be helpful if she would share that with the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div><a name="09052163000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000495"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I have just told the hon. Gentleman that the
elasticities have changed and mentioned three of the reasons why, so
the point is not fixed. Analysis of our receipts performance, what is
going on elsewhere and the impact of those changes, such as the scale
of smuggling and the strength of the pound, are all relevant. I have
just gone through some of the factors that can be brought to bear when
calculating the elasticities, so it is not a fixed point. We analyse it
when we are doing our revenue calculations and do not just pluck it out
of the air. We believe that some of the changes I have mentioned have
had an impact on elasticities and allowed us to increase the duty rates
without going beyond revenue maximisation. We always keep those
calculations  under analysis as we consider what future duty
rates should be.</div>
<a name="09052163000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talked about cheap whites. There is a limit on the import
from non-EU countries of cheap whites for own use of 200 cigarettes per
person, meaning individuals who come across the border with their own
shopping. Commercial imports need to be properly imported with duty
paid through excise warehouses. We therefore ensure that they have
appropriate health warnings, as required by UK law. Goods not in either
of those categories are classed as smuggled, and that is how the
breakdown of cheap whites that are available or that one might come
across at one&#146;s local football match would be
categorised.</div>
<a name="09052163000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000496"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Exchequer Secretary clarify that? For
example, when the Jin Ling, which is the most popular of the cheap
whites, comes from Kaliningrad to the UK via Poland, at which precise
point do the Government try to intervene? What discussions has the hon.
Lady had with the Polish authorities? Surely one of the problems is
that, as Poland is in the EU, the intervention could also happen at the
EU external
border.</div><a name="09052163000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000497"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It would depend on who brought in the pack of cheap
whites and why. If they were imported via Poland, they would be dealt
with at the excise warehouse. If the hon. Gentleman brought a pack
in&#151;even though he has given up&#151;after visiting some of his
family in Kaliningrad, he would be allowed 200 sticks before having to
pay duty. Anything else that appears is
smuggled.</div><a name="09052163000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton asked about the differential between premium
brands and lower-priced brands. I understand his point. There is often
switching, and even now we could say that there would be switching from
potentially counterfeit to cheap, up to premium brand or not. We have
to be aware of that and look at how it is going, but I emphasise that
Government policy is to try to reduce the prevalence of smoking
of any brand. That is the aim of the excise duty policy in
clause
12.</div><a name="09052163000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham asked about statistics and
wondered whether it is true that one in three cigarettes smoked in the
UK fall outside UK duty paid. Our statistics show that 13 per cent. of
cigarettes smoked in the UK are smuggled and 8 per cent. are from legal
cross-border shopping, so one in five&#151;not one in
three&#151;are outside UK duty paid. We must never be complacent
about our ability to tackle smuggling but we have made good progress, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>often reaching targets years in advance and regularly discovering and
destroying 2 billion to 2.6 billion cigarette sticks a year. That is
our new target. We have made seizures of around 1.8 billion sticks,
which is rather a lot, and, believe it or not, 450 tonnes of
hand-rolling tobacco. We are getting the figures of smuggled cigarettes
down, but it is a constant battle, which the UK Border Agency and Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs are fighting well. In answer to
the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, we co-operate a lot with
our colleagues in other countries to protect borders as best we
can.</div><a name="09052163000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Member for Taunton asked about the distributional effect. The
best way to reduce the impact of duty increases, distributionally or
otherwise, is to reduce smoking prevalence, which is why a lot of the
work that is being done by health authorities to offer assistance and
free Nicorette patches to those who wish to give up is having an
effect. We have already dramatically reduced smoking prevalence and
seek to drive it down further. Clause 12 and the changes in duty before
us are one part of that, and I commend them to the
Committee.</div><a name="09052163000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000498"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and
Fulham did on tobacco, I shall curtail my remarks on clause 13, on the
basis that we have already debated vehicle excise duty for next year in
Committee of the whole House. I have some fairly narrow points on
clause
13.</div><a name="09052163000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is, of course, a fact that the Government have significantly changed
their position. I made that point last week. Much of the credit for
that shift must go to my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine
Greening), who has done sterling work. I pay tribute to her once
again.</div>
<a name="09052163000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
comparing the VED bands implemented by the clause with those set out by
the Government. It is not entirely fair to use that announcement as a
baseline and then compare pluses and minuses and say where there are
increases and reductions&#151;it is a trick of the Prime Minister to
do that in other contexts, and I do not want to go down that route.
However, by comparing what was announced in the 2008 Budget with
what we have now, I note that vehicles that emit 150
g/km are being charged more than was originally proposed, while
those that emit more than 150 g/km are being charged
less.</div>
<a name="09052163000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="09052163000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful if I give the Committee an example. Under proposals in
the 2008 Budget, a car that emits 130 g/km would pay &#163;90 VED
under the provisions in clause 13. Now, the VED payable on that car is
&#163;120, which is &#163;30 more. Equally, we could find examples
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>higher-emitting cars where there is a reduction in the VED to be paid if
we use the 2008 bands as our baseline.</div>
<a name="09052163000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister set out how many motorists will lose and how many will win
when comparing those two measurements? Using the same test, and
comparing what was announced last year with what we have now, it is
clear that the measures are beneficial to those cars that emit
more.</div>
<a name="09052163000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to overstate the environmental arguments because there are none, at
least according to the Government&#146;s figures. It appears that the
change in VED announced last year will have a very, very small impact
on the total amount of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emitted. Nevertheless, when the
proposals in the 2008 Budget were announced, the Chancellor stated that
there was a need for an incentive to encourage drivers to choose the
least-polluting cars, and one could argue that that incentive has been
diminished. I do not want to overstate the point, as the environmental
impact of what was announced in March 2008 appears to be so minimal
that unwinding that announcement cannot, I assume, cause any harm.
Nevertheless, I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response on
that.</div>
<a name="09052163000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">By comparing
the Red Book for the 2009 Budget with that of last year, I note that
last year the VED reforms for 2009-10 were due to raise &#163;465
million. The Budget announcement for 2009, which uses that as the
baseline, has largely been unwound. The cost of using that baseline is
&#163;475 million&#151;&#163;10 million more than was going to be
raised.</div>
<a name="09052163000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why have the
Government continued to introduce the banding on the basis of CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emissions this year, even though they have largely unwound the
position set out in the 2008 Budget? They are not making a particularly
environmental case for the reform of
VED.</div><a name="09052163000291"></a>

Eagle:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09052163000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000500"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am about to sit down. I might well be satisfied
by the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s arguments for the introduction of
this process, but it appears to have cost &#163;10 million. We could
just have returned to the system we had before. It would be helpful if
she could explain that point. Subject to those questions and given that
we debated VED at some length in the Committee of the whole House, I
have no further
remarks.</div><a name="09052163000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000501"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Clause 13 will change vehicle excise duty rates for
cars and vans from 1 May 2009. It follows the introduction of a system
of banding for VED on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions that
provides a signal to motorists about the environmental impact of using
cars. The system applies to cars registered from 1 March 2001 onwards.
The signal has succeeded in contributing to a fall in the CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emissions of new cars of 17 per cent. since 1997. Other things
have contributed to that such as new engine technologies and new
regulations. Road transport still accounts for 20 per cent. of all UK
emissions.</div><a name="09052163000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
the 2008 Budget, there was a clear case for further reform of VED. We
therefore announced the increase in the number of VED bands from seven
to 13 in 2009 to strengthen the incentive to choose the best in class.
The 2008 pre-Budget report confirmed those reforms to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>structure of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-based VED, but announced that to help
motorists during the economic downturn, rates for all cars would go up
by no more than &#163;5 in 2009 and that rates for cars emitting less
than 140 g of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>per kilometre would be frozen. Budget 2009
confirmed the announcements in the pre-Budget
report.</div><a name="09052163000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to moving towards a low-carbon transport
system through the introduction of measures that support the
development of green technologies and that provide the right signals to
encourage efficiency overall. The reforms to CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-based VED
will allow the system better to reflect changes in the fuel efficiency
of vehicles and will provide a greater incentive to drivers to choose a
lower carbon car. It is estimated that the reforms will save about 1
million tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>by 2020. That will support the
UK&#146;s broader aim of reducing transport
emissions.</div><a name="09052163000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure does not apply to cars and vans registered before 1 March 2001
because comprehensive data on CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions are not
available for those vehicles. Instead, VED will be set at two rates
based on engine size, as under the old system. There will be a higher
rate for vehicles with larger engines and a lower rate for those with
smaller engines. The clause will increase both rates by &#163;5,
which is in line with changes to VED rates for post-2001 cars. That is
the basic structure of what we are
doing.</div><a name="09052163000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are introducing VED bands because we believe that it is the right
structure to move towards. However, because we recognise that people
are under pressure during the recession and we do not want to add to
it, we have made modest changes this year, such as the
&#163;5 increases and the real-terms freezes. In future
there will be a role for the 13 bands, but a more stable and simple
approach is appropriate in this year&#146;s economic
conditions.</div><a name="09052163000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000502"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Exchequer Secretary said that the changed
approach to VED was a consequence of the economic conditions. Another
Government response to the economic conditions that relates to motoring
is the car scrappage scheme. If Mr. Atkinson indulges us,
will she clear up the confusion over VAT and car scrappage that seemed
to undermine the scheme on its first
day?</div><a name="09052163000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000503"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> First, there is no confusion over VAT and car
scrappage. The problem, as I understand it, is that two companies, Ford
and Nissan&#151;</div>
<a name="09052163000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000504"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to stop the Exchequer
Secretary, but this whole issue is very wide of the clause.</div>
<a name="09052163000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000505"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It is frustrating to have to answer the question
asked by the hon. Member for Fareham without being able to go into
it.</div><a name="09052163000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000506"></a>The

<a name="09052163000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000507"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will. The confusion, as I understand it, was
about whether the manufacturer could demand that its dealership made
part of the &#163;1,000 payment, which the manufacturer was meant to
make. The Government and the manufacturer pay &#163;1,000 each, but
there was some dispute about how that should work out for the
dealerships. It was not a VAT issue and the problem has now been
resolved. The scrappage scheme is going ahead, and it is attracting a
great deal of interest. We hope that it will support the car industry
at this very difficult time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div><a name="09052163000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000508"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Fuel duty was debated at some length on the Floor
of the House, and I have no intention of running through the whole
argument again. However, I should like once again to put on record our
concern at how the Government address it. Sometimes, fuel duty
announcements are postponed and postponed again, and it is then
unexpectedly increased. We have seen a great deal of evidence of that
in the past couple of years.</div>
<a name="09052163000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
Government feel that they have the political ability when oil prices
are lower to raise fuel duty, but it is difficult for them to do so
when oil prices are
higher.</div><a name="09052163000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09052163000509"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> I differentiate future duty
increases and those that have already been implemented. What cumulative
losses would the Exchequer have incurred, and what consequent increases
in public debt would have resulted, if the Conservative-Scottish
National party vote on the Floor of the House not to proceed with the
April 2009 duty increase had been successful? The policy would
obviously have had an impact on the public finances as a
whole.</div><a name="09052163000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000510"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We voted that way on the Budget resolutions, as was
made clear by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
(Mr. Hammond), because the way in which the Government
addressed fuel duty was lacking a coherent structure. They have
increased it and decreased it, and not implemented previously announced
proposals. We have advocated, as we said on the Floor of the House, a
fair fuel stabiliser. Given that we have debated the policy before, I
have no intention of offering another detailed
explanation.</div><a name="09052163000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000511"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am not seeking to debate that Conservative
policy again, but I wanted to make this specific point: the Government
may or may not have a coherent policy for fuel duty increases, but
surely any Opposition party that is even vaguely serious about assuming
office would have made an estimate of the adverse impact on the public
finances of voting against a duty increase that had already taken
effect. It would have cost the Exchequer a certain amount every day,
had the joint Conservative-SNP policy been successful. I cannot believe
that anyone who wished to be in office would not have made that
calculation and shared it with the
Committee.</div>
<a name="09052163000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000512"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am somewhat confused by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s position, given that his party voted against the
September increase. I am not going to question him as to what the cost
to the Exchequer of that would be. Our position on the Budget
resolution reflected our concern about that lack of a coherent
framework. I put that again on the record as an explanation for our
vote  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>on that Budget resolution. We have debated fuel duty before and, given
the time, I have no intention of reopening that debate
again.</div><a name="09052163000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000513"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I shall make an extremely brief point because
these subjects have been discussed at length. I wanted to expand
briefly on the two interventions that I have just made. There is a
difference between April 2009 and September 2009. In May, April has
already happened and September has yet to happen. I do not know what
the price of fuel will be in September, but I certainly knew in May
what the price of fuel was in April. The decision, or otherwise, not to
go ahead with September 2009 duty increases is not costing the
Exchequer anything today, whereas it would have done if the
Conservative-SNP amendment had been passed, because every single person
at the pump today would be contributing less in
taxation.</div><a name="09052163000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000514"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The ready reckoner is that every 2p rise is
&#163;1 billion a
year.</div><a name="09052163000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000515"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The patterns of demand could vary slightly
throughout the year, but if one divided the figure by 365 one could get
a daily clock running on the level of extra public borrowing that the
Conservative party supports through this measure alone. I note that the
SNP has lost interest in the subject, but the concern is that when we
have a public deficit of &#163;175 billion, no serious political
party should vote with minority parties, from Scotland or anywhere
else, to produce good publicity for election leaflets without regard
for the public finances. I do not doubt that there are people in the
Conservative party who have honourable intentions to go with their
burning ambitions, but I fear that unless they have coherence to go
with them they will end up being
disappointed.</div>
<a name="09052163000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000516"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is
referring back to a debate that we have already had. I shall be
grateful if he can limit himself to the
clause.</div>
<a name="09052163000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000517"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I had no more to add, Mr. Atkinson. We
have managed to get to a figure. It is helpful to cost the Conservative
proposals, and we will now bear those in mind every time we hear any
lectures or concerns expressed about the state of the public
finances.</div>
<a name="09052163000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09052163000518"></a>Angela

Lib Dem Focus leaflet. I am sure that hon. Members will look forward to
seeing it coming through their doors soon.</div>
<a name="09052163000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main fuel
duty rose by 1.84p per litre on 1 April this year. Duty on rebated oils
rose in proportion to the main fuel duty increase on the same date,
while duty on road fuel gases increased such that the duty differential
for compressed natural gas was maintained, but the differential for
liquefied petroleum gas was reduced by 1p per litre. The clause also
increases the duty rates for leaded petrol and aviation gasoline, with
effect from 1 May 2009. Duty on leaded petrol will increase
on that date by 1.84p per litre and duty on avgas will increase by 2.31
pence per litre. I felt that I had to get that on the record.</div>
