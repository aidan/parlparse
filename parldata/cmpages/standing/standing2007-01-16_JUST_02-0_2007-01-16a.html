							<b class="B">Lady
Hermon</b> (North Down) (UUP): Thank you, Sir
Nicholas. It was nice of you to describe my contribution as valuable to
this Committee, particularly since I was disagreeing, saying,
&#147;No, no and no again&#148; to the Minister&#146;s typically
persuasive and eloquent argument. The Committee will not be persuaded
by his eloquence on this occasion, however, because it is inconceivable
that it could recognise that the conditions outlined in clause 1 would
be met to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Prosecutions and
that he would also be satisfied that, because of those conditions,
there is a risk that the administration of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 44</div>justice might be impaired. The Minister is trying to persuade us that,
even though he cannot conceive of any instance in which the DPP would
not issue a certificate, he is still not convinced that he should
change the DPP&#146;s discretion, which is indicated by the use of
the word &#147;may&#148; in clause 1(2), into a
duty.</div>
					<a name="07011774000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
eloquently reminded us in this morning&#146;s sitting that we really
have nothing to worry about, because if there is any danger at all of
jury tampering, it will be picked up under the Criminal Justice Act
2003. The Act gained Royal Assent four years ago and I think that he
hinted that section 44 is its key provision, but that came into force
only today or this
week.</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000553"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul
Goggins):
						</b> I am happy to confirm that it came into force on
8
January.</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000554"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> It came into force on 8 January, so that is the
time that it has taken the Government, in conjunction with the other
relevant justice agencies, to put the 2003 Act into operation even
though there is the real and present threat of jury
tampering.</div>
					<a name="07011774000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look
for a moment at what the Minister is trying to persuade us of. Section
44 of the 2003 Act came into force just a few days ago and has very
limited scope. The Minister, who sits there with an angelic look on his
face, knows well that that is so. It will apply only when the
prosecutor makes an application to the Crown court judge, who must be
satisfied about two conditions that are set out in section 44. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07011774000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first condition is that there is evidence of a real and present danger
that jury tampering would take place ... The second condition is
that, notwithstanding any steps (including the provision of police
protection) which might reasonably be taken to prevent jury tampering,
the likelihood&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">is such
that there would be a substantial threat to the interests of justice in
the trial if it were conducted with a
jury.</div>
					<a name="07011774000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 44
applies only to jury tampering. The tests that have to be satisfied are
set at a high level. The provision will be available only in limited
circumstances. However, the Minister has identified the two parts of
clause 1 that must be satisfied and the first is that the DPP must find
at least one of the conditions outlined in the clause. It is a side
issue, but the DPP might be a man or a woman as we would anticipate
that in future all aspects of the judicial system would reflect gender
and ethnicity in Northern Ireland. For the Committee&#146;s
information, there are 10 High Court judges in Northern Ireland, and
not one is female. The positions of Lord Chief Justice and the Director
of Public Prosecutions have never been held by a woman, but that is a
side issue.</div>
					<a name="07011774000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
issue is that the DPP is satisfied that there is a risk that the
administration of justice might be impaired. In those circumstances, it
is completely illogical that the DPP, he or she, should turn a blind
eye to that significant fact and not make a certificate that there
should be a non-jury trial.</div>
					<a name="07011774000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister, by being terribly
persuasive about the virtues of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, is wrong
in giving the impression that there is a seamless system that will pick
up, at the trial stage under the 2003 Act, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 45</div>those cases in which the DPP has concluded that there is a risk to the
administration of justice. They will not be picked up under the 2003
Act because it sets a very high standard for the judge to come to that
conclusion when the trial has begun.</div>
					<a name="07011774000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition of risk to the
administration of justice goes much wider than simply jury tapping,
which is the only issue covered by section 44 of the 2003 Act. In those
circumstances, it is consistent with the Minister&#146;s own
arguments that he cannot conceive of an instance when the DPP would not
issue a certificate but the Minister is still not prepared to make it a
duty rather than a discretion.</div>
					<a name="07011774000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be intrigued if the
Minister would intervene to give the Committee and the Chairman some
examples. I know that Sir Nicholas follows our debates with great
interest and passion as he chaired in his characteristically fair and
kindly manner in difficult circumstances our ghastly sittings on the
proposed measure in respect of on-the-run terrorists not coming before
a court.</div>
					<a name="07011774000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will intervene to give examples of cases in which the DPP
would exercise discretion when he knows that there is a risk to the
administration of justice. Why in heaven&#146;s name not make that a
duty? The Minister said that he did not want to be rigid and
inflexible, but I cannot be convinced that he believes, in his heart of
hearts, that it is right that the DPP should turn a blind eye to a risk
to the administration of justice.</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000555"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I say, in passing, that although it is a long
time since the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was passed, the hon. Lady,
with her experience, will appreciate that careful preparations with the
appropriate training are needed for the introduction of such important
powers.</div>
					<a name="07011774000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rise not to
give the hon. Lady examples but to repeat what I said earlier: I do not
have any examples to give. I cannot foresee any circumstances in which
the certificate would not be issued when both limbs of the test are
satisfied. I say again that there may be unforeseen circumstances,
which I cannot predict, that may require some discretion by the DPP,
but fundamentally it is a point of principle. In the end, it is for the
DPP to make that decision and we leave it to him, as it is at present,
to use his discretion to make that judgment. I see no circumstances in
which that would happen, but we have to leave it open to the DPP.
</div>

							<a name="07011774000556"></a>
								Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
intervention, which I invited, because he confirmed, as we believed,
that there are no circumstances that he can at present envisage in
which the DPP would not issue a certificate. We are trying to
clarifying the legislation so that it builds confidence. I entirely
share the Minister&#146;s view that trying to get the balance right
is a matter of caution&#151;he used that word&#151;and that may
build some confidence in the criminal justice system among victims. We
are talking about victims and their
protection.</div>
					<a name="07011774000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
see that the hon. Member for East Antrim is here on time, and very nice
it is to see that. His nickname is &#147;The late Member&#148;.
Both the hon. Gentleman and I have taken evidence in private and heard
that there is real fear among the victims of organised crime,
paramilitary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div>and ex-paramilitary crime, and intimidation. We should err on the side
of the victim to build confidence in the criminal justice system in
Northern Ireland. That means making it absolutely clear that when the
DPP recognises that there is a threat to the administration of justice
in Northern Ireland, and that one of the conditions set out in clause 1
is satisfied, he will do the right thing by the victim and the criminal
justice system and issue a certificate. That cannot be done under the
Criminal Justice Act 2003, save in very limited
circumstances.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Mark
Durkan</b> (Foyle) (SDLP): Just as the Minister did not give
examples, the hon. Lady did not. There might be cases that cause
concern about the supposed discretion contained in the measures.
Obviously, I oppose clause 1 for the same reason that I do not want any
provision for non-jury courts beyond that contained in the 2003 Act. Is
part of her concern about the DPP having discretion that, under
devolution, he may be influenced by a devolved Minister or a Committee
of the Assembly as to how he uses that
discretion?</div>

contribution. However, I am not concerned about who might or might not
be a future Justice Minister in Northern Ireland when policing and
justice are devolved. I hope that the Government bear in mind the words
spoken in the Chamber and the assurances that policing and justice
would be devolved to the Assembly only when there is public confidence
in the criminal justice system.</div>

						My concern
has been propelled by the fact that the Government&#151;quite
rightly&#151;established the Independent Monitoring Commission, and
sometimes it would be good if we paid more attention to the
commission&#146;s reports. I was affected by a paragraph 5.5 in its
third report, published as long ago as November 2004. That paragraph
highlights the staggering influence of criminal gangs in Northern
Ireland and
states:</div>
					<a name="07011774000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force has stated that there are
some 230 organised criminal gangs believed to be operating in Northern
Ireland. We have been advised that about 60 per cent. or some 140 have
paramilitary links and that, of the top 25 criminal gangs involved in
international activities operating in early 2004, 17, some two-thirds,
had paramilitary
associations.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
the key phrase:</div>
					<a name="07011774000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Seldom in the developed
world has this high proportion of the most serious criminals been
associated with groups originating in terrorism, with an organised
structure and discipline, and the experience of planning, learning and
conducting sophisticated clandestine operations, methods of handling
money, and with traditions of extreme
violence.&#148;</div>

						Northern
Ireland has a population of about 1.7 million people. It is a
small jurisdiction. I have not dreamed up the following facts and
figures, and the Ulster Unionist party did not produce them. We have no
time for that&#151;we have time for so little. The Independent
Monitoring Commission produced the report, highlighting that there are
230 organised criminal gangs in Northern Ireland, and that a vast
percentage of them have international connections. They are very
sophisticated and quite ruthless. On ruthless and sophisticated
criminality, it is perfectly logical and legitimate for the Government
to say to the people of Northern Ireland that when they are victims of
paramilitary intimidation or of organised criminal gangs, the criminal

Sir Nicholas. I am grateful for your offer of a vote, but since the

we do not feel it necessary to push any of them at this stage. We may
return to them on

							<a name="07011774000584"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in
clause 1, page 2, line 19, leave
out paragraph (b).</div>
					<a name="07011774000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to a curious part of the clause. Although we were
defeated on the last amendment, we have not given up on our efforts to
improve the Bill. We are here jointly, no matter which party we
represent, to make sure that this is a good Bill for the people of
Northern Ireland.</div>
					<a name="07011774000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
construction of the clause is interesting. Subsection (9) includes a
definition of a proscribed organisation. As we know from our earlier
discussions, the DPP has to be satisfied of two things, including one
of the four conditions outlined in the clause. The first three
conditions make reference to the defendant&#146;s connection to a
proscribed organisation. Condition 1 is that the defendant is a member
or past member of a proscribed organisation. Condition 2 is that the
offence was committed on behalf of a proscribed organisation. Condition
3 is that an attempt has been made on behalf of a proscribed
organisation to prejudice the investigation or prosecution.
Interestingly, the fourth condition makes no reference to a proscribed
organisation. It concerns</div>
					<a name="07011774000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a result of, in connection with
or in response to religious or political hostility of one person or
group of persons towards another person or group of
persons.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have tabled the amendment to give the Minister an opportunity to
explain the construction of the clause and why one of the four
conditions, the last of which makes no reference to a proscribed
organisation, must be satisfied, along with the condition that the DPP
must be satisfied that there is a risk to the administration of
justice. Will the Minister give examples of circumstances in which he
thinks there will be a non-jury trial, not under the 2003 Act but under
this Bill, where there is no connection with a proscribed
organisation?</div>
					<a name="07011774000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates specifically to the deletion of subsection (9)(b),
which defines a proscribed organisation. Hon. Members will be familiar
with the definition in the Terrorism Act 2000. Having taken advantage
of modern technology, I have a lengthy, up-to-date list of the all the
organisations proscribed under the Act. I will not name them all;
al-Qaeda is obviously on the list, but some of them have extremely odd
titles. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with them&#151;for
example, the 17 November Revolutionary Organisation is listed. At the
end of the list are the proscribed Irish groups, which include the
Continuity Army Council, the Orange Volunteers, the Red Hand Commando,
the Red Hand Defenders, the Ulster Defence Association, the Ulster
Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force, to name but a
few.</div>
					<a name="07011774000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like the
Minister to explain the reason for subsection 9(b), which curiously
adds the condition that, in addition to the defendant being a member or
a past member of a proscribed organisation under the definition in the
2000 Act, the organisation&#146;s</div>
					<a name="07011774000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;activities are (or were at the
time of his membership) connected with the affairs of Northern
Ireland&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011774000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give an
example, which the Minister can address in his
response.</div>
					<a name="07011774000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an
organisation that falls within the definition of a proscribed
organisation were to be responsible for a major bank robbery&#151;I

be sufficient that the bank was in Northern Ireland? Would that be

activities of the organisation are</div>

Wilson</b> (East Antrim) (DUP): Will the hon. Lady accept that
when the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee took evidence on the
criminal activities of proscribed organisations in Northern Ireland, it
heard that those organisations&#146; activities often go well beyond
the boundaries of Northern Ireland&#151;for example, smuggling drugs
from outside Northern Ireland or taking fuel to other parts of the
United Kingdom? Although those organisations are based in Northern
Ireland, their activities are not exclusively connected with Northern
Ireland; nevertheless, they have the same ability to intimidate jurors,
if the cases are brought to court in Northern
Ireland.</div>

							<a name="07011774000586"></a>Lady
Hermon:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>It is a rare for me to be grateful to the
hon. Gentleman, but I am genuinely grateful to him. He has the dreadful
habit of poking fun at the hon. Member for North Down, but I usually
rise above it. On this occasion, however, he is absolutely right. His
point was mentioned in the 2004 IMC report:</div>
					<a name="07011774000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We understand that
virtually all the most significant 25
gangs&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011774000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">those are
the most sophisticated organised criminal
gangs&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011774000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
international associations referred to above are engaged in smuggling
or in laundering the proceeds of their crimes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">International organised criminals
certainly do not recognise the border between the Republic of Ireland
and Northern Ireland. In fact, their operations are helped by the
different ways in which both sides have constructed their legislation.
However, that gap has been properly narrowed, and there is much greater
co-operation between the Garda Siochana, the Police Service of Northern
Ireland and the other justice
agencies.</div>
					<a name="07011774000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
welcome the Minister&#146;s explanation of the curious construction
of subsection (9)(b). Subsections (6) to (8), which concern condition
4, make no mention of proscribed organisations, yet we move on to their
definition in subsection (9). That means that we will have non-jury
trials only if the circumstances meet the narrow phrasing. The good
that we are doing with non-jury trials, which it is necessary to
maintain in Northern Ireland, could be undermined by that phrase, and I
do not see the need to include it in the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07011774000587"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> Given our earlier discussions, hon. Members will
not be surprised to hear that I oppose the amendment. If it were to be
accepted, those hon. Members representing constituencies on this island
might start to catch on to the concern expressed by the hon. Member for
Montgomeryshire that aspects of the Bill might be rolled out
into UK-wide legislation. The Minister tried to assure hon. Members
earlier that the focus is purely on Northern Ireland and Northern
Ireland-related terrorist or paramilitary organisations. If the
amendment were agreed to, the argument would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div>be that if the Government are prepared to have non-jury trials for
proscribed organisations that have nothing to do with the Irish
situation in Northern Ireland, surely that would be the precedent for
not having jury trials for those organisations elsewhere in the United
Kingdom.</div>

					<a name="07011774000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the
hon. Lady is trying to remove an awkward term from the Bill, and of
course the term was in the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, too. The
exemptions and certificates that were going to be afforded then were
for any offence committed by anybody in relation to the affairs of
Northern Ireland. I know why the term is questionable for many people,
and I make that point in response to the comments made by the hon.
Member for Montgomeryshire and the Minister. However, my reason for
opposing the amendment is that it still does nothing to do away with
Diplock courts. It does not alter the basic thrust of the Bill, which
is to provide for continuity Diplock
courts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000588"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> As ever, the hon. Member for North Down does the
Committee and the process of consideration a great service by tabling
amendments that allow us to face, debate and explore the issues raised
by the Bill. Sometimes amendments are pushed to a vote and sometimes
they are withdrawn. That is the spirit in which such things should be
done. I have served on a number of Standing Committees with her, on
both home affairs and Northern Ireland affairs, and she always pursues
the issues in the way in which she has this afternoon. We are all
indebted to her for that.</div>
					<a name="07011774000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to her questions
about why we include a fourth condition in the first limb about
religious or political hostility, we do so because incidents, events
and crimes might reflect the religious and political hostility that
has, I am sad to say, been a feature of Northern Ireland for far too
long, and there could be evidence of that but no evidence that the
perpetrators were involved in a proscribed organisation. The hon. Lady
might say that that is not likely, and perhaps it is not, but if the
Director of Public Prosecutions had evidence that people or a defendant
were involved in political or religious hostility but could not show
that they were members of a proscribed organisation, it would be wrong
if the option of the non-jury trial was prevented in such
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07011774000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
take the example of Whiterock. If there was evidence that a defendant
was involved in the kind of hostility that marked that dreadful event
in Northern Ireland&#151;related as it clearly was to political and
religious hostility&#151;but it was not possible to show that they
were a member of a proscribed organisation, the fourth test in the
first limb would enable the DPP to issue a certificate. Our motivation
is to ensure that all eventualities are covered in relation to the
conflict and criminality with which we are trying to deal, which is the
most serious criminality in Northern Ireland.</div>
					<a name="07011774000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We are trying
to limit the power in our provisions in a way that reflects the
particular and ongoing risk in Northern Ireland. The kind of difficulty
that arises from the way in which proscribed organisations&#151;there
are 14 in the list&#151;relate to local communities and the hold that
they have over them would undermine juries and the judicial process. We
seek to deal with that, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>with that alone, and we do not want to extend the provisions beyond the
proscribed organisations that relate to affairs in Northern Ireland. We
do not want to include al-Qaeda and other international terrorist
organisations within the provisions. To answer the hon. Lady&#146;s
sharp question about the Northern Bank, if al-Qaeda had carried out the
Northern Bank raid that would not be covered by the provisions. If one
of the proscribed organisations listed in relation to Northern Ireland
had carried it out, that would be a different matter.</div>
					<a name="07011774000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I confirm
that in subsection (9) we are talking about an organisation</div>
					<a name="07011774000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whose activities ... are
connected with the affairs of Northern
Ireland&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011774000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">That shows a
distinct relationship between the organisation and the affairs of
Northern Ireland. As desirable as it is that the perpetrators of any
al-Qaeda operations are brought to justice, it could not be done on a
certificate issued by the DPP under the Bill&#146;s provisions. Only
those connected with proscribed organisations related to the affairs of
Northern Ireland could be so brought to
trial.</div>

							<a name="07011774000589"></a>Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> Does the Minister accept that increasingly many of
the terrorist organisations based in Northern Ireland are involved in
international criminal activities, according to briefings by both the
police and the Government? Those criminal activities may stretch to
mainland Britain or the Republic of Ireland. If the people responsible
are apprehended in Northern Ireland and there is a danger that they
would seek to intimidate a jury, would the case be required to go to a
jury trial because the activities were not connected to Northern
Ireland? Would a trial be heard in a non-jury court for criminal
activities that take place outside Northern
Ireland?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000590"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> My response to the hon. Gentleman continues my
response to the hon. Member for North Down. We do not have evidence of
jury intimidation by members of international terrorist organisations
that have nothing to do with Northern Ireland issues, but we have
evidence of proscribed organisations in Northern Ireland intimidating
juries. Therefore, the provisions will protect juries and justice to
ensure that trials can be conducted properly. We do not have evidence
that international terrorists are intimidating juries in Northern
Ireland so that justice cannot be done. If we had such evidence, we
might look at the situation again. The only evidence we have relates to
Northern Ireland proscribed organisations, and that is why the
legislation focuses on that issue alone.</div>
					<a name="07011774000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the circumstances
highlighted by the hon. Member for East Antrim, in which a proscribed
organisation in Northern Ireland has links with international terrorist
organisations, those matters relating to members of the proscribed
organisation in Northern Ireland could be dealt with under the
provisions of the Bill. Matters relating to members of other
organisations could not.</div>
					<a name="07011774000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking to ensure that
we have a provision for non-jury trials, because that is still
necessary in view of the risks that exist in Northern Ireland. However,
we

there is no such thing as a good terrorist or a bad terrorist. There
should not be a distinction between home-grown terrorism in Northern

terrorists, such as al-Qaeda. We have seen what they can do. We saw,

wreak.</div>

organisations are ruthless and have murderous intent. They have no
comppassion for their co-religionists or anyone else in the pursuit of
their political aims. In my book, when we have a lengthy list of
proscribed organisations in the 2000 Act, I do not want the distinction
that we have non-jury trials only for those home-grown terrorists. They
are not better terrorists. Terrorism is terrorism, as far as I am
concerned.</div>

appreciate the Minister&#146;s efforts, valiant as ever, to explain
why the clause has been constructed as it has and why it focuses on
home-grown terrorism, but it is just not an argument that I can buy
into. I am sure that he did not mean this, but he said that the whole
provision is to protect juries. With the greatest respect to him, and
he knows that I hold him in the highest esteem, the whole provision is
not just about protecting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div>juries. It goes much wider than that. The Liberal Democrats alluded to
this when we did not adopt their amendment, although the Minister is
going to consider it. There is a risk that the administration of
justice might be impaired. That is wider than the intimidation of
juries; it means the intimidation of witnesses.</div>
					<a name="07011774000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult to ask people
to come forward and appear in a jury in a small jurisdiction with
international press coverage. We have a lot of press coverage in
Northern Ireland for a hole host of reasons, sometimes the wrong
reasons. We have a lot of media attention. It takes a very courageous
man or woman to step in as a witness in the case of an al-Qaeda
terrorist who has committed atrocious crimes in Northern Ireland or who
has been associated in some other terrorist activity in Northern
Ireland which might affect all of the United Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="07011774000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have an opportunity in this
Bill. As the hon. Member for Foyle said, we do not want to have to come
back to amend it. So let us get it right when we have the chance to do
so. Let us not just legislate for the present. Let us take into account
what the Prime Minister told us at the end of last week: it will take
at least a generation to defeat this kind of international
terrorism.</div>

Goggins:
						</b> The hon. Lady argues passionately about this. I
understand why. She condemns international terrorism as much as the
rest of the Committee, but does she have any evidence that
international terrorist organisations that have no specific interest in
the affairs of Northern Ireland are threatening and intimidating either
witnesses or members of a jury in Northern Ireland? If she does, I
would be pleased to look at it.</div>

are linking themselves in the supply of drugs, smuggled cigarettes and
arms to groups in Northern Ireland which are prepared to intimidate
jurors on behalf of their members, they are equally likely to
intimidate jurors on behalf of their
associates?</div>

						</b> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
that helpful intervention. He is in sparkling form this afternoon. He
is absolutely right. He sits on the Northern Ireland Policing Board,
which I do not, so he has access to information that I do not see. His
intervention was spot on.</div>
					<a name="07011774000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have evidence, documented by
the IMC, that there are international links with sophisticated criminal
gangs in Northern Ireland. It beggars belief that the Minister is
asking the hon. Member for North Down to identify and to give evidence
of intimidation. I take my hat off to the people who very courageously
come to my constituency surgery on a Friday evening&#151;they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div>want to sit in the back office and do not want their names mentioned
anywhere at all&#151;to give information about neighbours who will
slit the throat of their own dog to make sure that they are not
awakened and that nobody&#146;s attention is drawn to the fact that
they are shifting drugs late at night. We are talking about utterly
ruthless people. Those who come to me to say that they are prepared to
allow their homes to be used for police surveillance are enormously
courageous. I do not in any way diminish the threat.</div>
					<a name="07011774000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fairness to the people of
Northern Ireland, we should be much more realistic about the future
dangers to the whole of the United Kingdom. That includes Northern
Ireland, which, as I pointed out this morning, can be accessed through
many ports in the Republic of Ireland, through Shannon and through
Dublin. There are no manned borders&#151;we no longer have
checkpoints.</div>
					<a name="07011774000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to get this legislation right. The Minister has argued that there
should be a discretion for the DPP. I disagreed, but we all want to get
the legislation right now, so that we do not have to come back later
and amend it to take account of changing circumstances. For goodness
sake, let us allow for flexibility instead of tying the hands of the
DPP. The Minister has managed to argue against himself in the last 15
minutes. He wants us to give the DPP discretion in circumstances that
he cannot identify, but would also tie the hands of the DPP. Let us not
give al-Qaeda or any other hideous proscribed terrorist organisation a
fair wind through Northern Ireland to wreak havoc, and then stand back
wringing our hands in regret when somebody is dead. Let us accept the
amendment today and not argue about it. Accept the amendment and give
flexibility to the DPP. I rest my case.</div>

The terms are open to many differing interpretations. For example, two
people might be cousins but might not have seen each other since
childhood. On the other hand, are we going to include second, third or
fourth cousins? Where do we stop? That is an important issue as to
whether or not a trial is conducted with a jury.</div>

DPP has the absolute right to take decisions and cannot be challenged
by a court. If the DUP&#151;I mean the
DPP&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I hope that it will not be the DUP

half-facetious point that since almost everyone I have met in Northern

Durkan:
						</b> That could be so. In fact, in many parts of
Northern Ireland the word &#147;friend&#148; is used to mean a
relative. To say that somebody is your friend indicates that they are a
cousin or that there is some family connection. I doubt whether
Ministers were aware of that subtlety of dialect in parts of Northern
Ireland.</div>

					<a name="07011774000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause and other provisions
in the Bill will mean that people affected by the list in subsection
(10) will not know on what grounds they have been given a non-jury
trial, and they will not be able to say anything. I can imagine that a

what has been said about him.</div>

						Many people
in Northern Ireland are related to those who have been members of
proscribed organisations, but have themselves never given those
organisations any support and have views diametrically opposed to
theirs. There may also be many people in senior positions with such
relatives. So although I have a lot of sympathy with the attempt to
restrict the list, the problem is that it does not go far enough,
because I do not think that we should be making the provision for
non-jury trials at all. That is why I would not strongly oppose the
amendments. However, because of my reservations about continuity
Diplock courts, I will not support
them.</div>

Goggins:
						</b> The hon. Member for North Down has asked why the
provision concerning enduring family relationships in clause 1(10)(c)
has been included. The reason is that we need to say more about the
nature of the partnership. Other subsections refer to the spouse or
former spouse, civil partner or former civil partner, and the nature of
those relationships is defined in legislation, so there should be no
confusion. However, in paragraph (c), we need to define the nature of
the partnership. Business partners could not be included, for
example.</div>

								Paul
Goggins:
						</b> Because we are defining very precisely what we
mean by partners in an enduring family relationship&#151;people who
share a life together. &#147;Enduring&#148; implies a length of
time. &#147;Family relationship&#148; implies sharing a house and
common facilities, which normally happens in families. We do not intend
the provision to cover business partners, romantic partners or people
who meet up every day of the week at the same time and place to go to
the same pub and carry on the same activities. They will not be caught
by the
provision.</div>
					<a name="07011774000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
say again to the hon. Lady, as gently as I can, that it is important to
ensure that we have the capacity for trials without jury in Northern
Ireland&#151;for all the reasons that we have heard, we want to limit
them for use only when required. The provision explains the meaning of
the term &#147;partnership&#148; in the present circumstances. The
term &#147;enduring family relationship&#148; explains that the
context is a length of time and shared household facilities. Those
matters are defined in statute in relation to spouses and civil
partners, but they are not defined in respect of other
relationships.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000634"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> In that case, I admit to being confused as to
what the Government are trying to achieve. To qualify under this
provision surely means that there is some kind of relationship. As the
hon. Lady has said, what difference does it make whether the
relationship is an enduring family one or one in which the parties live
together? If they live together, could they not qualify to some extent
as friends? That may not necessarily be the case, but given that

						</b> It may well be that in that kind of relationship
the description &#147;friend&#148; would be adequate. What we are
seeking to do in paragraph (c) is to extend what is covered by
paragraphs (a) and (b). Paragraph (a) clarifies that spouses are
covered, and the term spouse is defined in legislation. Paragraph (b)
covers civil partners, which is also a term defined in legislation.
There are other people, however, who live together in enduring family
relationships and who are neither spouses nor civil partners. We simply
wanted to extend the explanation of the provision&#146;s intention by
including an additional paragraph, which seeks to describe people who
share a family relationship over a period of time who may not be
spouses or civil partners but who may have an enduring family
relationship. It could even be that they are friends and that they
qualify in that way, but we do not want there to be the possibility of
omitting them. It is important that such situations are brought to the
attention of the DPP, which is why the provision has been
included.</div>

There is a qualitative judgment to be made, and it will be for the DPP

the friendship or family relationship, or the length of the enduring

						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for trying to
explain the drafting of clause 1(10). He has made a good effort, but I
think that we are splitting hairs. For example, in respect of a spouse,
we have no idea how lengthy the marriage will be; we just know that a
box will have been ticked and that the people were married at some
stage. If we are talking about a former spouse, we know only that they
were divorced or separated at some stage. There is no requirement for
consideration of the length of time that the marriage may have
lasted&#151;it does not have to be enduring.</div>
					<a name="07011774000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately, although the
Minister has acknowledged that the Government were hoping to cover a
relationship, including a house and all the things that would show some
sort of commitment, he did not answer my specific question about
whether that means that there have to be children. The term
&#147;enduring family relationship&#148; implies more than owning a
house, which is the only thing that the Minister has alluded to. We
have given the DPP a major headache in trying to decide who falls into
the categories in subsection

mention family. Paragraphs (a) and (b), in particular, do not mention
having a family or having children. It would have been ludicrously
discriminatory if the provision depended on the presence of children
when people live together as partners, but not in the cases of civil
partnerships and marriages. That would not have been a tenable
position.</div>
					<a name="07011774000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
happier if the Minister were to say to the Committee that he and his

His adherence to an administrative approach is profoundly wrong for the
reasons that we have discussed. Given the debate that we have just had,
it is quite obvious that many of us have the gravest reservations about
what the definitions actually mean. I was only half joking when I said
that it will be difficult to find individuals who do not fall foul of
all the conditions&#151;a large proportion of the Northern Ireland
population is related to itself. In addition, if individuals try to
cheat the system, they are unlikely to volunteer information regarding
their relationship with other people. The Minister must give some
thought to that.</div>

					<a name="07011774000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I oppose
this clause. We have already discussed the detail of the provisions
involving the DPP and the circumstances in which the non-jury trial
option might be used. We have also touched on the Secretary of
State&#146;s comments on Second Reading that national security and
intelligence matters could be considered in that. I want to share one
of our fundamental concerns with the Committee, which is that the
provisions have implications for how things will work out and be seen
to work out in the devolution of policing and justice. The clause gives
a key role, which is quite controversial, to the DPP to do something
that the Government have assured us would not be provided
for.</div>
					<a name="07011774000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The joint
declaration of 2003 made it clear that the emergency provisions were
going to go. The Government amendments to the Terrorism Act 2003 gave
effect to the commitments in the 2003 joint declaration, but now they
have been reversed. When those amendments removed the Diplock courts
and made sure that they would not exist after July 2008, we were also
debating the options for the devolution of justice and
policing.</div>
					<a name="07011774000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone
looking at those debates taking place in parallel would see that, with
the arrival of justice and policing devolution, a devolved Minister
would not be in a position to face questions about decisions on the use
of non-jury trials, even though he they might have their own views or
concerns. They would not be in a position to know why such decisions
were taken, because, as the Secretary of State suggested on Second
Reading, the DPP would be taking them on the basis of receiving
information from MI5 or a similar source. The devolved
Minister&#151;a devolved committee in the Assembly might also be
interested or concerned, because no doubt lawyers, defendants and other
people would be writing to it&#151;would be in the difficult position
of having to say that they knew nothing, could know nothing and
potentially could do nothing.</div>

						</b> I assure the hon. Lady that we absolutely do. I
did not say that any Minister would wish to influence decisions; I said
that they would not be in a position to know why decisions were made or
anything else about them. The fact is that a Minister will inevitably
face questions, whether they are from lawyers, defendants or members of
committees.</div>
					<a name="07011774000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there
is a pattern of non-jury trials and no information is given in the
certificates, people will say that we should at least know on what
grounds people are being referred to a non-jury trial. People will
question the procedure and protest the fact that they cannot know why
the certificates were supposedly issued. Lawyers will protest at
that.</div>
					<a name="07011774000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a devolved
Minister is meant to simply defend the status quo, then they will be is
in a very constrained and difficult situation. That is why we said on
Second 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>Reading that the Bill is pregnant with implications and complications
for the devolution of justice and policing. Perhaps the Minister will
clarify the plans for the devolution of justice and policing. The
provisions are not renewable but permanent. Will the amendments be
subject to Westminster legislation or can they be altered, amended or
repealed by the devolved Assembly after devolution? Will the Minister
clarify which it is to be? If they are to be amended by the Assembly, I
assume that cross-community support will be needed before they can be
altered.</div>
					<a name="07011774000460"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">
						In
a sense, the Bill means that Diplock courts will be born again just
ahead of the devolution of justice and policing. They will become part
of the suite of devolved justice arrangements, which can be changed
only on the basis of cross-community support. On current form, that
will not happen unless and until the DUP says so. Not only will we have
continuity Diplock courts, but essentially we will have DUP-lock
courts. Again, I ask the Minister whether Sinn Fein fully realises
that. Is Sinn Fein in on it, or has it slept
in?</div>

								Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> As you rightly say, Sir Nicholas, this clause
is the meat of the Bill and it has been discussed for the best part of
two sittings, as is right, so I shall keep my remarks short. I entirely
understand where the hon. Member for Foyle is coming from. That said, I
support the clause because it at least moves in the right direction. It
shifts the emphasis and makes a presumption for a trial by jury. The
reasons why a trial should not be by jury have to be shown, although I
accept that they do not have to be shown to the defendant.</div>
					<a name="07011774000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I retain my
concern. I listened to the Minister carefully and I think that it
should be a matter for the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland to
decide. I am still concerned that the person who will carry out the
prosecution will decide on the mode of trial and I do not think that
that is correct. However, that is not a strong enough objection to
cause me to vote against the clause.</div>
					<a name="07011774000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed subsection (10)
fairly briefly, and a number of interesting points came up. I accept
that it is difficult to determine what an associate is, but with
respect to the Minister the debate showed that there are a number of
holes in the attempt that has been made. He generously offered to go
away and consider it, and I urge him to do so as there are a number of
holes. I cannot see why the words &#147;enduring family
relationship&#148; are used. It is difficult to define a friend. I
cannot see why a business partner should not qualify or why a spouse or
parent should not qualify, too. However, with those few comments I
shall give the clause fairly guarded support, but support nevertheless.

						</b> Despite the support that I have given to some of
the amendments moved by the hon. Member for North Down, I do not
believe that they are sufficient to cause us to vote against the clause
in its totality. We believe that non-jury courts are essential in some
circumstances in Northern Ireland. The implication in some of the
opposition to the use of non-jury courts is that somehow or other the
justice in non-jury courts is different from or of a lesser standard
than that in a jury court. That was never the purpose of non-jury
courts; the purpose of non-jury courts was to ensure that justice was
done. Justice was done by stopping the interference of those who would
wish to subvert the justice system by intimidating jurors. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div>
						is one of the reasons that I do not have a great
deal of concern about the continued use of non-jury courts. I see them
as a means of ensuring that the integrity of the justice system remains
and is protected, and that people who would have been guilty of
horrific offences are brought to justice.</div>

accept the point made by the hon. Member for Foyle that the provisions
will make the devolution of policing and justice more difficult. If
anything, they will probably build in a further safeguard for those
concerned about that devolution and whether community confidence is
sufficient for it to work. Those who would want to question a Minister
about why a case is being taken to a non-jury trial would do so with
one view&#151;to change the outcome. They would be seeking
ministerial interference. In the context of Northern Ireland devolution
and the administration of policing and justice, a situation that allows
even the thought that the administration of justice might be interfered
with in that way would make it more difficult to gain the confidence
required for
devolution.</div>

Down said earlier that I was trying to fetter or qualify the

own remarks the hon. Gentleman indicated that it was a divisive issue
in Northern Ireland and the fact that he said that, were it to be

further hard thinking and decisions. A considerable amount of work has
been done since then to deal with the issue in the context of a
reducing number of non-jury trials under the Diplock
system&#151;there were 354 in 1987 and 49 in 2005. However, if there
were jury trials in all cases there would still be a serious risk of

in the small number of cases in which it was necessary a non-jury trial

that it is right way to go, given the sensitive information that is
often dealt with. The DPP is in a good place and has the right kind of

to give the issue some thought because it is a criminal justice matter,

it is not meant as a criticism of the holder; I do so because those
offices are listed in that schedule. Listed among the judicial offices
to which the Lord Chief 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div>
						Justice may delegate the serious responsibility of
deciding on a non-jury trial are the chief child support commissioner
for Northern Ireland; the child support commissioner for Northern
Ireland; the deputy child support commissioner for Northern Ireland;
the president of the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland, and a member
of the panel of chairmen of the fair employment tribunals. The list
extends to more than a score of judicial offices, including lay
magistrate. Are we to understand that the chief social security
commissioner, the Lands Tribunal president, a lay magistrate, or a
member of the mental health review tribunal, all of whom are in listed
in schedule 1 to the 2002 Act, should be tasked with the great
responsibility of deciding on a non-jury trial? I should have
thought
not.</div>

delete all of subsection (2), perhaps the Minister could have a rethink
about to whom exactly the Lord Chief Justice should delegate. There is
no criticism of his judgment. I just think that lay magistrates, chief
commissioners of social security and presidents of the Lands Tribunal
may be somewhat surprised, to put it mildly, if they have delegated to
them a responsibility for a non-jury trial in Northern Ireland in
relation to a proscribed organisation. That is the point that I wish to

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000714"></a>Mr.
Reid:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Lady and share her concerns.
Subsection (2) allows the Lord Chief Justice to decide that a trial, a
part of a trial, or a whole class of trials should be held somewhere
other than Belfast. The hon. Lady read out a list of the various
offices to which the Lord Chief Justice could delegate that decision.
Many of the people on that list will not be legally qualified. I am
concerned that they would be taking very important decisions. Members
of various tribunals might not have a legal qualification. I do not
think it appropriate that everyone on that list should have this power.
I am not familiar with all the courts in Northern Ireland and whether
they have the same levels of security as the courts in Belfast. I would
certainly want the Minister to address that issue. Do other courts have
the correct security facilities to protect the identity of witnesses
who have been granted anonymity? The hon. Lady has raised some
important points and I ask the Minister to
respond.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000715"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> Once again, the hon. Lady demonstrates the
trouble she goes to in looking into the detail of this. I, too, looked
at the list of office holders in schedule 1. She omitted to mention the
president of the special education needs tribunal for Northern Ireland,
who probably sits alongside some of the other people she mentioned.
They all do their job perfectly well. But that is not the issue she
raises here. This is a case of, &#147;If it ain&#146;t broke,
don&#146;t fix it.&#148; I hope to explain to the hon. Lady why I
believe that we should leave the situation alone. This provision is
similar to one that already operates successfully under the Diplock
court system. We see no reason to change it.</div>
					<a name="07011774000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most non-jury trials take place
in Belfast in circumstances where the greatest security can be
afforded. Hon. Members would expect that. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 68</div>
						Occasionally, for various reasons, it may be
necessary and appropriate to hold the proceedings outside Belfast. The
provision gives the Lord Chief Justice the power to make that decision.
It also gives him the power, in the part of the clause to which the
hon. Lady has drawn our attention, to delegate that decision to others.
One can imagine the circumstances when that may occur. For example, if
the Lord Chief Justice is ill, indisposed or away for some reason, it
may be necessary for that decision to be taken in his absence. He needs
the power to delegate.</div>
					<a name="07011774000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, one would expect the
decision to be delegated to someone with appropriate experience and
seniority. The key judgment here is not about the list. It is about the
Lord Chief Justice&#146;s own capacity to decide who in this list
would be the appropriate person to take that decision. The evidence is
that the Lord Chief Justice has operated a similar system under the
Diplock regime perfectly well and without any cause for concern. It is
therefore perfectly legitimate to continue that arrangement and use
schedule 1 to give the Lord Chief Justice discretion in a way that has
already
worked.</div>

giving way. The Diplock courts obviously preceded the list in schedule
1 to the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 of people who do their
jobs very competently but are not all legally qualified. Will the

Justice found himself indisposed or too busy? To whom did he

to check what happened in those days, and I will be happy to write to
her&#151;or to point out that an amendment was made in the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005. I hope that that answers her question
at least partly. The formulation is standard and has been used a number
of times in legislation such as the 2005 Act which sets out other
functions of the Lord Chief Justice. The system already operates in
relation to Diplock and exists in other legislation to give the Lord
Chief Justice flexibility. It has worked and we see no reason to alter
it in the

Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): I am listening
carefully to the Minister&#146;s case, which is quite persuasive, but
the provision seems a incongruous part of the clause. Before we make a
decision on the amendment it is incumbent on him to share with us the
likely number of cases in which the Lord Chief Justice will be
incapacitated and the number of such cases that have occurred under the
current
situation.</div>

able also to share the numbers that the hon. Gentleman mentions I will
happily do so. In 2005, only 49 cases were conducted by non-jury trial.
By definition, the number of those that were delegated by the Lord
Chief Justice is likely to have been small. If there are numbers that I
can share, I will do so and perhaps include them in the same
correspondence as the details requested by the hon. Member for North
Down.</div>

								Lady
Hermon:
						</b> I am indebted to the Minister for trying to
explain why the clause was written as it was. I must point out to him
that there are two paragraphs in subsection (2). Paragraph (b)
specifies that if the Lord Chief Justice is ill or too busy, he can
delegate an important decision to a lord justice of appeal. I shall not
press the amendment, but I look forward with curiosity to hearing the
list of alternatives for the Lord Chief Justice. The Minister has told
us that before the 2002 Act there were more than 300 Diplock court
cases a year, touching on 400. I will be intrigued to find out to whom
the Lord Chief Justice delegated his responsibilities then. The list in
schedule 1 to the 2002 Act includes coroners, for goodness&#146;
sake, and lay magistrates. The alternative is staring us in the face in
paragraph (b). I suggest that the Minister should have a good
night&#146;s sleep and reflect more wisely on the relevant category
of non-jury trials. We should not lose sight of what we are tasking the
judges with; the responsibility is onerous. We have the alternative, a
lord justice of appeal, upon which the Minister needs to reflect
further. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in
clause 5, page 4, line 31, leave
out subsection (4).</div>
					<a name="07011774000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am very concerned about clause 5, which was alluded to in passing by
the hon. Member for Foyle and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire
(Lembit &#214;pik). Having named them, I will check that, but I think
that they were concerned that inferences might be drawn from a
certificate for a non-jury trial being issued by the DPP. The provision
that may allay the fears of the hon. Gentlemen is in clause
5&#151;which I am attacking this
afternoon:</div>
					<a name="07011774000489"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
inference may be drawn by the court from the fact that the certificate
has been issued in relation to the
trial.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording is
interesting, with the emphasis on &#147;the fact&#148;, not on no
inference being drawn from the
certificate.</div>
					<a name="07011774000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
Minister&#146;s good track record in the Home Office&#151;which I
say in all sincerity&#151;he will be familiar with the provisions of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003. He has quoted heavily from the Act to
justify having to issue the certificate before arraignment, which I
have objected to&#151;but we have moved on. The Minister will be well
aware of the provisions on bad character in the 2003 Act. The House
wisely decided to change the law so that a defendant&#146;s bad
character would be admissible as evidence if certain conditions were
satisfied. I will not read out all those conditions, but interested
members of the Committee can look at section 101 of the Act. The
defendant&#146;s bad character can now be included in evidence in
criminal proceedings.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 70</div>
					<a name="07011774000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Not to labour
the point too much, but the introduction to Northern Ireland of the
provisions about non-jury trials, when there is evidence of real and
present danger of jury tampering, has taken an inordinate length of
time&#151;since 2003 until 8 January 2007. Could the Minister assure
the Committee that the provisions on bad character, which were also
legislated for in the 2003 Act, now extend to Northern Ireland? If they
do not, why in heaven&#146;s name do they not? We are part of the
United Kingdom and if the provisions are good enough in Great Britain
they should also be extended to Northern Ireland. There is provision in
section 334 of the Act for bad character provisions to be extended to
Northern Ireland. My first question to the Minister, therefore, is
whether those provisions have been extended and, if so, when was that
done. I suspect, with a sinking heart, that they have not. As with the
jury tampering provisions, until we highlight the issue the Northern
Ireland Office will not see fit to extend the bad character provisions.
However, I hope to be surprised, although I will eat my hat if I
am.</div>
					<a name="07011774000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, will the
Minister explain the impact of subsection (4) on a bad character
application? Can the facts that the DPP used to come to the conclusion
that a non-jury trial is appropriate, and which lead to the issuing of
a certificate for such a trial, go towards a bad character application
being made against the defendant? I should like the Minister to address
those two issues, and that is my reason for tabling the
amendment.</div>

Durkan:
						</b> I oppose the amendment. As the hon. Member for
North Down said, I have expressed concerns about the possibility that
inferences might be drawn not only by the court, but more widely, and
particularly where there is no indication of which conditions are
supposed to have informed the DPP&#146;s issuing of a certificate. If
the amendment were successful, there would be no restriction on a court
drawing an inference from the issuing of the certificate. We do not, of
course, know what effect other evidence in the case might
have.</div>
					<a name="07011774000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
particularly concerned because of some of the Secretary of
State&#146;s comments on Second Reading. At one point, he obviously
misunderstood the Bill, because he said:</div>
					<a name="07011774000490"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the DPP must put the matter
before a judge. If the judge took the view that the action was
unreasonable, he would obviously have an argument with the
DPP.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 December 2006;
Vol. 454, c. 902.]</div>
					<a name="07011774000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
that is completely wrong, as we all know from our reading of the Bill.
However, the Secretary of State later said:</div>
					<a name="07011774000491"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Bill is clear that the DPP
essentially takes the decision and issues the certificate, but he must
have good grounds for that. The judge may want to ask him privately
about the decision.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 December
2006; Vol. 454, c. 903.]</div>
					<a name="07011774000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be very concerned about a judge privately asking the DPP about
some of the issues and conditions, perhaps being privately told what
they were and then being allowed, in conducting the court, to draw an
inference from the fact that a certificate had been issued. That
breaches even the claims that were made about the Diplock courts, where
judges had to warn themselves and meet all sorts of conditions so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>that nobody could say that what was done was of a lesser quality than
what would have been done in a jury court.</div>
					<a name="07011774000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Putting a
judge in a non-jury court in circumstances in which he can draw a
particular inference from the issuing of a certificate will take the
Bill into even more dangerous territory than it is in already. I
therefore oppose the amendment.</div>

Goggins:
						</b> On the question of whether evidence of bad
character has been introduced in Northern Ireland, it is in force
there, not under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, but under equivalent
legislation&#151;the Criminal Justice (Evidence) (Northern Ireland)
Order 2004. That is a different route, but I am sure that the hon.
Member for North Down will be pleased to know that that is the
situation. I hope that that will add to the credibility and strength of
the justice system.</div>
					<a name="07011774000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is the result of a
switch in presumption in relation to the decision as to whether a trial
should be by judge alone, rather than by jury. Under the present,
Diplock court system, the Attorney-General will not de-schedule a case
unless he is satisfied that it is not connected with the emergency in
Northern Ireland. In other words, he has to have positive evidence and
information that a case is not connected with the emergency in Northern
Ireland. There may not be any evidence, but for him to de-schedule it
there has to be positive evidence that it is not connected with the
emergency.</div>
					<a name="07011774000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
system that we are proposing, where the presumption is changed, if a
certificate has been issued, everybody will know that some positive
information must have come before the Director of Public Prosecutions
relating to membership of a proscribed organisation, involvement in
political or religious hostility or the risk that the administration of
justice would be impaired. In other words, the issuing of a certificate
will signal that positive information and evidence has been seen by the
DPP, leading to a judgment that the case should be tried by judge
alone.</div>
					<a name="07011774000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can foresee
that there would be more grounds for inference based on the issuing of
a certificate than there would be under the de-scheduling of cases in
the current system. We seek to question neither the credibility of the
justice system in Northern Ireland, nor the senior judges that preside
over it: they are used to dealing with cases on the facts and reaching
their conclusions in the right way. Given that we are switching the
balance in respect of how the test is carried out, it is important that
it is switched in favour of a presumption of trial by jury, rather than
not. It is important to include this small addition to the clause to
make it clear that no inference can be drawn from the fact that a
certificate has been issued. It is included to strengthen the
credibility of the justice system. Although that is what judges do, it
is none the less important to include this provision in the Bill. I
hope that that reassures the hon. Lady. We seek to make it explicit
that no inference can be drawn from our changing the way in which the
test is carried
out.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div>that has slipped under the radar&#151;and that there will be a

					<a name="07011774000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">

(6).</div>
					<a name="07011774000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
raised this matter previously. The amendment provides that, where the
court is not satisfied that a defendant is guilty of an offence that is
being tried, but is satisfied that he is guilty of another offence of
which a jury could have found him guilty after trial, the court may
convict him of the other offence. My concern is that somebody who is
tried without jury for a specific offence can be found not guilty of
that offence but convicted by that same court, without a jury, of a
completely separate offence. Is that correct? If the second offence is
a similar one, it could be argued that it would waste a lot of court
time to start the trial all over again, but if it is very different,
should it not be considered in a different way and separately? I do not
wish to drag this out. I have raised the matter before, and the
Government came up with all sorts of explanations, but I should like to
hear what the Minister has to say about why they group two offences
together.</div>

							<a name="07011774000728"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I shall try to give a short but careful
explanation, because I know that the hon. Gentleman has raised the
issue before, and it is important to give the correct
answer.</div>
					<a name="07011774000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5)
enables the non-jury court to convict a person of an alternative
offence, where the defendant is found not guilty of the offence for
which he is being tried. The principle behind that provision is taken
from normal criminal procedure. A jury can find a defendant not guilty
of an offence with which he has been charged, but guilty of an
alternative lesser offence even if that offence has not been put on the
indictment. Alternative verdicts are available only where the lesser
offence consists only of legal elements contained in that originally
charged. That means that where a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div>defendant is charged only with murder, a jury can acquit of murder but
instead convict for manslaughter, because murder is similar to
manslaughter. It is the same with robbery and theft. There might be a
trial for robbery that is not found, but if theft is found the
conviction is made.</div>
					<a name="07011774000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is not
possible to move from murder to theft or from murder to robbery. The
offences have to be of like nature for a conviction on the lesser
offence to be found. The lesser offence arises from the same facts, and
therefore the circumstances that have led to the decision for non-jury
trial in that case will apply. It clearly makes sense for the tribunal
that has already heard all the witnesses and come to a conclusion on
the facts to enter the appropriate verdict rather than to start from
scratch. It is in the interests of justice that we do not start all
over again. That is important&#151;the criminal justice system does
not allow us to start all over again on the same charges. Under the
changes to the double jeopardy rule&#151;this takes us back again to
the Criminal Justice Act 2003&#151;it is possible to retry for the
same offence only where the matters are very serious and there is new
and compelling evidence.</div>
					<a name="07011774000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not give the judge
here the same powers that a jury would have to convict on a lesser
offence, somebody who is not convicted of the most serious offence but
who has none the less committed an offence, could walk scot free from
the court. That would indeed be something that any member of the
Committee would
regret.</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000729"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
explanation. Is he satisfied that, as the Bill is drafted, the two
offences&#151;murder and manslaughter in the example that he
gave&#151;would be
linked?</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000730"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I am satisfied that they would. The Bill is clear
enough, and that is understood in criminal justice legislation and
procedure generally. There has to be that close association between the
two offences for there to be a finding of guilt on the lesser offence.
That relationship has to exist; it is not possible for the court to
switch dramatically from one offence to another.</div>
					<a name="07011774000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (6) contains one of
the main safeguards applicable to non-jury trial. Where the court
convicts a defendant, it must give a judgment stating the reasons for
the conviction at&#151;or as soon as is reasonably practicable
after&#151;the time of the conviction. That helps to ensure the
European convention on human rights compatibility of the system. It
also provides transparency and helps to increase confidence that
non-jury trials are fair. That is the point that the hon. Member for
East Antrim made when we discussed clause 1. The fact that a trial is a
non-jury trial does not mean that it is an unfair trial. The standard
of justice has been very high indeed, and part of the underpinning of
that is to ensure that the statement is made clearly at the end of the
trial or as soon as possible afterwards. It is a safeguard to ensure
that, in what are extraordinary, unusual circumstances, justice is done
and&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle

						so I will rephrase it. Does the Minister accept that
the problems with the credibility of a situation where certificates are
issued without the information being revealed or indicated, and people
do not know why the certificates were issued, would be compounded if
the court that was held on the basis of a certificate could convict
someone and, as a result of the measure, not be under an obligation to
produce a statement of judgment in a timely fashion that said why they
were convicted? Then, people would say, &#147;We weren&#146;t told
why we were going to a non-jury court, and now we&#146;ve been
convicted and we&#146;re not even told why we have been
convicted.&#148;</div>

defended it and explained the Government&#146;s position. It is
important that at last we have something on which we can agree, which
is the importance of the fact that the court makes absolutely clear the
reasons for the finding of guilt and provides an explanation of that.
That ensures that we comply with human rights legislation and, as
important, it offers credibility to the system that we are putting in
place, so that justice is done and is seen to be done, even if some of
the decisions are not particularly transparent to the public eye. I

						</b> I apologise, Sir Nicholas. I have full faith
in the ability of the Committee, including my hon. Friend the Member
for Argyll and Bute, to cover the other matters, but I do wish to make
a point about clause 7.</div>
					<a name="07011774000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again, it is not necessary
to repeat everything that was said on Second Reading, but there are
significant issues about the clause. In essence, clause 7 is
objectionable because it just does not take account of the observations
of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on this issue. My party did not
oppose the Bill on Second Reading, but I did say in the debate at that
time that if clause 7 were not removed or massively altered, we would
not support the Bill on Third Reading.</div>
					<a name="07011774000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The key
reason for opposing the clause is one that has already been indirectly
alluded to by the hon. Member for Foyle. Not only is there no provision
in the Bill for an appeal against a decision of trial without jury, but
appeal is expressly prohibited. We believe that that is completely
wrong. Furthermore&#151;in my judgment at least&#151;it cannot be
right that the Director of Public Prosecutions can issue a certificate
for a trial to be conducted without a jury, without the defendant even
having any means to make representations to the DPP, or having any
means of appeal.</div>
					<a name="07011774000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
similar proposal was made in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
Claimants, etc.) Bill 2004. What was then clause 11 of that Bill would
have inserted new section 108A in the Nationality, Asylum and
Immigration Act 2002. That provision would have cut off all appeals and
judicial review by the ordinary courts on immigration matters. It would
also have excluded habeas corpus applications in immigration cases. At
the time, the Joint Committee on Human Rights issued a damning report
on the provision. It stated that the Committee regarded the proposed
restriction
as</div>
					<a name="07011774000492"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;inherently
objectionable as an attack on an important element of the scheme for
protecting Convention rights in the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">That quotation
comes from paragraph 1.28 of the Committee&#146;s third report, dated
19 January
2004.</div>
					<a name="07011774000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite attempts
by the Government to assuage the Committee&#146;s concerns, a second
report stated that</div>
					<a name="07011774000493"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
could be strongly argued that the ouster of judicial review of tribunal
decisions contemplated by clause 11 has not been justified by any
argument advanced by the Government. There is a real danger that this
would violate the rule of law in breach of international law, the Human
Rights Act 1998 and the fundamental principles of our common
law.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was in
paragraph 71 of the Committee&#146;s fifth report, dated 2 February
2004. As far as I am concerned, the provisions before us are the
same&#151;albeit in a different piece of legislation&#151;and are
equally objectionable.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): Does not the hon. Gentleman
agree that the issues here are different? In the present context, we
are talking about life and death matters, because if the detailed
reasons for the director&#146;s decision were to be effectively
challenged in court by judicial review, it would be necessary to go
into much more detail in public than is foreseen, for the reasons we
have discussed. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that in an immigration
case there is a case to be made for doing that. In the present case it
seems to me that there is potentially a real
risk.</div>
					
					
					<a name="07011774000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07011774000741"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman
believes that there is a difference, but I do not share his view. The
principle is the same. Although it may be argued that immigration cases
have a different magnitude, let us recognise that those cases too can
be life or death matters that can divide or unite families. For me, the
important point is that the proposal would set a precedent that was
rejected in earlier legislation: if it were allowed to pass, it would
set the precedent of acceptance of the opposing view in a piece of
British legislation. It would be inconsistent for the Liberal
Democrats&#151;or anyone concerned about the human rights
consequences of the earlier legislation&#151;to support such a
provision
now.</div>
					<a name="07011774000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Clause
7(3) actually
says:</div>
					<a name="07011774000494"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Section
7(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) (claim that public authority
has infringed Convention right) is subject to subsections (1) and
(2).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">So if my
understanding is correct, the provision says that the Human
Rights Act is subjugated by clauses 7(1) and 7(2). In other words, the
clause itself sets out a hierarchy of priorities in terms of rights,
and indicates that it is required in order to subject the Human Rights
Act to a process of relegation&#151;in order not to fall foul of that
statute.</div>
					<a name="07011774000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That is our
case; that is why we are opposed to clause 7. The only way for
the Minister to convince us otherwise would be to explain why it is not
similar to the precedent defeated previously. He will have to say why
the observations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on that
previous legislation, which was very similar, can be disregarded on
this occasion. I doubt that he can.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000742"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> The clause presents one of the most draconian
aspects of the Bill. Unlike the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act
2003, under the Bill, the DPP does not have to apply in court to have a
case tried without a jury. However, the clause goes much further: it
makes it impossible to question or to challenge that certificate by way
of judicial review. That runs totally contrary to the
Government&#146;s own consultation paper, which stated that</div>
					<a name="07011774000495"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As with other
administrative decisions, the DPP&#146;s decision will be judicially
reviewable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also runs
contrary to the recommendations of Lord Carlile, who clearly believed
that the decision on certification should be judicially
reviewable.</div>
					<a name="07011774000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say in
passing that the fact that the Government can be so dismissive of such
a significant view is one reason why we have no faith in what the
Government offered last week about MI5&#151;that we should be assured
that Lord Carlile will be reviewing it annually.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div>
					<a name="07011774000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have already told
us that the provision merely reproduces the result of the Shuker case.
In that case, it was decided that the decision of the Attorney-General
to deschedule was</div>
					<a name="07011774000496"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
procedure on which the courts should be reluctant to
intrude&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011774000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">If so, and if
the courts had already established for themselves that it was a
procedure on which they should be reluctant to intrude, why is it now
necessary to go further? Why is it necessary to ensure that the courts
cannot even get a look in through the door or the window, never mind
intrude? The Government are exaggerating and extending the implications
of the Shuker case through the clause.</div>
					<a name="07011774000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that the
Government also argue that it will be possible for the courts to step
in, at least if there is bad faith on the part of the DPP. However,
subsection (1) does not permit that; it rules out judicial
review&#151;full stop. It is true that subsection (2) provides that
the court is prevented from judicially reviewing where a decision is
taken without bad faith, but that is not to say that a court will be
permitted to do so if there is bad faith. After all, the
Minister&#146;s argument is that the court should not
intrude.</div>
					<a name="07011774000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shockingly,
the Government back the provision with a derogation from the Human
Rights Act 1998 under subsection (3), and therefore from the European
convention on human rights&#151;that is to say, a
derogation from the basic standards of decency that
are meant to have applied throughout Europe for more than 50 years.
That is an extraordinary thing for any Government to do. It is
particularly extraordinary for the Government to want to do it in
Northern Ireland, especially at a time when the security situation is
improving. They are constantly telling us how much things have changed
and saying that people should not have any worries or hang-ups about
the situation, yet they still want to introduce this extremely
draconian clause. I oppose its standing
part.</div>

it were otherwise, there would be no need for subsection (3). It is
ridiculous, and, as the hon. Member for Foyle said, there can be no
judicial review. I am not a lawyer, although I studied law for a while,
but I am not aware of any other area of law in which judicial review is
impossible. Lawyers on the Committee may be able to advise me better,
but it seems to me that judicial review should be available for any
decisions that are not made in the correct manner.
</div>
				
					<a name="07011774000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
do we know that that will not be the case with the Bill? Decisions

participated in the debate on Second Reading will know, I am extremely
uncomfortable with all of clause 7, and I shall certainly support
others in voting against it. I might not have supported them to date in
voting against other aspects of the Bill, but I have no hesitation in
this instance.</div>
					<a name="07011774000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Explanatory notes are very
helpful, and I know that civil servants spend an inordinate amount of
time scrutinising legislation and judicial cases to compile them for
the benefit of readers of the legislation. Although they are not part
of the legislation, they are a helpful background note. In this
instance, the explanatory notes laboured&#151;as did the Secretary of
State on Second Reading&#151;a small, narrow point taken from the
case alluded to by the hon. Member for Foyle, the Shuker case. That was
a decision, which the Minister mentioned, made by the Lord Chief
Justice of Northern Ireland and Lord Justice Campbell about whether the
Attorney-General should have descheduled an offence and whether that
decision was reviewable.</div>
					<a name="07011774000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						After
some discussion and a lot of thought two of our most senior judges in
Northern Ireland, both of whom are extremely experienced, came to the
conclusion, cited in the explanatory notes and by the Secretary of
State on Second Reading, that the descheduling of
offences</div>
					<a name="07011774000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is not a
process which is suitable for the full panoply of judicial review
superintendence. In particular, we do not consider that the decision is
amenable to review on the basis that it failed to comply with the
requirements of procedural
fairness.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
would have been accurate and would have done justice to the judgment of
those two senior judges in Northern Ireland had the explanatory notes
and Secretary of State been so kind as to go on to explain to the House
on Second Reading that the judgment continues in paragraph
27:</div>
					<a name="07011774000499"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It must be
made clear that while we have concluded that judicial review is not
available to challenge the decision of the Attorney in the present
cases, we do not consider that this will be excluded in every
circumstance.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on
to
say:</div>
					<a name="07011774000500"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Depending
on the circumstances of other cases that may arise, further grounds of
judicial review challenge may be deemed appropriate but we do not
consider that it would be helpful, or even possible, to predict what
those grounds might
be.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not fair and
accurate to construe the Shuker case as a restriction, as clause 7
does, to the grounds of &#147;dishonesty or bad faith&#148;. That
is not what the judges were saying. They were saying that they would
not set out an exhaustive list of the grounds for judicial review. On
the narrow ground of the Shuker case, they decided not to open the case
and review it on the grounds of &#147;procedural fairness&#148;. It
beggars belief that under clause 7(2) a court would be
prevented</div>
					<a name="07011774000501"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;from
entertaining proceedings to determine whether a decision or purported
decision of the Director (without dishonesty or bad
faith)&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011774000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">those are
the two allowable

make a decision that is wrong in law and wrong in fact because he is
unwell&#151;for example, medically unwell&#151;and a court would
not be able to review such a decision. We are talking about
someone&#146;s civil liberties in the context of a Government who
made the European convention on human rights part and parcel of our
domestic law, and to which I say hallelujah. That was the best decision
they ever made. I am amazed and offended that they are now going to
say, &#147;Well, we might have done that. It was a good decision at
the time, but when it suits us, we will, through clause 7(3), make the
Human Rights Act 1998 subject to subsections (1) and
(2).&#148; That was done on the basis of a distorted interpretation
of one case, the Shuker case, where the judges were much fairer than
the explanatory notes or the Secretary of State. I am completely
opposed to clause 7 as drafted and, honestly, if I were the Minister I
would not even attempt to justify
it.</div>

possible where dishonesty or bad grace are suspected. However,
subsection (1) does not appear to envisage that possibility. Will the
Minister clarify whether, in the eyes of the law, the proposal as it

						</b> Although it is fairly evident from some comments
that it may be a tall order, I will do my best to persuade the
Committee that we are placing Shuker on a statutory footing, as
mentioned by the hon. Member for North Down. The Shuker judgment makes
it clear that the limitation we provide is not incompatible with the
European convention on human rights. The reason why the Bill is
compatible with the ECHR is because it guarantees a fair trial. The
convention does not guarantee trial by jury; it guarantees a fair
trial. As has been made clear by all hon. Members on Second Reading and
today, whatever questions people may have about the Diplock system, it
delivers fair justice and has done so in the teeth of some difficult
situations. That standard of justice will continue and I am happy to
stand beside the commitment my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
made about the Bill being compliant with the ECHR, because it
guarantees a fair trial.</div>

							<a name="07011774000747"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> We are disputing the decision about the mode of
the trial, not the trial itself. It is a fundamental right that if a
legal decision has been reached through the wrong channel, there is the
option of a judicial review. That is a fundamental basic right. I do
not know why clause 7(3) is in the Bill at all when the whole Bill is
supposed to be compatible with the European convention on human rights.
If the Bill was compatible, there would be no need for clause
7(3).</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000748"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> We are simply dealing with the decision on mode
of trial; this is not about a fair trial. The trial would be fair
whether it was by a judge alone or a jury. Yes, we are limiting the
grounds on which a challenge can be made, and that is for the good
reasons we rehearsed earlier. I shall repeat some of those.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>
					<a name="07011774000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was difference of opinion
across the Committee, but the overwhelming judgment was that it is
still necessary to have trial by judge alone in Northern Ireland. I
believe that that view has held sway, as demonstrated in the votes
taken so far, because we have chosen the administrative route for
decisions about the mode of trial rather than the judicial route. We
have done that because if evidence is given in a judicial process on
whether a person belongs to a proscribed organisation, with which they
associate with, or on other aspects of the test, it has to be shared
with the defendant, and with that comes many risks, such as further
intimidation.</div>
					<a name="07011774000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
greatest risk of all is that such cases are tried not by judge alone
but by jury. Many risks come with that. We have decided that trial by
judge alone is justified in certain circumstances and that the
administrative route is the right one. Once we have taken that
decision, we cannot open that process to a system of judicial appeal
because that would put at risk all that we have sought to protect with
our earlier decisions. All that information would have to be shared in
a judicial process, and that would bring into question the system of
having trials by judge alone, in limited circumstances, which we seek
to introduce. There is no inconsistency. If we choose the
administrative route of having trials by judge alone, we cannot have a
judicial process questioning that, because it would undermine the whole
process.</div>

						</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I put it to the Minister,
as have other hon. Members, that something cannot comply with the Human
Rights Act or the convention if it provides for a derogation from them.
He still has not addressed the point about the Government&#146;s
clear and unambiguous statement in their
consultation:</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000503"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
with other administrative decisions, the DPP&#146;s decision will be
judicially
reviewable.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011774000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
answering the question about which court will consider judicial review
cases brought on the grounds of dishonesty or bad faith, will the
Minister tell us how someone will be able to mount such a case if the
DPP&#146;s certificate is to contain no indication of which
conditions are supposed to have informed its issue? How can one prove
dishonesty if there is no information and no case
stated?</div>

Goggins:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The High Court is, of course, the court to
which reference could be made, albeit on the limited grounds of bad
faith and dishonesty. I do not deny for a minute that they are limited
grounds. They are necessary to provide some assurance for the most
extreme circumstances, but I set my face clearly against a judicial
process of challenge given that we have chosen an administrative route
to protect justice. I accept that some Committee members disagree with
that argument, but it is coherent and is consistent with all that has
gone before.</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000756"></a>Mr.
Bone:
						</b> The Minister cannot have it both ways. Subsection
7(1) makes it clear there can be no challenge, irrespective of what it
says later. There can be no consideration and no challenge. The
Minister is right to say that an administrative route is what he
prefers, but he has to accept that it infringes the
convention.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000757"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I do not accept that. What the European
convention on human rights guarantees, and what we are signed up to, is
a fair trial, and that will happen. Even if the decision to give a
certificate is one that the defendant wishes to challenge, and even if
he is not able to challenge in the way that some hon. Members would
like, he still gets a fair trial.</div>

								Sammy
Wilson:
						</b> My concern is not that the grounds have been
limited for challenging these decisions. I have made it quite clear
that I believe there is still opportunity for a fair trial. My concern
is whether, if the challenge is on the basis of honesty, that opens the
door for information regarding the background of the individual or the
associations of the individual and how that information has come to the
DPP to be revealed to those who challenge. We then have the
difficulties that we had before with national security and the
possibility of the identity of agents being
revealed.</div>
					
					<a name="07011774000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000759"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that that would
not be the case because the grounds for the appeal relate to the
character and way of operating of the Director of Public Prosecutions
rather than the background of the defendant. I can therefore give him
the assurance that he seeks. In adopting the administrative route we
seek to protect information
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>sources. Those small number of cases where it is justified to make a
certificate can be very sensitive indeed and it is absolutely essential
to keep that out of the public domain and away from the defendant in
order to make sure that we actually have a fair
trial.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000760"></a>Mr.
Robertson:
						</b> I return to the opportunity to appeal against
the decision on the basis of dishonesty or bad faith. I am not
convinced that this would be available under the clause as it is
written. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough says, clause
7(1) expressly rules it out. Therefore, will the Minister try to
re-word it so that it makes it clear that in certain
circumstances&#151;he can specify them if he wishes&#151;it is
possible to appeal. I do not believe that the present wording of the
clause allows
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000761"></a>Paul
Goggins:
						</b> It is important that subsections (1) and (2) are
read together. They make it clear that we are not excluding judicial
review altogether. There are grounds to make the challenge. The grounds
are, however, limited. They are limited in a way that is consistent
with the Shuker judgment, which we are now seeking to put on a
statutory basis. The grounds are very limited indeed but they are
compliant with the ECHR. The Shuker judgment makes that absolutely
clear.</div>
					<a name="07011774000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will, of
course, reflect on the point the hon. Gentleman has made, but I
encourage him to read the whole of the clause to see that there are
limited grounds for appeal. They are limited grounds and necessarily
so.</div>

&#214;pik:
						</b> I do not want the Minister to turn this into
a dialogue with each individual so I will try not to intervene on him
again. I do, however, have to back up what the hon. Member for
Tewkesbury says: there can be no misinterpretation of clause 7(1). It
is utterly clear and unconditional. To suggest that subsection (2)
provides some latitude to challenge these proceedings would assume that
by saying &#147;without dishonesty or bad faith&#148; is somehow
more important than the unconditional statement in subsection
(1).</div>
					<a name="07011774000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (3)
would indicate that the Government are aware that this does not really
comply with human rights legislation. I do not wish to embark on a
dialogue or contention with the Minister, but I would like to hear him
say that he will take this clause away and re-think it and perhaps come
back on Report with something that is compliant and does not need
subsection (3).</div>

Goggins:
						</b> If we can make it clearer we will do so. However,
undertaking to reconsider it does not mean that we are shifting our
ground; absolutely not. The proposal makes it clear that the court
cannot question the decision of the DPP to make a certificate having
considered both limbs of the statutory test. It is that decision, and
the grounds on which the DPP made it, that the court cannot challenge.
That is explicit; it is understood.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 83</div>
					<a name="07011774000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision can be challenged
only on the grounds of dishonesty and bad faith in relation to the
character and the conduct of the DPP, not his judgment in relation to
the statutory test. It is entirely right that no court can challenge
the decision. We are not having a full-blown judicial process to
consider an appeal against that decision. We make that clear; it is our
choice. I am open about that; we are taking the administrative route,
which subsection (1) makes absolutely
clear.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011774000766"></a>Mark
Durkan:
						</b> Again, I remind the Minister that when he talks
about taking the administrative route, as with other administrative
decisions the Government&#146;s own paper said that the DPP&#146;s
decision will be judicially reviewable. That is a very significant
exception.</div>
					<a name="07011774000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

of jurisdiction or an error of
law.&#148;</div>

narrower when one considers the full subsection.</div>
					<a name="07011774000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister accept that
what he is saying clearly now means that what the Secretary of State

								Paul
Goggins:
						</b> There are two distinct processes, one is the
issuing of the certificate, which is based on a decision made by the
DPP in the light of any information he has set against the statutory
test. The certificate is issued, there is arraignment and then there is
a trial by judge alone. It is up to that judge how he or she conducts
that trial. They are two separate processes and I am happy to have the
opportunity once again to explain that to my hon. Friend.</div>
					<a name="07011774000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend referred to the
consultation, which was clear: there would be grounds for a challenge
to be made and we have provided for that, on very limited grounds, I
agree. He may not agree with our position, but there is the ability to
challenge on the grounds of bad faith or dishonesty. However,
subsections (1) and (2) make it explicit that there is no
provision to challenge the decision of the DPP in relation to the
judgment he has made on the facts that he has, set against the
statutory test. We are clear that that is coherent and absolutely
consistent with our stance in relation to the statutory test on
non-jury trials.</div>

how could someone possibly challenge on the grounds of dishonesty or

faith?</div>

agreement and disagreement in the Committee on this issue are
evident.</div>
					<a name="07011774000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I make
one final point, which has not been made so far? It is open to the
defendant, as is the case under the Diplock system, to make
representations to the prosecution about whether the statutory test
applies. It is possible to make representations to the DPP. The
defendant does not have to be a completely passive person in this
process. Again, I reiterate, we believe that an administrative route
and a statutory test with limited grounds of appeal is the best way in
the limited number of circumstances where trial by judge alone is still
needed in Northern Ireland.</div>
