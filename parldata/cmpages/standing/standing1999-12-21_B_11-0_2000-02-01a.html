Amendment moved [this day]: No. 140, in page 22, line 30, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) In this section "trade secret" means any confidential trade information which is disclosed to a competitor would cause harm to its owner".-[Mr. Greenway.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I had just moved amendment No. 140, and was about to give way to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath).
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I wish only to say that the hon. Gentleman"s earlier remarks might have been construed as suggesting that the Liberal Democrats opposed all commercial confidentiality. That is, of course, not the case. We accept that there are certain circumstances in which that might be appropriate. We object to the breadth of the exemption in the clause. The hon. Gentleman addresses that in his amendment, and we shall support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful for that clarification because, when the hon. Gentleman spoke earlier, I almost thought that he did not support the amendment. I was sure that that could not be right.
<P>
We believe that there is a need for commercial interest exemption generally, but have some concerns about the drafting of this clause, especially subsection (1), which provides an exemption for information if it constitutes a trade secret. Some commentaries on the clause appear to suggest that subsections (1), (2) and (3) somehow work together. That is not how I read them. Subsection (1) provides a separate exemption from that in subsection (2). Subsection (1) provides a class exemption:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Information is exempt information if it constitutes a trade secret."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
End of story. The provisions in subsection (2) about information that would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prejudice the commercial interests of any person"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
have nothing to do with subsection (1). They are two separate exemptions.
<P>
In that respect, the clause is unique because I cannot recall any of the other provisions for class or contents exemptions having two separate exemptions in the same clause-one a class-based exemption, the other a contents-based exemption. I am sure that the Minister will advise me if I am wrong. That may have added to the confusion. The majority of such measures are not in that category.
<P>
We must consider the question whether the sentence-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Information is exempt information if it constitutes a trade secret."-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is adequate. The Committee needs to consider whether the term "trade secret" should be defined in the Bill. The amendment would add the following subsection:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) In this section "trade secret" means any confidential trade information which is disclosed to a competitor would cause harm to its owner."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is a trade secret? I am sure that we would agree that the formula for making Coca-Cola would be a trade secret. That is a secret manufacturing process or formula which, if obtained by a competitor, could, and probably would, remove a significant commercial advantage enjoyed by its owner. I am always impressed when I visit the Nestlé factory in my constituency to find that there are secret ingredients in a number of the items of confectionery made there. I would be happy to name them, but I do not want to be out of order.
<P>
Some things are obviously trade secrets, but others are less obvious. Is a negotiating position, marketing information, competitor assessment, personnel information or information about customers a trade secret? More important for the purpose of this exemption, what element of contracts let by public authorities to private sector organisations constitutes a trade secret and should therefore benefit from this exemption?
<P>
When, in the last Parliament, the Home Affairs Committee looked in detail at the management of the private prison service, it constantly came up against the question of which parts of the private prison contract were commercially confidential and which were open to scrutiny. Commercial confidentiality verged on being absolutely necessary as an exemption in the minds of the directors of the company, because in their view it was a trade secret, something that they had to keep from their competitors.
<P>
We do not believe that the trade secret goes far enough, because it is not obvious that there needs to be a harm test. As I have said-and I think that there is general acceptance-this is a blanket class exemption, but should there not be a harm test? The wording contains no requirement for confidentiality, nor does it say whether it belongs to the person whose commercial interests might be at risk if it was disclosed; nor is it clear whether it relates only to the manufacture or sale of goods or to all the contracts, some of which are of the kind that I have described. Therefore, the Bill offers enormously wide protection.
<P>
The protection given in the code of practice, which already exists, is much narrower. It contains just one exemption:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Information including commercial confidences, trade secrets or intellectual property whose unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a crystal clear definition, which commends itself. We do not suggest that the Government"s exemption should be limited to that, but to ensure that as much information as would be released under the code would be released under the Bill, the Bill could benefit from a definition of trade secret.
<P>
Circulating among members of the Committee is a suggestion from the Confederation of British Industry that it would not welcome a definition in the Bill. Far be it from me not to sit up and take notice when the CBI gives us its view, for which we are grateful, but its argument that there should not be a definition stands on two premises. The first is the approach that the Law Commission has adopted to the misuse of trade secrets in its consultation paper-I shall come to that in a moment-and the second is that it would like the matter to be covered by guidance.
<P>
As regards the Law Commission"s approach to a definition of trade secrets, its 1997 report observed:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are unaware of any authority on the construction of the phrase in these provisions of trade secrets"-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is to say in "Legislating the Criminal Code: Misuse of Trade Secrets", the Law Commission"s own consultation paper of 1997. The commission went on to propose a new statutory offence of misusing trade secrets. It proposed a definition, whose essential elements were that it applies to information that its owner wishes to keep secret, is not generally known, and has some economic value which derives from the fact that it is not generally known.
<P>
The Bill therefore protects three different types of information held by a public authority about business. The first is information supplied to and accepted by the authority in confidence, which is covered by clause 39 and does not need to be covered by this clause. The second is information, whether confidential or not, which could prejudice anyone"s commercial interests, which is the second exemption in clause 41(2). The third is information that is not generally known but not necessarily confidential, which has economic value as a result. The disclosure of such information, however, would not necessarily prejudice anyone"s commercial interests because there is no prejudice test in the subsection (1) provision of a blanket class exemption of trade secrets. The case for such a blanket class protection is far from clear. On the contrary, it could lead to a general presumption that non-confidential information held by a business would be exempt. We think that that danger is another argument for having a clear definition of a trade secret, which adds important qualifications. There are three such qualifications: first, the information would be confidential; secondly, it would relate to trade; and, thirdly, its disclosure would be likely to cause harm to its owner. The Government"s overriding motivation for including such a provision-which we do not oppose-is to prevent the harm that would arise, because of the use that a competitor would make of it, were the secret to be divulged. Although we understand the CBI"s concern, it is important that the Committee should address that matter.
<P>
It is far from clear how guidance could be framed, and under what provision. What status or force would such guidance carry? Because there is no definition of trade secrets, no requirement in the exemption even for the most substantial damage test-let alone a harm or prejudice test-and no confidentiality requirement, subsection (1) needs attention. We hope that the Government will consider those points carefully, and will respond to our concerns today and at a later stage.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor"s Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> It is a pleasure, Dr. Clark, to serve in a Committee under your chairmanship. The amendment would mean that "trade secret", under clause 41(1), would attract a definition, and therefore be limited to the definition set out in the amendment. There are a number of UK statutes in which the expression "trade secrets" is used, but where it is not defined further. For example, a number of Acts contain provisions prohibiting the disclosure of trade secrets obtained in connection with the exercise of a power of entry or inspection given by those Acts. Section 325(3) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and section 8(5) of the Data Protection Act 1998 also contain a reference to trade secrets.
<P>
Part of the reason why the term is not defined is that it covers such a wide range of materials in different types of industry. The courts have considered that. Without wanting to sound like a barrister making submissions-my previous occupation-I shall refer the Committee to the case of Lansing Linde Ltd v. Kerr in the Court of Appeal, which I cited on many occasions. It described a trade secret as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"information, which, if disclosed to a competitor, would be liable to cause real (or significant) harm to the owner of the secret".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement was qualified by the court in two ways. First,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it must be information used in trade or business".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the owner must limit the dissemination of it or at least not encourage or permit widespread publication".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Save for that, the courts have not precisely defined a trade secret in every circumstance.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I draw the Committee"s attention to the first important feature of the definition adopted by the courts. In Lansing Linde Ltd v. Kerr, a trade secret was described as 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"information, which if disclosed to a competitor, would be liable to cause real (or significant) harm to the owner of the secret".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment, however, would define a trade secret as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"information which if disclosed to a competitor would cause harm".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that definition is potentially much wider than the courts", which specifies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"real (or significant) harm to the owner of the secret".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) asked why the clause does not establish a harm test. The addition of a further harm test would be otiose where a trade secret is defined as information that, if disclosed to a competitor, would be liable to cause real or significant harm. Therefore, the Government are content to adopt the generally understood definition set out in English law.
<P>
In countries such as Canada and the United States, a statutory definition has been adopted in freedom of information legislation, but in other countries, notably Australia, it has not. In Searle Australia Property Ltd. v. Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the federal court of Australia considered the meaning of the term "trade secret" in section 43(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which is the corresponding Australian legislation. The court held that the term should bear its ordinary meaning, and cited the "Oxford English Dictionary" definition of a trade secret as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a device or technique used in a particular trade or occupation and giving an advantage not generally known".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court then cited Lansing Linde Ltd v. Kerr, and maintained that a trade secret need not be technical, but that it must be used or useable in the trade in question. Again, a harm test was adopted and the question whether the relevant information could truly be said to be a trade secret was taken seriously.
<P>
That demonstrated that the term "trade secret" has been described in, but not defined in, case law. It is sufficiently wide to cover information of a non-technical nature, but sufficiently narrow to exclude information not used in trade or business. On that basis, and given that the term has been generally used in an undefined form in other legislation passed by this House, it is neither necessary nor sensible to define in the Bill the precise meaning of "trade secret".
<P>
The hon. Member for Rydale asked whether this is the only clause in the Bill to combine what are, in effect, class and contents-based exemptions. Clause 38 strikes a similar balance between two related but not identical parts that deal with personal information.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do not think that that counts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that that does not count.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary understands the point that I am making. I am happy graciously to accept that, like clause 41, clause 38, is a hybrid clause, but it does not quite fall into the same category as other, narrow definitions in the exemptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I, too, understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but it is not central to our debate. He rightly referred to the definition of "trade secret" that is proposed in the Law Commission"s paper on the new criminal offence for the misuse of trade secrets. However, it is one thing to propose a definition in the context of creating a new criminal offence, where the boundaries of that offence must be circumscribed with clarity to ensure that people know where they stand with regard to criminal law, and quite another to propose a definition in civil rights legislation, which is what we are doing. Our definition will encourage openness, and will balance the right to access information available to official bodies with the need to protect emerging and evolving business practices.
<P>
The Government are concerned that, if the amendment were accepted, the categories of information that might be regarded as a trade secret could be considerably wider than those that appear to be defined by the courts. Given other UK legislation has used the term "trade secret" in a civil context without defining it, and a perfectly satisfactory working classification has been developed by the courts, I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will agree with the way in which the Government want to proceed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Before the Parliamentary Secretary sits down-I hope that we will not need to persuade him to speak again-will he comment on the Confederation of British Industry"s point about guidance? He has made it clear the Government intend that the phrase "trade secret" should carry the "real (or significant)" harm test that is associated with the court case to which he referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for providing the opportunity for me to say something on that point. Guidance is ultimately a matter for the commissioner, but in determining what is appropriate in such a clause, the commissioner will be guided by courts" interpretation of the phrase "trade secret". Like the rest of us, she will be constrained by the meaning of that phrase. The courts have made it clear that a trade secret is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"information, which, if disclosed to a competitor, would be liable to cause real (or significant) harm".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, within those limits, the exact phrasing of guidance will be a matter for the commissioner.
<P>
Mr. Greenway: That was an extremely useful exchange and I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his response. Given the court definition of "real (or significant) harm" to which he referred, and given the Government"s refusal to accept significant harm or substantial prejudice in respect of most other exemptions in the Bill relating to public authorities, it is tempting to suggest that there is one law for the private sector and another for the public sector. However, we shall let the matter pass.
<P>
In years to come, this exchange may well lead us into Pepper v. Hart territory, which will cheer up the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher). The Parliamentary Secretary has made it clear that, in introducing this proposed class exemption, the Government intend that the definition of a "trade secret" should meet the "real (or significant)" harm test determined by the courts. It is important to business, and to the public interest in disclosure, that we get the balance right.
<P>
While the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking, I was wondering how a public authority might come by such secret information. The Food Standards Agency may, in investigating various food processes, become privy to the recipe for a food product or drink that would be a trade secret. I understand the point made about real or significant damage, which would result if such information were released.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that, in determining whether there is a class exemption for trade secrets, the public authority is none the less constrained by the public interest balance test contained in clause 13. Does he, therefore, accept that the public interest will be protected by clause 13 in determining the right balance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is a helpful intervention. I was about to use an analogy that I have used before, in which an organisation might seek to use this exemption to persuade a public authority not to release information that genuinely should be released in the public interest, but which might be deemed a trade secret using a broader definition. It was useful for the Parliamentary Secretary to anticipate my thinking in that regard, and to confirm the interaction of clause 13 with all the class and contents-based exemptions that we have considered.
<P>
I also take the Parliamentary Secretary"s point about guidance being a matter for the commissioner. I take a degree of reassurance from the Government"s intentions, and from their explanation as to why they would not include a formal definition of a trade secret in the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of the debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 (Debate on Clause or Schedule standing part), and Standing Order No. 89 (Procedure in Standing Committees), That the clause stand part of the Bill:</B>-
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 41 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibitions on disclosure</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I seek clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the application of subsection (1)(a), which refers to measures prohibited by law. The 1993 White Paper on open government stated that there were about 250 statutory measures restricting freedom of information at that time. In the consultation paper of 1999, the Government stated their intention to reduce that number by repeal during this process.
<P>
The Home Office has helpfully supplied the Public Administration Committee with an interim list of 29 statutory provisions that it intends to repeal or amend, and a further 26 that it regards as flowing from international legal obligations, which could not be removed. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the Committee whether further progress has been made on the case-by-case review of those restrictions, and whether more repeals are proposed? Will he address the specific example of section 118 of the Medicines Act 1968? It prevents the Medicines Control Agency, the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Department of Health from disclosing: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any information obtained by or furnished to him in pursuance of this Act...unless the disclosure was made in the performance of his duty"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has led to an unacceptable degree of secrecy. Basic information on medical products is not available. I shall illustrate how that applies with the example of the medical cement call Boneloc, used in hip replacement operations in the mid-1990s. It was found to disintegrate rapidly within the body-not a good outcome for the patient. A formal hazard warning was issued on Boneloc in April 1995 and hon. Members sought further information. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) asked the then Secretary of State for Health:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"what is his calculation of the total number of patients on whom Boneloc cement was used; and where in the United Kingdom it was used."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The then Under-Secretary was forced to reply:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Section 118 of the Medicines Act precludes the disclosure of information which is provided about products in accordance with the provisions of the Act."-[Official Report, 30 October 1995; Vol. 265, c. 45.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision allows unacceptable secrecy and it would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that it is on his list of potential repeals.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have referred in the Committee to the previous occupation of the hon. Member for Ryedale and how that benefited the Committee. I am grateful that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is bringing his previous occupation as a pharmacist-
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Optician.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Optician. The hon. Gentleman"s experience in the medical field will assist us with our deliberations.
<P>
Clause 42(1) must be considered with clauses 72 and 74. The Government are committed to providing a wide-ranging freedom of information regime and considering the repeal of any such bars in other legislation which can no longer be justified. To do so will require a long, hard examination of every provision in other legislation which imposes a statutory bar on disclosing information. Clause 74 sets out the order-making power through which we propose to address the operation of statutory bars in previous legislation. That power in clause 42 is necessary because, until the order-making power is used in respect of any particular piece of legislation there is a bar on disclosure until such time as the House has decided that the bar should no longer operate.
<P>
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that section 118 of the Medicines Act 1968 is one of the bars that is being considered. I am sure that he will acknowledge that the decision to remove a bar is not for one Department alone, but requires considerable cross-Department consideration before a statutory instrument can be introduced to remove it. The significant step in the Bill is that a further Act of Parliament will not be required to create an open government culture. That will be done relatively speedily by order-making power under the Bill, which I hope the hon. Gentleman welcomes. I cannot give a definite date on which that consideration will be completed, but I am sure that his observations will be carefully studied by those in the Department of Health and the Home Office who are responsible for pushing the agenda forward.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 22, line 42, leave out from "to," to "as" in line 43 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prejudice the carrying out of such functions".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Lock:</B> The effect of amendment No. 164 would be to limit the power of the Secretary of State to create new prejudice-based exemptions where a specific function that would be prejudiced by disclosure of information is named in the order. Clause 43(1) allows such new exemptions to be created, as it does in relation to exemptions that are similarly based on prejudice but do not rely on a specific function of a public authority being prejudiced. The prejudice could be in relation to an aspect of the more general public interest, outside the functions of the authority. The distinction already exists within the prejudiced-based exemptions in the Bill. For example, clause 29, which deals with law enforcement, relates to functions, but clauses 36 and 37-which deal with health and safety and environmental information respectively-are not so limited.
<P>
It is important to retain the power to create new prejudice-based exemptions in its current form. Due to the number of public authorities covered by the Bill, a wide range of information will fall within its scope. Therefore, there may be some areas of information that have not yet been considered, but would legitimately need protection. The Government should also ensure that they are able to protect, in the future as well as now, all information that it would not be in the public interest to disclose.
<P>
In those circumstances, although I understand the point of the hon. Gentleman"s amendment, it would limit unacceptably the operation of clause 43. The Government would not have sufficient flexibility to respond to changes in circumstances. I therefore hope that he will not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> It is my express intention to limit the effect of clause 43, and to prevent the Government from extending it into new areas that they cannot currently tell us about. There is a risk of a new near-class-exemption being formed, and I suspect that the test incorporated in the clause is weaker than the prejudice test, which has been accepted elsewhere in the Bill. In light of the Parliamentary Secretary"s reply, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 23, line1, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 142, in page 23, line 6, leave out "or (2)".
<P>
No. 143 in page 23, line 13, leave out "or (2)".
<P>
No. 145, in page 23, line 20, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
No. 144, in page 23, in line 26, leave out "or (2)".
<P>
Members of the Committee will note that amendment No.145 had originally been intended for a separate debate. On reflection, I decided that it should be debated in this group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I think that that will help the Committee. It will certainly help me to outline our reasons for tabling these amendments.
<P>
We have serious misgivings about clause 43. We acknowledge that the power that it gives to the Secretary of State would be subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses. None the less, it would allow the Secretary of State to create an additional exemption in respect of information, the disclosure of which would 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"have such effects adverse to the public interest as may be specified in the order."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Note the use of the words "may be", rather than "would be". Apparently, the power does not even require the Secretary of State formally to give a reason. That is clearly the implication of the wording of the subsection, although I would not go so far as to say that it is its intention. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will clarify that.
<P>
Subsection (2) makes it clear that the power could apply to information that is already in existence. What kind of information does the Parliamentary Secretary have in mind? It is questionable whether the power is necessary at all, given the scope of the class-based and contents-based exemptions that already exist in the Bill. Much of the code is reflected in the Bill in terms of categories, which suggests that a great deal of thought has already been given by successive Ministers-in the previous Government, as well as the Secretary of State and his departmental staff-as to what kinds of information deserve specific exemptions under the Bill. We might worry, because of the risk of compromising our national security, or defence or economic interests, about certain areas being overlooked. However, such matters are already covered by exemptions in the Bill.
<P>
Against that background, how can the Parliamentary Secretary say, "Here is a regime that is going to free up information and create a new culture of open government, an end to secrecy and massive powers for people to obtain the kinds of information that they have always wanted", while including in the Bill a clause that says, "Oh, by the way, just in case there is something we ought to have thought of that we have forgotten about, we will give this power to the Home Secretary, both now and in the future, to bring an order before Parliament saying that we are going to extend the Bill"s exemptions to something else"?
<P>
I can understand that there may be an argument for the Secretary of State having this power. The Parliamentary Secretary may wish to make a point about more primary legislation being required to insert another exemption. Given the process that that involves, I can appreciate that it is something that Parliament may wish to avoid and, while I would not necessarily agree with the argument, I would understand why it was being advanced. However, we have to ask not only what further exemptions might be required, but why on earth Ministers go so far in respect of subsection (2), which says that an exemption that is introduced would apply to information that is already in existence.
<P>
It gets worse in subsection (5). I have been scrutinising Bills in Standing Committees for 12 and a half years, and this subsection is one of the most retrospective in its effect of any that I have seen. It says, in effect, that if someone applies for information under clause 1(1) of the Bill, and it transpires that the information is not covered by any of the exemptions that are already in the Bill, not only can the Secretary of State use his order-making powers to create an exemption specifically to exempt the information that the applicant has asked for, but the public authority can use that exemption to say that the exemption was effectively in existence on the day before the person made the application. Subsection (5) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a public authority is not to be taken to have failed to comply with any provision of Part I before the day on which the order comes into force by reason of any failure to comply with a request to which the order applies, to the extent to which the request relates to information which becomes exempt information by virtue of the order."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is objectionable.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is one thing for the Secretary of State to say, "We want to include in the Bill a power to create another exemption or to exempt specific information, in case it transpires that we should have put something in the Bill that we forgot about." I can be charitable and concede that, were I sitting in the Minister"s place, I might think that it would be worth asking Parliament to approve such a provision as a precaution. But it offends our sense of natural justice to ask Parliament to accept that a new exemption of that kind would apply to existing information and then that it applies to information that has been properly requested under the terms of the Bill and is not caught by any of the existing exemptions, wide as they are, and then that the new exemption would be retrospective, as it would affect what had been a fair and bona fide request for information in the first place.
<P>
I fully understand that we need a sense of balance and caution when we are dealing with national security, defence, our economic interests, our relations with foreign Governments or indeed with confidentially within Government, across Governments and with other member states and international institutions, but all those are covered anyway.
<P>
The Minister owes the Committee an explanation for including in the Bill this huge power, which offends natural justice in the way that I have described. There is the caveat that it is subject to affirmative resolution, but we all know how those things work. Not only does the subsection need a great deal of explanation, but the Committee must seriously consider in the next half-hour or so whether we should send the Bill back to the House for Report with the clause still in it as it stands, unless the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking that he will rethink or revisit the provision.
<P>
To conclude, I think that all members of the Committee are aware of the views that the Public Administration Committee and its sister Committee in the other place expressed in respect of these provisions, which were pretty damning. Even in its Second Report of 30 November 1999 the Select Committee said that it believed that this power in the clause was not justified and advised Parliament that it should not be included in this form in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> If the Bill applied only to central Government Departments that were acting in their usual manner, I concede that there might be some merit in the complaints of the hon. Member for Ryedale. However, the Bill will apply to a wide range of public bodies-they are listed in the schedule-that operate in different circumstances and carry out different functions. They need to find a balance between the need to carry out their functions and their duty to carry out those functions openly and in the way that the Bill prescribes.
<P>
The Bill was subject to extensive consultation and involved a White Paper and pre-legislative scrutiny. However, we cannot be certain that we have got it right with regard to all of the bodies that will have to comply with the Bill"s requirements. We do not have a crystal ball that allows us to see precisely how the Bill will operate.
<P>
In effect, the hon. Member for Ryedale wanted me to say when the power would be used and in relation to which categories. My answer to him is quite simple: if we knew what the categories were, or were likely to be, we would have included them in the Bill, the Committee could have debated their inclusion and we would not have had to rely on the clause"s power. However, the world, Governments and public bodies develop and change, and new public bodies will be created in circumstances that we cannot foresee. The operation of such public bodies may require new exemptions.
<P>
Amendment No. 141 would remove subsection (2) from the clause, and the amendments that are grouped with it would remove references to the subsection that appear elsewhere in the clause. Amendment No. 145 would remove the retrospective operation of clause 5, which involves a public body"s refusal to carry out duties relating to information and which the House may subsequently determine as part of an exemption.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale accepted that subsection (2) will enable Parliament to make an order to exempt the disclosure of particular information that is already in existence if the public interest in doing so outweighs the public interest in allowing access to the information.
<P>
Practically speaking, that means that Parliament, acting on a prompt from the Secretary of State, may create a new exemption for a specific piece of information, when he assesses that the public interest in withholding the information outweighs the public interest in disclosing it.
<P>
The Government consider that it is vital that we retain that power to create new specific exemptions. Due to the number of public authorities that are covered by the Bill, the nature of the information that will fall within its scope will be very wide ranging, and there may therefore be information that has not been considered at this stage but which would legitimately need protection. Alternatively, such information could come into existence if a public body were added to the Bill in situations that we cannot currently foresee. If a specific piece of information requires exempting, it is not sensible to require that a general exemption be created around it. When an exemption is required for particular information, the exemption that is drawn should be limited to that information. Furthermore, no order could be made unless the Secretary of State had concluded that the public interest in exempting the particular information outweighed the public interest in allowing access to it. Subsection (2) will therefore enable the Secretary of State to ask Parliament to create those specific limited exemptions.
<P>
However, that power is subject to certain "safeguards". Before such an order is made, the Secretary of State is required, by subsection (6) of the clause, to consult the Information Commissioner. The order would also be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure by virtue of clause 81(2). There is therefore no possibility that such an order could be made on the quiet. It would not be possible to use that power without proper consideration.
<P>
Amendment No. 145 would remove subsection (5) from clause 43. That subsection provides that the authority would not be taken to have failed to comply with the provisions of part 1 in relation to a request that it has received but not yet complied with, before an order creating an exemption comes in to force if that non-compliance relates to information that becomes exempt by virtue of the order.
<P>
If that subsection were removed, it would be possible for an applicant to appeal to the commissioner on the grounds that information requested had not been disclosed and should have been, despite the fact that an order had been made in the meantime to exempt the information with an order.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> How will a public authority whose application for information is perfectly in order avoid having to fulfil that request? In that regard, we should bear in mind the Bill"s proposed 28-day limit, pending the laying of an order that could have damaging retrospective effects. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I noticed that when the hon. Gentleman sat down, a round of applause came from somewhere in the Palace.
<P>
To answer the hon. Gentleman"s question, I should highlight the importance of using the power in defined circumstances and reasonably quickly. As I understand the situation-I shall write to him if my explanation is mistaken-the sequence of events is this: an application is made by an applicant to a public authority seeking disclosure of specific information; the public authority has 20 days to respond; if the response is made within 20 days and the authority says, "No, we are not prepared to release the information," the applicant can appeal to the Information Commissioner, who is required, under the Bill"s provisions, to make an order requiring the public authority to disclose; and if the public authority chooses not to comply, it will face the full rigour of the Bill"s enforcement procedures. If a public authority believes that it has an urgent problem on its hands, it can approach the Secretary of State in an attempt to secure the House"s rapid intervention to get an exemption. However, that is an unusual situation which would require Parliament and the Secretary of State to move with a speed that is possible-the speed with which Northern Ireland legislation can be handled confirms that that is possible-but which is used only in exceptional circumstances. I hope that my explanation shows that the power is an exceptional reserve power and that it will not be used in the ordinary course of events.
<P>
If the provisions in clause 43(5) were deleted, the authority would either comply with the request and disclose the information, which would prejudice the public interest in some way, or it would fail to comply with the commissioner"s notice, which would expose it to punishment for contempt of court. Either option would be an intolerable choice for an authority. A specific order exemption that information would come before Parliament for a determination by the House as to whether the Bill should grant a further exemption in respect of that information.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I have said, in a Bill with such a wide impact, it is possible that, despite the amount of consultation that has taken place, the exemptions do not take account of all information whose disclosure would not be in the public interest now or in the future. The exemptions may not be exhaustive; that may become apparent only after the Bill is enacted. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that it is our fervent wish to use the powers on as few occasions as possible, if at all. He will be aware that any exemption created by the clause may not be made before the Secretary of State has consulted the commissioner and then only after he has laid a draft order before each House of Parliament, which is subject to affirmative resolution procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Is the Parliamentary Secretary hinting that a public authority might decline to release information, endeavouring to claim one of the other exemptions, but that the commissioner would then have to rule whether that exemption was valid, and that may be the trigger that enables the commissioner to say that the exemption is not valid but perhaps should be valid? Is that the circumstance in which the provision may come to be used?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> That is one possible course of events. the provision could operate in that way. Equally, the public authority, on receipt of the initial request, might recognise that, although the information that it holds should not be released for an overriding public interest reason, it does not fit into any of the exemptions listed in the Bill. Therefore, the public authority would proceed directly to the Secretary of State to ask him to consider applying to Parliament to make an order under subsection (2).
<P>
The provision is an essential reserve power, but, without subsection (5), the amendment would make nonsense of the ability to create a new exemption, because by the time Parliament had decided whether it was the type of information that it was in the public interest not to disclose, the information would already have been disclosed, because the authority would have had to comply with its obligation under the Bill. Clearly we would not wish to put any public authority in that position. Therefore, the two subsections stand or fall together. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded that the provision is necessary in the limited circumstances that I have described and therefore will not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary is persuasive, but I am not sure that he has persuaded us enough. In the first instance, he suggested that our concerns about the matter might be justified in regard to Government Departments, but he has in mind other public authorities, of which there is a long list in parts VI and VII of schedule 1, as well as other public bodies that have yet to be added to the list and some that have yet to be spawned into the world of quangocracy to which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred on an earlier occasion.
<P>
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether the exemption should apply to Government Departments-the clause does not make the distinction that he made-or simply to the other public bodies.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary explained that there could be some information thought to be covered, which it transpired, was not covered, and the remedial action would therefore have to be taken. I take his point that it is difficult to think of an example, because if the Government had thought of it, they would have put it in the Bill. Nevertheless, the retrospective nature of the provision is a cause for concern. In the light of all the other possibilities for exempting the release of information that the Bill provides, it can be argued that it goes one step too far in its retrospection.
<P>
Given the weight of numbers that are available to us to register a protest, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. However, we wish to indicate our disapproval by seeking to divide the Committee on amendment No. 145.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I need not detain the Committee with this amendment, which would require the publication of representations made to the Secretary of State by the commissioner, because it is self-explanatory. The Parliamentary Secretary may say that they would be published as a matter of course because the Government would wish it, or because the Information Commissioner would in any case make her recommendations known to the general public. If so, there is no obstacle to accepting the amendment, which would fall entirely within the spirit of freedom of information by requiring that representations be published.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> It gives me enormous pleasure to say that, in principle, the Government accept the amendment. We agree that it would be a good idea to include a provision that will compel the Secretary of State to publish representations made to him by the Information Commissioner in respect of consultations on an order to confer additional exemptions under the clause. That would add to the openness of the Bill. The Government have consulted the Information Commissioner designate on this issue, and she is content that such an obligation be included in the Bill.
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome to withdraw the amendment. I undertake that a similar amendment will be tabled on Report, and I want time to consider the exact form of wording. Representations might need to be made about a matter that is extremely sensitive, and the prospect of their publication could constrain the Information Commissioner"s ability to make such representations to the Secretary of State. As a result, an order might be made that was wider than it would otherwise have been. We are talking about representations about information in which there is a public interest in respect of confidentiality. We must ensure that the representations do not make public that which they are intended to keep confidential.
<P>
Subject to that minor caveat, and further consideration of the precise wording, I accept, in principle, the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The Government will table an amendment on Report that will require the publication of representations, except in the narrow circumstances that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That will have been helpful to the Committee, but in light of the Parliamentary Secretary"s comments, I am glad that we divided the Committee and registered our deep anxiety about subsection (5). However, given what he has just said, I shall not seek to divide the Committee on clause stand part.
<P>
When the Parliamentary Secretary considers the wording that he wishes to add to subsection (6), will he also give further thought to the wording of subsection (1)(b)? Should Parliament be made aware of effects adverse to the public interest that the Home Secretary thinks of sufficient importance to require the creation of the specific exemption in the clause? I said earlier that subsection (4)(a) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may be specified in the order"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not says "shall be specified in the order". We have avoided tabling such amendments just to have a debate or an argument, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give it some thought before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House.

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I refrained in the debate on the amendment to subsection (2) from commenting on the hon. Gentleman"s observations on subsection (1), but I am happy to do so now in lieu of a stand part debate.
<P>
Subsection (2) is a distinct power from subsection (1), but the context of subsection (1)(b) should make it clear that the order requires the adverse effects to be specified. I agree that the words "may be specified" in the subsection should be construed as "are specified". I shall consider whether that is clear enough not to require an amendment or whether further clarification is needed to put the matter beyond peradventure.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary.

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I do not know whether there is any provision in Standing Orders for a procedural motion to cause bells to be rung out, but I am extremely pleased that I have finally secured an amendment to the Bill. The Government can never quite bring themselves to accept words produced by an Opposition Member to encompass their intention, but that is as may be. I am most grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his response and I look forward to the words that he chooses to introduce at a later stage to accomplish our common objective. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The amendments make two simple additions to the provisions that must be included in the code of practice and I think that they are self-explanatory. I invite the Parliament Secretary to comment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Amendment No. 165 would compel the Secretary of State to include in the code of practice guidance relating to the provision of information about an application for a decision by the commissioner under clause 50.
<P>
Subsection (2)(e) enables authorities to make arrangements for dealing with complaints from applicants. The draft code of practice currently in preparation complies with this requirement and provides for an authority to inform an applicant of his rights under clause 50.
<P>
The Government agreed to reconsider amending clause 15 to enable details of complaints procedure and rights of appeal to the commissioner to be set out in the Bill. I expect a Government amendment to that effect to be tabled on Report. I hope that my assurance that the matter will be addressed in that way will be sufficient to allow the hon. Gentleman to withdraw that amendment.
<P>
In relation to amendment No. 166, the code of practice will include provision for arrangements for authorities to monitor the number and nature of complaints received and to review and, if necessary, amend their policies. However, I am reluctant to include further provision regarding the publication of this information. The Bill applies not only to central Government but to a great many public authorities, many of which are small. Any resources that they put in to complying with administrative and bureaucratic requirements will be diverted from their primary function of serving the public.
<P>
The proposal contained in the amendment, although perhaps justifiable for some larger authorities, could prove unnecessarily burdensome for the smaller ones, which may receive few complaints. The information, if kept, will be available on demand by anyone with an interest making a freedom of information request. That is a better way of proceeding than requiring all authorities to follow the course set out in the amendment.
<P>
However, the public should be told which authorities have failed to comply with the provisions of the Bill. That would include instances in which the commissioner issues and enforcement notice under clause 52 or a failure to comply with notice under clause 53. I would expect the commissioner to publish statistics relating to these and to include comments on them in her reports, much as the Parliamentary commissioner for Administration does now. I hope that those mechanisms-rather than the structured form set out in the amendment-will satisfy the hon. Gentleman"s requirement for openness. On that basis, I hope that he will feel free to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> There are many occasions on which I cannot entirely follow the Government"s logic. On this occasion, however, the Parliamentary Secretary appears to make perfect sense. I accept his assurances, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 25, line 10, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A) The Commissioner shall make publicly available, in such form as he considers appropriate, adequate details of-
<P>
(a) any assessment of good practice carried out under section 46(3);
<P>
(b) any practice recommendation given under section 47(1);

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with the general functions of the commissioner. The simple list incorporated in amendment No.167 sets out some of the information that we expect the commissioner to make publicly available to give guidance both to members of the public and to public authorities in carrying out their duties or in assessing their rights under the Bill.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the commissioner intends to do those things anyway. We believe that it is always helpful to set out in statute the general duties that the commissioner-or any other body within the legislation-will be required to carry out. This is not an exhaustive list, but it would provide helpful guidance. On that basis, I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am not entirely unsympathetic regarding the amendment and I understand the points raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The amendment would require the commissioner to public details of the occasion when, in accordance with his or her powers under the Bill. He or she has carried out the specified assessments or investigations, or made any orders resulting from them. The amendment requires such information to be adequate and stipulates that the commissioner should name the authorities concerned, but not the individual complainant. It provides that the commissioner is not required to publish any information if disclosure would be against the public interest.
<P>
I resist the amendment, not because it is not well intentioned or does not accord with the spirit of openness, but because, as the hon. Gentleman anticipated, it is unnecessary. Clause 49 already requires the commissioner to lay annually before Parliament a general report on the carrying out of his functions under the Bill. Clause 49 also enables the commissioner to lay other reports before Parliament in connection with his functions from time to time as he sees fit. The sort of information that the amendment would bring into the public domain will already be available in accordance with the powers that the Bill gives to the Information Commissioner. The purpose of the commissioner making such judgements is that they should be public.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar approached the same issue in relation to the Data Protection Act 1998 by making it clear that her policy is to publish in her annual report information about any formal activity that she is undertaking. I refer the hon. Gentleman to page 60, appendix 2 of the 15th annual report. The matter is for the professional judgment of the Information Commissioner, when appointed, and I have no reason to believe that a different approach will be used in respect of freedom of information from that which the Data Protection Registrar currently adopts.
<P>
Subsection (2A)(a) in the amendment raises a further point. It would require the commissioner to make public details of any assessment that he has made of good practice. However, such assessments are carried out with the consent of the authority and it would be self-defeating to require the commissioner to make information on such assessments public as a matter of course, because to do so might dissuade authorities from consenting to the commissioner carrying out such assessments. The purpose of clause (46)(3) is to encourage authorities to seek the assistance of the commissioner and that could be defeated by the amendment. However, it will be open to the commissioner to use information gained from such assessments in preparing and disseminating good practice advice in accordance with his obligations under clause 46(2).
<P>
More generally, there is a risk that the amendment would increase the burden on the commissioner"s resources by requiring him to report on each and every occasion on which he takes action, when a more flexible approach-for example, by publishing a representative example of the sort of judgment made-might serve the public interest and the purpose more effectively.
<P>
Finally, I draw the Committee"s attention the fact that the amendment is technically flawed. It would require that such information be adequate, but adequate for what purpose, and who would judge the adequacy of such information? The amendment would not require the information to be laid before Parliament, so it would not be scrutinised or evaluated in any way. That is a technical defect.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the amendment and I agree that there should be publication, but in the light of the practice followed by the Data Protection Registrar, the open way in which information is conducted and disseminated and the helpfulness of the parliamentary report, the amendment would not be helpful. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are concerned that if the amendment were accepted, the commissioner might be overloaded. To that extent, we could not support the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. Like the Parliamentary Secretary, however, we think that the amendment is well intentioned. In relation to the laying of the report before Parliament, we took comfort from our scrutiny of clause 49. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the wording of the clause already makes clear the role of the commissioner in disseminating information about the operation of the Bill, good practice and other matters. Clause 46(3) states that the commissioner may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with the consent of any public authority, assess whether that authority is following good practice."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the rationale for that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary has built up such a store of goodwill among Opposition Members-having accepted the spirit of my previous amendment-that I can almost never refuse him when he asks me to withdraw an amendment, especially when he does it so politely.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary touched on the subsequent amendment to clause 46(3). The public authority"s consent does not form part of that, so the two amendments are consistent, although they are not grouped together. If the permissive right is not in place, there is no problem with publishing the assessment of good practice, as it would not have been done with the consent of the authority. It would have been done under the authority of the commissioner. We shall discuss that under the next amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 25, line 11, leave out from "may" to "authority" in line 12 and insert "assess whether any public".
<P>
The amendment makes exactly the point that the hon. Member for Ryedale sought to address in the debate on the previous amendment. Why does clause 46(3) allow the commissioner to assess whether an authority is following good practice, but only with the consent of that public authority? There are many occasions when it is good practice to have the consent of an authority into which an inquiry is being made. On other occasions, it is appropriate to make such an inquiry whether or not consent has been given, because there is reason for concern. If we limit the commissioner"s scope in such way, the commissioner will be less able to deal with the affairs of a recalcitrant authority, which has been the subject of complaints that may or may not have been substantiated. Clearly, the Parliamentary Secretary has reason for proposing the clause in this form-he wants to encourage authorities to seek an assessment of good practice. I have no quarrel with that intention, which is by far the better way of addressing the issue. From time to time, however, the commissioner might wish to make an assessment that is not based on the consent of an authority. If the Minister can point out how that is achieved elsewhere in the Bill, other than in response to a specific complaint, I shall be content. If he cannot, I shall seek to probe further on how the commissioner will do the job that we want done. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome for straying into his amendment, but we are in agreement with him.
<P>
It is strange that the purposes of clauses 46 and 47 include the giving of general powers to the commissioner to ensure that there is good practice and that it is monitored. I cannot understand the logic of assessing only the good practice of an authority which is content for the assessment to be carried out. That is rather like a good school sending for the inspector, if that is not too facile a view. Under clause 47, the commissioner, having made his assessment with the authority"s consent, will give his practice recommendation in writing. However, if the recommendation is not honoured, the process is left hanging in mid-air. Under the Bill, all the commissioner could do is ask the public authority for permission to check whether his recommendations, which had so far been ignored, were being complied with. That appears to be something of a conundrum.
<P>
I can see from the Parliamentary Secretary"s reaction that he understands our mystification, and I shall therefore give him the opportunity to explain the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Perhaps I may shed a little light on this confused situation.
<P>
Clause 46 places a duty on the Information Commissioner to promote good practice by public authorities and promote observance of the requirements of the Bill and the Secretary of State"s and the Lord Chancellor"s code of practice. Subsection (3) gives the commissioner the power to assess whether a public authority is following good practice-but only where the authority has consented, as the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Ryedale pointed out. The amendment would allow the commissioner to carry out an assessment without the authority"s consent.
<P>
To answer the hon. Gentlemen"s questions as to why consent is required, under the structure of enforcement in the Bill, the carrying out of an assessment without the consent of the authority is neither necessary or appropriate. I shall try to explain why.
<P>
The commissioner already has wide powers to promote openness in respect of information that is held by public authorities. That role could include advice on how to handle a request for information or the management of recorded information. As an example, I draw the Committee"s attention to clause 17, which requires the commissioner specifically to approve a publication scheme for a public authority. Clearly, the commissioner has a duty to consider and, if necessary, refuse consent to the authority"s proposed publication scheme.
<P>
In addition, the commissioner has the power to enforce the right of access to information under the Bill where she has received a complaint or, if she has not received a complaint, where it appears to her that the authority is not complying with any of the requirements of part 1. Those powers are significant, as the hon. Member for Ryedale has noted. Under clause 47(1), the commissioner has the power to impose a practice recommendation. That procedure, like the procedure of the enforcement notice, is initiated by the commissioner on the basis of the information that she has about the authority in question. It is not responsive-it does not require a complaint-but proactive and positive.
<P>
I draw the Committee"s attention to the consequences of failing to comply with an enforcement notice, which are set out in clauses 52 and 53. Those clauses make it clear that the commissioner has teeth. If it does not appear to the commissioner, on the basis of information that is available, that the public body is carry out its obligations under the Bill-
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am now even more confused. My understanding was that the enforcement notice in clause 52 relates to a failure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to comply with any of the requirements of Part I".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have now reached part III, and it is not clear whether the enforcement notice will apply to clause 47.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I shall deal with that matter fully when we reach the provisions relating to enforcement notices, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that they will apply. 
<P>
Under Clause 53, an authority will be in contempt if it does not comply with an enforcement notice. Clause 46(3) requires "consent" because the Information Commissioner and the public body will have a different interaction. That mechanism is designed not to create a commissioner with hob-nailed boots who can serve notices and require certain actions but to encourage public authorities to seek assistance from the commissioner to ensure-

<P>
On resuming-
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> If I understood the Parliamentary   Secretary correctly-and setting aside individual complaints-a commissioner can intervene on a bad authority using clause 47(1), but, because clause 47(1) is predicated on there being a non-conformity with good practice, he needs clause 46(3) to allow him also to give friendly advice to authorities that may in other ways conform to good practice in terms of how they can improve their performance. Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that that is the reason for clause 46(3)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Up to a point. Clause 47 gives the commissioner power to serve a practice recommendation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it appears to the Commissioner that the practice of a public authority in relation to the exercise of its functions under this Act does not conform with that proposed in the codes of practice under sections 44 and 45".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not quite the same as saying that the commissioner has a detailed working knowledge of the public authority and knows for certain that the practices that it follows are deficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I probably expressed myself badly. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary is now coming to the same view. Where there is reasonable suspicion, the commissioner can invoke clause 47(1); where the commissioner has no reasonable suspicion that an authority is not in conformity but the authority would like to have a good health check, he can only do so under clause 46(3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> That is certainly correct. Clause 46(3) is a co-operative, mutual assistance provision, so it requires the authority"s consent. The authority is saying to the Information Commissioner "Please come and do an assessment. We have these duties. We should be grateful if you would come and help us check that our procedures accord with the obligations under the Bill." Clause 47 is where the commissioner concludes that the authority may be acting in breach of practice.
<P>
Perhaps I may clarify one matter and, if I gave the wrong impression, correct it. If the commissioner then takes the view that the public authority is continuing to fail to comply with its duties, an information notice should be served under clause 51, not clause 50. As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, clause 50 relates to specific instances under part I, which predicates other complaints; clause 51 is for general failure. That would then, if there was continuing default, trigger the enforcement procedures under clause 53, which then brings the authority before the court for contempt. That is clearly a serious event, which we hope will arise on few occasions.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is the enforcement mechanism and those are the procedures that the Information Commissioner carries out as policeman. But as guiding friend and co-operator, the commissioner is called in with the consent under clause 46(3), and that is why cluase 46(3) requires consent. We would not think it appropriate for the commissioner to go in and carry out a full assessment of an authority in the teeth of sustained opposition from that authority. The right way there is to serve the notice under clause 47 and then proceed under clause 52.
<P>
I hope that that explains why clause 46(3) contains a consent provision and will enable the hon. Gentleman to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his response and I pray your indulgence, Dr. Clark. I shall not now seek to catch your eye on clause 47.
<P>
However, there is a point worth making here. Clearly the clauses interact, and when we eventually come to clause 48, which may not be today, the marshalling of some of the clauses may require review. With that, I am now satisfied that there is an enforcement in relation to clause 47, which follows on from clause 46(3), which in turn follows on from clauses 44 and 45. I can see that it is in clause 51, but it certainly is not in clause 50 or clause 52.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for Ryedale would confirm that police officers are always guiding friends and co-operators, with whomever they deal. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary. He has done the Committee a service by clarifying the way in which the clauses fit together. He has allayed my fears that a category of authority could slip through the provisions of the Bill, were the amendment not accepted. I now understand how he sees the architecture of the Bill fitting together to ensure that that does not occur. I think that what he has told me indicates that the amendment would reduce the commissioner"s scope when dealing with the friendly co-operation of which we have heard. That being the case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
