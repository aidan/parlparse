					<a name="07030876000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule relates to the
powers devolved to the National Assembly for Wales and on pages 165 and
166 of the Bill is a list of additional powers and changes to powers.
The amendment would add an additional power transferred to the National
Assembly for Wales that relates to the delegation of methods of
election and electoral arrangements for local government in Wales. At
the moment, the Assembly and the Administration in Wales are competent
to propose changes, but they have to be signed off here at the
Westminster Parliament. Bearing in mind the huge surge of democracy
that took place in this building last night, I hope that the Government
see fit, particularly remembering the devolutionary words of the
Ministers in this Committee, to agree that the amendment should be
added to the list of powers, thus giving the Administration and the
Assembly in Wales the competence to make the same changes that have
been made in Scotland and which would be very much of a piece with the
devolutionary atmosphere in the
Bill.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):
						</b> It is good to see you back
in the Chair, Mr. Benton, this fine morning. I am grateful
to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment. It is interesting how
the word &#147;devolution&#148; is sometimes bandied around in
Committee and the different interpretations that are given to
it.</div>
					<a name="07030876000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would enable the Assembly Government to bring forward proposals for the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div>National Assembly to legislate on methods of election and electoral
arrangements for local government in Wales. The UK Government are
committed to using UK Bills to confer new powers on the National
Assembly if it is appropriate to do so. The Assembly Government have
asked that we take the opportunity of this Bill to bring forward
proposals in respect of local government in Wales, but they have not
sought the power that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has asked us to
give. Devolution is a matter that the Assembly Government should raise
first. It would not be right for the Committee to propose something
that has not been requested by the Assembly Government. On that basis,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000191"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> The amendment relates to who should be authorised
to delegate power to ward councillors. Should it be a senior executive
member as the Bill states at present or should it be the result of a
decision made by the whole council as set out in the amendment? Given
the power as it is, senior executive members might be a lot more
reluctant to devolve power than the council collectively and, in fact,
the Government&#146;s wishes might be frustrated. There would be more
flexibility and more devolution if the matter were for discussion and
decision by the whole
council.</div>
					<a name="07030876000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that all members of the Committee understand the realities of power and
local government. In 80 or 90 per cent. of all decisions, it is likely
that the council will follow the wishes and direction of the executive
members. However, it seems proper for the council as a whole to have
the opportunity to override an executive who are excessively centralist
or unwilling to release power or to devolve decision making. The
Minister has just said that devolution can be used in many ways.
Obviously that is true, but the amendment is about ensuring that there
is internal devolution or broader democratic oversight of the
devolution inside councils. I hope that the Under-Secretary will feel
minded to accept our amendment.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div>

							<a name="07030876000192"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I hate to disappoint the hon. Gentleman twice in
one day, but I may have to do so. I hope that when I explain the
reasons why, he will be happy to withdraw his amendment.</div>
					<a name="07030876000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In speaking to the amendment,
it may aid the Committee if I also say something about what the clause
does. At this point, I would like to talk about what we are considering
and explain what is intended by the empowerment of councillors for
which the Bill provides.</div>
					<a name="07030876000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 166 is part of a
strategy we have discussed many times during the course of the Bill. It
enables councillors to be more visible to the electorate and to act
more visibly. As we have discussed before, it is about being champions
of the local community&#151;front-line councillors who take the
opportunity to effect positive change in their areas. The clause as it
stands allows local authorities to empower individual members to
discharge functions on behalf of the authority, but only to the extent
that they relate to their own ward or division. It will be the job of
the authority, discharged either by a senior executive member or, where
appropriate, the full council, to determine the scope of the
delegations. The arrangement to which the clause refers covers the
methods to be used by councillors in exercising the empowerment that
they are given by the authorities, as well as the scope. The clause
provides for the Secretary of State to exclude specified categories of
function by order and to limit the manner or the circumstances in which
local authority arrangements can apply. Hon. Members will accept that
there are many local authority functions that would be quite
inappropriate to delegate to individual councillors.</div>
					<a name="07030876000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking about relatively
straightforward issues. The proposal for the Secretary of State to
limit by order is a significant constraint on the innovation. We need
to work very closely with the Local Government Association and others
to define it. We need to consult widely on laying an order before
Parliament before coming to a final decision. Hon. Members will be
aware that the clause dovetails with clause 92. It enables councillors
to discuss matters themselves in the community concerned. It would be
inappropriate and a waste of council resources always to refer such
matters to overview and scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07030876000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reading through
yesterday&#146;s edition of my local paper, I found an example which,
I think the Committee would agree, would be a matter for a councillor
with those powers. An 81-year-old lady living in Noak Bridge in
Basildon had an intruder in her sheltered accommodation home. She asked
the council to fit locks on the windows. The council&#146;s response
was, &#147;We have not got the money for the locks, it is not in the
budget. However, if you buy them yourself we will fit them.&#148;
That is an example of a situation in which a local councillor, using a
small delegated budget, could buy the locks and arrange for them to be
fitted without going through overview and scrutiny. The power is
therefore limited. We expect that most authorities will want to make
such arrangements themselves. Although it is a relatively minor power,
it has major significance to the constituent who is on the receiving
end of that support from the local councillor&#151;or lack of support
from their council. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>power is a backstop&#151;an extra provision to help local residents in
a situation in which local council services have not worked
well.</div>
					<a name="07030876000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another example
is fly-tipping. A local resident has made repeated calls to a council
to clean up an area that has been repeatedly fly-tipped. A local
councillor, however, might be able to move things along more quickly,
or start again through the official channels if they were not able to
get action from the council. The first step would be for the council to
speak to the service provider. When that does not work, there has to an
additional recourse in which a councillor&#151;many hon. Members on
the Committee have been councillors themselves&#151;can cut through
the bureaucracy and get something done much more quickly. However, it
is not for the Government to tell local authorities what those
arrangements should be. In the two examples I gave, a small budget
might be made available to councillors for a function, or a councillor
might be given the opportunity, in limited circumstances, to place
priority orders for the work of council contractors. Again, that will
be for individual authorities to decide.</div>
					<a name="07030876000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth saying that it is
not the Government&#146;s intention to try to force front-line
councillors into an executive role that they do not
want.</div>
					
					<a name="07030876000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000193"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> Perhaps the key comes in the
Under-Secretary&#146;s last phrase. I do not disagree with what she
said about the desirability of local councillors having the opportunity
to intervene in the direct way she describes, but the amendments are
not about that; they are about the inhibitions that can be placed on
such interventions, and whether a councillor&#146;s budget and the
decision to devolve will be at the behest of an executive member or of
the whole council. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will address that
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07030876000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000194"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> Patience is a virtue&#151;I was coming to that
in my very next sentence, but I thought it was worth setting out
exactly what the clause seeks to do. With his experience of local
government, the hon. Gentleman will recognise that in 2000, the
separation of executive and front-line councillors was defined by
legislation. The legislation provided that most council decisions were
taken by a small number of highly visible, high-profile
councillors&#151;the executive or cabinet, as those groups were
called in some areas. That made it easier for the public to identify
clearly the councillors responsible for decision making. Council
executives make the majority of day-to-day decisions&#151;any
function of the authority is the responsibility of the executive unless
specified otherwise by regulations. Certain council functions are not
under the direct authority of the executive, as specified by
regulations. For example, decisions on development control and
licensing are both functions for which a full council committee is
responsible, and a full council makes budget decisions.</div>
					<a name="07030876000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause 40, when a
function is an executive function, the executive can confer or delegate
it to an individual councillor. When a function is a function of a
committee or a full council, it will be for those bodies to delegate.
It does not seem right for a body that does not have a responsibility
for a function to delegate it to someone else. Clause 166 will allow
the executive or the authority, depending on which of those has the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 579</div>responsibility for the function concerned, to empower an individual
councillor. Although devolved powers are important, we would not want
powers such as the budget, which is a function of an entire council, to
be placed with an individual councillor. I hope that that explanation
satisfies the hon. Gentleman&#151;I can see him pondering it
now&#151;and that he will withdraw the
amendments.</div>

point she made, but I cannot say that I am satisfied. Nevertheless, I
beg to ask leave the withdraw the amendment.</div>

							<a name="07030876000197"></a>The

Woolas):
						</b> Good morning, Mr. Benton. I will
endeavour to explain the reason briefly, although I think that the hon.
Gentleman recognises that it is sometimes difficult to be brief about
local government finance and, in particular, capital
financing.</div>
					<a name="07030876000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you will

putting it on the record, following the agreement with the Local
Government
Association.</div>
					<a name="07030876000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Poole is that the
clause, as he will see, contains three separate provisions, all
relating to part 1 of the 2003 Act. Hon. Members will recall that that
legislation was used to bring in the prudential capital finance system,
which allows local authorities to borrow to pay for capital projects
without Government consent, so long as they can afford to service the
debt from their own resources. That system has been widely recognised
in local government as a success. My hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Devonport will remember it well. It has been one of the major
changes in local government
finance.</div>
					<a name="07030876000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 168(1)
is needed because the new capital finance legislation replaced earlier
statutory provisions. The latter are referred to in subsequent pieces
of legislation that remain in force, but all those references were
rendered obsolete by the 2003 Act, which is a common result of new
laws. As is usual, the 2003 Act contained a power enabling the
cross-references to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>updated by secondary legislation, and in 2003 such an order was made,
containing all the consequential amendments that were then thought
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07030876000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The need
for further such changes has recently been identified and it is
possible to deliver them through this Bill, which is why I have
included clause 168(1). As the hon. Member for Poole will know, it
amends section 74 of the Housing Act 1988, which provides for the
transfer of local authority housing to housing action trusts. In
dealing with payments between the parties, it relies on terms used in
the former local government capital finance legislation. Those
provisions now need to be expressed in the terminology of the 2003
Act.</div>
					<a name="07030876000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means that
this is a tidying-up clause, because we did not spot the need for the
changes last time. In fact, that is slightly unfair to my team. This is
a consequence of terminology. We are bringing up to date matters that
have been referred to before. I hope that the explanation is
satisfactory and if I were to say that my speaking note goes on for
another seven pages, perhaps the hon. Gentleman would consider
that.</div>

Mr. Benton, for allowing me to table these amendments. In
all honesty, if I had had time, I would have included them in the

things, I wanted to wait but I am glad that I have been able to
introduce the amendments in
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07030876000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Waste is
one of the top pressures on council tax. The increase in waste, as a
result of a more prosperous and changing society, is one of the main
inflationary pressures on local government, as identified by the joint
work that we have done with the Local Government Association. I have
been pressed on this point by the Association of District Treasurers
for many months and, indeed, years.</div>
					<a name="07030876000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">These new clauses allow
districts and counties to enter into joint arrangements for the
collection and disposal of waste. London boroughs already do this
between them, by joining up&#151;of course, London boroughs have the
waste and recycling responsibility&#151;into four London waste
authorities. Metropolitan authorities have the opportunity, and the
largest waste authority in the country is the Greater Manchester waste
authority, which involves 10 local authorities working together to
achieve efficiencies in procurement and
savings.</div>

							<a name="07030876000205"></a>Michael
Fabricant:
						</b> Two or three years ago, Lichfield district
council was top. I am not talking about the parish being the largest
parish in the country&#151;I was slapped down and told it was
Weston-super-Mare&#151;but I do know that Lichfield district was the
best recycler in the country. It has been held back, to some degree, by
liaison with Staffordshire county council. This measure will help us go
from second place, which is where I think we are, back up to first
place.</div>

district council yesterday afternoon.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Indeed, he is a Conservative who
chairs the West Midlands Local Government Association very ably. I can
confirm that what the hon. Member for Lichfield says is true. I can
also confirm from my conversations with the leader that the mace is
safe; the hon. Gentleman need not worry, but he makes a good
point.</div>
					<a name="07030876000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lichfield has
done very well but, broadly speaking, the authority areas that recycle
the most are the better-off areas. That is true irrespective of the
political persuasion of the council. The districts have been asking to
be able to work with counties for some time. We had a group report from
the high-performing local authorities, of which I believe Lichfield was
a member. These are the three-star and improving and four-star councils
that group together to advise the Government on how to make
improvements in these matters. Their report, in support of this
proposal, identified efficiency gains of approximately &#163;150
million that would result simply from knocking down this legislative
barrier to being able to set up joint working authorities.</div>
					<a name="07030876000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
separation of decision-making powers and funding streams into two-tier
areas inhibits the efficiency of the waste management function.
Additionally, not all local authorities have the optimum size to
deliver the efficiencies. It has long been the case that the argument
for unitary authorities has rested on the example of districts
collecting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div>rubbish and counties disposing of it. As part of our permissive regime,
we are trying to encourage joint working as well as considering unitary
proposals.</div>

						</b> I expect that it will, and I expect that if I
answered to the contrary, I would get a steaming letter from my hon.
Friend. He is right. We are trying to facilitate better working
together across boundaries and between tiers of government. The
financial pressures on waste and recycling identified by the councils
result from the huge need for capital investment in recycling and other
measures identified by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs strategy document. Not all of that, incidentally, should or
will fall on local authorities. However, it is the local
authorities&#146; responsibility. There are significant financial
reasons why the proposal is
beneficial.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): As in so many other matters
during this part of the debate, I rise to highlight the merits of
Shropshire as a pathfinder in many areas of local government. We are a
four-star county council, and we have established with the district
councils a Shropshire waste partnership, which began its deliberations
some six years ago. Had the legislation existed at the time to
facilitate what is proposed in the clauses, it would not have taken the
districts and county six years to achieve joined-up waste collection
and disposal, which is due to come into force at the end of this
year.</div>
					<a name="07030876000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support the
Government&#146;s objective but, contrary to the Minister&#146;s
point a moment ago that the measure is necessary to demonstrate the
importance of unitary as an appropriate model, we in Shropshire have
secured agreement between the two

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000211"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> My argument is not an argument for unitary. My
point was that the desirability of bringing together collection and
disposal has been used as an argument for unitary. It is the most
common argument. Because the Government have a genuinely permissive
approach, it makes sense if we are not imposing unitary
authorities&#151;and the hon. Gentleman knows that we are
not&#151;to facilitate better joint working between districts and
counties, particularly where they have asked for it. The head of steam
behind the measure is very strong indeed. Ken Thornber, leader of
Hampshire county council, made strong representations with his
districts on that point, as have other county local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07030876000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause 27
will introduce a requirement on local waste authorities to consult
relevant electors and other interested persons in their area on a draft

said something like &#147;Blair to chop elected authorities of
rubbish responsibility&#148;, implying that we were establishing a
quango that would not be accountable. Of course, the waste authorities,
like existing waste authorities, will be led by elected members, albeit
elected members from different areas. Perhaps the journalist had had a
heavy lunch and was looking for some knocking copy. I assure Committee

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): As the Minister
knows, the London borough of Bromley has a good record on recycling and
is top of the league in London, particularly if garden waste is
excluded. Perhaps the Minister could introduce a clause to enable West
Ham United to get up the league table. That is a tall order, but I was
hoping that he would work on
it.</div>
					<a name="07030876000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">My specific point
relates to an issue that I mentioned during the evidence hearings. Will
there be anything to prevent local authorities in different counties
from forming a joint waste authority? One can think of circumstances,
albeit unusual ones, in some of the big conurbations where it may make
economic and environmental sense for people to combine across county
boundaries. That is not how we tend to think in local government terms,
but it may be sensible. I should like reassurance that, if there is
agreement among all the authorities, there would be nothing to inhibit
them from doing
so.</div>
					
					<a name="07030876000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000213"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Government have issued guidance to Alan
Curbishley, the manager of West Ham, advising him to use a mobile phone
when driving, because I have been told that that is the only way he
will get three points. I apologise, Mr. Benton, because I
should have declared an interest as a Manchester United season ticket
holder. We tried to assist West Ham&#146;s negotiations with the
Olympic delivery body to ensure that the club was able to move into a
new stadium. My rationale was that it would then compete more with
Chelsea and Arsenal, which would benefit Manchester
United.</div>
					<a name="07030876000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is a big and desirable yes.
Authorities are already coming together through contracting
arrangements. For example, the Park Royal industrial estate in
north-west London&#151;the largest in western Europe&#151;spans the
boundaries of three London boroughs and has contracting arrangements
for shared waste disposal and recycling. I mentioned previously other
examples of districts, particularly in rural county areas, coming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div>together to co-operate on revenue and benefits. On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about the waste authority, there is a case for
what he suggests&#151;either on the edge of a conurbation with a
rural area or between districts spanning county
boundaries.</div>
					<a name="07030876000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authorities
that do not share a geographical boundary are increasingly coming
together, where it makes sense for them to work together, in respect of
expertise, geography, or for other reasons. For example, Tameside
metropolitan borough council, a four-star council, and Camden council
in London co-operate on processing housing benefit claims for Camden
residents. Unison&#146;s claim for London weighting for employers in
Tameside was one of the most innovative that I have seen. The hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is right. Such joint working,
leading to efficiencies, breaks down barriers, stops local authority
boundaries being the be-all and end-all, and allows change through a
commissioning regime that will allow savings to be made. It is
ridiculous that there are different arrangements for the procurement of
vehicles, and so on, when the taxpayer can benefit from better working
together.</div>

clause. Indeed, we have been pressing for some time for the
introduction of such a measure. We appreciate that it is permissive and
that it allows authorities the opportunity and option to work together,
which is exactly the right thing to
do.</div>
					<a name="07030876000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the Local
Government Association for its briefing. We appreciate its work in
informing the Committee and keeping us up to speed through its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div>briefings. I wish to raise a couple of points that it made and get the
Minister&#146;s comments on them. The LGA states that it
is</div>
					<a name="07030876000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not convinced that it
is necessary for the bill to provide the Secretary of State with powers
to dissolve Joint Waste
Authorities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030876000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It said
that it would seek a brief explanation</div>
					<a name="07030876000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of the circumstances in which the
Secretary of State might take such
action&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030876000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">and use such
powers. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07030876000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
LGA is keen that the final drafting of the bill puts local authorities
firmly in the driving seat when a proposal for a Joint Waste Authority
is formulated. Central government must not be prescriptive in making
modifications and we would like assurance that any duty to consult is
proportionate.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030876000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
be grateful if the Minister would briefly tackle those two points, if
he
can.</div>
					<a name="07030876000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						While
the Minister is finding the information, I would add that he was right
to say that waste is a significant and growing factor for local
authorities and their budgets to deal with. Many councils make the
point that increased duties are placed on them by the Government, but
that it is sometimes difficult for them to find resources to meet
ever-more onerous requirements. There plainly is complete
complementarity of interest between the Government and local
authorities in doing their best on this score. I would like to
congratulate Bedfordshire county council, which has made significant
efforts to improve its recycling position. Its committee, under the
leadership of Councillor Tom Wootton, has done very
well.</div>
					
					<a name="07030876000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07030876000218"></a>
							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): The hon. Gentleman
refers to councils&#146; recycling. Would he join me in
congratulating the Conservatives on Sutton council on deposing their
deputy leader because he did not find time to recycle at all? Is that
something that the hon. Gentleman would recommend other local
authorities
do?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000219"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is tempting me not to a champagne
moment but to a suicidal moment in welcoming the deposing of any
Conservative council on any council. On this occasion, my briefing is
not sufficiently extensive for me to give him an adequate response. He
has put the matter on the record in his own way, and we should be
content to leave it at
that.</div>
					<a name="07030876000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to
reiterate, Conservative Members are pleased with the new clauses, and
we hope that, where it is appropriate and where it would be effective,
joint waste authorities come into
being.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000220"></a>Andrew
Stunell:
						</b> We, too, welcome the provisions and the way in
which they have been introduced. In responding to the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire, however, could the Minister tell us whether
the Secretary of State&#146;s residual powers, which the LGA has
queried, are a response to the situation in Greater Manchester? For a
number of years, it was a matter of great frustration that the waste
authority&#146;s constituent councils were required to reach a
unanimous decision to change the charging regime. It was widely
recognised that the regime operated contrary to public policy in that
it charged those who
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>recycled most, rather than those who recycled least. That has now been
put right, but there was a logjam in the decision-taking process, and I
should be very satisfied if the Minister could reassure me that the
power that he holds, to which the LGA objects, would prevent such a
logjam in future.</div>
					
					<a name="07030876000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030876000221"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> On that last point, I shall need to write to the
hon. Gentleman. I agree with what he says. As he knows, my council is
the secretariat for the Greater Manchester waste authority,
and&#151;it is surprising what one learns as a local MP&#151;the
procurement contract into which it is entering is the largest public
sector contract in Europe. It relates to rubbish, bins, collection and
recycling and is hugely important to the public and the taxpayer. If I
may, therefore, I shall give him the details that he needs in a letter
because I do not know the answer to his question.</div>
					<a name="07030876000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think, however, that I can go
some way towards addressing hon. Members&#146; other questions. On
modification, a proposal made to the Secretary of State that might
require minor alteration would be fettered because the Secretary of
State could not create a joint waste authority for an area that was
different from the area specified in the proposal or establish a joint
waste authority to discharge functions that were not specified in the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="07030876000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
abolition, new waste authorities might be created through the
amalgamation of waste authorities that had come forward under the new
proposal. If three districts came together across county boundaries, as
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst suggested, and the new
authority was a success and wanted to expand, it would need to make a
new proposal, and the old one would need to be abolished. In
exceptional circumstances, an authority might simply have imploded and
might not be working, and its poor performance would mean that it would
have to be got rid off and that new arrangements would have to be put
in place. The provisions are intended as a backstop should an authority
seriously fail. Those are the circumstances that are envisaged under
the new arrangements, and I hope that that answers the point in the LGA
briefing.</div>

&#147;Mr. Burt, why, in the ember days of his premiership,
does the Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, not go to the
European Commission and say, &#145;How about you moving your European
parliamentary elections to the date on which we traditionally vote in
Biggleswade&#151;the first Thursday in May?&#146;?&#148; I have
to say that there is some force in that argument.</div>
					<a name="07030876000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As well as
the Minister enlightening us as to whether it is to be standard
practice that, every five years, we should accept the date of the local
elections being moved to coincide with European parliamentary
elections, will she also say whether the Government have made
representations to the European Commission and the European Parliament
on changing the date of their elections in order to coincide with our
local and district elections in the county of
Bedfordshire?</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemen for their
wise and interesting comments. It is always helpful to know what the
voters of Biggleswade think about any particular issue, so I am
grateful for that.</div>
					<a name="07030876000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 19 and amendment No.
243 will amend the Representation of the People Act 1983 to provide the
Secretary of State in England and Welsh Ministers in Wales with the
power to change the day of local and Greater London authority elections
by order, so that they can take place on the same day as European
Parliament elections. Prior to the last European Parliament elections,
in 2004, we took the power, in the Local Government Act 2003, to
combine them with other 2004 elections. However, that power applied
only to the 2004 elections, and this is a recurring issue, particularly
in England where there are local government elections in most
years.</div>
					<a name="07030876000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
elections to European Parliament are due to take place in June 2009. In
that year, local elections for all English county councils are due to
be held on 7 May. We seek to give the Secretary of State the
power 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div>to combine such elections without the need for primary legislation by
making an order to combine elections that fall due at around the same
time.</div>
					<a name="07030876000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Government said in 2003, we have taken a number of measures since 1997
to improve participation in the democratic process. Our proposal then
to combine the 2004 local, GLA and European Parliament elections was in
line with other measures that focused on voter convenience and
assisting the voter. We wanted to ensure that voting was convenient and
not a hassle or difficulty, and we wanted to remove as many barriers as
possible. That is why we thought it right to hold the 2004 elections on
the same day, so that people did not have to vote twice in six
weeks.</div>
					<a name="07030876000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a change
might be valid on any number of occasions, as having only a few weeks
between two election dates creates a significant risk of there being a
very low turnout for both polls or either one of them, particularly the
second one. We all want to ensure that as many people as possible
participate in the democratic process. It is worth noting that turnout
at the 2004 European elections was significantly higher than in 1999.
It rose from 24 per cent. to 38.5 per cent. Research for the Electoral
Commission&#146;s follow-up report on the European elections found
that combining the European Parliament elections with local elections
and the mayoral and assembly elections in London was an important
factor in improving turnout.</div>
					<a name="07030876000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a presumption that
combining local and European elections, on whichever date, is generally
the right way forward, but that would depend on the circumstances, and
it would be inappropriate to say that it was automatically the right
thing to do. It might depend, for example, on the length of the period
between the first Thursday in May&#151;the traditional day for local
elections in England&#151;and the day set for European elections.
Combining polls has advantages, but I readily admit that it also has
disadvantages. With combined elections, there is always a concern,
particularly among local councillors, that local elections will be
subsumed and will not get the priority or recognition that they
deserve.</div>

limit on the duration between local council and European elections that
the Government would not want to go beyond when ensuring that such
dates
coincide?</div>

						</b> Clearly, it might be appropriate to combine
elections that are due to take place in May and June, but it might not
be appropriate to combine them when the European elections are due to
take place at a later date. Combining elections that are due to be five
or even 12 months apart would have a bigger
impact.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> That is exactly why we want flexibility. That is
also why I say that combining election dates might not be appropriate
in all circumstances. It would be a matter to be decided by order after
discussion and consultation. There are many cases in which it might not
be appropriate. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div>important that in local elections, local issues are to the
fore in any campaign. That should be taken into
account.</div>

Burt:
						</b> I am not sure that the Under-Secretary will like my
intervention. Does this power mean that the Secretary of State can move
the date of an election by order? When there is discussion as to
whether it is right to move a particular election date, will there be a
debate and a vote in the House, or are we agreeing to a process that
will preclude that discussion and simply allow the Secretary of State
to make the decision?</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> It would be for Parliament to decide by order.
The Secretary of State could not make the changes without putting an
order before Parliament. There would probably need to be consultation
and discussion. I do not think that any Government would move election
dates lightly. The hon. Gentleman will recall that prior to the 2005
general
election&#151;</div>
