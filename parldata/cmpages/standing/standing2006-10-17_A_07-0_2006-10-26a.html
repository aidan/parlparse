<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000163"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. It is good to
be under your chairmanship today. The weather has somewhat improved
since our previous sitting, and long may that continue. I gather from
the radio this morning that I will be confronting storms, snow, ice and
all sorts of other things when I return to my constituency this
evening, so I hope that the atmosphere in the Committee this morning
will be more in keeping with the atmosphere outside than with that in
my constituency this
evening.</div><a name="06102648000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
the amendments would introduce training requirements into clause 10,
which relates to work-focused health-related assessments. Amendment No.
31 specifies training in work-related needs and support. Amendment No.
261 refers to a health care professional having</div>
<a name="06102648000130"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;training in disabilities and
health conditions&#148;.</div><a name="06102648000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
amendments seek to probe the Government&#146;s intentions regarding
the training of those who will carry out work-focused health-related
assessments, and I gather that the Under-Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire),
will respond to the debate, so my comments are addressed to her. I
raise the issue because it was suggested in our previous debate that
the assessments could sometimes be undertaken by different health care
professionals from those who will carry out the limited capability for
work and the limited capability for work-related activity assessments,
and we had a good debate about the training needs of those
involved.</div>
<a name="06102648000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">My key point
is that it is important for Ministers to make it clear that they will
ensure that those who carry out these important work-focused
health-related 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 234</div>assessments&#151;we have discussed their functions before, so I do not
need to go into them again&#151;have a proper understanding of the
wide range of disabilities, impairments and health conditions that
those they are talking to might have. That is the burden of amendment
No. 261. If they have that understanding, they should&#151;this is
the burden of amendment No. 31&#151;be able to understand such
conditions and impairments and make health care recommendations that
might enhance people&#146;s ability to undertake work-related
activity. With those few remarks, I ask the Under-Secretary to set out
the Government&#146;s intentions.</div>
<a name="06102648000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102648000164"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): May I, too, welcome
you back to the Chair, Mr. Amess? I look forward very much
to serving under you as we discuss all the issues before us.</div>
<a name="06102648000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want briefly to add to the
comments made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey (Danny Alexander). When we discussed training earlier, the
Under-Secretary gave us an assurance that people would be provided with
all the training necessary to ensure that what is envisaged in the Bill
happens. However, I wonder whether she could respond a little more
fully on that issue, because there are widespread concerns among
disabled people and the organisations that represent them about the
level of training to be given to those who do the assessments and to
Jobcentre Plus staff. I know that the Under-Secretary takes a great
interest in this issue, so could she say a little more specifically
about what training will be undertaken to ensure that people understand
hidden disabilities? People with learning disabilities, for example,
are concerned that those disabilities might not be understood because
they are not visible.</div>
<a name="06102648000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is widespread concern
about these issues, and I know that the Department will have the right
intentions, but with the greatest respect to Ministers, it has not
always delivered to the highest standard. Will the Under-Secretary
therefore give some reassurances in that
respect?</div>
<a name="06102648000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000165"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> Like my colleagues, I am
delighted to be here and to be under your chairmanship, Mr.
Amess. It must be lovely to be the Chairman of a Committee, by the way.
I do not know of any other group of MPs who get so many compliments so
early in the morning&#151;and sometimes even late at night; but I
shall not go down that road.</div>
<a name="06102648000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can offer the Opposition
considerable reassurance. I understand the reason for their concern and
for their wanting matters to be spelled out in Committee. As currently
happens with Atos Origin doctors, all the health care professionals who
will be involved in the process will undergo training specified and
agreed by the Department&#146;s chief medical adviser before being
approved by the Secretary of State to carry out assessments. That will
ensure that health professionals who carry out the work-focused
health-related assessments will have been trained to the standard that
the Secretary of State expects and thinks appropriate. A health care
professional who has not been trained to that level will not be
approved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 235</div><a name="06102648000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102648000166"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I am reassured by
that. Will the Under-Secretary further reassure the Committee that the
number of trained people will be sufficient to provide capacity in the
system to manage any surge that might happen at the beginning of the
roll-out, such as was described by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) with reference to pathways to
work in her
constituency?</div><a name="06102648000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000167"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I can give my hon. Friend that assurance because
we have set quite exacting targets for the gateway process and in our
expectations of the health professionals. It is in everyone&#146;s
interest to make sure that that works properly, and that will be part
of the continuing discussions with Atos Origin. We also need
flexibility to change the training requirements,as may be
necessary in the future. That is one reason why the amendments are
unacceptable&#151;although I appreciate that they are probing
amendments.</div> <a name="06102648000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly want to reassure the hon. Member for South-West Surrey
(Mr. Hunt) that hidden disabilities will be one aspect of
the training for the relevant health professionals. I hope that the
whole Committee will accept our commitment: the training currently
prescribed by the Secretary of State requires each practitioner to have
a personalised continuous development plan, which includes models
relating to a wide spectrum of medical subjects, including specific
conditions. Practitioners must, in addition, undertake a series of
modules on non-medical subjects such as cultural awareness. They may
have to work with broader issues than just the medical side in their
capacity as health professionals undertaking such important
assessments.</div> <a name="06102648000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that reassures the Committee, and, in particular, the hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, so that he will feel
able to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="06102648000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000168"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for those
remarks. She has given the reassurance that I wanted, so I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="06102648000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06102648000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part ofthe
Bill.</div>
<a name="06102648000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000169"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> With your leave, Mr. Amess, there
are some broader issues about the conditionality regime in the Bill
that I should like briefly to draw to the attention of the Committee,
and on which I should like to seek some assurances from the
Under-Secretary of State. Those considerations pertain not just to
clause 10 but to clauses 11 to 13, all of which come under the heading
&#147;Conditionality&#148; in the Bill. I hope that discussing the
matter now may help us to expedite proceedings on those
clauses.</div> <a name="06102648000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our
sitting on Tuesday afternoon the Minister of State entered into a quite
lively discussion about the level of funding for pathways to work. I
should like to return to that. It is important to put it on the record
that the Bill, understandably, and, provided that the reassurances that
I seek are given, justifiably, makes it clear, as he said in language
that I would endorse, that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 236</div>it is based on the idea of responsibility. It is based on the idea that
provided the support for individuals is in place and they are part of
the work-related activity component, they have some degree of
responsibility for availing themselves of that support. The Bill dwells
at length on the individual&#146;s responsibility, which is again
understandable, given the nature of legislation in this area, but it
does not dwell on the Government&#146;s responsibilities.</div>
<a name="06102648000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to press Under-Secretary
of State a little on the reciprocal responsibility that exists on the
part of the Government in exchange for the responsibility that
individual claimants are being asked to undertake under these and other
clauses relating to conditionality. I am sure that the Ministers would
agree that it is important that the Government fully carry out their
part of the bargain. It has been described as a something-for-something
package: claimants are asked to give something in terms of
responsibility and the Government undertake to provide something in
terms of support to get them back into work. That is a reasonable
proposition.</div> <a name="06102648000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to say that the Government have a particular responsibility,
although it is not stated in the Bill, to reassure the Committee on a
number of points. The first relates to funding, which we debated a
little on Tuesday afternoon. I have carried out further work on that,
partly as a result of the Minister of State&#146;s prompting,
building on written answers that he and his colleagues have provided to
me over some months. I examined what the costs per claimant in the
pathways regime were, and what they might be expected to be, given the
predictions of the onflows on to incapacity benefit over the next few
years, in the two-year period for which the &#163;360 million has
been allocated.</div> <a name="06102648000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not wish to go through all the references in all the parliamentary
questions on which this is based. However, if one takes into account
all the different available elements in the pathways pilot areas within
the choices package, the number of people who have been helped and the
percentage of people who have been participating in the different
elements of pathways, one comes to an estimate of the annual cost per
claimant within the pathways project of &#163;571 a head. My
calculations, which are based on the figures that have been provided in
answer to questions about the expected onflows on to IB&#151;in other
words, the new claimants to whom initially this is devoted&#151;
suggest that, even if the full &#163;360 million were to be devoted
entirely to the roll-out of pathways, which I shall come on to in a
second, the annual funds per participant allocated for the national
roll-out of pathways to work would be less than &#163;327 a
head.</div><a name="06102648000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be happy
for Ministers to correct my figures or to give their own estimates. If
the entire &#163;360 million is to go to pathways, and one is talking
only about new claimants over this period, on those calculations, there
is a funding gap of &#163;268 million.</div>
<a name="06102648000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Tuesday,
the Minister of State fairly made the point that the Government would
spend whatever was necessary&#151;that might not be an exact
quote&#151;and sought to make reassuring noises on this important
point. I am delighted to hear reassuring noises from the Ministers in
Committee, but I would be even more delighted and reassured to hear
similar noises from the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-Budget
report about the sums 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 237</div>that will be spent. This is a serious point, because if we are telling
employment and support allowance claimants that they are expected to be
part of a conditionality regime, it is important to make it clear to
them that the promised help will genuinely be available at the promised
levels throughout the country. That is the first point on which I would
be grateful for the Under-Secretary&#146;s response. The equation is
simple: if there are to be responsibilities and obligations, there must
also be opportunities for people to obtain the help that they
need.</div><a name="06102648000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary may want to debate whether my calculations are accurate
and whether the &#163;360 million is insufficient,
but there is a second serious question on which the Committee would
like reassurance. What proportion of that &#163;360 million will be
spent on the pathways to work roll-out&#151;I raised that earlier
but, perhaps due to the temper of the debate, it was not
addressed&#151;and what will be spent on other things? I understand
that Ministers will seek leave to start spending money on implementing
aspects of the Bill in advance of Royal Assent&#151;that is an
established procedure&#151;particularly on setting up the benefit,
which is understandable as there is not much controversy about the
benefit. If that is the intention, will the Under-Secretary explain
what proportion of the &#163;360 million will be spent on benefit
administration&#151;setting up computer systems and so on&#151;so
that the Committee will have a genuine idea of how much will be spent
on providing support and assistance for ESA claimants and how much will
be spent on the necessary administrative tasks that will underpin the
benefits?</div><a name="06102648000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third
aspect, which again relates directly to the nature of the proposed
conditionality regime, is the extent to which the pathways to work
regime is successful for all groups of claimants. That was drawn to the
Committee&#146;s attention earlier, but I want to highlight two
groups of claimants. The first is those for whom their first reason for
claiming benefit is mental health, and I distinguish that from learning
disabilities. Secondly, several charities representing older people
have said that there is not much evidence that older workers have
benefited from the pathways to work regime.</div>
<a name="06102648000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that the Under-Secretary addresses that. Both older workers
and those whose first reason for claiming benefit is mental health but
who do not satisfy any of the 46 descriptors will eventually be subject
to the conditionality regime for recipients of the work-related
activity component. It is important that the Under-Secretary sets out
what steps the Government are thinking about and what ideas they have
to improve the available support within the pathways regime for those
people. Given that the conditionality regime is the same, it is
important that the Government make it clear how they will ensure that
support and assistance is available through pathways. Pathways has been
remarkably successful for some groups of claimants and that should be
welcome on both sides of the Committee, but it has not been so
successful for other groups.</div>
<a name="06102648000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">On mental
health, I draw the Under-Secretary&#146;s attention to the work of
Professor Lord Layard on depression and the availability of, for
example, cognitive behaviour therapy services within the NHS. I wonder
whether the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 238</div>shortage of such services at the moment is one of the causes of the
condition management programme being less successful for people in that
category. Perhaps she will reflect on
that.</div><a name="06102648000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are broader considerations about the fairness of the proposed
conditionality regime and the degree to which the Government are
prepared to play their full part in the bargain. I fully accept the
Under-Secretary&#146;s good intentions, but the spending plans of
some Ministers in the Department are subject to an annual reduction of,
I believe, 5 per cent. over the next two or three years. In that
context, how does the Under-Secretary foresee funds coming forward to
ensure that the available support for ESA claimants is sufficient to
ensure that the full roll-out is available, not just for new claimants
but for existing claimants and members of the support group who wish to
take part, so that the hopes that have rightly been generated as a
consequence of our discussions are fulfilled, and people are not left
disappointed at the end of this
process?</div><a name="06102648000138"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000170"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I do not wish to speak at length even though it has
been an important debate. Thanks to the analysis of the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, we have come a little closer
to matters of concern regarding the funding that has been put in place
for the roll-out of the pathways to work programme under the Bill. If
his figures are correct, there has been a drop in funding from
&#163;571 a head to a maximum&#151;assuming that all the money is
allocated to pathways to work&#151;of &#163;327 a head. In
comparison with the pilot programmes, that is a 43 per cent. reduction
in funding. How does the Under-Secretary square that with the response
of the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform in our last sitting
when I asked whether there would be enough funding? He
said:</div><a name="06102648000131"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

drop&#151;or he does not. Ministers owe it not just to the Committee,
but to all the people who will be on the programme, to explain why the
Government are confident that a minimum43 per cent. reduction
per head in funding will be enough to fund an adequate roll-out of the
pathways programme.</div><a name="06102648000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Under-Secretary will address my particular concerns about
the people in the support group, because they have more severe
disabilities and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 239</div>will therefore require the most help to move closer to the labour
market. I am concerned that that level of reduction in funding will
make it difficult to give the necessary additional support to those
people, as it will be much more expensive and intensive than that for
people with less severe disabilities.</div>
<a name="06102648000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to rake over the arguments about the failings of incapacity
benefit, because we all agree that that system does not
work&#151;that is why the Bill was introduced&#151;but I want to
put my concerns to the Under-Secretary directly. There is concern on
both sides of the House that the incapacity benefit system parks people
who have an incapacity and effectively says, &#147;We are paying you
a little bit extra, but that is it.&#148; The whole purpose of the
new programme is to avoid that problem, and the Conservatives want to
ensure that that mistake is not repeated with people in the support
group. We want to make sure that all the options envisaged by the
pathways to work programme are as available to people in that group as
to those with less severe disabilities who are closer to the labour
market.</div><a name="06102648000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also agree
with the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
about the importance of training, particularly cognitive behaviour
therapy, and measures to help to build up people&#146;s confidence
if, for example, they have sustained a brain injury after a car crash.
The work-focused health-related assessment will be an important part of
that. However, it is difficult to understand how the sophisticated
training and medical understanding necessary to help people with those
issues will work in such an austere funding environment. I hope that
the Under-Secretary can give the Committee significant reassurance
about
that.</div><a name="06102648000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000171"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> To a certain extent, we are
revisiting our debate on clause 9, but I shall deal with some specific
issues and then refer, in particular, to funding. I reassure the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey that there has
been significant support for older people&#151;those who are over
50&#151;through the new deal for disabled people as one of the
options in pathways. Indeed, he might be interested to know that,
during the past year, 200,000 more older people have now gone into
work.</div> <a name="06102648000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also referred to rights and responsibilities. Will the
Committee reflect on why we are here discussing the Bill? I shall not
rake over the matter of incapacity benefit, but it is an example of
when the Government expected individuals to take on all the rights and
responsibilities themselves. In its generic sense, government abandoned
people and their responsibilities to 2. 7 million people, a figure that
was trebled under the previous Administration. It was a case when the
Government decided to stand back and more or less let people stand
where they hung. What underpins the Bill is the fact that we are
rebalancing those rights and responsibilities. Yes, individuals must do
something for something, but the Government also have a special
responsibility to those who need additional support at particular times
in their
lives.</div><a name="06102648000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000172"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does the Under-Secretary agree that that
responsibility applies equally to the most severely disabled members of
the support group, as it does to the less severely disabled members of
the work-related activity group?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 240</div><a name="06102648000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000173"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I wish to make it clear to the Committee that,
when I talk about disabled people, I am not talking about one category
of disabled people. When I refer to those who are in receipt of
employment and support allowance, I am not talking about only one
category. Of course, I mean people who are in receipt of the support
element. I have spent my life working with disabled people and those
who have learning difficulties, and I do not think that it is always
necessary to put a lever in the discussions as the hon. Gentleman is
doing. Of course, I mean all disabled people including those in receipt
of support. I hope that he now takes it for granted that, when I am
referring to the spectrum of people on employment and support
allowance, I am talking about those who are furthest from the labour
market and those who are most severely
disabled.</div><a name="06102648000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000174"></a>Mr.

<a name="06102648000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000175"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I will let the hon. Gentleman in, but to be frank
with him he is trying my patience on this
matter.</div><a name="06102648000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000176"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I will press the Under-Secretary. I accept her
reassurance that she is talking about all disabled people, but does she
therefore accept that it can often be a lot more expensive and
resource-intensive to help those furthest from the labour market to
have the same opportunities as those nearer the labour
market?</div><a name="06102648000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000177"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was about to
come some way towards meeting me on that point. I remind the Committee
that, when we introduced pathways to work, his party voted against
every single penny of investment that we wanted to put in to support
those who are most severely disabled as well as those who are closer to
the labour market. I am sorry that I have had to inject a little bit of
edge into the discussion, but it is about time that we started to
realise that we are all on the same track on this matter. The hon.
Gentleman continues diversifying and putting disabled people into
inappropriate categories. I appreciate that there are specific issues
relating to the support
group.</div><a name="06102648000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000178"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000179"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am not going to allow the hon. Gentleman to
intervene any more. I hope that he will now accept than when my
colleague the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform and I talk
about disabled people, we are encompassing all disabled people. That is
the philosophy underpinning the
Bill.</div><a name="06102648000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
now move on to other matters raised by hon. Members, specifically on
financing. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey has done his calculations, looked at the
parliamentary questions and so on, and come up with a figure. I can do
nothing other than reiterate what my hon. Friend said in earlier
discussions. We think that &#163;360 million is the correct amount
with which to roll out the pathways
projects.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 241</div><a name="06102648000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members seem to get
tied down in the unit cost. We are not into unit cost. The hon. Member
for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) smirks, so I shall explain
why we are not into unit cost. As I said in an earlier debate, I
operated employment programmes under a unit cost, which could be
&#163;13 a head, for example. The difficulty with the unit cost
approach is that it does not allow the resources to be directed to
those individuals who need more support and assistance, because there
is a
limit.</div><a name="06102648000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000180"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000181"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Let me finish. Within a contract, some
individuals do not, perhaps, need quite as much investment as others
who happen to be on the pathways project. A unit cost limit is an
artificial barrier to extra support for
individuals.</div><a name="06102648000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000182"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Under-Secretary talks about my making an
artificial division between groups of disabled people, but I am not
doing that; the Bill does it. Many disability organisations are
concerned that, in reality, there is a wide spectrum of disabilities
and it is hard to make such a division. We have accepted that division
in the Bill. No one is saying&#151;I think that I am also speaking
for the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey&#151;that the cost per head should be identical or that
there should be equal costs for every person in the programme. An
average cost per head, taken for the programme as a whole, would appear
to be a huge reduction of 43 per cent in the roll-out of pathways to
work. The Under-Secretary owes it to the Committee to explain why she
thinks that it will be possible, with that level of reduction, to get
the same good results on the roll-out of the pathways to work programme
as in the
pilots.</div><a name="06102648000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000183"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I re-emphasise the reassurances given by my
colleague the Minister of State in earlier discussions&#151;we have
moved from a conversation to a discussion and perhaps even to a
debate&#151;that we are confident that our funding model will deliver
our pathways programme. We can argy-bargy about the funding models in
Committee till kingdom come and perhaps not get to the basis of an
agreement. To a certain extent, as the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said, it is about trusting our funding
model and figures. We are sure that we can roll out pathways on the
funding model that we have presented to the
Committee.</div><a name="06102648000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102648000184"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): In an effort to be
emollient, I shall take a slightly different tack, and I anticipate
that the answer to my question will be positive. Will the
Under-Secretary assure the Committee that nothing will be built into
the remuneration or general management appraisal of Jobcentre Plus
staff or contractors in respect of ESA that would suggest that there
was simply a target model? That might give rise to a perverse incentive
through which people got more by processing volume rather than applying
themselves to the particular cases of the individuals
concerned.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000185"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I do not wish to embarrass the hon. Gentleman; I
had a slightly more robust conversation with his Front-Bench
colleagues. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which I am happy to
clarify. There will be no staff incentives in respect of the throughput
of people on the pathways to work project. I hope that that reassures
him. If the Committee felt that staff were on some sort of bonus, that
might make life slightly more complicated and move against the
underlying philosophy of the
Bill.</div><a name="06102648000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102648000186"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): Perhaps the approach of
Opposition Members is a function of their never having been in
government or having forgotten what that is like. Do we not learn a
great deal from piloting, which this Government have often carried out?
We have already taken account of all the set-up costs, so they do not
have to be repeated, and we have carried out the pilots, which have
been successful, so we now know how best to target resources. We do not
have to spend money again on the things that the pilots taught us

touchy than normal. However, I am grateful that she has eventually
given way. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> There is a bit of chuntering from a
sedentary position, but I want to put my point to the Under-Secretary.
There is a lot of confusion in this debate about the funding model. To
clear that up, will she undertake to publish details of her funding
model and the methodology and assumptions that underpin it, so that we
can have an open debate about
it?</div><a name="06102648000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000191"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Sometimes we in Committees forget that we are
only part of a greater whole. Funding models will, of course, be
investigated and tested through the normal parliamentary
procedure&#151;a Select Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and
so on. The hon. Gentleman does not need my reassurance that that will
happen; it is what actually happens. The issue is not just about our
talking here about a funding model, but all the other areas of
parliamentary scrutiny that will examine the funding
models.</div>

read minds as well. I should say in passing to the hon. Member for Bury
St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) that I am not touchy this morning;
this is me on my normal, robust form. He had the pleasure of Lord
Forsyth heading the Conservatives&#146; tax policy committee and if I
were not robust, I would not have given the hon. Gentleman an
opportunity that he did not think he wanted at the time.</div>
<a name="06102648000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the investment in IT,
about which the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey asked. Of course, we have the ability pre-spend under
section 28, particularly on IT. I am not prepared to give the hon.
Gentleman the exact figures. We are issuing contracts and it would be
difficult to put some of that information into the public domain. As I
have already said, however, we operate under parliamentary scrutiny,
which will allow for scrutiny of the figures at an appropriate
time.</div><a name="06102648000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000198"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary&#146;s
clarification, although I was a little disappointed by her response. I
accept that members of the Committee have entered into the discussion
about the funding of pathways and its delivery with good intentions,
but I am not at all satisfied with the answers that I received about
the specifics of the funding. We might hear more from the Chancellor in
his pre-Budget report about levels of investment that may or may not be
put into such matters, and I hope that the hon. Lady will take that up
with her friends and colleagues in the
Treasury.</div><a name="06102648000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if we
accept that we trust the Government&#151;I am not saying that I do,
but they are asking us to take it on trust that the necessary amount
will be spent&#151;it worries me that no clause in the Bill makes
clear the reciprocity of responsibility that the Under-Secretary
rightly described and the commitment that I share that would not allow
a future Government, perhaps of another party or of a political hue
that chose to make substantial tax reductions and seek cost savings, to
reduce the funding for pathways to work and to increase their use of
the conditionality regime. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that
from happening and that would allow for the fact that, in future years,
the support package might be thoroughly inadequate enough to undermine
the use of the conditionality regime. I know that that is perhaps not
the intention of Ministers here, but the Bill could be used by future
Governments, too, and that remains my

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000199"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have a few points to make about the clause. The
more that I look at the Bill, the clearer it becomes that the next few
clauses hang together and cannot be construed in isolation. I wish
first to put on record my appreciation that, in this case, the
Government have provided us with draft regulations and, as they refer
to the substance of the action planned that we shall be discussing
again in respect of clause 13, I shall at least touch on some of those
issues.</div><a name="06102648000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As is evident
from the existence of regulations and the absence of specific
amendments, the clause is not particularly contentious. It gives rise
to several points that I hope that Ministers will bear in mind when
they work out the administrative arrangements and that relate to the
reassurance of customers and the avoidance of a lot of appeal or
difficulty when carrying them out
subsequently.</div><a name="06102648000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
clear, by definition, that the purpose of a work-focused interview is
that it results in something positive. It is action directed towards
the return of the person, the customer or the claimant to work, which
is an entirely acceptable principle. Although I do not wish to go on as
much as I did on Tuesday about such matters, my experience of looking
at the pathways to pilots in Derbyshire confirmed that that approach is
being taken, and I welcome
it.</div><a name="06102648000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within those
pilots, there is no requirement for particular activity; the obligation
is to appear for the interview. As we debate clauses 12 and 13, we will
see that there is at least the potential of a specific obligation,
albeit not necessarily to carry out a particular piece of work-focused
activity, but, as it were, the noose is tightening on the claimant to
do something about it. We could argue endlessly, but it would not be in
the spirit of this Committee for me to suggest that that has a
malicious or unpleasant overtone about the motivation of people who are
claimants or customers. It is worth recording that figures I have seen
from Jobcentre Plus suggest that, under the present pathways, 23 per
cent of claimants never actually make the work-focused
interview.</div><a name="06102648000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
&#147;saloon bar&#148; interpretation, this could simply be because
the claimants have not got a case and they do not turn up. More
realistically, it may well be that, for many of them, the condition has
worked its way out and they are perfectly fit and able to return to
work. We celebrate that. There may be a variety of reasons, but clearly
the work-focused interview is a something of a milestone along the
way.</div><a name="06102648000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some
interesting issues about the timing. If we take the pathways
experience, my understanding is that the interview takes place in the
eighth week of claim. That is over and beyond the six months of
statutory sick pay, so it is quite a long time from the incidence of
the condition or the initial incident. There may be a reason for not
attending the interview, and some people would take the view that the
system needs time to settle down and for some people to return to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 245</div>work. This is defensible, although my hon. Friends and I will be arguing
later in a different context that there is a strong case for earlier
intervention in the whole process when the condition establishes
itself, even within the statutory sick pay period, but we will not get
into that debate today. However, Ministers owe it to the Committee to
say something about the optimum time or how flexible that can be in
relation to the individual. I think that it is good to connect with
people earlier in the process rather than leave them to nurse their
difficulties until it is too late to find a remedy for them.
</div><a name="06102648000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are issues,
which we will return to in later clauses, about the nature of the
interview and the basis of the action plan. I cannot help, if only by
consanguinity with a member of my family and the sort of discussion we
tend to have, although I cannot say we spend our whole weekends
discussing the Welfare Reform
Bill&#151;</div><a name="06102648000092"></a>

by constituents even if it is not the case. To avoid any doubt, that is
not the sort of approach to this process that the pathways officers I
saw were taking. It is not a penal process and nobody here wants it to
be.</div><a name="06102648000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even within the
narrow terms of clause 11, which is about the rules for interview, and
paves for the draft regulations that I mentioned, there are some
interesting issues. What is an interview? What is co-operation with an
interview, which is required under section 6 of the draft regulations?
It is to talk about assisting and encouraging the person to remain in
or to obtain work and about identifying activities the patient may
undertake to make that more likely.</div>
<a name="06102648000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have said extensively in
this Committee, many of the claimants may well have mental conditions,
attitude problems and feelings about themselves that are probably not
objectively justified, but we do not want to penalise people if they do
not quite fit in the interviewing officer&#146;s book. On the other
hand, if someone sits in the interview in what used to be described in
the armed forces as a mode of dumb insolence and refuses to answer any
questions or to co-operate with the interviewer, one could reasonably
argue, and the regulations appear to argue this, that they have not had
an interview at all. They may have attended, but they have not played
their part. There are some issues about how that is to be
defined.</div><a name="06102648000140"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06102648000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a little
more concerned about the nature of the record and we may need to return
to this on clause 13. An action plan ideally should be consensual and
signed by both parties. It should say, &#147;We have discussed your
case. We realise that you have these problems which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 246</div>have been identified by the work-focused health-related assessment, but
nevertheless we think that you could try to do this&#148;, and the
person will undertake to do so. There is also the question of a record
of what is to take place. That is specified in the draft
regulations.</div> <a name="06102648000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said the other day, the benefit situation for the individual
should be incorporated in some way into the action plan. It is a little
bit more than an action plan. In financial planning, if one went to an
independent financial adviser, one would call it a report and a series
of recommendations or agreed undertakings. It will be quite a complex
document.</div><a name="06102648000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of
these things may be done for good reason over the telephone. There is
always an evidential problem. There is also a serious
issue&#151;again, I do not want to get at officers
involved&#151;concerning the appropriate bag of qualifications for
the individual conducting the interview. What was immensely impressive
about pathways to work was that the personal advisers clearly knew what
their job was. They were highly motivated and in certain cases rather
movingly so. I watched them from across the room carrying out
interviews. When going into institutions one looks at the body language
and it looked like a positive interview, with no lurking behind a
screen and telling people to account for
themselves.</div><a name="06102648000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
do what they will be asked to do, for not great remuneration, these
officials need a full bag of qualifications. They have to have
reporting skills. Something has to be written down. They have to have
the personal adviser skills to try to tease out what is possible. The
main point for the Minister that concerns me is that they have to have
an understanding of the benefits situation because that is clearly
relevant to the action plan. All my experience of the Department is
that people can be very good on the benefit that they are
administering, or they may be good at getting people back into work,
but they are not omnicompetent.</div>
<a name="06102648000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the difficulties arise
where people are operating in silos. One person will understand the
disability living allowance very well. I see the Under-Secretary of
State is nodding. Another will understand the linking rules, someone
else will know what the local employment position is for the person
being coaxed back into work and someone else will have an input into
the health-related assessment. That is all perfectly sensible but it
all comes together in an action plan which has to be competent. It has
to be authoritative because it can give rise, at least in principle in
later clauses, to
sanctions.</div><a name="06102648000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless
I have grossly oversimplified the pathways pilot model, personal
advisers on the benefits side talk primarily about the return-to-work
credit, which is relatively straightforward and part of the whole
complex, but not the overall bag of benefits. A benefits adviser would
be brought in if necessary. We are asking a lot of these action plans.
They are meant to advise and to help individuals. I am sure that that
is the intention. They are meant to cover a lot of ground with people
who have quite a lot of difficulties. It is important that they are
well conceived and defensible&#151;if necessary, in a
tribunal&#151;because we do not want people being given low-grade
action plans that do not cover their needs, might contain factual
errors or give rise to other arguments further down the chain when, for
example, things do not turn out to be feasible. In this clause, we need
to make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 247</div>certain that the work-focused interview is prescribed a proper gateway
to action, that it can all be dealt with in a professional way and will
not be skimped on or hurried through, which can give rise to
difficulties. We will no doubt want to explore this matter seriously in
other clauses. I do not find anything personally objectionable in the
structure or regulations at all, so there areno amendments on
it but Ministers do need to think about
it.</div><a name="06102648000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000202"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I endorse everything that my hon. Friend has
said. I would like to add a further point. This clause underpins the
rights and responsibilities agenda, which both the Government and Her
Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition support. As with anything to do with
rights and commensurate responsibilities, there is a fine balance to be
struck. This clause seems to be about encouraging people to find out
more about the support that they can get. The work-focused interview is
a good thing. It is designed to showcase the types of support that are
available to the customer. However, it must not frighten people off.
There is always that tension throughout all these reforms.</div>
<a name="06102648000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mind and the Child Poverty
Action Group have raised a point about some of the literature that
customers have been receiving in pilot areas, regarding their
attendance at work-focused interviews. They have evidence&#151;I am
not going to quantify it&#151;that a threatening tone has been
deployed, threatening withdrawal of benefits for non-attendance. I am
not suggesting that that is widespread at all, but CPAG wants a review
of some of the language used. It quotes a standard letter sent to
claimants regarding their attendance at a WFI in a pathways
pilot:</div><a name="06102648000134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As your
adviser, I need to meet with you to discuss how we can improve your
chances of finding work, now or in the future. We want to make sure
that you are getting the right support and are claiming all the right
benefits. It is important that you attend and participate in this
interview. If you do not, your benefit may be
affected.&#148;</div><a name="06102648000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am used to the rough and tumble of politics. I used to be, when I had a
proper job, a lawyer&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>I was going
to say that I earned an honest living as a lawyer&#151;well, a living
anyway. To many in this room, that kind of language may seem
straightforward and factual. It touches all the right bases in one
respect: it talks about the right support and making sure that people
get the right amount of benefit. However, it has affected some
customers. Sue Christoforou, the policy officer at Mind, said in
evidence to the Select Committee for Work and Pensions earlier this
year that, after receiving such letters, some of Mind&#146;s clients
had</div><a name="06102648000135"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;gone out immediately
to get a job because they feel that is what the letter is saying to
them, completely inappropriate jobs and after a number of days that job
fails.&#148;</div><a name="06102648000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress that
that evidence undermines neither the propositions in the clause, nor
the successes of pathways and the progress that it has made. However,
will the Minister commission, or assure us that he will commission, a
review, whereby officials continually analyse and perhaps audit such
specimen letters to ensure that the language can be tweaked, not so
that it loses its force, becomes meaningless prose or is so bland that
the customer takes no note of it, but so that it does not threaten
clients and customers&#151;not my words&#151;in the ways in which
some bodies say it does? One hopes that such cases are in the
minority.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 248</div><a name="06102648000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000203"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am much in sympathy with my hon. Friend. If the
Committee needs reminding, many of those people are nervous of any
administrative process and they feel that it is to their disadvantage.
Does not he agree that, under the review that he is canvassing the
Minister to undertake, it would also be wise if officials kept, as I
hope they do, a continuing dialogue with the disability organisations,
in particular those concerned with mental health, to ensure that such
text is run past them to determine whether a better outcome can be
achieved?</div>
<a name="06102648000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000204"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I was going to come to that point. Taking on
board what my hon. Friend said, will the Minister undertake to conduct
a review of the language in conjunction with disability and support
groups? The review might produce a standard letter, so that its
drafting was left neither to individual branches of Jobcentre Plus nor
to providers, which might have different takes on it. The Minister
could then present the standard letter to the Committee at one of our
sittings and after due consultation with outside groups. It might
address the point that Mind has raised. We do not want even one person
who may be fragile or have mental health problems to be upset by the
process. One way of doing so would be with language on which we agree,
which would be used uniformly during the roll-out and when the
allowance was up and running.</div>
<a name="06102648000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102648000205"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman refers
to the language that is deployed, but does he accept that often, there
is a broader problem with such regulations? In support of my argument,
I cite a document that Citizens Advice has circulated about an income
support appeal. The decision communicated to the client read:</div>
<a name="06102648000136"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The decision
disallowing income support does not fall to be
revised.&#148;</div><a name="06102648000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">To most people
that means absolutely nothing. It is double Dutch. Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that there is a wider problem that we must
consider?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000206"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. The
problem is about not only language that in the minds of some people may
be threatening, but language that is meaningless, unhelpful and opaque.
Everyone in this House must take more cognisanceof plain
English. In the document that the hon. Gentleman quotes, the language
bears no relation to how we talk in the 21st century. Ministers are
sensitive to the issue and they are disability-aware, but will the
Minister respond to my proposal for a standard letter requesting the
work-focused-interview, the subject of this clause, to be made
available to the Committee? If not, will he suggest why it is not a
sensible proposition?
</div><a name="06102648000141"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06102648000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000207"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I endorse the suggestion made by the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds, although I think that the Department has
set up groups involving bodies that represent disability organisations,
which could advise on those matters. It is an important
point.</div><a name="06102648000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to raise a few points in addition to those already raised on
clause 11. I join the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)
in welcoming the fact that we have draft regulations. A problem with
draft regulations is that they sometimes raise more questions than they
answer, and I should like to probe the Minister on a few aspects of
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 249</div><a name="06102648000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Draft
regulation 6, on page 24 of the booklet, sets out in some detail the
requirements that must be fulfilled for a claimant to be regarded as
having taken part in the interview. A quite long list of conditions
must be satisfied, such as that the person must give information about
work-related activity that they have undertaken. However, perhaps the
Minister will consider, when he redrafts the regulations for
presentation to a Committee&#151;of which we may both be
members&#151;after the Bill is passed, the fact that they do not
contain, in addition to the obligations on claimants at the
work-focused interviews, any reference to what the adviser will do.
That is important because, as all parties in the Committee have pointed
out, a sense of the reciprocity of responsibilities, and of the fact
that advisers have responsibilities, is needed. I agree with the hon.
Member for Daventry that pathways advisers seem to take their
responsibilities seriously, but it is important to make it clear that
the adviser&#146;s role in assisting the claimant is an aspect of the
work-focused interview. Ideally, that should be in the
regulations.</div><a name="06102648000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000208"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman also agree with me about
a further point, which I notice on looking at the draft regulations
rather more carefully than I did earlier? There is no provision for a
failure notice when a person has attended an interview but the official
does not deem them to have been co-operative. There is no provision to
issue a formal notice that states, &#147;You attended the X jobcentre
and we were going to have a work-focused interview, but my judgment is
that your lack of co-operation meant that we did not achieve
one.&#148; Nor is there any evidential basis for being able to
establish that, apart from the assertion of the officer
concerned.</div>
<a name="06102648000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000209"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an
important point, to which I hope the Minister will respond, about how
the regulations will be interpreted when a decision is made about
whether someone is deemed to have taken part in an interview, when
there is the possibility that they were present but unco-operative. The
way in which the decision is communicated is also important. Perhaps
the Minister could dwell on that.</div>
<a name="06102648000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without wishing to pre-judge
the debate that we shall no doubt have on a later amendment, tabled by
the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson), I think it
might also be worth providing in the regulations that the work-focused
interview should, at least in the first instance, include discussion of
access to other benefits that people might get, to ensure that they
receive their full entitlement.</div>
<a name="06102648000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Draft
regulation 9 on page 25 of the booklet provides for waivers. It is my
understanding that in the pathways areas a work-focused interview can
be waived&#151;and the pathways regulations specify this&#151;when
it would not be of assistance to the persons concerned, or would not be
appropriate in the circumstances. However, draft regulation 9 states
that a work-focused interview can be waived only if someone is likely
to start work. Advisers will be able only to defer a work-focused
interview, not to waive it, on the grounds that it is inappropriate or
would not be of assistance. This may seem a pedantic point, but it is
important because it restricts advisers&#146; discretion. Given that
those ideas depart from previous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 250</div>practice, will the Minister explain the basis for that change in
rationale? What implications does it have for advisers&#146; case
loads and training? On work-focused interviews more generally, what
thought has the Department given to ensuring that reasonable
adjustments aremade to premises under the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 to ensure that claimants can participate fully
in the interview?</div> <a name="06102648000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last, short series of points relates to the sanctions regime in the
clause. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> When the Minister gets his
pen back, will he briefly set out the rationale behind that regime? The
work-related activity component can be subject to a sanction amounting
to 50 per cent. for the first four weeks and 100 per cent. after that.
What is the rationale behind choosing the50 per cent. figure?
What is the rationale behind choosing the four-week period, as opposed
to two weeks, six weeks or three months? Why not have more stages of
sanction and make the arrangements more progressive, rather than having
two rather steep steps?</div>
<a name="06102648000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000210"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I just wonder whether more steps would add to the
complexity. I thought that the Committee and these proceedings were
dedicated to eradicating complexity.</div>
<a name="06102648000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000211"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> They may well add to the complexity. I was
merely trying to encourage the Minister to describe the thinking that
went into the provisions. He said earlier that every aspect of the Bill
had been subject to lengthy discussion between Ministers and officials.
He has no doubt chewed over the issue at some length, so he might be
able to describe his thinking on it.</div>
<a name="06102648000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also a question about
the period after which someone who has been sanctioned, but who has
subsequently met the requirements, can have their benefit reinstated.
How does that process work?</div>
<a name="06102648000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the impact
of the new sanctions regime, has the Minister made any forecast of how
often he expects to use the new powers and how many people will be
drawn into the net? He said earlier that part of the idea behind the
Bill was to tackle child poverty, so has he made any assessment of the
impact that the sanctions&#151;in whatever volume he predicts they
will be used&#151;will have on child
poverty?</div>
<a name="06102648000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102648000212"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> Mr. Amess, I am delighted to see you
in your place on this sunny morning. I know that it is sunny because I
can feel the sun on my back and see it in the eyes of Opposition
Members&#151;at least, I think that that is why their eyes are
glinting at me in the way that they are.</div>
<a name="06102648000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had hoped that we would have
finished our conversation/exchange/debate on the clause before our
break, but I do not think that that will be possible. Although there
are not many amendments, more questions have been posed on this clause
than on many others to which more amendments were tabled. I shall try
to rush through the points that have been raisedand to make
some progress before and after thebreak, because we are
talking largely about the draft regulations. They will be agreed later,
should the Bill be agreed by this place and the other place, so there
will be further opportunities to discuss the specifics.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 251</div><a name="06102648000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn first to the points
raised by the hon. Member for Daventry. The difficulty in conversing
with him is that he asks a question and then helpfully moves close to
answering it. That is not a bad trait; indeed, it is very helpful,
because it occasionally saves me from asking officials. He also used
the analogy of a saloon bar analysis, and although I have many images
of him, I cannot see him in a saloon bar.</div>
<a name="06102648000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the less, the hon.
Gentleman asked several pretty reasonable questions, including what is
meant by participating in an interview. That is described in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 252</div>regulation 6, on page 24 of the draft regulations, which shows that it
is not simply a matter of attending. He then asked about enforcing a
requirement to participate in a work-focused interview. That appears to
be covered by regulation 4(1). Of course, the conversation about the
draft regulations will continue as they make their way through this
place.</div> <a name="06102648000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
