<H4><center>Tuesday 6 July 1999</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Peter Atkinson in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/121/1999121.htm">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a></center></H3>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Alan Milburn):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
That, during proceedings on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock, except on Thursday 22nd July when the Committee shall meet at half-past Two o'clock only.
<P>
On behalf of all members of the Committee, may I extend a warm welcome to you, Mr. Atkinson? We look forward to you chairing our proceedings. As always, you will be fair but firm. I also extend a warm welcome to your co-Chairmen, Mrs. Dunwoody and Mr. O'Brien. I am sure that all members of the Committee will be on their best behaviour. I shall be for two good reasons. First, I want to set a good example to the Committee and, secondly, because you, Mr. Atkinson are my Member of Parliament. Therefore, I do not want to fall out with you or, indeed, with Mrs. Dunwoody or Mr. O'Brien. I have made that mistake more than once in the past and have lived to regret it.
<P>
I welcome the Opposition parties to the Committee. I look forward to their constructive engagement on an important Bill. In particular, I look forward to hearing not just about the measures that they oppose, but about the measures that they support and about the type of structure that they would like for modern regulation of the financial services industry.
<P>
I welcome my hon. Friends to the Committee. I am sure that they will serve with distinction and aplomb. From their consideration of previous Treasury Bills, many have built up formidable expertise. They will serve on this Bill with the same distinction that they have shown in the past.
<P>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have an array of expertise and there is a striking overlap between the membership of this Committee and the membership of the Joint Committee on Financial Services and Markets, which was chaired by Lord Burns. That Committee carried out formidable work on what is a formidable Bill. We shall explore the issues rigorously, robustly and in detail, but I hope that the consensus on the case for change that was established in the proceedings of the Joint Committee will be reflected in this Committee's work.
<P>
The Bill is a major piece of legislation. It is large, complex and technical and will bring about a radical overhaul of regulation in this country, which will set the pace for regulatory change internationally. Financial services are important not just to the City of London, but to the viability and vitality of the United Kingdom economy. Therefore, the health of the industry is of concern to us all, and so is its proper modern regulation.
<P>
The work of the Joint Committee and the consultation that the Government have undertaken in the past year or so have demonstrated an important point. Despite the arguments about matters of detail and some matters of principle, there is a consensus for change. It is recognised that the old regulatory structures are past their sell-by-date and that the time has come for their radical overhaul.
<P>
With co-operation and good will, we can make much progress before the House rises for the summer recess. The Government intend, with the support of the Opposition, to take the Bill through the new carry-over procedures. If we can manage to reflect the consensus that has been built up so far on the issues raised by the Bill, we shall achieve that, so that by next spring, subject to the approval of Parliament, the Bill will be on the statute book and the financial services industry will be clearer about the role of regulation in producing more competitive industry and consumers will be clear about their rights and responsibilities in the modern world.
<P>
I look forward to the Committee sittings in the coming few months. I shall be ably supported by my hon. Friends the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. They, alas, have other Government business today but I am sure that they will shoulder more than their fair share of the Government's work on the Bill. I see my role as more non-executive than executive as regards the issues in the Bill but I, too, will do my fair share during our proceedings. I commend the sittings motion to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): May I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson--and your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, in due course--to the Chair? I welcome also members of the Committee. There are familiar faces from past Finance Bills and from the Joint Committee which examined the draft Bill earlier this year. Sometimes on Finance Bill Committees members have been rather reticent--even silent. I hope that they will take as their model the Joint Committee, where they were more inclined to voice opinions, to good effect. It would be great to hear from all parts of the Committee from time to time on a Bill of this nature, which does not perhaps automatically divide completely along party lines. The joint aims would be to improve the Bill and to ensure that the United Kingdom has a system of financial regulation of which we can be proud.
<P>
On Second Reading, Opposition Members gave the Bill a cautious welcome. We agree about the necessity to legislate. The Financial Services Authority certainly needs statutory cover. Indeed, the present dangerous lacuna allows the authority to operate without guidance from the House, and I am not at all sure that it would have adequate powers in the event of a major regulatory failure. We need in statute a proper Bill that defines and limits the powers of the FSA.
<P>
The Bill has been greatly improved since last July, when the first draft was published, but we still want further substantial changes. There are defects in the Bill even as re-published, and we wish to urge a number of policy issued on the Government.
<P>
Over-regulation is still a threat. It threatens the position of the United Kingdom, and the City of London in particular, in international markets. Evidence to the Joint Committee from a number of City institutions made that point. For example, the bank, Singer and Friedlander, Ltd., estimates that even at present it is spending £2 million a year responding to regulatory inquiries, and that United Kingdom profits are only £25 million. That gives an indication of the threat. Many jobs are at stake, as are huge foreign earnings. So there is an obligation on all of us to counter the threat of regulation by setting up safeguards in the Bill.
<P>
There is also a threat to ordinary savers because excessive costs would undermine the savings culture. If costs are loaded onto--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman but we have been asked to evacuate the building. Members and staff should leave the building at once, without using the lifts, and assemble at the muster points in New Palace Yard. If members of the public are unsure where to go, they should seek the advice of security staff. I cannot say when the Committee will resume sitting, but I hope that it will be about five minutes after the sounding of the all-clear.
<P>
<H5>10.40 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>10.57 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am glad that Committee members survived the alarm. There was a danger of being crushed--rather than burned--to death on the way out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am not sure what the fire practice proved, except that the staircase leading to Speaker's Court is far too narrow for the number of people being evacuated. Undoubtedly, we would have perished, had there been a real fire. However, from time to time it is useful to be reminded of our mortality.
<P>
When we were evacuated, I was reminding Committee members that we have severe misgivings about the tendency to over-regulate, which may be a feature of Bills such as that which we are considering. The City is vulnerable, and ordinary savers who bear the cost may be put off buying savings products or seeking financial advice, should the costs become excessive.
<P>
We are worried about whether the Bill respects certain basic principles in British law. To me, that is as important as the more technical matter of the Bill being compatible with the European convention on human rights, which is being incorporated into British law.
<P>
Without doubt, the Government got matters wrong in the Bill as first drafted. The reasons for that are obscure, but they seem to have been given faulty legal advice. The Joint Committee was advised that the Bill that was published last year would have been successfully challenged.
<P>
Improvements have been made to the Bill, but it is dangerously vulnerable to challenge under the ECHR. If that happens, the big crooks will get off, because the well-advised and the rich always get through the legal minefields.
<P>
Therefore, if the Committee can enhance the rights of the accused, it will not be to protect wrongdoers, but the opposite: to ensure that people who are guilty of fraud and wrongdoing are successfully prosecuted and cannot challenge the edifice of the measure under the European convention.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are also concerned to put further checks and balances around the Financial Services Authority. As it stands, it is an awesome concentration of executive power; the FSA makes the rules, it has much discretion and it can levy unlimited fines. We want further formal separation of powers and checks and balances. We have received assurances, but we want more of them in the Bill.
<P>
The Joint Committee and hon. Members have received representation from individuals and organisations complaining about the past actions of regulators. We cannot revisit those complaints, but we can respond by trying to ensure that future regulatory action respects the principles of British common law and gives adequate opportunities for the accused to defend themselves, possibly--certainly in the case of criminal-type accusations--with the assistance of legal aid.
<P>
The government have moved some way towards building in further safeguards, but, in our view, they have not moved far enough. In addition, they want to improve the accountability of the FSA to producers, consumers and the House. It is therefore important to strengthen the position of the non-executive members of the FSA and to ensure that it reports fully and accurately on its activities and the compliance costs levied on the regulated community, not just on the fees that it levies.
<P>
The Treasury, too, should be subject to many of the disciplines in the Bill. It has an important function in defining the scope of the legislation and it will introduce secondary legislation in due course. The Treasury should, follow the same, or similar, rules as the FSA in respect of matters such as the principles and objectives referred to in the Bill.
<P>
It was not mentioned on Second Reading, but it occurred to me that as the Government are a participant in the financial services market, they should be required to abide by the same rules as the private sector. For instance, the Government are involved in the issue of debt; they design savings products such as individual savings accounts. The Department for Social Security advises people on pensions; there was a regrettable example of a type of mis-selling in which the DSS failed properly to alert people to the reduction in the widows' element in the state earnings-related pension scheme.
<P>
That has been a longstanding issue, which is being grappled with by the Department of Social Security now, and it demonstrates that the Government--or the Government Department--are players, not referees. They should therefore be encompassed in the provisions in the same way as the City of London.
<P>
On Second Reading we touched on Scotland and I hope that there are more hon. Members representing Scottish interests here than there were on the Joint Committee. Some confusion has already been caused. The Bill will require changes to Scottish law on bankruptcy and solicitors. I asked on Second Reading who would make the necessary changes to Scottish law--this House or the Scottish Parliament. In a short debate in the Scottish Parliament, the Deputy Justice Minister said that this Parliament would change Scottish law, even though those laws are not reserved matters for this House. That raised some eyebrows north of the border. When I put the question to the Economic Secretary, she responded by saying that the Bill covers the whole of the United Kingdom. We already knew that; it was not a proper answer.
<P>
There is an important political point here because we are facing a sort of reverse devolution in which some matters that were previously dealt with in Scotland are now to be regulated from London. An individual solicitor practising in Scotland who gave some incidental financial advice pays a modest fee to the Law Society of Scotland. Under the Bill, such a solicitor will face an increase in that fee of more than 400 per cent. Furthermore, his cheque will be sent to London, not Edinburgh. I am not sure that that is what the Government intended when they proudly announced administrative devolution. In forthcoming months, we shall require some hard answers to some hard questions.
<P>
The Government have provided some welcome assurances about other matters, but we want to ensure that those assurances are built into the text of the Bill and become part of the legislation. The work done on the text so far is not altogether reassuring. Some of the drafting is ambiguous and needs technical improvement. We shall table many amendments, some of them probing, with the objective of eliciting reassurances. If they are not forthcoming or the amendments reveal defects in the Bill, we expect the Government to respond by incorporating some of our ideas into the Bill.
<P>
We have adopted a constructive attitude so far, as the Chief Secretary would acknowledge. That was our attitude on the Joint Committee, which had an unpartisan atmosphere. Happily, many members of that Committee are with us in Standing Committee today. I hope that that constructive attitude will continue, but it will require the Government to respond positively to our well founded concerns.
<P>
The Government have said that they will enact most of the recommendations of the Joint Committee and also assured us that the Bill already incorporates the recommendations that they have accepted. We shall be vigilant and ensure that that is the case. Of course, we understand the need for a limited number of Government amendments in due course, but it will be a serious matter if those amendments are tabled only after the Committee has passed the relevant parts of the Bill. That would not be in line with the assurances that we have been given. We ask that when Government amendments are required, they are tabled in plenty of time so that we can scrutinise, debate and vote on them.
<P>
We start with good intentions. We want to scrutinise the Bill carefully. We have identified what we regard as defects, examples of which we gave on Second Reading and some of which I touched on again today. We will be tabling amendments and new clauses. I understand that the Committee wants to get down to the serious business of amendments on Thursday.
<P>
We will be constructive throughout and will not needlessly inhibit the Bill's progress, but it is of great importance--many people's livelihoods will be affected by it. A huge British industry is watching our proceedings and hoping that we get the right balance between our collective desire for good and effective regulation and a light touch so that we do not drive the same businesses into other jurisdictions, which would not improve regulation globally and would cost this country dear. I think that we can get that balance right, and although I do not think the Bill yet gets it right, I hope that we are moving in the right direction. We will  take every opportunity to get it into the right shape before it is reported to the House.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I also welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, and your co-chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, to the Chair. 
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members give the Bill broad support, but as someone who spent nearly 30 years in banking, I find the amount of legislation and regulation that we are now having to implement for that sector rather sad. In a bygone, golden age, the industry had a reputation for probity and the excellence of its advice, and the people who provided financial advice did so because they thought that it was in the very best interests of those who were being advised. Sadly, I suspect that we are now in other realms where regulation is certainly necessary.
<P>
I hope that the Bill will be flexible enough to ensure that it can be sustained in this fast-moving industry with its new products and providers. More and more people are realising the necessity of financial advice.
<P>
We articulated our reservations about the Bill on Second Reading, principally its exclusion of mortgages. I hope that we will have the opportunity to discuss that in some detail and perhaps even to move towards a timetable for including mortgages in the scope of the legislation. That would certainly be important for consumers. Their futures will be affected by the important financial decisions that they take, so it is vital that they have the very best information and can rely on a certain amount of regulation to support them in that.
<P>
Consumers are increasingly at a disadvantage; the range and complexity of the products that they are being asked to consider is constantly increasing and it is becoming more difficult to compare one with another. They need to be able to rely on the advice  that is given to them. We need to encourage more educated consumers, backed by regulations, so that people can make the right decisions more often than not. That is what the Bill is intended to achieve, and I hope that it does so.
<P>
I also hope that we will be able to tackle the problems of those who are at the bottom end of the financial market--those who often have small amounts to save or borrow. They are often more in need of protection, advice and support than others higher up the scale.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I look forward to examining these issues. I hope that we will continue to provide a constructive approach. Clearly, the Bill has benefited enormously from the extensive consultations that have taken place to date. No doubt we shall be bombarded with even more as we go through the Committee stage. I hope that we will produce legislation that will not overburden some of my former colleagues in terms of what they have to do and the costs that they incur in  doing so. I hope that there will be a balance that will provide the strength of regulation to ensure that the consumer is protected, advised and educated and that the industries that supply the products are not burdened with so many costs that the whole exercise becomes over-regulated as that can sometimes work against the best interests of the consumer. I look forward to the coming weeks and to contributing where possible to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, perhaps with extra profusion, as I know how antagonistic your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, is to the general love-ins that tend to preface such proceedings? We do not envy you your job, given the technicalities of a Bill that may last into the next millennium.
<P>
I should like at the outset, and I hope that I will not have to repeat it, to declare my interest as set out in the Register of Member's Interests. I am a director of Fleming Private Asset Management and a member of the Securities Institute. I am also a shareholder as I hope many members of the Committee are because the Bill is of particular interest to us.
<P>
I add my praise for the work of the Joint Committee which was a bold innovation and a worthwhile experiment. The process of pre-legislative scrutiny certainly proved itself in our deliberations. I hope, therefore, that the Government will pay slightly more attention to the work of the Joint Committee than perhaps they have in their initial responses, welcome though many of them were.
<P>
The Opposition are interested in how the Government will respond to the fine detail as we go through the Bill. We are particularly keen to see how Labour members of the Joint Committee, who contributed fully in their raw, unwhipped state, will respond in their rather more whipped state here. When we reach the relevant clauses in the Bill will they go against their Whip and continue to support some of the proposals that they unanimously agreed to in the Joint Committee?
<P>
I am also pleased that the Minister has said that he will play his fair share in these proceedings. It will need all hands to the deck. We very much hope that the Liberal Democrats will do so too. It was telling that the closest the only Liberal Democrat member got to the Joint Committee proceedings was when his name appeared on the annunciator when he was speaking in the Chamber. It would be sad if he did not play his full part in these important proceedings now.
<P>
This is an important Bill and extremely technical. It also gets more confusing every day. We seem to be dealing with a living, evolving organism which is underlined by comments in the press in the last few days. The Financial Times on Friday reported a speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the American ambassador which suggested that there was a change of tack, if not a U-turn on the whole issue of competition and competitiveness. Indeed, the Financial Times said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A fundamental shift in the regulatory regime for banks and other financial institutions is . . . being planned by the Treasury."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We had no inkling of that when the Economic Secretary gave her presentation as a witness to the joint committee. The Financial Times also says that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a late amendment for... a statutory duty to promote competition is likely to be tabled by the Government this week."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I read the Chancellor's speech, and singling out the opening out of the utilities, consumer goods and financial services to even greater competition can certainly be construed as the Financial Times has done. I notice that that has not been denied, so there is apparently to be a fundamental, major addition to the four objectives.
<P>
We also heard in the Chancellor's speech that Don Cruikshank, who has been commissioned to produce a report on competition in the banking industry, may be expected to produce an interim report by the end of July. Our proceedings will be fairly well advanced by then, yet fundamental analysis of how the banking industry will work, which is highly germane to the Bill, will not be even at an interim report stage. The Competition Commission would be asked to adjudicate and have the final say if anyone decided to contest a new rule from the FSA because they thought that it harmed competition. A few days ago, some of us discussed with senior members of the FSA what will be the role of the Office of Fair Trading vis-a-vis the FSA. That is another fundamental question that the Government must address, and I hope that the Minister will do so.
<P>
Today, the Financial Times states that competition risks compromising the integrity of the financial system and that making major changes at this late stage can only cause further delays to the Bill. I have news for the Financial Times: we have a long way to go. It has been more than a year since the Government embarked on this course, yet every day there is a new direction, and we have been told that there are about to be new amendments. Exactly what are we dealing with?
<P>
It is therefore not surprising that many concerns have been expressed to us by members of the financial services industry. The Financial Times reported at the weekend that in a comprehensive survey of the industry carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers, two thirds of the respondents said that they were concerned that the Bill before us would push up costs to the whole industry, that the FSA would lack accountability and damage London's attractiveness as a financial centre and that the FSA may fall prey to international turf battles and excessive bureaucracy. Only 8 per cent. of the many respondents agreed that the FSA would take sufficient account of the needs of specialist derivative businesses, and half believed that it would not give firms consistent and transparent treatment in disciplinary matters. That tells us that a great many practitioners at the sharp end of the financial services industry have not been reassured by the warm words of Treasury Ministers and bureaucrats in the Treasury and the FSA. The Government have a big job to do to convince the financial services industry that the provisions that we are discussing today, that must be successful, will be in its interests and to its benefit.
<P>
I hope that it will come as no surprise to the Government to learn that we have tabled 23 amendments--all of which, I am glad to see, have been selected for debate. That takes us only as far as page 3 of the Bill; many more amendments will follow. I echo the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) in hoping that the Government will not be shy in tabling their own amendments, which the Economic Secretary promised on Second Reading would be considerable. Let us hope that we have them in good time, so that they can be properly considered by all concerned, and not just steamrollered through.
<P>
It was especially annoying to the Joint Committee that the major headlines that we achieved from a comprehensive report concentrated purely on the theme of whether mortgages should be included within the scope of the FSA and on the--perhaps minor, perhaps not--skirmish about splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive. We covered much more in that report, and there was even more that we could not cover within our time remit, but that I hope that we will cover in this Committee. The Government have brought themselves some time over the summer. They will need to use that time wisely, and I trust that certain Ministers' holidays will be slightly shorter than usual during the summer recess because the problem concerning the European convention on human rights has not been dealt with satisfactorily. That is a major issue which still threatens to scupper much of the discipline regime in the Bill. We need to see firm proposals in black and white that are ECHR-proof, which is not the case at present.
<P>
We also need to see the Government's response to the FSA responses to the consultation papers. There have been more that 24 such papers, with less than a handful of responses. How can we be expected to lay down the ground rules of how to draw up the extensive rule book for the FSA if the FSA has not even had the results from the consultation exercises and responded to them? Part of this process has been rather topsy turvy; the cart has been put before the horse. I hope that the Government will not rush us through consideration of the Bill because we need detailed consideration of many of these points.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Government have time over the summer, there is an awful lot to deal with in the Bill's early clauses and schedules. The point about the authority's general duties is fine, but what are the Treasury's general duties? It is all very well having detailed debates to curtail the rule book and ensure that there is a level playing field between the regulator and the abuser, and that they enter into a course of action with both eyes open, sensible of the consequences of their action, but as the Bill stands, tremendous powers are retained by the Treasury to change the rules under secondary legislation. The FSA will be required to put in place arrangements for consulting practitioners and consumers, but the Treasury can implement its secondary legislation in the absence of any further consultation with the industry or Parliament. We want to see the Treasury's commitment to the fairness of the system; it should not simply be tying down the FSA, because it retains considerable powers over the FSA.
<P>
I have already mentioned briefly the problem of competition and the competitiveness. Let us not mix up the two. The Chancellor's speech showed that there will be a difference of direction. In the competition between two United Kingdom merchant banks, for example, will promoting competition be a result of the FSA having a lower capital adequacy requirement for a new bank entering the system? How does the Treasury propose to address that issue?
<P>
In Germany's financial service industry, one size fits all and there is very little innovation when it comes to products. Consequently, the culture of private equity ownership in Germany is embryonic when compared with that of the United Kingdom. We certainly do not want to go down that strait jacketed route.
<P>
There is also the question of international competitiveness. It is slightly confusing that, although we have many lessons to learn from the International regulator, IOSCO--the International Organisation of Securities Commissions--the Treasury has not taken on board many of the competitiveness suggestions that IOSCO has already made. It is also a mystery why the Treasury did not more forcibly back the City corporations' bid for IOSCO to be hosted in the City of London rather than in Spain, where is is now, because it had a lot to teach us.
<P>
We would like completion and competitive objectives included in the Bill, and are hopeful that the Government are coming round to our way of thinking. Reducing red tape is key, and another important spur to competition is education of the investor. I hope also that the Ministers present will have regard to the words of the Prime Minister in the foreword to the better regulation guide of last year when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is vital that the Government regulates wisely. If our regulatory framework is excessive or poorly conceived, we all suffer from the resultant red tape."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that we would all agree with that, but let us see that happening in practice under the Bill. We should like the Government to put their money where their mouth is and to have a competition and competitiveness objective, or objectives, in black and white in the Bill.
<P>
I shall briefly touch on the problem of systemic risk. I use the phrase "touch on", but I shall give the matter more consideration than the Bill does in its 360-odd clauses and many schedules. It makes only cursory reference to the problem of systemic risk, but that is one of the most fundamental problems to be faced. However, it is not entirely clear who will deal with the problems that may arise from the Bank of England Act 1998. We are told that there is a memorandum of understanding between the Treasury, the FSA and the Bank of England and that monthly tripartite meetings between the three bodies take place. However, we are not entitled to see the minutes or learn the contents of those meetings.
<P>
The balance relating to the vested interests in letting banks or financial institutions go under has substantially changed as a result of taking powers from the Bank of England. That important point is not addressed by the Bill, but I would like the Committee to discuss it. The market confidence objective set out in clause 3 is very woolly. The Bill contains at least four different definitions of the term "consumer" and it has others relating to "customer". There are many inconsistencies in the Bill's drafting.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We welcome the provision to put practitioner and consumer panels on to a statutory basis, but those bodies need teeth. The provisions for them must not be mere tokenism, but Howard Davies, the FSA's supremo, has already said that the budget for consumer panels is inadequate. Although the panels will be set up, it is a mystery to me why there is no explicit requirement on the FSA to consult them on rule changes before they are put out to general consultation. What is the point of creating a panel of experts who are there, among other things, to ensure that consultation exercises are relevant and ask the right questions if that panel is to be sidelined? If the FSA and the panels disagree, the minutes of those discussions should be published so that there is transparency. The Bill contains a raft of good intentions, but they are not followed through in black and white and in its wording.
<P>
I have touched on only the first few clauses, but schedule 1 is a different kettle of fish. I hope that we shall have time to linger on schedule 1, because it takes in many important regulations. For example, it refers to the splitting of roles between the chief executive and the chairman. We will be interested to see the reaction of Labour Members to that.
<P>
We are pleased that the main board will have a majority of non-executive members, but we need to be assured that they will not be poodles and that it will not be manned by compliant officers. We need to know the arrangements for remuneration and the length of time they will serve.
<P>
We welcome the innovation of an investigator, but he will have no deterrent effect unless he has the powers to award compensation. How independent will the investigator be if he or she is appointed by the Treasury rather than by the Lord Chancellor's Department? If the office of the investigator uses the staff and resources of the FSA, its independence may be called into question.
<P>
The Bill will give the FSA enormous powers to proceed with actions or to come down like a ton of bricks on firms that transgress the rules. However, there should be a mechanism in place that will cause the FSA to think twice before it takes such action. Having an investigator is only side of the equation. He should also have teeth and the powers to award compensation. I do not see the need to wrap the FSA in cotton wool, but much of the Bill is couched in those terms.
<P>
I suspect that we shall spend no little time on the question of immunity. The Joint Committee was told that the provision for immunity was made when the Securities and Investment Board was first configured in 1986. People could not be found to serve on the panels of the SIB unless they had statutory immunity. I do not dispute that. However, the FSA does not need to retain statutory immunity, especially if it is negligent or reckless in pursuing its actions and if its actions prevent a regulated person or firm from undertaking legitimate business. I am therefore in favour of immunity extending only to individuals within the FSA, not the whole edifice.
<P>
The Government and the FSA have agreed in principle to much more information being readily available in the annual report, which will be important in demonstrating that the FSA is carrying out its business properly, economically and in the interests of everyone whom it looks after. The Bill should therefore contain specific requirements for the costing of extra regulations, their cumulative cost and the cost in an international context. The head of the FSA has taken up the idea of commissioning a new international report, following that produced in 1995 by Dr. Willis in Australia.
<P>
I turn to penalties and fees. We do not know how the system of rebating fines to subscription fees will work and need to be convinced that such rebates will not be swallowed up in a big melting pot, failing to reach those members who pay their subscription fees. 
<P>
Paragraph 17 (1)(a) to schedule 1 mentions charging fees "for any incidental purpose". That is not good enough. We must tighten many of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
I have made a few brief comments on the first dozen clauses and the first schedule, giving a taster of matters that we will tackle in a comprehensive, detailed and technical Bill. We shall discuss in greater detail the ECHR; the need for greater clarification of the definition of market abuse; the possibility of including intent as a fundamental requirement for the market abuse regime to apply; the scope of what will be included in the FSA's remit; the dilemma of what is civil and what is criminal; and how the promised legal aid scheme is to be financed--will that involve recycling extra revenue from firms that have to pay a levy?
<P>
We must get the Bill--including its fine print--absolutely right first time. The Minister repeated the mantra of light-touch regulation--when appropriate--being a purpose of the Bill. We agree with that. However, I am sure that he does not expect Conservative Members to be a soft touch in dealing with the Bill. We want the Bill to succeed, but in a way that will benefit the financial services community, its customers and consumers. We also want one of this country's important industries to benefit from the Bill's international context.

<P>

<B>Mr. Milburn:</B> I am sure that Committee members are grateful for the tour of the first few clauses provided by the hon. Member for East worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). No doubt, that will relieve him of the responsibility of repeating such a survey later in our proceedings. I suspect that that will be a relief to the whole Committee.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised several detailed issues, which, no doubt, will be subjected to close scrutiny in Committee and I shall now highlight three or four of them.
<P>
I agree with the right hon. member for Wells, who said that the Bill was not a party-political matter. Indeed, it is not: that was reflected in the work of the Joint Committee described as a bold move by the hon. Member for East Worthing, who went on to criticise the Government for having the temerity to alter the Bill in response to consultations undertaken before the Joint Committee met and after it reached its conclusions.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing cannot have it both ways. There is a great deal of cynicism about consultation. Under the previous Government, consultation was more a period of time than a process. However, that is not true of the Bill, which has involved a genuine process of consultation. Rightly and properly, the Government listened to the consultations that were received. We even listened to representations from Opposition Members and will continue to do so during the Committee's proceedings. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, given the scale of the industry and its importance to the United Kingdom economy, and the scale and significance of the Bill, it is important that we do everything in our power to get it right. If that makes for delay and extra investment of time and effort, so be it. That is the right thing to do, and we should not apologise for it.
<P>
Detailed issues such as accountability, competition policy, and others were raised, and we shall return to them in due course. On accountability, I would not wish Opposition Members to think, as has been alleged in some quarters, that somehow or other the Financial Services Authority will be an accountable body able to act as prosecutor, judge and jury. It will not. We have built in appropriate safeguards to ensure that it is capable of reporting to Parliament and is answerable to the needs of the industry and consumers. But no doubt we will come back to these matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to the Financial Times. I have a small tip for him: he should not believe all that he reads in newspapers, not even in as august an organ as the Financial Times. He quotes from it as though it were something of a Bible, but it is not. The Government have always made it clear that we favour competition in banking, as in other industries. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor repeated that point in a recent speech in which he said that good regulation facilitates competition. That is why, as the right hon. Member for Wells is aware, the Bill proposes extending the role of the Office of Fair Trading to allow it to scrutinise banking regulation as well as the banking industry. That position was endorsed by the Joint Committee on which my right hon. Friend served. The Cruikshank review was mentioned and we look forward to its findings. If it recommends further improvements, we shall consider them carefully.
<P>
Three further issues lightened the proceedings somewhat. I look forward to hearing how the Opposition intend to enhance the rights of wrongdoers--the phrase that I believe the right hon. Member for Wells used. That would be an interesting challenge for him, and is something that my hon. Friends will no doubt scrutinise with much interest.
<P>
It was good to discover that Opposition Members are now on the side of devolution and opposed to centralisation. I am not sure that they have always advocated that policy for Scotland, Wales and other parts of the United Kingdom, but a latter-day conversion is better than none.
<P>
It was fascinating to hear the right hon. Member fore Wells criticising the Government for pensions mis-selling. I thought that that happened under the Conservative Government.
<P>
Two central issues arise from the sitting motion, and I remind right hon. and hon. Members that we are making these changes for two principal reasons. First, the nature of the industry has changed fundamentally. Regulatory structures have lagged behind those changes and there is now much more of a mixed economy within the financial services industry than ever before. That form of integration will intensify in future, not only in the United Kingdom but in financial services industries world wide, and it is important to have parallel structures in financial services regulation.
<P>
Secondly, on the point about pensions mis-selling, it is also important to get right the balance between providing appropriate and tough regulation were necessary, and including safeguards for consumers. The right hon. Member for Well rightly mentioned pensions mis-selling. He might have said that that was damaging to the financial services industry's reputation and that it was extremely important that all who want to safeguard the interests of the industry learn from what happened in the past. That means securing a proper balance between having a light-touch regulatory regime with protection where necessary, and enshrining the principle of fairness throughout the proceedings of the regulatory body. That is what the Bill achieves and I have no doubt that this Committee will build on the work of the Joint Committee and ensure a regulatory structure that will stand the test of time and better protect the interests of consumers and of the industry as a whole.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock, except on Thursday 22nd July when the Committee shall meet at half-past Two o'clock only.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the order of consideration motion, I remind the Committee that there are two financial resolutions attached to the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. Neither I, Mrs. Dunwoody nor Mr. O'Brien intend to call any starred amendments in morning or afternoon sittings. Adequate notice of amendments must be given and the Chair will reflect that.
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following Order, namely: Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clauses 2 to 20; Schedule 2; Clauses 21 to 28; Schedules 3 and 4; Clause 29 to 33; Schedule 5; Clauses 34 to 37; Schedule 6; Clauses 38 to 69; Schedule 7; Clauses 70 to 82; Schedule 8; Clause 83; Schedule 9; Clauses 84 to 94; Schedule 10; Clauses 95 to 107; Schedule 11; Clauses 108 to 141; Schedule 12; Clauses 142 to 175; Schedule 13; Clauses 176 to 197; Schedule 14; Clauses 198 to 295; Schedule 15; Clauses 296 to 367; Schedules 16 and 17; new Clauses; new Schedules--[Mr. Milburn.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall not detain the Committee much longer, except to respond to some of the Chief Secretary's reassurances and touch on how best to order the amendments. If the Chief Secretary had sought to change the sequential order of the Bill, that would have needed explanation. However, I understand that we are going to move through the Bill as printed.
<P>
I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for some of his mildly reassuring remarks, but I found some of his other comments alarming. The concept of wrongdoers having rights is clearly not one with which the Labour party is familiar. I hesitate to give legal advice, but even prisoners--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are supposed to be debating the order of consideration motion. It is a very narrow motion and I would be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman would relate his remarks to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am going to suggest that we bring forward any matters in the Bill that relate to the European convention on human rights. If people accused of serious crimes are denied adequate rights, that is seriously at variance with the European convention. I assume that the Chief Secretary was engaging in relatively good-humoured banter, so I shall not pursue the issue. I am content with the motion.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following Order, namely: Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clauses 2 to 20; Schedule 2; Clauses 21 to 28; Schedules 3 and 4; Clauses 29 to 33; Schedule 5; Clauses 34 to 37; Schedule 6; Clauses 38 to 69; Schedule 7; Clauses 70 to 82; Schedule 8; Clause 83; Schedule 9; Clauses 84 to 94; Schedule 10; Clauses 95 to 107; Schedule 11; Clauses 108 to 141; Schedule 12; Clauses 142 to 175; Schedule 13; Clauses 176 to 197; Schedule 14; Clauses 198 to 295; Schedule 15; Clauses 296 to 367; Schedules 16 and 17; new Clauses; new Schedules.
