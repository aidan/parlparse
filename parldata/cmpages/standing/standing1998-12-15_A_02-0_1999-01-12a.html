<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</b> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, if proceedings on the Water Industry Bill are not completed 
at this day's sittings, the Committee do meet on Thursday 14 January 
at Nine o'clock and Four o'clock.</font></ul>
<P>
Before Christmas I tabled a motion to cover today's 
sittings. It did not cover further sittings because on
16 December the House of Commons was to consider a 
Modernisation Committee report that suggested that 
Standing Committees meet earlier on Thursdays and not 
at the customary time.
<P>
As members of the Committee will know, that report 
was agreed and, in line with its recommendations, today's 
sittings motion suggests that we sit from 9 am on 
Thursday. That recommendation has been agreed through 
the usual channels. [Interruption.] I am glad that such an 
announcement has produced such hilarity and joy among 
all quarters. It has been agreed that we should complete 
consideration of the Bill on Thursday and, to ensure that 
we have sufficient time to enable us to do so, I propose 
that we meet from 4 pm on Thursday rather than the usual 
time of 4.30 pm.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Prohibition of use of limiting devices</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentar Under-Secretary of State for the </B><P>
Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan 
Meale): We have talked before about how important 
water is in terms of personal health and hygiene, and 
public health. When we met before Christmas, my right 
honourable Friend the Minister for the Environment 
explained our approach to the disconnection of water 
supply to domestic and other vulnerable premises. Several 
water companies are either considering or, in some 
instances, actually carrying out, the replacement of cut-off 
systems in budget payment units with trickle valves. They 
are doing so in the light of the court cases banning 
disconnecting budget payment units. The Bill will outlaw 
household disconnection.



<P>
We believe that the prohibition on domestic 
disconnection is vital to protect health and hygiene. 
Anyone who agrees with that statement must agree also 
that devices which reduce the flow of water available for 
use to such a small trickle that it can take up to a quarter 
of an hour to fill the kitchen sink to enable washing up to 
be done should be banned, too. Indeed, the hon. Member 
for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) accepted on Second 
Reading that, if we were to ban disconnections, we must 
also ban limiting devices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Donald Gorrie (Edinburgh, West):</B> Like other 
members of the Committee, I received a briefing from the 
Chartered Institute on Environmental Health that 
contained a couple of points that are worth considering in 
connection with the clause. It feels that the wording of the 
clause is unsound in that proposed section 63A(1) states 
that a water undertaker is guilty if it uses a limiting device
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with the intention of enforcing payment of charges"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The institute points out that it is difficult to prove such an 
intention and that it would be possible for an undertaker 
to produce a spacious, but perhaps legally convincing, 
argument that that was not the intention of such action. 
Does the Minister consider that the institute's point has 
any merit and, if so, will be reconsider the wording of 
the provision?
<P>
Furthermore, proposed section 63A(2)(b) states that 
the apparatus
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is designed to restrict the use which may be made of water"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The institute does not think that that is the correct 
wording, because it restricts amount rather than use. I am 
not an expert, but those seem to be two sensible points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> We are convinced that the wording is 
correct as it stands, but it has been valuable that the hon. 
Gentleman raised those two definitions in terms of what 
the Bill should do. We are sympathetic to his objectives, 
but are confident that the clause would fulfil them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> I ask the 
Minister for some information and advice, rather than 
express an opinion. Some consumers, because of their 
financial circumstances, like the idea of pre-payments for 
water, as they may already use such payments for 
electricity, gas and other essential services. How might 
the Government try to help such people? I understand that 
the Bill will not allow pre-payment schemes, and might 
cause such people financial hardship. I accept that such 
people constitute a very small minority of the population, 
but they may prefer such a scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. 
Many low-income consumers with budgetary difficulties 
want some consistency and regularity in their financial 
arrangements. The Government do not want to undermine 
such people and want to assist when we can.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware that budget payment 
units as currently constituted were rejected in the High 
Court because they are disconnecting, or, in the parlance, 
self-disconnecting, which leads to a stoppage of the water 
supply. If we can find alternative mechanisms that assist 
with budgeting and do not lead to such disconnection, we 
would certainly be sympathetic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I notice that the Minister said "If we can 
find"	. What work has he and his officials been doing to 
try to find ideas? I accept that it is a horrendously 
complicated problem, given the contents of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is not for the Government to 
undertake such research. We encourage water companies 
to think of new and imaginative tariffs, new financial 
arrangements and methods of payment that will benefit 
and make it easier for consumers. Under clause 4, the 
Director General of Water Services must accept such 
proposals, but we strongly encourage them. I hope that 
water companies are carefully investigating the matter.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.




<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Undertakers to charge in accordance with charges schemes</center></H4>


<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Charges schemes will be the mechanism 
for delivering many of the important new protections for 
water consumers included in the Bill. In particular, under 
clause 5, the Secretary of State will have powers to 
specify protection to be given to vulnerable customers 
with high essential water use living in properties with 
water meters. It is important that the new protections and 
improved customer choice are not undermined by large 
numbers of customers being charged on the basis of 
agreements. The clause will ensure that domestic 
consumers are charged on the basis of a charging scheme. 
It will ensure also that everyone knows the system of 
tariffs under which he or she is charged, and provide 
greater consistency in charging arrangements.
<P>
We are aware that there are some, historic agreements 
between water companies and domestic consumers that 
we do not want to disturb. The clause gives scope for 
agreements to be entered into covering premises that are 
not dwellings if water companies and non-domestic 
customers want to do so. The clause therefore provides 
important protection, while leaving the opportunity for 
agreements where they are commercially attractive.
I therefore urge that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Making and approval of charges schemes</center></H4>

and insert

<P>

<B>Mr Letwin:</B> I begin, Mr. Atkinson, by wishing you a 
happy new year. I shall restrict my remarks mainly to 
amendments Nos. 26 and 22. My hon. Friend the Member 
for West Chelmsford may seek to catch your eye to speak 
to some of the other amendments in the group, and our 
friends from the Liberal Democrats may well want to say 
something about amendment No. 2.
<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 26 and 22 is twofold. 
Amendment No. 26 is intended to modify and somewhat 
tone down the rather aggressive language of clause 4 as 
drafted. Amendment No. 22, on the other hand, is a 
substantive amendment intended to alter the character of 
the powers given to the director. I shall speak first to 
amendment No. 22.
<P>
The Minister or his colleagues on his behalf has 
taken some trouble in designing lines 14 to 17 of page 3 
to restrict the director's power, at least in respect of his 
intent. In passing, I note that it is not unprecedented but 
odd to restrict the director's power not absolutely but in 
his intent. Nevertheless, that is what those lines do they 
prevent the director from having the purpose in acting of 
limiting undertakers' total revenues. We have no intrinsic 
quarrel with that; it is a perfectly reasonable measure to 
make clause 4 conform with the price cap.
<P>
However, there is a problem, which is economic.
I know that the main purpose of the Bill is not economic 
but social. Nevertheless, it ought to be our purpose as 
legislators to ensure that when social considerations are 
to the fore, economic considerations are not forgotten.
I hope to persuade even the Minister that there is a 
problem if not today, later.



<P>
Clause 4, together with clause 5, which is the subject 
of other amendments in the group, is intended to give the 
director the power to alter the balance of charges. That is 
fine in principle, if it does not affect total revenues 
which is the purpose of lines 14 to 17. However, altering 
the balance of charges has another possible effect besides 
that of affecting total revenues. It may also move revenues 
and costs out of line. It is a signal failing of most utilities' 
regulation in this country that it does not pay adequate 
attention to the cost-reflectiveness of charges. It is 
particularly true in the water industry that the 
understanding of genuine resource costs and their 
matching to charges is at a very early stage one might 
almost say that they were in their infancy. Indeed, if the 
clause is accepted, the infant stands in severe danger of 
early abortion.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her </B><P>
Majesty's Household): Oh dear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry if Labour Members think that 
that is a slightly infelicitous metaphor; perhaps I should 
talk in terms of an early conception that is in danger of 
being obliterated.
<P>
The problem is that if there is no relationship between 
prices and costs, there are no normal economic incentives. 
There is no incentive on the water companies or their 
customers to match the economic preferences of 
individuals. If it were suggested that huge discrepancies 
between cost and price could be forced on any other 
industry through administrative action in this case, by 
the director the Government would leap to the Dispatch 
Box, filled with new Labour fervour for the purity of 
market economics, to argue that something needed to be 
done. I cannot give the Committee chapter and verse, but 
I am sure that I have heard Ministers speak in those terms 
in relation to other industries in the past 18 months.
<P>
In clause 4, however, the director is given powers under 
the Secretary of State's aegis to interfere with the balance 
of the charges. No restriction is made on the scope of 
those powers in terms of forcing prices out of line with 
costs. The modest intent behind amendment No. 22 is to 
introduce such a restriction. It does not introduce an undue 
restriction and is not drafted with that intent. It is not 
intended to undercut the basic ideas behind clauses 4 and 
5. It is, however, intended to ensure that lines 14 to 17 are 
complemented by a restriction that would prevent highly 
non-cost-reflective charging.
<P>
We have tried carefully to mirror the slightly odd way 
of going about business in lines 14 to 17. We have 
described not an absolute limitation, but a limitation on 
the director's purpose. We picked up the idea from lines 
14 to 17 of limiting the purpose with which the director 
can act rather than limiting his actions absolutely. We do 
that with some reluctance because lines 14 to 17 are 
slightly odd in that respect. We have, however, tried to 
parallel the Minister's way of going about matters to 
maximise our chances of making the amendment 
acceptable to him.
<P>
Amendment No. 26, by contrast, is a probing 
amendment. It is intended to suggest to the Minister that 
the drafting of paragraph (6), (7) and (8) is a little 
aggressive a matter of take and no give. In it, we suggest 
a more consultative relationship between the director and 
the undertaking. It would be materially helpful to the 
Committee if the Minister could give us some guidance 
about how he sees the operation of clause 4. He might be 
able to give us sufficient assurances that the clause will be 
more consultative in practice than the drafting suggests. In 
that case, we will have fulfilled our purpose in tabling 
amendment No. 26.



<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake (Carshalton and Wallington):</B> I shall 
confine my remarks to amendment No. 2, which I may 
seek to press later. The amendment is simple, and would 
introduce into the Bill and into the water industry the 
concept of sustainable development, which is missing 
from current legislation. The hon. Member for West 
Dorset (Mr. Letwin) said that although the Bill principally 
concerns social matters, it also involves economic 
considerations. Environmental factors should also be 
taken into account. Water is a natural resource that needs 
to be nurtured and preserved. Without clean water 
supplies, sustainable development cannot occur. Such 
problems are already arising in many areas where a strong 
demand for housing has caused the lack of adequate 
water supply.
<P>
I hope that Labour Members will do a little more than 
play lip service to the concept of sustainable development 
and support the amendment. Before the Christmas recess, 
the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton) 
attempted to make a speech about sustainable 
development. I hope that the amendment will enable her 
to speak about it today, and I look forward to her support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The amendments deal mainly with
clause 4, but overlap into clause 5. The Opposition have 
serious reservations about this part of the Bill. We believe 
that the powers contained in the clauses are a throwback 
to a bygone age that we though that Britain had long 
since left.
<P>
The Government are seeking in two specific ways to 
interfere in the marketplace. The Bill would give the 
Secretary of State and the regulator enhanced powers of 
interference. We have serious misgivings about that. Until 
now, all of the regulated industries have enjoyed an 
independent regulator. When privatisation occurred, 
primary legislation gave such regulators powers and 
responsibilities to enable them to monitor the industries, 
to investigate charging policies and to protect customers. 
The powers were also intended to safeguard the overall 
interests of the utilities in developing from nationalised 
and monolithic state industries as they entered the private 
sector and found their feet as private companies. The 
Conservative Government set up the regulators as a 
protection measure. We gave them independence in the 
primary legislation that laid down their duties and 
responsibilities.
<P>
The Government are seeking seriously to erode the 
principle of the independence of the regulatory system. 
The Opposition find that worrying, especially because the 
Secretary of State is taking powers of direction that will 
enable him to interfere with the industry and with 
pricing policy.
<P>
I accept that clause 4 states that the Secretary of State's 
power to make regulations under clause 5 cannot be used 
to limit
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the total revenues of relevant undertakers from charges fixed by or 
in accordance with charges schemes."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Notwithstanding that provision, however, the Bill gives 
the Secretary of State power socially to engineer charging 
policies while working within that prescribed ambit. On 
Second Reading, Conservative Members raised the 
problem that the Government could use these powers, if 
the Secretary of State so wished, to start placing more 
of a financial burden on water customers to alleviate the 
financial responsibilities of the Department of Social 
Security. It is worrying that a Secretary of State might, at 
some point, be tempted to use such powers.
<P>
The amendments that Conservative Members have 
tabled would check the powers that the Bill extends to the 
Secretary of State. We should like the powers to be taken 
out of the Bill altogether. However, we are realistic 
enough to realise, in terms of the sheer mathematics of 
the Committee, that our wishes will not come true in a 
month of Sundays. That is one of the downsides of 
opposition. The Government have no intention even of 
entertaining the idea of rethinking the issue.
<P>
Our responsibility is to try to influence the Government 
to think again and to moderate their rather nasty 
proposals. That, as my hon. Friend the Member for West 
Dorset said, is the purpose of our amendments. The 
powers that are to be given to the Secretary of State are 
wrong. We hope that the Government are prepared to 
listen to use and to accept the amendments, which are not 
intended to take away entirely the Secretary of State's 
proposed powers, but to moderate them in a responsible 
way to enhance the operation of the proposed legislation.



<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that I can give the hon. 
Gentleman some encouragement. I assure him that we are 
an extremely reasonable, logical and consumer-friendly 
Government. We have no intention of forcing through 
unnecessary powers in defiance of market economics, 
which seemed to be the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's 
objection.
<P>
I should like to spell out the philosophy behind
clause 4 before turning to the amendments. I shall discuss 
amendment No. 2 first, because it is rather different from 
the others, and then those which seek to limit the powers 
to be made available to the Secretary of State. As 
Opposition Members have made clear, the amendments 
propose a number of constraints on the director general's 
powers in relation to charging schemes and, in the case 
of amendment No. 27, on the Secretary of State's powers 
to make regulations.
<P>
The Labour party's manifesto made it clear that the 
Government would pursue tough and efficient regulation 
in the interests of the consumer and the environment 
that we would retain the existing structure but would also, 
with good reason, strengthen the regulatory system. We 
want customers to enjoy a fair and affordable water 
charging system, which protects public health at the same 
time as ensuring that water supplies are used in a 
sustainable way to protect the aquatic habitat. I take it that 
all members of the Committee are in agreement with those 
broad philosophic principles. In order to secure such a 
scheme, a mechanism is needed that can provide 
assurances that water charges will be properly regulated.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have hardly started, but I am happy to 
give way in the interests of friendly relations in the 
Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He said, in 
effect, that the powers are being taken to ensure proper 
pricing policies in the water industry. Will he tell the 
Committee in what way he feels that the current pricing 
policy is not proper?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to 
proceed, I shall make that clear. There is a move towards 
a metering system, and about 14 per cent. of households, 
as opposed to commercial premises, are now metered. 
That is increasing by 1, 2 or 3 per cent. a year and the 
process may, as a result of the Bill, accelerate slightly. 
Consumers who are compulsorily metered if they move 
into new houses where there is no rateable value, for 
example, or if, through no fault of their own, they have a 
medical need, are elderly and incontinent, require medical 
dialysis or are relatively poor with many children in the 
family could find themselves disadvantaged under the 
current metering system. One of the provisions in the Bill 
is to protect such customers.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to 
proceed, I think that he will understand better the 
proposed general framework.
<P>
We are proposing to formalise the involvement of the 
director general in determining charges schemes. He 
already has certain opportunities to influence these 
schemes. They are on an informal footing, and we are 
seeking to make matters clearer. That is important, not 
only in relation to matters which are currently covered by 
charges schemes but to deliver important elements of the 
policy outlined in the Bill. The example that I have given, 
in which companies will be allowed to fit meters after 
they have been requested, will be set out in charges 
schemes. A household may request the installation of a 
meter, but there is at present no limit on the time scale 
within which it will be installed. Charges schemes must 
therefore be approved by the regulator to ensure that water 
companies offer customers a good service in this and 
other areas. That is basically the philosophy.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 is somewhat different from the 
others. I have a good deal of sympathy with it, but I hope 
that I can persuade the hon. Member for Carshalton and 
Wallington (Mr. Brake) that we are already taking into 
account the issue that it raises, and that the amendment is 
not the best way to introduce the element of concern for 
sustainable development. There is a better way, which we 
are pursuing.
<P>
The amendment would introduce a duty on the 
regulator to exercise the new powers that the Bill would 
give him in approving charges schemes with the objective 
of achieving sustainable development. Let me make it 
clear, if the hon. Gentleman doubts it, that the 
Government are committed to sustainable development.
I do not know whether the Brundtland definition of 1987 
is the best one, but it is a very good one. It is that this 
generation should pursue its own needs in a manner which 
does not compromise the capacity of future generations to 
meet their needs. In other words, we should not 
over-pollute, nor should we use our material resources 
excessively in a way which will leave future generations 
in a worse situation.
<P>
We are concerned to ensure that in pursuing 
development now we do not allow the environment to be 
damaged so that future generations will not be able to 
enjoy it and will as a result have a lower quality of life. 
Again, that is agreed the question is how best to 
implement it.



<P>
The director general is already under a duty to consider 
the natural and built environment when he is formulating 
or considering any proposal relating to water companies' 
functions. Last year, the United Kingdom round table on 
sustainable development recommended that the economic 
regulators should have a duty to promote sustainable 
development. We agree that the regulators should be 
placed under a duty to have regard to statutory guidance 
on social and environmental objectives in the exercise of 
their statutory functions. However, it is for Ministers, 
rather than economic regulators, to set out social and 
environmental policies. That includes making clear what 
the objectives behind the policies are, and how they relate 
to the regulators' current functions.
<P>
Many members of the Committee will be aware that we 
are currently reviewing the operation of utility regulation. 
We confirmed in the White Paper, "A Fair Deal for 
Consumers"	, which we issued a few months ago, that we 
intend to introduce legislation under which Ministers will 
issue statutory guidance on social and environmental 
objectives. Regulators will be under a statutory duty to 
have regard to such guidance.
<P>
I begin to part company with amendment No. 2 here, 
because we believe indeed, it is because we so strongly 
believe this that we want to go much further that that 
statutory duty should be placed on all regulators and not 
only on the Director General of Water Services. We 
further believe that it should apply to all the regulator's 
duties, not only to the new functions that he will gain 
under the Bill. Thus, I hope and believe that the 
Government will be able to set up a framework for 
achieving sustainable development consistently and 
across the board in a way in which an economic regulator 
would not be able to achieve. The Government will also 
be able to clarify how the new duties relate to the 
regulator's other functions.
<P>
I hope that I can carry the hon. Member for Carshalton 
and Wallington with me. We believe in an integrated 
approach to sustainable development which I am sure is 
the intention behind the hon. Gentleman's amendment 
throughout utility regulation. We think that such an 
approach offers the right way forward in protecting the 
environment for people's current and future well-being. It 
must therefore be right to wait for an opportunity to make 
comprehensive provision for statutory guidance on social 
and environmental objectives which we shall certainly 
do rather than accepting this narrowly defined 
amendment now. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be 
satisfied with that explanation. We accept the underlying 
purpose of the amendment, but we believe that it would 
be best incorporated in a wider package, which I hope 
will satisfy him even more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Will the Minister indicate the time scale 
for the announcement of that integrated approach?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We are consulting on our sustainable 
development strategy and propose to come forward with 
a draft strategy very soon, by which I mean certainly in 
the next few months. We hope to produce a final strategy 
as quickly as we can. It would be nice to think that that 
will happen before the end of the year, as I would prefer, 
but these things often take a bit longer. It may well be 
early next year. However, that is the time scale. I am not 
talking about the wide open future before the next 
election. We are working extremely hard to prepare 
statutory guidance within the framework of a broad 
sustainable development strategy.
<P>
I turn to the comments of the hon. Minister for 
[Interruption.] West Dorset. I apologise for not knowing 
his constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The right hon. Gentleman might have 
heard of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am surprised that it was not won by 
Labour at the last election, but there is always another one 
to come.



<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset introduced his 
amendments in his usual felicitous way, to use his own 
word. In fact, he did it in the manner in which he usually 
makes speeches with feline delicacy. I take his general 
point.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 proposes that the director should 
not use his powers over charges schemes substantially to 
affect the extent to which charges reflect water company 
costs. I take it that the amendment addresses the total 
revenue to costs position of a company, rather than 
focusing on the charges of the individual customer. From 
what the hon. Gentleman said, he is clearly concerned 
with the former.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It seems that I did not make myself plain. 
In any event, that would be the effect of subsection (3) 
(9), lines 14 to 17.
<P>
I moved the amendment precisely to talk about 
restricting the director's scope of action in relation to 
particular charges, to ensure that they are individually 
cost reflective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am grateful for that. The hon. 
Gentleman rightly referred to subsection (3) (9) lines 14 
to 17 several times, which, as I am sure he recognises, 
prevents the director from using his powers to drive down 
the total revenue of a company. That is obviously an 
important safeguard. Thus, the director will not be able to 
manipulate charges schemes with a view to affecting the 
extent to which a company's total revenue reflects its total 
costs. The director already undertakes a detailed and 
careful assessment of each company's costs and revenues 
when he sets price limits in his periodic reviews. Indeed, 
the objective of the periodic review we are currently in 
the middle of one, as the hon. Gentleman will know is 
to set price limits that reflect the director's best 
assessment of total costs. That process will continue and 
will not be affected by his new powers over charges 
schemes.
<P>
The concern of the hon. Member for West Dorset 
might, however, be different. If the purpose of the 
amendment is to ensure that each individual customer's 
charges are cost reflective, I would simply disagree with 
it. It implies that account should not be taken of ability to 
pay when developing charges schemes. Ability to pay is, 
however, an important principle, which must play some 
role in the water charging system. Significant 
environmental problems associated with water companies 
might develop, such as continuous drought that is an 
odd thing to say when we have just had the wettest year 
for 150 years, but who can say what this year or next year 
will hold? In such situations, it is conceivable that charges 
might need to be set to encourage savings in demand for 
inessential water use. The amendment might prevent the 
introduction of tariffs to achieve that aim. I am sure that 
the hon. Gentleman does not intend that to be the result, 
but we believe that it would be.
<P>
I accept that there is a place for reflecting costs in water 
charges. We do not, however, want the director to be 
bound by cost recovery as an absolute principle when 
implementing the Government's social and environmental 
policies. As in so much of the Bill, it is a question of 
striking a balance, and I hope that we have the balance 
right.
<P>
The hon. Members for West Dorset and for West 
Chelmsford went on to speak about amendment No. 26, 
which links with amendment No. 27. As has been said, 
amendment No. 27 relates to clause 5, but the spirit 
behind it is consistent with amendment No. 26. Perhaps, 
therefore, I can reply by giving the Government's view of 
both amendments.



<P>
We have made it clear that we propose particularly to 
use clause 5 to specify vulnerable groups of people with 
essential high water use who should be given protection 
when faced with the prospect of a measured bill exactly 
as I have suggested. Under amendment No. 27, it would 
not be possible to give such customers any assurance that 
they would be protected from hardship.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The Secretary of State could provide 
guidance, but it would be for water companies to 
determine the extent to which they followed that advice. 
There could be a confusing pattern of entitlement to 
protection, with different companies taking different 
views about eligibility and the nature of protection. Some 
companies might choose to offer no assistance at all to 
such customers. Such a result would not be acceptable.
<P>
The provisions in the Bill are not simply motivated by 
the wish to protect consumers. The amendment would not 
be in the interests of water companies either. In some 
cases, the Government will involve themselves in 
charging matters. We do not intend to be heavy handed 
or bureaucratic I will not say old Labourish because I 
am sure that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford will 
say it for me. We are not going back to the practices of 
the 1940s and 1950s 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The 1970s?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> No. We are doing nothing of the kind. 
For certain purposes, however, it is necessary to specify. 
That is better for the water companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, 
who is being very user friendly. Why is he dissatisfied 
with the way in which the regulator currently administers 
his functions?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not commenting on the way in 
which the director general currently undertakes his 
functions. I was saying that if we wish to protect specific 
consumers such as those with medical needs, large 
families or those on low incomes, it is necessary to 
provide more than the director general's capacity to give 
guidance. The Secretary of State must be able to ensure 
the protection of such consumers. I am not saying that 
there is present failure. If the extension of metering begins 
to gather pace, many more people will be drawn into the 
net, some of whom could be disadvantaged. The extra 
rights and powers are necessary for their protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I want to clear up one point: why does it 
have to be the Secretary of State? Why cannot the 
regulator take action on his own, without interference or 
input from the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The provision is necessary because the 
Government need the ability to specify the contents of 
social and environmental policy. It is not limited to the 
specific categories of consumers to which I referred. The 
Government think it important that the director general is 
the agent. He has a greater deal of freedom to encourage 
water companies to draw up new and innovative tariffs. It 
is the Government, however, who lay down social and 
environmental policies. We need the capacity to specify 
the policies that we wish the director general to follow.



<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will not the Minister accept that the 
regulator, is, by definition, an independent person? The 
Secretary of State is a highly political animal, whoever 
he is, and to whichever political party he belongs. Why 
introduce political interference when the regulator could
 carry out the function of seeking to protect the less well 
off and the other consumers that the Minister mentioned? 
Why is the political interference of the Secretary of State 
necessary? Why do not the Government trust the regulator 
to do a decent job on customers' behalf?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman 
was quite listening. It is not a question of distrusting the 
director general. However it is not appropriate for him to 
decide social and environmental policies. He should deal 
with pricing policy, the relationship between revenues and 
costs, economic efficiency, better economic performance, 
new innovative tariffs and so on. That is his role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Perhaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> May I just ask one question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In a moment.
<P>
Social policies and environmental objectives are a 
completely different ambit. It is not right to require 
someone with an almost exclusive concern for dealing 
with economic factors to at the same time juggle other 
factors that are a matter of judgment and discretion. 
Judgment and discretion are exactly what the Government 
are in power to use to lay down the framework, the basic 
rules, the fundamental principles and interaction between 
them. The powers will enable the director general to do 
that in a manner that meets Government policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister said several times that he is 
not returning to the 1940s or 1950s. However, I have 
brought him to the 1970s. The policy that he is describing 
is highly interventionist. I was, perhaps, being kind by 
mentioning the 1970s: the approach is a throwback to 
1940s and 1950s interventionism.
<P>
The Minister said that it was not for the regulator to 
take decisions per se on social issues and the environment. 
He will correct me if I am wrong, but surely the regulator 
currently determines environmental issues. The 
environment has been a significant part of charging policy 
during the past eight or nine years because of the 
investment needed to improve the environment and 
infrastructure. The regulator is already taking decisions 
based largely on environment grounds. In that respect, the 
Minister's argument does not hold water.



<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is not quite like that. Under the 
periodic review, the Government give their advice and 
guidance to the director general as to the environmental 
objectives to be achieved. The director general takes 
account of that guidance in determining pricing policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Exactly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Yes, but the point that the hon. 
Gentleman seems to be missing is that it is the 
Government who determine what those environmental 
objectives shall be. It is the Government who specify the 
range of environmental objectives and the extent to which 
they are to be pursued, taking account of the approximate 
overall cost. The Government then give that guidance to 
the director general and it is up to him to determine, with 
the water companies, the pricing policy that will deliver 
those objectives. What I have said is entirely consistent 
with that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned interventionism. We do 
not take the view that all interventionism is wrong quite 
the reverse. There are social and environmental objectives 
that need to influence the market process and be infused 
into it. We do not take the view of a previous Thatcherite 
Government that there is no such thing as society, that 
social and environmental considerations do not apply and 
that the market shall rule supreme over everything. We 
think that there is a measure of balance. The decision at 
the election means a rather different policy that 
combines without overriding, but taking into account 
the balance between the social and the environmental as 
well as the economic.
<P>
The point that I was trying to make about 10 minutes 
ago is that I think that accepting our proposal will be for 
the benefit of the water companies because it would 
operate in a very transparent way. If, as the hon. 
Gentleman proposes, the matter is left to the director 
general, he presumably would engage in private 
calculations to determine how that balance should be 
created, and would produce the final decision. Is it not 
better that the interventionist criteria the social and 
environmental objectives should be specifically and 
openly spelt out? In that way, everyone is aware of 
them not only the director general, but the water 
companies and the public. It will then be for the director 
general to weave those objectives into the economic 
process of price fixing.
<P>
Clause 5 will enable the industry to work with a clearly 
understood framework of essential requirements. By 
contrast, the amendment would create the risk of greater 
uncertainty as companies sought to interpret the 
non-binding guidance and set out plans in the light of 
those interpretations. Therefore, I think it vital for the 
Secretary of State to have regulation-making powers 
regarding charges schemes which back up the director 
general's powers to approve those schemes.
<P>
I should also like to make it clear that this is not a 
throwback to a bygone era. Although I have so far 
emphasised the importance of having the appropriate 
regulatory mechanism to protect consumers, that does not 
mean that the arrangements should be accompanied by 
any form of rigid central control or inflexible bureaucracy. 
Given their position, the water companies should be well 
placed to understand the needs of their local customers 
and to develop tariffs which meet the needs of those, 
whom the hon. Member for West Chelmsford mentioned 
a moment ago, who want assistance with budgeting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am constantly being interrupted in 
mediis rebus. It would be better for me to say what I want 
to, and then the hon. Gentleman can intervene.
<P>
Following consultation on water charging in England 
and Wales, the Government indicated that the prime 
responsibility for developing new tariffs should lie with 
water companies, and they have been innovative. Some 
water companies have done very well in drawing up new 
proposals for charging that skilfully meet a number of 
objectives. I want to encourage them to draw up such 
tariffs, which meet the needs of customers. I am anxious 
to ensure that the new arrangements, which, as I said, 
introduce important protection for consumers, should not 
stifle the initiative that has been shown by some water 
companies in their charging arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden):</B> I have listened 
carefully to what the Minister has been saying. He helped 
me to understand his perception of the regulator, but it 
troubles me that he is pessimistic about the ability of the 
regulator to build in the sort of criteria that the Government 
want. At the outset, he talked about the customer-friendly, 
consumer-friendly nature of the Government's initiatives, 
but I have not yet heard him specifically mention a process 
of consultation with existing customer service committees. 
Because of his pessimism about the regulator's ability to 
deliver, he maintains that giving the Secretary of State 
additional powers will remove uncertainty. Does he accept 
that customer service committees are concerned that there 
is no statutory requirement on the Secretary of State to 
consult them on the changes, which leaves them in a less 
certain position.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Lady is not right to say that 
there is no provision for consultation. We are reflecting 
the structure that we inherited in the Water Act 1989, the 
water privatisation Act, which provides for consultation 
we support that.



<P>
When we approached the periodic review, my right 
hon. Friend the Secretary of State received advice from 
many of the customer service committees on what 
guidance we should offer the director general about the 
balance between reducing prices and increasing 
investment to achieve environmental objectives. I held a 
number of meetings with customer service committees 
before the current periodic review they came to the 
Department and to meetings at which I spoke, and lobbied 
me very hard. I was in no doubt about what they believed, 
and they were able to feed their views into the process. 
They are listened to. Of course, it is always difficult when 
one is lobbied from two directions with entirely different 
proposals. In the end, one has to decide which proposal is 
more right because there is advantage in both and 
what is the balance between the two.
<P>
It is not right to say that consumers are not involved in 
that process. Once the Government have given their 
statutory guidance their advice to the director general, 
he will again consult the customer services committees. 
So they are written into the process.
<P>
I shall conclude by speaking to amendment No. 28.
I hesitate slightly to do so, because it raises a contentious 
issue that no member of the Committee has yet raised, but 
one that is so important that it is right to draw it to the 
Committee's attention. Amendment No. 28 would provide
 for regulations to cover a number of issues it would 
move in the other direction from that of amendments
Nos. 26 and 22. It mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the requirements of different customers and regional variations and 
conservation and efficiency initiatives.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall briefly spell out how we plan to address those 
issues, so that the Committee has a clearer understanding 
of the Government's aims.
<P>
The clause already provides scope for regulations to be 
laid covering the requirements of different customers in a 
wide range of circumstances, and I do not believe that any 
further reference to that is necessary. I also recognise that 
water charges can have an important role in conservation 
and promoting water efficiency for example, by helping 
to manage water use at times of peak demand. There are 
many other ways in which we are helping to encourage 
conservation and water efficiency for example, the 
tough leakage targets that we set after the initial water 
summit, which aim for a 20 per cent. reduction in leakage 
in England and Wales during the first two years of the 
Government. Our document, "Raising the Quality"	, gave 
guidance to the Director General of Water Services that 
we attach great importance to the protection of all sites 
of special scientific interest that are being damaged by 
abstraction or discharges.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment refers also to regional variations in 
charges, which is a very important issue. The differences 
in charges that are faced by those in different regions are 
highly sensitive not least, as I am sure that Liberal 
Democrat Members know, in the south-west. For 
example, under the price limits set since 1994, average 
charges in the south-west are now more than 40 per cent. 
higher than those across the country as a whole. That issue 
must be dealt with. Proposals have been put forward for 
the establishment of a water quality fund or similar 
mechanism to equalise prices across England and Wales, 
which would be funded either from general taxes or from 
a levy on water bills. The Government do not believe that 
that is the right way forward. The "polluter pays"	 
principle means that it is right for customers to meet the 
costs of necessary works in their own area, and we do 
not propose to depart from that principle. Linking bills 
to investment and service in water companies' areas also 
increases the accountability of those companies and 
provides a strong incentive to improve their performance 
and reduce costs.



<P>
That does not mean that the Government plan to stand 
by and do nothing while regional price differences 
increase, and I shall spell out how we intend to tackle 
things. When we provided guidance to the director general 
on the quality and environmental objectives to be 
achieved over the next periodic review of 2000-05, we 
made it clear that we shall want to ensure that detailed 
obligations at company level are defined in a way that 
avoids unacceptable impacts on water prices in different 
parts of England and Wales and reflects local priorities. 
The Office of Water Services has been obtaining further 
detailed information from companies on the investment 
that is needed to meet quality and environmental 
objectives. That information must also be considered by 
the quality regulators: the Environment Agency and the 
drinking water inspectorate. Ministers can then consider 
the detailed programmes at company level to ensure that 
they do not lead to unacceptable implications for bills. 
The proposed price limits and the extent of companies' 
investment programmes will be announced in due course 
in the context of the current periodic review. That is how 
the Government will try to deal with the issue, and it is 
important in terms of amendment No. 28 to emphasise 
that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray (North Wiltshire):</B> I think that 
members of the Committee will agree that the "polluter 
pays"	 principle dictates that there will be regional price 
differences. The people on whom those regional 
variations bear down particularly harshly are those on 
income support, which includes a standard water element. 
Will the Government consider introducing regional 
variations in income support so that the poorest people in 
Britain, for example those who live in the south-west, 
would be given a larger amount of income support to pay 
their water bill than those in, for example, London, where 
the price of water is particularly low?
<P>
The Minister mentioned the Liberal Democrats with 
regard to the south-west. He will, of course, know that the 
party with the largest number of Members of Parliament 
in the south-west is the Conservative party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am glad to know that there are still 
some deep niches in the country in which the 
Conservative party still survives.
<P>
I give the hon. Gentleman full marks for persistence on 
the point that he raised, because I recall that he raised 
a similar one when I made my first appearance in the 
Environmental Audit Select Committee a year ago. He 
was obviously not satisfied with the explanation that I 
gave at that time, but all that I can do now is to repeat it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North 
Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) cut the right hon. Gentleman off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is true. He did so on the grounds 
that this was straying considerably from the point. Perhaps 
under this Chairman, on this Bill, it will be possible to 
explore that matter a little further.
<P>
My response is that it would be impossible to have 
regional variations in elements of the constituent parts of 
income support. Not only would there be arbitrary 
boundaries between one region and another, but the sheer 
complications in calculating social security when 10 
million to 12 million people, including children and older 
people, are still dependent on income support would make 
it so unwieldy and cumbersome that I do not believe that 
such a system would work. I take the point of the hon. 
Member for North Wiltshire we need to do something 
about it but I believe that our proposal is better than his.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I have a small correction to what the right 
hon. Gentleman has just said. Does he agree that council 
tax benefit and housing benefit are regionally variable, 
with precisely the difficulties of border problems and 
administration that he described? If we made income 
support for water charges variable according to region, it 
would be precisely the same as making council tax benefit 
and housing benefit regionally variable.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister rises, I 
should say that although I am grateful that the Chairman 
has a reputation for liberalism, I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman and the Minister will not tax it too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am not sure that tax is the appropriate 
term, given that we are talking about housing benefit, but I 
accept that this matter is not to be pursued, Mr. Atkinson. 
Perhaps I could just say that of course we accept that for 
a benefit such as housing benefit, which must reflect 
housing conditions that vary limitlessly, even within a 
small area, it is necessary to make individual calculations. 
However, with regard to access to the water supply, only 
one region the south-west is significantly out of kilter 
with and more disadvantaged than other regions. I do not 
believe that it would be right to change the whole system 
simply to accommodate those in the south-west in regard 
to their access to an unchanging commodity, namely, 
water.
<P>
I have tried to be as helpful as possible in setting out 
what we are doing to address the issues that the 
amendment flags up. I shall not attempt to encapsulate 
those measures because I have discussed them all in 
sufficient detail.



<P>
We do not think it wrong that there should be the power 
to tell the director general the social and environmental 
objectives that he needs to take into account, but in our 
view, because it is transparent, that power is also of 
assistance to the water companies. For those reasons, I 
hope that hon. Members will not press the amendment to 
a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I almost forwent the pleasure of 
responding to the Minister because of his Latin tag, which 
was marvellous to hear. It is the first time I have heard 
one in Committee since I entered the House. However, I 
cannot forgo that pleasure and duty.
<P>
The Minister was kind enough to refer to my previous 
remarks as feline. I must say that his remarks let the cat 
out of the bag. The truth is that the right hon. Gentleman 
exposed a huge fault line in the Government's policies in 
general and in particular, in relation to the water industry. 
I wonder whether the Minister understands the magnitude 
of what he was saying and the way in which it will 
reverberate Conservative Members will certainly make 
it our business to ensure that it reverberates. The right 
hon. Gentleman is so immured in a certain view of 
things and perhaps I am so inadequate in my capacity 
to explain that he mistook my point to be merely 
repeating lines 14 to 18. He clarified that in the course of 
his speech.
<P>
My point is about the transparency of charging and the 
relationship of particular charges to particular costs. The 
Minister did not immediately leap to that conclusion 
because, as I said, he appears to be immured in another 
view, one which is widely shared by ex-Marxist regimes 
in Africa and current proto-communist regimes in central 
and eastern Europe. Indeed, it has been the great ambition 
of the world bank over the past decade or so to try to 
eradicate such misconceptions as the Minister now reveals 
the Government share in, inter alia, the water industry, in 
such places as Africa and central and eastern Europe.
<P>
The Minister appears not to have grasped or, rather, I 
suspect, as his intellect is quite sufficient to grasp 
anything, not to want to grasp the principle that if 
particular charges for particular commodities are not 
related to the resource cost of providing those 
commodities, a resource misallocation will result. In other 
words, the Minister appears not to want to grasp the 
fundamental economic principle of the free market, which 
is that effective resource allocation depends on 
transparency of pricing and on the relationship between 
pricing and costs for particular goods and services.
<P>
If the Minister genuinely does not accept that 
proposition, all the talk about the Government's 
understanding and belief in market efficiencies and the 
benefits of markets is talk, and nothing more. Ultimately, 
the difference between a command economy and an 
ill-constructed pricing system that delivers the wrong 
goods in the wrong amounts to the wrong people and a 
properly functioning free market that delivers the right 
goods in the right amounts to the right people is 
transparency of pricing. The chaos of the Soviet Union 
was generated by an attempt to deny that relationship.



<P>
In its own quiet way, this innocuous little Bill takes us 
not to the 1970s, or to the 1940s in this country, but to 
1917 in its economic nihilism. That is an extraordinary 
state of affairs. I think that the Minister is genuinely not 
aware of what he is doing; I think that he genuinely 
believes that he is merely allowing for minor pricing 
adjustments. However, the theory that he exposes in 
Committee if extended widely, would have exactly the 
results that I describe.
<P>
A remedy is available to the Minister. He mentioned 
people on dialysis machines and those with large families 
who move into houses with no rateable value and 
metering, which they inherit of necessity under the Bill. 
If he is genuinely concerned with those cases of need, the 
remedy available to him is the transparent remedy that 
would be recommended and is often recommended by 
the World bank for an African regime under similar 
circumstances a direct and transparent subsidy to those 
in need.
<P>
Opposition Members may have particular views about 
particular subsidies in particular kinds of need. However, 
none of us would argue that anything is economically 
improper or counters the effectiveness and efficiency of 
markets if a transparent subsidy is introduced to deal with 
what the Government of the day consider to be a 
particular social need. The Minister is not doing that. He 
had the ability: he could have drafted the clause in just 
that way. In fact, he is saying that the Government have 
the power to force the industry to distort prices for 
particular consumers away from cost-reflectiveness, and 
hence away from effective resource allocation, into a 
hidden cross-subsidy in the charging scheme to advantage 
socially certain groups.
<P>
Once that path is set on, there is no stopping. The 
pricing of everything could easily be arranged indeed, 
some regimes have tried to do so to reflect need and 
ability to pay rather than cost. That is not how a 
Government who responsibly understand the economics 
that they avow that they entertain would approach the 
water industry. They would suggest a transparent subsidy. 
It is remarkable that the Minister has not done that. That 
has a profound impact on how the public should 
understand what the Government are doing.
<P>
The Minister made a further, subtler point. He accused 
us of failing in drafting amendment No. 22 to take into 
account what he rightly regards as an important 
flexibility the water companies' ability to set charges to 
deter heavy users from excessive use that is beyond 
necessity and to the disadvantage of society, especially in 
times of drought or potential drought. It might surprise 
the Minister to learn that, in conjunction with our friends 
from the Liberal Democrat party, we are concerned about 
the social requirement that there should be an adequate 
supply of water in times of drought or potential drought. 
It is reasonable for water companies in their charges to 
seek

<P>

<B>Mr. Allen:</B> Market distortion.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On the contrary. If the hon. Gentleman 
can wait a moment, he will receive a little lesson on how 
market economics works that he can take back to his 
colleagues in the Government Whips Office in the hope 
that they may eventually be able to instruct their own 
Ministers in policy making and theory.
<P>
The idea that there should be an attempt to restrain 
unnecessary and excessive water use in such 
circumstances is perfectly reasonable. We accept that 
charging systems should be used to do that. If the Minister 
understood the import of amendment No. 22, which he 
would if he were not immured in the conceptual world in 
which he is immured, he would recognise that it would 
allow that to happen.
<P>
In fact, not in its precise wording but in the general 
shape of the words, the amendment is almost entirely 
reflective of several United States regulatory provisions 
that have been subject to prolonged hearings before both 
regulatory commissions and the courts, in which legal 
experts and witnesses from distinguished economic 
faculties have been called to speak. It is well established 
that cost in a regulatory context includes not only 
short-run marginal costs, but long-run average and 
marginal costs.
<P>
There is no doubt that, if a water undertaking in this 
country were forced to accommodate under all 
circumstances, including exceptional drought years all 
requests for water, the investment costs to the industry 
and, hence, the long-run average cost of water, would rise 
markedly. That position is common ground between us 
and the Government; it must be, because they have 
continued the policy of previous Governments, both 
Labour and Conservative, of not enforcing on water 
undertakings the construction of vastly expensive United 
Kingdom-based ring mains and transmission systems that 
would bring water from the north to the south in sufficient 
quantities to make it unnecessary to cut off supplies.



<P>
I think that we all agree that there is a relationship 
between the cost entertained as a whole by the water 
company and the use of water in conditions of drought. If 
there were no charging system to limit the use of water in 
conditions of drought, the costs of the water company 
would rise because its investment costs would rise. The 
proposal would allow charging systems that were tapered 
specifically to ensure that, under conditions of potential 
drought, there was an incentive on users not to over-use, 
where overuse was strictly and economically defined.
<P>
I come now to an important crunch point. In 
contradistinction to the rhetoric purveyed by his right hon. 
Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he made 
the Bank of England pseudo-independent, the tenor of the 
Minister's remarks was that Ministers know how to judge 
such matters. He said that Ministers can set the regulations 
that will serve the purpose, and that they would not let in 
gremlins the regulators to decide matters. He said that 
Ministers know what set of regulations will give the 
appropriate social result.
<P>
The Minister for the Environment displayed a 
fundamental misunderstanding of the capacity of the 
marketplace to deal with the problem. In the pricing 
system itself, geared to long-term economics, lies the 
long-run salvation to the question of sustainable 
development and water rationing in times of scarcity. The 
whole point about an adequate pricing system that is 
genuinely reflective of the right sort of costs, short-run 
and long-run, is that it will deliver an answer to society's 
question about how much money it wants to spend to 
protect it against times when there is not enough water 
because there is a drought.
<P>
Such a balancing act should lie in the pricing, and it is 
what amendment No. 22 would allow to lie in the pricing. 
The Minister's course of action will not force anybody to 
allow it to do so. On the contrary, as currently 
constructed, clause 4 will allow the Secretary of State to 
distort pricing specifically in order to substitute for a 
transparent subsidy a covert subsidy through 
cross-subsidisation within pricing and does not enforce 
on the Secretary of State or the director any 
responsiveness to actual long-run and short-run costs. 
Hence, paradoxically, it makes it less likely that the 
charging system as a whole will serve the environmental 
purposes that the Minister has in mind.



<P>
Finally, I return to the interesting debate that arose 
about amendment No. 28, which, as the Minister rightly 
pointed out, neither my hon. Friend the Member for North 
Wiltshire nor I had mentioned. The Minister began by 
saying that amendment No. 28 moved in the opposite 
direction from amendment No. 22. I do not think that that 
is the case. On the contrary, if pricing is to be 
cost-reflective, as amendment No. 22 provides, prices will 
reflect differences between regions and between 
customers, and, as I have been explaining at some length, 
will take into account conservation and efficiency, 
because they have an effect on cost.
<P>
The fascinating interchange between the Minister and 
my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire 
concerned precisely the subject on which I have been 
dwelling. My hon. Friend suggested that the right way 
to deal with regional discrepancies is through transparent 
subsidy in this case, through an income support system. 
I do not want to intrude on your liberality, Mr. Atkinson, 
by dwelling on the issue of income support. However, it 
is the crux of this debate that when the Minister was 
presented with the opportunity to use a transparent 
subsidy to deal with one of the problems that he is trying 
to address, instead of even considering the possibility of 
separate subsidies, if he did not like the interaction with 
income support, he immediately said, "No, no; that is too 
complicated."	 By implication, he reverted to the 
proposition that he could deal with the matter through the 
wonderful regulations that the Secretary of State will 
introduce regulations that will distort pricing with 
internalised cross-subsidies.
<P>
That was a remarkable debate, which reveals a great 
deal about how the government think about industry, and 
about regulated industry in particular. That will have 
major impacts on the rest of the regulation to which the 
Minister referred; it ought also to have a major impact 
on how economic commentators regard the Government's 
actions. If the Minister genuinely meant what he said I 
suspect that he did and has considered the matter, as he 
shows every sign of having done, he has today played a 
major role in illuminating public debate about what the 
Government are up to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is an interesting dissertation in 
Thatcherite economics that we should have a market 
system that is completely unfettered, apart from the 
existence of subsidies for those in need. I will not be so 
rude as to suggest which year in this century or past 
century the hon. Member for West Dorset lives in, but I 
had not realised that the Conservative Front Bench 
continued to be so wedded to a Thatcherite philosophy 
which was so convincingly repudiated at the last election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minster give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In a moment. I am well aware that there 
were other causes behind the result of the election, but the 
idea of an unfettered marketplace wreaking its social and 
environmental consequences has been rejected by the 
British people, for very good reasons that I will try to 
spell out.
<P>
First, the only way to relate the individual charges to 
every consumer to cost is to have universal compulsory 
metering. In other words, everyone must be charged for 
the exact amount of water that they use. It appears that 
the Opposition Front Bench is once again harping on what 
I said on Second Reading was their secret agenda to 
move to universal compulsory metering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns rose </B><P>



<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall give way, but the hon. Gentleman 
cannot bounce up and down as if he were a yo-yo and 
think that I shall do so automatically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Because I shall not.
<P>
I said that the previous Government's failure to come 
up with a system that would continue with rateable 
valuation after 31 March 2000 suggested that their agenda 
was to introduce meters throughout the country. The hon. 
Gentleman denied that, on the grounds that they never 
quite got round to it before 1997. The speech that the hon. 
Gentleman just made absolutely confirmed that that is the 
Conservative agenda.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I should like to stop this nonsense, which 
I know that the Minister is anxious to perpetuate. Under 
the present Government, if one spins a fib as often as 
possible it becomes a fact. I categorically assure the 
Committee that the Opposition have no secret agenda to 
introduce compulsory universal water metering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am very glad to hear that. Will the 
hon Gentleman tell his hon. Friend the Member for West 
Dorset how it is that he proposes an umbilical link 
between charges and costs without proposing universal 
metering?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I addressed my question to the hon. 
Member for West Chelmsford. How does he explain the 
fact that his hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset just 
advocated an unbreakable link between individual 
charging and costs, if the Opposition do not propose 
universal compulsory metering?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for West Chelmsford 
made the statement why does he not answer the 
question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> First, amendment No. 22 would merely 
restrict the director's scope in doing something that the 
Government are adding to his present duties. It does not 
seek to force every charge to be in line.
<P>
Secondly, the Bill creates a ratchet that moves 
towards metering.
<P>
Thirdly, therefore, the Opposition are seeking simply to 
ensure that intervention by the director and the Secretary 
of State do not result in moves away from 
cost-reflectiveness. That is very different from saying that 
the industry has to move immediately and overnight to 
total cost-reflectiveness.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for West Chelmsford 
made his statement apparently oblivious to its direct 
contradiction of his hon. Friend the Member for West 
Dorset, who has also failed to answer my question.
<P>
I admit that a further increase in the rate of metering 
will probably occur. That rate is currently, however, at the 
low level of one in seven households, and it will remain 
low for a long time. The hon. Member for West 
Chelmsford said that the Opposition did not propose 
universal compulsory metering, but the hon. Member for 
West Dorset argued for a link between individual 
charging and costs, which requires individual metering.
<P>
I do not want to go on and on about the matter, but 
there is a clear contradiction on the Opposition Front 
Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I urge the Minister to accept that the Bill 
does not merely create a slight acceleration. It creates a 
ratchet that will move customers inevitably towards 
full-scale metering, at a pace that no one can yet predict. 
The Minister cannot argue that an attempt to prevent the 
Government from distorting pricing further than it is 
already distorted constitutes a hidden agenda to do 
something that his own Bill will do, slowly, remorselessly 
and perfectly appropriately, but not overnight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> It is not a question of doing it more 
slowly. Metering is proceeding at an extremely slow pace 
from a low level. That enables people who do not want 
to be metered to continue to be charged on the basis of 
rateable valuation.



<P>
It is perfectly clear from all the interventions that the 
question that I posed has not been answered. There is a 
fundamental contradiction. If one pursues unfettered 
Thatcherite market economics and says that everyone 
should be charged strictly according to cost, with no other 
consideration, that can be done only on the basis of 
everyone being metered that is absolutely clear.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> All I can say is that there is a 
philosophic difference between the parties. The Labour 
party believes in ability to pay. To suggest that the 
provisions are somehow related to Marxist regimes is 
ridiculous. The hon. Member for West Dorset is sensible 
and should not make such absurd allegations. The 
provisions are a perfectly sensible way of operating and 
do not mean that a hugh secret internal subsidy will 
destroy any relationship between revenue and cost.
<P>
I want not to answer the other point that the hon. 
Member for West Dorset made in relation to what I said 
about drought. He suggested that market pricing would be 
geared to long-term economics, and that it would take into 
account the possibility of a drought this year, next year or 
at some point. He said that funding or charging would 
provide for some reserve against that contingency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This is a point of genuine clarification.
I was suggesting that a rational operator, knowing the 
costs involved in providing limitless amounts of water, 
would always set charges in such a way as to deter the 
use of unlimited amounts of water during conditions of 
potential drought. That is the effect that we are trying 
to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Theoretically, I understand what the 
hon. Gentleman is saying, but I doubt whether the 
industry operates in that way in practice. I suspect that 
the normal pressure of competition in the immediate 
future means that insufficient account is taken of 
undesirable contingencies in the hope that they do not 
occur. In reality, that is a more likely result. Therefore, 
if a drought occurred, costs would start to rise and 
charges would be pushed up sharply to meet them. In 
other words, the approach to the possibility of drought 
would not be even and uniform. I suspect that, if we 
suddenly had a drought, the approach would be far 
sharper and more violent unless provisions were in 
place. The whole point of the Bill is that the Secretary 
of State has provisions in his hands when giving 
guidance to the director general, and that those 
provisions are taken into account in charging policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Surely the issue is the effect of 
amendment No. 22. My argument was that it does not 
prevent the Secretary of State or the director general from 
taking the type of action to control prices that would give 
the water companies a duty to take long-term costs into 
account when setting prices. Those long-term costs are 
the costs that would be engendered by a limitless use of 
water in conditions of potential drought. Nothing that the 
Minister said contradicted my assertion that amendment 
No. 22 allows for the effect that he wants to generate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Amendment No. 22 may be consistent 
with that aim. I did not suggest that it ruled out what the 
hon. Gentleman and I are discussing. We are talking 
about, not only the possibility of drought, but a range of 
conditions. All that I am saying is that the Secretary of 
State needs a power to prescribe the social and 
environmental conditions of which the Director General 
of Water Services is required to take account when 
drawing up his pricing policies. That is what clause 4 is 
all about. My objections to amendment No. 22 were based 
on slightly different grounds.



<P>
Without testing your tolerance, Mr. Atkinson, I should 
like to refer to subsidy, as the hon. Gentleman did at the 
end of his remarks. Is the best way to have a system of 
market pricing across the board which is qualified only 
by a limited system of subsidy? That is a difficult 
proposition, when the element to pay for water in income 
support is fairly small and, therefore, variations in it to 
take account of regional differences are likely to be 
fairly small.
<P>
The key point, as I said earlier, is that whereas housing 
varies almost totally from house to house, water is a 
single, unchanging commodity. For that reason, a system 
of ability to pay is a much better way to proceed than 
an attempt to interfere with the income support system 
which, goodness knows, is complicated enough already.

</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Brake:</B> The amendment would simply change the 
word "may"	 to "shall"	. I am sure that the Government 
want special provisions to be made, including exemptions 
for vulnerable people. Therefore, a simple substitution of 
the word "may"	 with "shall"	 will ensure that that happens. 
If the Government are not willing to accept the 
amendment, I should at least like an indication from the 
Minister as to when they expect the regulations to reflect 
these special provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I feel confident about amendment No. 29. 
[Interruption.] If the Ministers will listen, I should be 
grateful. I feel confident that the Government will accept 
the amendment. I spent 10 years on the Government 
Benches, and served on a number of Standing Committees 
over a great deal of time. I heard time and again 
amendments identical to the one that I have tabled being 
pressed on what was then my Government by Members 
of the then Opposition. Under the laws of logic, therefore, 
the Minister will find the amendment compelling and will 
no doubt want to incorporate it into the Bill.



<P>
It is a simple, straightforward and constitutionally 
important amendment. As the Minister said in an earlier 
debate, clause 5 gives the Secretary of State the power to 
make regulations as he feels fit that would set out groups 
of people to be given special protection and how the 
eligibility for such protection should be demonstrated. 
According to the explanatory notes that have been 
supplied, these
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"groups may include those who need special protection because of 
their age, health or financial circumstances, or due to disability. As 
well as prescribing those who should receive special treatment, the 
regulations will outline the nature of the assistance to be offered."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No committee member would disagree that that is an 
important and, as our earlier debates show, far-reaching 
power which concentrates more power in the hands of the 
Secretary of State and widens his scope to intervene and 
interfere in the water industry.
<P>
You will be pleased to know, Mr. Atkinson, that I do 
not intend to rehearse the previous arguments. You might 
feel that we have dealt with them adequately and that we 
would therefore be out of order. However, I am sure,
Mr. Atkinson, that you would agree that the Secretary of 
State will be taking an important power, and that it is 
important that the House of Commons has the opportunity 
properly to scrutinise that power when he exercises it 
through any regulations that he might make.
<P>
Hon. Members in all quarters agree on the importance 
of scrutinising what the Government are doing. They need 
to be scrutinised and held to account all the more when 
they are giving themselves enhanced powers. That is why 
it is crucial that any regulation that the Secretary of State 
might issue under clause 5 should be subject to the full 
scrutiny of the House of Commons. As we all know, the 
disadvantage of using the negative procedure, which the 
Government are becoming increasingly tempted to 
embrace, is that measures can be flushed through the 
House with minimal if any scrutiny. I therefore 
believe that we should prescribe an affirmative motion.
<P>
Given the rhetoric of Ministers and the Labour party 
during their 18 years in opposition no doubt the two 
Ministers have, in their time, made exactly the same 
speech that I have just made we are united not only in 
our rhetoric but on the principle. I therefore hope that the 
Minister will now accept the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> First, I should like to say with some 
honesty that I know exactly how the hon. member for 
West Chelmsford feels at this time. For 12 years, I 
suffered in similar situations. As Committee members 
know, my right hon. Friend the Minister and I have said 
a great deal about the importance of our policy on water 
charging, but it might be helpful for me to explain our 
approach in a little more detail.
<P>
As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford pointed out, 
amendment No. 30 would change the Bill so that the 
Secretary of State had to make regulations instead of 
merely having the power to make them. I assure hon. 
Members that the Government have a firm and sincere 
intention to make regulations under that power. The only 
reply that I can give to the hon. member for Carshalton 
and Wallington, who asked about when such powers 
would be brought in, is that these powers will be 
introduced as soon as is practicable and possible.
<P>
As we have explained before, a key element of our 
approach to water charging is to introduce new protection 
for those who have a high essential water use and may 
face hardship if they are liable to a measured bill. My 
right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment 
indicated on Second Reading the types of group that we 
considered should be entitled to protection, and suggested 
that such groups should be entitled to a bill based on 
average measured consumption. It may be helpful if I 
restate the groups that we propose to protect. The first 
group is large families on low incomes and the second is 
people with medical conditions that require a high use 
of water.
<P>
For the first group, we propose that protection should 
be available to families with three or more children in 
receipt of one of the following benefits: income support; 
income-based jobseeker's allowance; family credit, which 
is to be replaced by the working families tax credit; 
disability working allowance, which is to be replaced by 
the disabled persons tax credit; housing benefit and 
council tax benefit. Customers should be able to 
demonstrate to the water company that they are in receipt 
of one of the appropriate benefits and that they have three 
or more children.



<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
For the second group, we propose that protection 
should be offered to those with conditions such as 
weeping skin diseases, incontinence, abdominal stomas 
and renal failure requiring home dialysis. To gain 
protection, customers will have to certify to the water 
company that they suffer from one of those conditions, 
any of which causes them to need to use an unusually 
large amount of water. It will be open to water companies 
to verify the information that customers provide. We 
shall, of course, consult on the regulations in draft. That 
point was raised by the hon. Member for Meriden during 
earlier discussions, and I can assure her that we will do so.
<P>
In addition to regulation on vulnerable groups, there are 
a number of proposals 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the 
Government always consult on regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> That was the question that the hon. 
Member for Meriden asked. She implied that in the 
debates on previous clauses she had not heard my right 
hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment refer to the 
fact that consultation was to be undertaken. In fairness to 
the hon. Member for West Chelmsford, he had briefly left 
the Room during that intervention, but I made a note of 
the hon. Lady's point and promised my right hon. Friend 
that I would cover it in my reply.
<P>
In addition to regulation on vulnerable groups, there are 
a number of proposals on charges, which we made in our 
consultation paper and subsequent policy statement. For 
example, provision could be made for the removal of 
standing charges in measured bills, tariffs with 
environmental benefits could be promoted and regulations 
could establish the basis of charging for customers in 
cases in which they request a meter but it is not 
practicable to fit one.
<P>
Subsection (4) prevents regulations being made for the 
purpose of limiting total revenue of water undertakers. 
That removes any risks that the water companies may 
perceive of constraints on their income and makes clear 
the director general's prime responsibility for economic 
regulation.
<P>
The Government have a legitimate interest in a wide 
range of charging issues. It must, therefore, be correct for 
democratically elected politicians to be able to play a role 
in decision making on the distribution of charges where 
distribution can have important social and environment 
implications. Some Opposition Members have expressed 
the view that they do not believe that that should be the 
case. The hon. Member for West Dorset, in particular, 
came out with an extraordinary dissertation which was, 
to put it mildly, off beam, as my right hon. Friend the 
Environment Minister pointed out.



<P>
The approach we are adopting is consistent with the 
response to consultation on the review of utility 
regulation, "A Fair Deal for Customers"	. That makes clear 
that where the Government wish to implement social or 
environmental measures that would have significant 
financial implications for consumers or for the regulated 
companies, they should be backed by new, specific legal 
provision. The arrangements in the Bill, including primary 
and secondary legislation, are not only consistent with that 
principle, but are necessary to ensure that regulation is 
carried out in as transparent a manner as possible and to 
avoid relying on Ofwat's economic regulation powers to 
achieve social and environmental aims.
<P>
In considering the scope of any regulations we make 
under clause 5, we shall also have regard to the powers 
to give guidance included in clause 4. We shall make 
regulations only where they are needed to achieve the 
Government's important policy objectives of establishing 
a fair and affordable system of water charging, 
particularly for vulnerable customers.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 would make regulations made 
under clause 5 subject to negative, rather than affirmative 
resolution. We do not believe that that is appropriate. The 
Water Industries Act 1991 already contains a number of 
regulation-making powers that are subject to negative, 
rather than affirmative, resolution, covering matters as 
important as regulations for preserving water quality and 
to ensure that the water supply is not contaminated 
through water fittings, supply pipes and so on. However, 
there are a number of safeguards to reassure those 
concerned about possible regulations. First, as we have 
made clear throughout, the prime aim of the regulations 
is to enable us to protect vulnerable groups with high 
essential water use who live in premises with meters. 
Secondly, the regulation making power is already 
constrained by our proposals in subsection (4). The effect 
of that constraint is that, in preparing regulations in which 
Ministers have a legitimate interest, we shall be concerned 
not with the overall burden, but with distributional effects 
between customers. Thirdly, to answer the point made by 
the hon. Member for Meriden, I am happy to make clear 
our commitment to consult interested parties on the 
regulations prior to their being tabled.
<P>
I hope that I have made our approach clearer and ask 
hon. Members not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> We shall not press our amendment to a 
vote, but I found the Minister's explanation of why he 
would not accept amendment No. 29 unconvincing. 
Whilst we were not impressed by Conservative Members' 
economics, they are trying to obtain better scrutiny of 
secondary legislation, and we should support that. It is 
pathetic of the Minister to say that some of the previous 
Government's legislation was susceptible only to negative 
resolution and to imply that if he were in Opposition now 
he would say what the Opposition are saying. What is 
good is good and whatever side one is sitting on, one 
adheres to that truth and does not change one's views.
I found the Minister's argument lamentable and hope that 
the Conservatives will press their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's 
monologue. It seemed to embody the old civil servants' 
adage that it is important to get it on the record, which is 
why he ploughed on to the bitter end. Unfortunately, his 
argument left me unconvinced; I imagine that I am saying 
what he would have made when he was in Opposition. 
Things change over the course of a year.



<P>
As I said earlier, the Bill greatly enhances the Secretary 
of State's powers and his opportunities to interfere. It is 
important that Parliament has the proper means to 
adequately examine and scrutinise the regulations that a 
Secretary of State may make. For that reason, I shall press 
our amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish to clarify whether the hon. 
Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) wishes to 
withdraw Amendment No. 30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gorrie:</B> Yes, I do. I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
