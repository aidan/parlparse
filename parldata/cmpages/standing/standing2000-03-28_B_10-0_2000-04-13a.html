<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 3, line 4, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In exercising any power in respect of coastal land under or pursuant to this Act, regard shall be had to the needs of flood defence and coastal protection.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 242, in page 3, line 4, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In exercising any power in respect of coastal land under or pursuant to this Act, regard shall be had to the protection of wildlife and the needs of nature conservation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 139, in page 3, line 12, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) An order under this section shall not be made until the Secretary of State (as respects England) or the National Assembly for Wales (as respects Wales) has consulted those interests likely to be affected by the order, has undertaken and published a regulatory impact assessment in relation to the proposed order, and has undertaken and published an assessment of the effects of a proposal for any such order on—
<P>
(a) the environment, including any effects on the natural beauty, flora, fauna and geological and physiographical features of the land affected;
<P>
(b) the use and management of land adjacent to the land affected; and
<P>
(c) flood and coastal defence and coast protection in relation to the land affected.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> We have severe reservations about the clause, Mr. Stevenson. As the amendments deal with specific concerns, I hope that you will allow a short clause stand part debate.
<P>
The amendments would introduce requirements that would have to be met if the Secretary of State intended to extend access rights to coastal land. The clause currently refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``coastal land or . . . coastal land of any description''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That terminology is wide and open and covers a vast range of types of land, habitat and geology—a point with which I hope to deal in more detail during a clause stand part debate. Amendment No. 241 would require the Secretary of State to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the needs of flood defence and coastal protection<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the exercise of any power. The Minister may say that the Secretary of State would do that anyway, but such provision should be included in the Bill to cover these crucial issues. Much of our coastline is extremely fragile and is open to erosion and significant flooding. We all know that particular regard must be given to the contribution by walkers to erosion. The Country Landowners Association has told us that it supports the amendments, as they would ensure that proper regard is given to such needs.
<P>
Amendment No. 242 deals with an issue that is, in many ways, much bigger. It would require the Secretary of State to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the protection of wildlife and the needs of nature conservation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I remind the Minister for the Environment of remarks that he made on Second Reading. He said that the priority of the Bill was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to extend rights of access on foot, provided that such access does not damage the interests of wildlife, which must prevail.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 724.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wholly support that statement, and it is already evident that we have strong doubts about other aspects of the Bill that compromise the ability of wildlife interests to prevail.
<P>
The 1979 European directive on the conservation of wild birds requires member states to take conservation measures, especially for specific rare and vulnerable species and for regularly occurring migratory species of birds. Such measures operate in part through the designation of statutory special protection areas by the Government on the advice of their statutory agencies. The designation is implemented through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and all special protection areas have to be notified first as SSSIs. Amendment No. 242 would ensure that appropriate recognition is enshrined within the Bill to keep it in line with European Union environmental rulings. Although there is much more public awareness of the need to protect the coastline—the disappearance of various bits of coastline is regularly mentioned in the media—the pressures are no less, and the provisions for access need to be balanced against the damage that access can cause to all aspects of our coastline.
<P>
Coastal bird colonies cannot cope with high levels of disturbance, either in the breeding season or when wintering flocks are present. The United Kingdom coast is extremely important for wintering birds. For instance, rock climbing can be very damaging to bird life, and most climbing cliffs are closed to climbers during the breeding season. We obviously have reservations about such access. There are many areas of particular importance; I shall not list them all, but they are to be found in all parts of the coastline of England and Wales and of Scotland.
<P>
The limits of coastal shoreline and marine zones are indistinct. That is why I mentioned the all-embracing terminology of clause 3, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>coastal land of any description.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Coastal land is difficult to define. Foreshores are a particularly susceptible ecosystem, and they are already being damaged by various external factors such as sewage discharge, nutrient run-off, boat mooring, sediment extraction, off-shore dumping and so on. That, too, must be properly accounted for. In short, although the Minister said that the interests of wildlife and conservation are paramount, it is essential that they are written in to the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 139 would require consultation to take place before the Secretary of State issues orders under clause 3. On Second Reading, the Minister undertook that any order of the Secretary of State to extend the right of access to coastal land would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>subject to approval by each House of Parliament, and that no order will be laid until a full public consultation has been carried out and a regulatory impact statement has been prepared.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 725.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is perfectly reasonable, but I ask the Minister to put action behind his words and to write words to that effect into the Bill.
<P>
I know that Henry VIII clauses are unpopular. Nevertheless, coupled with the environmental implications of clause 3, that undertaking, which was given and accepted in good faith, should be detailed in the Bill. The amendment would go a long way to meeting the understandable worry of environmentalists that the Secretary of State could extend the right of access without proper scrutiny or consultation, whatever the present Minister might intend. It is iniquitous that the Government would not be required to consult if they sought to make major extensions to the right of access.
<P>
Environmental regulatory impact assessments are also dealt with in the amendment. The need for environmental assessment prior to the extension of a right to roam over coast land is evidenced by the report of the UK biodiversity steering group, which includes a statement about boulders and rocks above the high tide mark. Page 302 of the report—I am sure that the Minister has a copy of it—states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recreational access can lead to the disturbance of rock-nesting birds. Tramping may also be detrimental to plant life.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On page 306, the report states that, for sand dunes,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>increasing tourism in coastal areas results in pressures from the development of public amenities and increasing levels of visitor pressure which leads to trampling of the vegetation, erosion of the dune systems and disturbance of breeding birds.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those two statements underline better than I can the importance of undertaking a proper environmental impact assessment before orders made under clause 3 are laid before Parliament.
<P>
I accept in good faith what the Minister said on Second Reading, but, without looking into a crystal ball, I suggest that he will not be in his post for ever and a day. We do not know who will take his post or that of the Secretary of State. It could go either way. The Minister is right to flip his hand. I am not suggesting whether he will move up, down or sideways, but I suspect that he does not expect to be in the same job in five or 10 years' time. Certainly, we will be doing our best to ensure that that prospect is not even under consideration. His words, even if delivered in good faith, do not bind future Secretaries of State. Secretaries of State should be so bound, however. I have tabled the amendments to ensure that the obligations to which the Minister has verbally committed himself are written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I am indebted to the CLA and the National Farmers Union for enlightening me of the potential problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): The hon. Gentleman gives me an opportunity to thank the National Farmers Union and the CLA. Their briefings to all hon. Members during the Committee have been excellent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): Will the hon. Gentleman also commend the briefings from the Farmers Union of Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I commend the briefings of the Farmers Union of Wales, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Wildlife Trust. I am sorry if I have left out an organisation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman might help the Committee by making a catch-all statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am obliged to mention the Game Conservancy. The catch-all statement is this: I am indebted to all those assisting the Committee in its deliberations.
<P>
The chief problem concerns nature conservancy. We are considering land often subject to considerable erosion. I might name several places in the Tywyn and Aberdyfi area of my constituency where coastland is eroding and to which there is not much access. If careful consideration is not given to the situation, sand dunes in such areas will erode further. The other problem is that such areas often need flood defence and coastal protection, to which amendment No. 241 refers. The amendments would require the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to have regard to such matters.
<P>
The protection of wildlife and the need to ensure adequate nature conservation is the overall consideration. There is insufficient information and potentially serious problems could arise. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said, much coastal land is already designated as being of considerable wildlife value, and of special scientific interest. They are important not only nationally but internationally. The access impact statements should be extremely well prepared before we proceed.
<P>
Amendment No. 139 would include the Minister's welcome commitment during the Second Reading debate that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no order will be laid until a full public consultation has been carried out and a regulatory impact statement has been prepared.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 725.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would bind successive Governments. I shall not discuss for how long the right hon. Gentleman will be in his post, but I recall that he was a Minister in the first Labour Government—[Hon. Members: ``The first one!''] I obviously did not mean to say that.
<P>
There is also the question of access for dogs and the consideration of ground-laying birds. I know that the Minister is concerned about that, but the amendments would ensure that more information was provided about the assessment process and who is taking part in it. There is also the important matter of livestock grazing on coastal land. In addition, legitimate wildfowling activities must be considered, as well as the issue of public safety. Will the Minister also say what regard has been had for the fact that some part of all areas of coastal land is Crown property?
<P>
The amendments are useful and I hope that the Minister will respond to them in detail because the Bill is somewhat vague and needs to be tightened up. I believe that we should have a clause stand part debate, and I hope that you will be minded to allow that, Mr. Stevenson.

<P>

<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> The background to the amendments is that clause 3 allows the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales by order to extend the statutory right of access to all or part of the foreshore and land adjacent to it. I recognise the force of the case that has been made. Coastal land is indeed rich in wildlife, and nature conservation bodies have expressed significant concerns that any proposal to extend or formalise coastal access might have adverse effects. Many sites are robust in the face of access and give little cause for concern but others are sensitive and could suffer negative impacts from human activities. Indeed, there is evidence that that has already happened in a minority of cases. Some types of coastal birds are especially vulnerable, often with considerable seasonal variation in sensitivity. Therefore, I understand the case that has been made and which needs to be answered. However, as the hon. Members for South-East Cambridgeshire and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) have said, we have already announced our intention to undertake full consultation and publish a regulatory impact statement before deciding whether to exercise the power to extend the right of access to coastal land. That will allow us to define the land affected and ensure that we take full account of all legitimate concerns, including conservation and coastal protection issues.
<P>
We recognise that the possibility of extending the right of access to coastal land raises issues of real significance. That is why clause 40(3) provides—these are not just my words as Minister for the time being, they are in the Bill—that a decision to extend the right of access in England will be subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses. That will ensure that there will be proper parliamentary scrutiny, and procedures in Wales will similarly provide effective scrutiny by the National Assembly.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 241 and 242 would require that, before extending access, the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales should have regard to conservation interests and flood defence and coastal protection. We have already declared our intention to take full account of those matters before any decision is made about extending the right of access to coastal land. Of course, were we to decide to apply a statutory right of access to coastal land, the provisions in the Bill for closures on nature conservation or land management grounds would routinely apply to coastal land as they would to other access land.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made a point about the need to take account of the European protected conservation sites in complying with any coastal land order. I take his point. The Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales are already under a statutory duty to have regard to the protection of European conservation sites in exercising any function—for example, under the 1994 habitats regulations. The Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales will be under a new duty to protect SSSIs under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as amended by schedule 9. We have taken the matter fully into account.
<P>
I support the concerns behind the amendments, but they are fully and satisfactorily dealt with by the Bill. I am happy to repeat in the most positive terms our commitment that, before we lay a draft order before Parliament, we will publish a regulatory impact statement and undertake full consultations on the wide range of relevant issues, including those mentioned in the amendments. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Minister for at least agreeing with the spirit of the amendments. I accept that some aspects of them are dealt with elsewhere in the Bill or under other legislation. I have less faith than the Minister that a statutory instrument Committee would be in a position to give full scrutiny to secondary legislation. I do not know whether he attends many such Committees these days, but I do, periodically, and, frankly, the business is a foregone conclusion. The subjects considered in those Committees do not receive the debate that they justify. That is why I hope that we shall return to the principle of what we have been discussing in a few minutes.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will accept that there is widespread concern, which has been apparent on Second Reading and from the multitude of documents kindly sent to us by environmental bodies, that the Bill does not go far enough in setting out the country's responsibilities under international environmental orders, directives and treaties. That is why we raised the issue of the directive on the conservation of wild birds. I accept the Minister's good will and therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No. 243, in page 3, line 6, after `Part', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except sections 12 and 13'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 161, in page 3, line 6, leave out from `Part' to end of line 8.
<P>
No. 244, in page 3, line 7, after `Part', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except sections 12 and 13,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 245, in page 3, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) An order under this section may not—
<P>
(a) remove or restrict the rights of appeal under sections 6, 28 and 36; or
<P>
(b) remove the byelaw making powers under section 17.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to constrain the otherwise broad powers under the clause which enable the Secretary of State to amend part I to extend the right of access to coastal land. For example, clause 3 would enable the Secretary of State to amend the occupiers' liability provisions by secondary legislation. That could have enormous impact in the form of massive new liability. To give a Minister such a power through secondary legislation is in many ways rather improper. Therefore, we propose that changes to part I should be subject to primary rather than secondary legislation. I shall speak briefly to the individual amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 243 would ensure that, when consequential amendments to the access provisions are made, the Secretary of State could not amend the sections that exempt from liability persons who have an interest in the land. That would protect those who might be subject to a new form of occupiers' liability. Amendment No. 244 would have a similar effect.
<P>
Amendment No. 161 would prevent the Secretary of State from being able to modify any of the access provisions relating to coastal land. In particular, we want to draw attention to the slightly woolly drafting of subsection (2)(b). That subsection recognises that access to coastal land needs to be treated independently from other forms of open countryside because different types of problem can emerge in relation to coastal land. However, it is fundamentally unsatisfactory to have to legislate separately, following the detailed consultation that the Minister keeps promising. Indeed, far from deciding whether there is overwhelming support for the measure, the Government want to sweep all discussion and the whole decision-making process into the future, once we have passed a Bill that gives sweeping powers to the Secretary of State.
<P>
We tabled the amendment because that part of the Bill is not only objectionable but incomplete. If the Government want that sort of power, they should have included detailed provisions in the Bill rather than allowing them to be introduced by regulation at a later date. There is also the more general point that, if the subsection is retained, it will provide the Secretary of State with excessive powers, which will not be subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny. A similar point is made in amendment No. 245, which would also limit the Secretary of State's power. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has already made the point that the Committees in which such matters are discussed are not necessarily a great adornment to the parliamentary process, in terms of scrutiny or predictability of result. Therefore, we believe that a firmer provision should be included in the Bill, which would enable Parliament to keep a hand on any extension to the right of access that any Secretary of State were to introduce.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I want to speak to amendment No. 161, and I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). The amendment simply raises a matter of principle. The Committee is carefully scrutinising the legislation in an attempt to get it as right as possible. There is always an inherent contradiction when provision is made for secondary legislation that has the capacity to make a substantial difference to the operation of a Bill at a later stage, as the subsection would. There are also inherent contradictions in the wording of the clause. As the hon. Member for Ashford has already said, the clause specifies ``open country'' merely because it is coastal land. In other words, it recognises that some coastal land is already included in previous definitions, yet there is not the same requirement in other clauses for that land to be treated differently. Therefore, the Minister is making a distinction between two definitions of coastal land; that which is included in open country by virtue of other provisions and that which is not, but which could be defined as coastal land at a later stage.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our debates on previous clauses have also shown up other inherent contradictions in the Bill. When hon. Members, principally Opposition Members, have suggested particular circumstances that could cause a problem, either of definition or in practice, the Minister or his colleagues have referred to the avenues for potential restrictions littered throughout the Bill, yet none of them seems to be adequate to deal with the specific circumstances that the draftsmen of the subsection envisaged in respect of coastal land. That begs the question: if they are not adequate to deal with those specific circumstances, why are they adequate to deal with circumstances relating to other open land that we have already discussed and on which we have been assured that flexibility for local direction is included?
<P>
Those are the basic problems with the clause, and the Minister must explain two things. First, why does he envisage that it is necessary to include a power to make separate directions in respect of this land at a later date and why cannot an appropriate provision be encompassed by primary legislation? Secondly, why does he differentiate between different classes of coastal land and believe that there might be a case specifically to exclude from some of the Bill's provisions coastal land that is newly accreted to the Bill's definitions, but not land that is already included in them? When I read subsection (2)(b) in conjunction with subsection (1), which allows the Minister to decide what coastal land should be included in the definitions, I find it even more inexplicable that he needs to include this belt and braces measure to support his intentions.
<P>
Those are the arguments, and the Minister must persuade us why that somewhat cursory scrutiny is sufficient. I do not want to play down any part of the scrutiny process undertaken by the House, but Statutory Instrument Committees do not have the same capacity for scrutiny as Standing Committees or further stages of consideration. I do not believe that such scrutiny is adequate when important arguments need to be made about the competing pressures of access and the environment, which lie at the core of the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The Bill already provides for the extension of access to coastal land as an integral part of our access proposals. As the hon. Member for Ashford made clear, the amendments seek to limit the power of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to extend access.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 243 and 244 seek to prevent orders extending access to coastal land from making changes to the Bill's provisions on occupiers' liability. I understand the reasons for that, and I appreciate that some coastal landscapes are intrinsically dangerous. However, in many cases the risk has co-existed with significant public use for a long time; we are not contemplating something new.
<P>
I confirm that we have no intention of changing the provision so that occupiers will owe no liability to those exercising the right of access in respect of natural features of the land. The same occupiers' liability as applies elsewhere to open country will apply to coastal land unless it is changed by order. I simply say that we have no intention of doing that. We would have to lay an order to make that extension. It would, of course, be open to us to include whatever we wished in such an order. However, I say with the authority of Government that we have no intention of changing the position in regard to occupiers' liability—if and when we make an order to extend the right of access to the foreshore.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am delighted to receive that assurance. I simply observe that it cannot be beyond the wit of man to include that assurance in the Bill, and make it much more difficult for future Ministers, who have a different—and incorrect—view. The Bill has several more stages to complete, and I hope that the Minister will make concrete his assurance by agreeing to include it in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do not think that one can include in the Bill the content of an order that does not yet exist and which we are not yet committed to making. I made it clear that such an order will require the affirmative resolution of both Houses, that a regulatory impact statement will be made and that there will be full consultation. That is when the question of occupiers' liability could arise and objections could be made.
<P>
I give the Committee an absolute assurance that we have no such intention. I made it very clear that occupiers' liability will be at the minimal level. Indeed, there will be no occupiers' liability in respect of natural features of the land; it will apply only to man-made aspects of the landscape. That will apply to coastal land in exactly the same way as it does to open country. The hon. Gentleman has no reason to dispute the unqualified nature of my statement, and I hope that he will accept it.
<P>
As with other access land, the onus would be directly on members of the public to keep themselves, and any children that they may have with them, out of danger. We propose that an extension of the right of access to coastal land should be accompanied by a positive educational campaign—risks obviously exist—that would provide information about the rights and responsibilities of users and landowners alike. We already intend the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales to prepare codes of practice for users and landowners. The codes of practice for the visiting public could include such items as ``Staying safe by the sea.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The Minister will know that, during consultation on the Bill, the Countryside Council for Wales and English Nature expressed their view that access to coastal areas should not be extended. That view was based on good environmental and conservational reasons. What appraisal has the Minister made of it in relation to the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I want to make it clear that we will take full account of the views of such bodies before we introduce any order. I am well aware of the resistance to extension of coastal access, which exists for reasons that have been mentioned. Coastal land was included in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, so such extension is not an innovation. We left it out of the Bill because of the great concern among nature conservation bodies. I am glad that the remarks that I made on Second Reading were mentioned, as I am very concerned about the matter. Full and genuine consultation will occur before any extension is made; there is no hidden agenda and the Government have not made up their mind on the land now.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I do not seek to limit power to make orders extending access to coastal areas. However, I am concerned about something that the Minister has not yet addressed. Why is a power needed to modify provisions in the Bill? That question is especially important in respect of liability, to which the hon. Member for Ashford referred. If there is no intention of using the power, why must it be included in the Bill? It does not make sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The best answer that I can give to the hon. Gentleman is to explain how the issue arose and its place in the chronology of the Bill's preparation. As hon. Members will know, the Bill was prepared quickly, after the statement that I made to the House on 8 March last year. I remind the Committee that we are considering a complex Bill that has been prepared within the past year.
<P>
The Countryside Agency reported its recommendations in favour of extending the right of access to coastal land only in the autumn. There was no time to undertake the full consultation that would have been necessary if coastal land was to be included in the Bill from the start. That is why I have given the commitment that we discussed in the previous debate. We do not know at this stage about the exact provisions that will be required, which is why the Bill has been drafted to retain flexibility. I am not undermining the point made by the hon. Gentleman and I recognise that he is expressing genuine concerns. I remind him that there is no sinister intent behind the provision and that it simply reflects the time scale within which the Bill was drafted.
<P>
Amendment No. 161 would restrict the power of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to modify the application of the provisions in so far as they apply to access to the foreshore or adjacent land. In order to ensure clarity and certainty about what areas would be included in the extension of the statutory right to coastal land, it is essential to have power to modify the provisions. The amendment would restrict the scope of the extension order, which would have a detrimental effect on its clarity and effectiveness. I am sure that that is not the amendment's intended purpose, but it would be its undesirable effect.
<P>
Amendment No. 245 seeks to prevent the Secretary of State from modifying provisions for various rights of appeal for landowners and managers and also the byelaw-making powers of access authorities on the extension of coastal land. As I commented in relation to the other amendments, we have no intention of changing the regime for appeals and the byelaw-making power of access authorities, which we expect to be exactly the same as they are for other access land. I realise that scrutiny Committees such as this one should test the Government's motives—one should always be suspicious of all Governments' motives—but I say with my hands up that there is no intention of treating coastal land or foreshore at all differently from the rest of open country in terms of the extension of the right of access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I am pleased to hear what the Minister has said on that point. Will he confirm that, were such an order made, there would be adequate time for mapping and for appeal? Will he also confirm that a holistic approach will be taken if some areas of coast are open and others are not? We will need to study the way in which rights of access to open areas work collectively. That will require a holistic approach to be taken with regard to the whole coastline.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> There will certainly be consultation on mapping and provision for objections to be made by all those with an interest in the land, including walkers. I understand the hon. Gentleman's reasonable point about holism and connectedness. If we go down that track, the process must be performed sensibly when the countryside agencies come to act and must take account of that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> There should be adequate time for mapping and for appeals against mapping.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Of course. The same factors should apply in those situations as will apply in cases regarding access to open country. After the mapping has been done, there will be consultation so that people might object and seek modifications, with time for appeals to be dealt with. It is not intended that those instances will be different in any way.
<P>
I hope that the amendments will be seen not to be necessary and that the hon. Member for Ashford will see fit not to press them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That was a more than usually riveting reply from the Minister. I should apologise to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) for seeming to expropriate his amendment. That would have been inappropriate. I am happy to support it, but I agree that it was not obvious from what I said that it was his amendment and not mine. I exercised my right to roam over it.
<P>
I said gently that I did not think that the clause was brilliantly drafted; now we know why. The Minister said that it was prepared in haste. I find that slightly surprising because the Bill was part of the Government's election manifesto and was hailed by the right hon. Gentleman on Second Reading as an historic Bill that he had been waiting to introduce all his life. As such, one might not have expected the Bill, when it reached Committee, to be described as having in part been thrown together at the last minute, and thus to be slightly unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I did not say or imply that the Bill had been thrown together in haste or had not been prepared with all due care. It has been so prepared; my officials have worked hard and have done extremely well. I said that, as the Countryside Agency had recommended the inclusion of the provision only in the autumn, there had not been time for full and proper consultation in regard to coastal land and foreshore, which form a separate category. The hon. Gentleman is not right to say or to imply that there has been undue haste or precipitation in the preparation of the Bill in other respects.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am happy to accept that point. Like the Minister, I was saying that it wants this particular aspect, that minds had turned only in the past few months, which explains why the drafting is more than usually unsatisfactory within the context of the Bill. The Minister legitimately reasoned that the clause had to be vague because not everything had been thought through. The amendments would make it less vague. However, the Government intend to address the vagueness by giving undue powers to the Secretary of State in secondary legislation. We and, I think, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome regard that as unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 3, line 11, after `cliff', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, cliff-top'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This small but helpful amendment would widen the definition of coastal land to include cliff tops. There are two aspects to consider. First, a lot of people enjoy walking on cliff tops, many of which are open to walkers. There are coastal paths in Pembrokeshire, south and north Devon and the Llyn peninsula in Wales. The fact that cliff tops are not mentioned has created a lacuna in the legislation. Cultivation rarely—if ever—extends to the cliff edge. There is always a band of land between a cliff and the start of cultivated land.
<P>
Secondly, seas cliffs are important for climbing. I appreciate what the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said about the damage that rock climbing could cause to wildlife and birds. However, the British Mountaineering Council told me that its members who climb sea cliffs do so after liasing with the relevant wildlife organisations. Only a tiny number of people have the competence and desire to climb sea cliffs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I always like to oblige my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), but I doubt whether there is a need to define coastal land further. The agencies' joint report to the Government on access to other land said that there was no universal definition of what constitutes coastal land, but that it should include all land from the mean low mark inland until another category is reached—I am sure that we will all go to bed worrying about that definition. The report also stated that coastal land could include open grass or scrubland, such as the top of cliffs, if it does not fall within an alternative category of land, such as downland, farmland or open countryside. If the extension to coastal land is approved, the agencies will take that definition into account when carrying out the mapping process. The amendment would have no effect on the definition of coastal land. My hon. Friend's concern is fully covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Given what we have heard, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson, for allowing a clause stand part debate.
<P>
We are gravely concerned about the way in which the Government have approached the question of coastal land. I do not want to rehash what has been said, but the Minister has admitted that there has not been time to think the matter through properly. Therefore, I oppose clause 3. If at some future date there should be a case for extending the rights to coastal land, that should be the subject of primary legislation and the full scrutiny of a Standing Committee, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggested, rather than a statutory instrument Committee.
<P>
The Minister, in explaining why less work than might have been desirable had been done on clause 3, said that it was the autumn before the Countryside Agency advised that it should be possible to extend the right of access to coastal land. I am sorry that the Minister appears to have taken the Countryside Agency as the sole arbiter of the matter. The agency does not, as I understand it, have a primary conservation function. The Minister has said that the interests of wildlife and conservation should prevail in this context. I cannot see how acceding to the views of an agency whose principle responsibilities do not include those interests would achieve what the Minister wants.
<P>
Many of the other bodies that were consulted did not approve of the proposal. The Countryside Council for Wales responded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There should not be a statutory right of access to coasts, woodlands and watersides, due in part to the sensitive wildlife habitats found there, particularly along river banks, sea cliffs and in sand dunes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It recommended that access should be expanded where appropriate by voluntary agreements backed up by grants. English Nature, the Government's statutory adviser on conservation issues in England, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Recreation may also have unwelcome impacts including physical damage to plants and sensitive geological features through trampling and erosion, collecting of biological or palaeontological specimens, changes in water quality, localised disturbance to wildlife, particularly birds, and negative by-products such as noise, artificial lighting, dog excreta and litter Development associated with recreation, especially in coastal areas, can have negative impacts including the loss of habitats and species.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred earlier to ownership. As I understand it, the Crown owns about half the foreshore. The rest is owned by the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancashire, in those counties, the National Trust, local authorities and some private owners. Ownership of other coastal land, above the high tide mark, varies widely, but many coastal stretches are served by the rights of way.
<P>
Without repeating what I said in the debate on the amendments, I must remind the Committee that vast areas of coastal lands are sites of special scientific interest, or have special protection for other reasons. Widespread concern is felt about the impact not just of access but of all the other threats to our coastal land, which is why so much is classified in those ways. An example of coastal erosion is to be found at Orford Ness in Suffolk, close to where I spend much of my life. It has an important area of shingle spit and salt marsh that is rich in plant life and birdlife. Increased access to the area would have a negative effect on local biodiversity. I have referred to pollution, which is highly significant in the area. Marram grass is being encouraged in order to stabilise sand dunes that are being eroded by public access; it is clearly human disturbance that leads to dune destabilisation.
<P>

<P>
Ten days ago, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food published a press release entitled ``Coastal Wetlands To Be Saved''. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Internationally important conservation sites around the English coast are to be saved from the sea under new guidelines published today.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The plans for the six areas will be formulated under the Coastal Habitat Management Plans (CHaMPs) guidelines, drawn up jointly by English Nature and the Environment Agency in close consultation with MAFF and the DETR.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document lists six separate areas in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, North Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex and Hampshire and asserts:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Environment Agency and local authorities will be able to use the CHaMPs guidelines to decide, with MAFF and English Nature what needs to be done to protect habitats.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When he launched the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—whom I think represented Scunthorpe at the time, although all hon. Members will know who I mean—said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government is committed to honour its international obligations to protect the important habitats around the coastline. To meet this commitment MAFF has modified the funding arrangements to ensure that these sites are protected.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The chairman of English Nature, Baroness Young of Scone—
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Scone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As in Frome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I apologise. Baroness Young is a Labour peeress, and she has answered my puzzle about the speaker whom the past quote represented. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am delighted that Elliot Morley is able to launch the guidance of CHaMPS at Tollesbury today. Coastal Habitat Management Plans are good news for both people and wildlife. They will ensure that we conserve the rich and varied wildlife of England's coastline and provide protection from the sea for the areas that need them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have used the MAFF press release to emphasise the fact that another Department has widespread concern about our coastal areas. I seriously doubt the wisdom of conferring power to include coastal land by ministerial order. All the various statements to which I have referred—I shall not detain the Committee with the many others that I could mention—show that the vast bulk of our coastal land would not be appropriate for rights of access. The whole exercise of trying to include such land would be one of great difficulty for the agency that will have to produce the maps. It would be very difficult to communicate to individuals that the minority of land will be appropriate for access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Public safety has not been considered. In some areas, people may risk being put under threat by a tidal race or by steep and crumbling cliffs. Such areas are not appropriate for general public access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. I know Dunwich in Suffolk very well. The cliffs there are extremely dangerous and are continually being eroded. People walk along the beach, where there are many signs telling them to keep off the cliffs, which are installed for safety and to avoid erosion. I can remember in my increasingly long lifetime a number of tragedies in which children have been engulfed in sandstone sliding off the cliff.
<P>
The point is that the issues associated with the inclusion of coastal land are very large. There will be arguments for its inclusion, and I have advanced a number of arguments against it. A range of arguments and interests must be considered, and they amount to more than can be dealt with in secondary legislation. That is the nub of the reason why I sought your permission, Mr. Stevenson, for a clause stand part debate and of why the clause should not be included in the Bill. An extension to include coastal land should be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny as part of primary legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): First, I declare an interest. I was not going to mention the fact that I am a non-practising lawyer, but lawyers have been mentioned more times, than any flora or fauna, so perhaps it is relevant. [Interruption.] I hope, Mr. Stevenson, that you will protect me from such badinage.
<P>
We legislate for the countryside about once every 20 years. The case has been made for a right of open access to coastal areas. I should like that to be in the Bill but, as my right hon. Friend the Minister does not want to go that far, I support his argument that we should have the ability to introduce that right in secondary legislation when all interested parties are satisfied.
<P>
The Countryside Agency, the Countryside Council for Wales, the Forestry Commission, the Environment Agency and English Nature produced a study last year on access to coastal land. My right hon. Friend said that, in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, coastal land was part of the original definition of land to which there should be a right of access. It is the only major category of land in the 1949 Act to which the Bill does not grant an open right of access. Woodlands and watersides were added in 1968.
<P>
Coastal land is a great place to walk. One in 10 regular walkers do all or most of their walking on coastal land. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said that the Crown owns a lot of our foreshore to which it may well allow access. Although it is not advisable to walk on the foreshore when the tide is in, we have an open right of access to it provided we are in a boat. That is the law.
<P>
As for other coastal land, the National Trust is the biggest single owner with 850 km out of 4,400 km of coastal land in England and Wales. Some coastal land is accessible by footpaths. In Wales, more than 1,800 km of rights of way are within 150 m of the coast. Not many people know that, in 1942, at the height of the second world war when Britain was a beacon of freedom and democracy and people had a special affinity with our coastal land as being symbolic of that freedom, the Scott report recommended that we should establish a network of public footpaths around the coast, an ambition that has not been achieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on it. Establishing a network of footpaths is completely different from extending the right of access. We would have no problem with a network of footpaths because that would be controllable, but an open right of access would not be controllable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I accept that they are different, but that ambition was set out in 1942 and has not been achieved by 2000. Conservative Governments took no steps towards achieving the ambition of the Scott report. The Bill gives us the opportunity to fulfil that ambition and provide access to all our coastal land, which is why I favour it.
<P>
It is worth recording what the Countryside Agency and others said in their report to the Minister about access to coastal land. They said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This approach would legally secure public access to most of the coastline of England and Wales. Depending on how the land affected was described, it could be relatively simple for people to understand where they could go, though access maps might still be desirable. It would adapt well to a programme of managed retreat. It would evoke significant concerns about possible impacts on nature conservation and private property rights. It would be important to include the full range of safeguards and closure powers envisaged by Government for other access land—recognising that some coastal habitats are considerably more sensitive to disturbance than is generally the case for mountain, moor, heath, down or common. Proactive planning now by the nature conservation agencies would help to ensure effective protection of sensitive sites when any statutory access arrangements came into effect.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That final point reminds us that the Bill will not become law for a while, so time is available to put the access right in place for when we have the same access to the areas listed. We could have that right of access in the Bill. I accept the Minister's explanation of why that right should come slightly later than the others. I am happy to support the Bill in its present form.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I reassure the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) that we may be talking about lawyers now but we shall come on to higher life forms later. [Laughter.] I apologise for that remark, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
The clause is the messiest part of what the Minister for the Environment says is a messy Bill. Government and Opposition Members have made that point. My basic preference is for the extension of the right, of access to coastal areas, but I recognise that there are serious issues to be sorted out, especially with regard to nature conservation in such areas.
<P>
My difficulty with the clause is that it is unfinished business­so much is left to secondary legislation. I do not accept entirely the view that it would therefore be better to omit the clause and to return with further primary legislation. Bills on countryside and access do not often come along. I am afraid that, once the present bus has left the stop, there might be a considerable wait for the next one. That is why I want the clause to be precise when the Bill leaves the Committee.
<P>
Under almost no circumstances do I believe in giving Ministers powers. I certainly do not believe in giving Ministers powers to rewrite legislation through secondary legislation after it has been properly considered in the House. As the hon. Member for Stafford said, we have considerable time to study the matter further. The Bill will be in Committee for months and months to come, so we have plenty of time. We shall consider the many amendments yet to be tabled that are no doubt in preparation, so Ministers will have an opportunity to reflect further on the matter.
<P>
I accept that the Minister might not be able to get the provision into a definitive form without consulting more widely and bringing a proposal back to the House. At the end of the day, we might have to be satisfied with elements of secondary legislation to deal with the question. I do not accept the entirely blank cheque that he asks the Committee to accept.
<P>
The amendments that we considered earlier attempted to narrow the field of search a little. The Minister must refine what he is saying and include not only the capacity to extend but the limits to the extension that would be possible through secondary legislation and the parameters of that legislation. He has failed to do that yet. That is not satisfactory. I hope that he will return with something more definitive on Report.
<P>
I feel confident that, if we do not get the clause right in this House, it will be focused on in another place, whose Members will want much greater satisfaction than the Minister is offering. If the Minister insists on retaining the clause for the moment, I urge him to accept that it is unfinished business, that it needs to be refined, and that his officials have plenty of time to consider it further and produce something nearer to a definitive solution.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I thank the Minister for his candour in admitting that the consultation on the clause was rushed and incomplete. I am sure that that is right. I am wary about leaving too much work to the secondary legislation process. We all know how statutory instruments are dealt with. They have an hour and a half—not a great deal of incisive debate and scrutiny. I am concerned about leaving too much for another day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): As a Welsh Member, does the hon. Gentleman also feel scepticism about the capability of the National Assembly for Wales to introduce and scrutinise secondary legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> At present, regrettably, I do, because a huge backlog of secondary legislation is waiting in Cardiff. Perhaps, the Assembly will adopt family-unfriendly hours and work more than three days a week. Who knows? That will make me popular with my party. I am due at a conference at the weekend, so I am in trouble.
<P>
The scrutiny of statutory instruments is generally far inferior to the way in which we are dealing with the Bill now, and the conduct of matters on the Floor of the House. The House itself has sanctioned the destruction of a large SSSI in Cardiff bay for the building of the barrage, so let us not kid ourselves about leaving the matter to another day, and careful scrutiny. We have a problem. The Minister said that the Bill has had a long gestation. He has been waiting all his life to present it. It is still pretty messy in some respects. I firmly believe that any amendment to part I should be made by primary and not secondary legislation.
<P>
Coastal land is too varied, and there are far too many interests involved, to allow the relevant concerns to be subordinated to an overriding right of access. Public safety is also a matter of concern. [interruption.] I shall wind up quickly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to wind up as quickly as he can. He will do so sooner, I am sure, without interruption and background noise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I am much obliged for your protection, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
Two of the main consultees—English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales—oppose coastal access. The Countryside Council for Wales has stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a statutory right of public access to coastal areas is untenable and would compound problems associated with the management of visitors and the conservation of sensitive ecosystems such as dunes and estuarine flats. The voluntary approach provides significant opportunities for improving recreational access but ensures retention of management control.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that will be heeded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In proposing that clause 3 should stand part of the Bill, I repeat that, before any decision is made about whether to extend a statutory right to coastal land, we will ensure that a full public and parliamentary debate takes place. I hear what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy says about statutory Instrument Committees, but we should not underplay the potential for deliberation by such Committees. Issues that are of serious concern to hon. Members will be vigorously debated in Committee and can be raised more widely in the House.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that we have no intention of rewriting primary legislation. As he said, countryside legislation is introduced fairly infrequently—currently about once every 20 years. We certainly need to include a reference to the extension of the right of access to coastal land and foreshore but, for the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to make the provision definitive because there has not been sufficient time for the full consultation process to be concluded.
<P>
There is an important principle here, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for his contribution. We believe in the possibility of extending access to coastal land. We hope, and I believe, that the proposal to extend the statutory right will be successful in increasing opportunities for responsible access while respecting the needs of conservation, land management and other legitimate interests. If the statutory right proves to be successful in respect of mountain, moor, heath and down, I see no reason why we should not consider extending access to coastal land. The Countryside Council for Wales and English Nature have not rejected that idea unqualifiedly and they did not advise against extension. The letter quoted by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire from Baroness Young of Scone suggested that those organisations, quite properly, have expressed concern about natural features that must be considered in detail. They are right to be concerned, but they are not unqualifiedly opposed to extension.
<P>
Parts of the coast are well able to cope with access and always have been. Other parts are precious and at risk, and they need protection, but we should not completely exclude the possibility of access. The issue must be examined carefully, as we have proposed. Let us not exaggerate the impact of an extension of access to coastal land, much of which is already open to the public on a de facto basis without any significant or widespread problems being caused, and no one in Committee has suggested that existing access should be withdrawn. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford said, there is already a statutory right of navigation over the foreshore—I presume that that is when the tide is in.
<P>
Wherever there is a need to protect conservation interests, even apart from the results of our consultation, we will retain the provision in chapter II relating to exclusions and restrictions. Therefore if, and only if, we decide to extend access to coastal land, we want to ensure that the arrangements are sufficiently flexible to take account of the acknowledged circumstances and needs of coastal land. Without such flexibility, it would be more, rather than less, difficult to address the legitimate interests affecting coastal land. I hope that hon. Members will understand and accept the force of that argument.
