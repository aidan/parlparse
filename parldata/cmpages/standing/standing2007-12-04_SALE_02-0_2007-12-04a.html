Members may remove their jackets if they so desire. Could they also

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000256"></a>The
Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill
Rammell):
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in
clause 1, page 2, line 4, at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) Transfer
arrangements shall have effect (and, in particular, a provision
transferring rights or obligations is sufficient to effect the
transfer).&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07120512000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did not say this morning what a pleasure it is to be under your
chairmanship, Miss Begg. I hope that all members of the Committee
realise that this is a minor and technical amendment. The intention
behind the Bill is to give the Secretary of State the legal power to
transfer his rights in respect of income-contingent student loans. We
have reconsidered the drafting of clause 1 and wish to remove any
potential for it to be construed in the commercial sector in a way that
differs from the policy intent behind the Bill. We want it be
completely clear that the Bill will give effect to transfers in itself,
rather than simply giving the Secretary of State the power to make
sales under general legislation governing contracts.</div>
					<a name="07120512000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Bill as it stands is clear&#151;that is certainly my reading, and it
was the view previously, including on Second Reading&#151;it is
important that potential purchasers in the commercial sector should be
in no doubt as to what it enables the Secretary of State to do. If they
thought that there was any question over whether the transfer would
have legal effect, they would probably reduce their valuation of the
loan portfolio and any securities backed by it, which would clearly
damage our prospects of getting good value for money. It is therefore
appropriate to remove that uncertainty, however slight it might be, to
ensure good value for money for the taxpayer. This technical amendment
will put beyond doubt our intention, which is that the Bill, in itself,
will enable sales of loans that will have legal effect. I hope that
that is uncontroversial and I therefore commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div>

						<a name="07120512000257"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): What an
immense pleasure it is to serve under your illustrious chairmanship,
Miss
Begg.</div>
					<a name="07120512000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has made a case for what is essentially a technical change.
However, clause 1 permits the Secretary of State to sell to a purchaser
his rights and obligations relating to student loans, and sensitivities
were expressed on Second Reading and again during the scrutiny that we
enjoyed this morning about the precise nature of that transfer of
competence. In particular, many concerns have been raised about the
impact on students past, future and present, and about commercial
issues relating to the sale and possible subsequent resale.</div>
					<a name="07120512000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely
accept the Minister&#146;s assurances about the effect on students
and that his intent is that they should see no difference. I accept
that the process is meant to be transparent and that students should
fully understand what is going on; indeed, they will be written to with
an explanation of the process. I also accept that they will see no
difference, because the circumstances will be identical; indeed, that
has been made clear in the explanatory notes, and in the
Minister&#146;s comments on Second Reading and this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07120512000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is the matter of Ministers&#146; judgment as to how they use
these powers in practice. For example, there is nothing in the Bill to
prevent different loan repayment arrangements, as long as those
arrangements are made with the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. The
Minister dealt with that this morning and said that if a future
Government took a different view about loans, it might be a matter of
political imperative that the circumstances changed in respect of the
treatment and condition of graduates. Had the Committee been
considering these issues over a longer period, we might have tabled a
probing
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000258"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. Perhaps I can help the
hon. Gentleman. This is a debate on Government amendment No. 1. I
suspect that his speech should be made during the debate on clause 1
stand part, which I will be
calling.</div>
					<a name="07120512000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000259"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am grateful for that advice, Miss Begg, which I
had anticipated. This is a short version of the very extensive summary
that I shall be giving in the clause stand part debate, but I take your
point that I need to address my remarks more specifically to the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07120512000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
I can ask the Minister a simple question: will he tell us specifically
what rights or obligations will be necessary? Will he confirm, once
again, that the amendment will have no impact on the graduate
population concerned? Perhaps in the clause stand part debate we can
explore one or two of the wider aspects of clause 1, which, as I have
said, have given rise to concerns here and
elsewhere.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000260"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I am happy to give that assurance. The minor
technical amendment that we are considering will have no material
impact on graduates. It is being proposed simply to ensure that the
position that we knew and believed to be the case is absolutely 100 per
cent. clear so that there is no room for doubt. I hope, on that basis,
that the amendment will be agreed by the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07120512000261"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Perhaps I can continue on stand part, as advised,
where I left off a few moments ago, Miss
Begg.</div>
					<a name="07120512000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
matter is a question of how Ministers will use their power in the
future. Of course, it is not appropriate for this Committee, or indeed
this Parliament, to bind its successors in that regard. It might well
be the case that a different Government came to a different view about
student loans generally. Nevertheless, given that this is enabling
legislation&#151;we heard that, in essence, both on Second Reading
and today&#151;it is vital that we put on to the statute book
something that will have relevance for the foreseeable future, because
these matters might not be brought to a head immediately. Indeed, it
might be some years before the loan book is sold.</div>
					<a name="07120512000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">My judgment about that matter,
and in a sense my judgment about what lies at the heart of this aspect
of the Bill&#151;clauses 1 and 2 set out the essence of the
Bill&#151;leads me to ask how far we can reasonably protect the
interests of students in perpetuity. How far can we limit the possible
risks associated with the Bill without compromising the commercial
attractiveness of the products? That paradox, if I can put it in those
terms, underpinned much of our earlier discussion.</div>
					<a name="07120512000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that Members are anxious that adequate protection is built into the
Bill. Indeed, the Government moved the simple amendment that we dealt
with a few moments ago for that reason. However, it is equally clear
that the Government cannot build in such protection to a degree that
makes the product unsaleable. The debate that we will have over the
short hours&#151;perhaps days, but certainly not weeks&#151;of this
Committee will focus on that issue.</div>
					<a name="07120512000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am anxious, as I am sure that
the Minister is, to ensure that we have a robust piece of legislation
that protects the interests of all concerned, including the public
interest, while recognising that commerciality means that we cannot tie
up the Bill so tightly that no one would want to buy the product. I
think that that tension needs to be explored in some detail at an early
stage of our consideration.</div>
					<a name="07120512000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to say one more
thing at this juncture about the early clauses. There are real doubts
about both the reason for the Bill and its consequent effects. Let me
explain both those points. There seems to be an inherent confusion
about the motive for the Bill. If the motive is to transfer risk, let
us have a frank debate about why and how that will happen. If, on the
other hand, the motive is to realise the value of assets, let us be
frank about that, too. I am not sure that it can reasonably be argued
that the motive is to do both, because if this is to be an attractive
product, it must be advertised&#151;as it has been by the
Minister&#151;as fairly safe and secure, and not a risky thing to
purchase. If it is not a risky thing for a private investor to buy, it
cannot be a terribly risky thing for the state to
own.</div>
					<a name="07120512000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the motive is realising assets, let us be equally frank. I think that
that is perfectly legitimate, and I have no ideological objection to
that process, to use the Minister&#146;s words. However, if that is
the key objective, it must be underpinned by a secure and robust value
for money framework, as the Minister has described. I am not yet
convinced that we have an absolute assurance in these early clauses
that value for money can be guaranteed, given the vagaries of
Government policy and the changes that take place in ministerial
offices&#151;not that we are expecting the Minister to change; we
want him here in perpetuity, at least until he is cast out at the
election.</div>

						<a name="07120512000262"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Rob Wilson</b> (Reading, East) (Con): My hon. Friend makes a
very interesting point about whether the Bill is about transferring
risk or realising assets. Is he aware that in the <i class="I">Financial
Times</i> on 15 March, it was suggested that the Prime Minister and
Chancellor were using the Bill to sell off public assets to keep the
national debt below 40 per
cent.?</div>
					<a name="07120512000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000263"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I struggle, because I am an
innocent in a world of cynics. I always tend to think the best of
people. My hon. Friend is a businessman of some esteem and has the sort
of sharp mind that those of us who are mere romantics can only envy.
However, he might be right that there will come a time when,
notwithstanding the assurances that we were given about value for
money, somebody in government&#151;it could be the Chancellor, or
even the Prime Minister himself&#151;will say, &#147;Where can we
raise a bit of dosh? I know, we have this enabling legislation.
Let&#146;s bang out the student loan book. We won&#146;t get much
of a price for it, but it&#146;s better than
nothing.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07120512000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07120512000264"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Gordon Marsden</b> (Blackpool, South) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman is making his point with his customary alacrity and,
certainly, some humour. If we are going into the fire sale area of
ancient history, we could perhaps relate some rather difficult examples
for his party. However, I will not stray down that
course.</div>
					<a name="07120512000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
it is perfectly possible to have a prudent approach on the overall
conduct of Government finance. Is it reasonable that a priority for the
Government&#146;s time and effort is keeping something like student
loans in the public sector when there is a perfectly good and robustly
tested mechanism for transferring that risk to the private
sector?</div>
					<a name="07120512000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000265"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. It is possible to
square that circle. While these things are juxtaposed, I do not think
that they are necessarily mutually exclusive. It is entirely possible
for the Government to be prudent, yet to take decisions that enable the
private sector to handle aspects of public policy. The Government
acting as a facilitator is a well established model in Westminster and
in local authorities, with which I know he is
familiar.</div>
				
					<a name="07120512000230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07120512000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the protection of the public interest, and of Ministers, it seems
important that the value-for-money framework should be well established
and well understood and should attract a degree of
non-partisan&#151;one might say bipartisan or perhaps even
tripartisan&#151;support. I have a feeling, as a result of this
morning&#146;s scrutiny more than anything else, that we have to be
even clearer about that to ensure that the marriage between prudence
and appropriate lateral thinking on how the Government should handle
their affairs, as described by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South, is
made.</div>
					<a name="07120512000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister find a way to frame the protection of public interest and the
value-for-money approach in a way that is entirely convincing? I
suggested that it could be appended to the Bill&#151;I do not take a
definitive view on whether it should be on the face of the Bill or
expressed in guidance. However, we need more than we have. The Minister
is right: he mentioned it on Second Reading, it is in <i class="I">Hansard</i>,
and he will mention it again today. However, as Ministers and policies
change, it would be useful to have something on value for money that is
set in stone. That was certainly the sense of this morning&#146;s
discussions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>
					<a name="07120512000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue with the early clauses was explored in some detail, and we will
no doubt return to it in our debate on clause 3. It is the question of
how far the Secretary of State should intervene, for how long and in
what circumstances. We talked at length about the Secretary of
State&#146;s power. This morning we began to test how permissive that
power was. We questioned the Minister and tried to identify the
circumstances in which the Secretary of State might feel that it was
reasonable to intervene in a transaction subsequent to the initial
sale. People were concerned about subsequent sales and how far the
Secretary of State might intervene.</div>
					<a name="07120512000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 is about the principle
of the first sale, and clause 2 goes into a little more detail along
with clause 3. When the Minister sums up clause 1, will he speak a
little about how the initial contract for the sale of the product might
be sufficiently flexible as to have use beyond that first sale? In
other words, would the Government sell the loan book in part, making it
absolutely clear in the contract what the purchaser could and could not
do subsequently? We know that there will be restrictions on what the
purchaser can do in respect of those of the graduate population who are
borrowers.</div>
					<a name="07120512000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
rather less clear about what the purchaser can do in commercial terms.
Can they resell the loans? How can they resell them? In what
circumstances? How will that resale affect the other considerations
that we talked about&#151;the collection of debt, the circumstances
of the loans, and the robustness and reliability of the system? Should
that not be dealt with up front, as we consider clause 1, and in the
first contract? If I were buying the product, I would want to know on
what terms I was doing so. If I were selling it, as a Government, I
would want to know on what terms I was selling it and what might happen
further down the line. It seems to me that the issue of resale will
come back time and again as we consider the Bill. There are worries to
consider.</div>
					<a name="07120512000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07120512000266"></a>
							<b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I must confess that I am
learning as I go along, and I suspect that I am not the only person in
the Committee in that position. I understand from our sitting this
morning that what happens to the bonds is a little irrelevant; the
issue is what will happen to the special purpose vehicle and the extent
to which that can be sold on. That is where we will need to focus our
scrutiny later in Committee.</div>
					<a name="07120512000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000267"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> That is a fair point and, in a sense, the
Minister&#146;s reassurances are built around that vehicle. Again, I
think that we assume a shared support for the principle behind the
Bill, which was established in the debate on Second Reading. We are now
talking about the mechanics of the sale. Parliament is at its best when
we look at the details of something that we do not fundamentally
disagree about, because we can get rid of some of the partisan debate
and move on to serious
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07120512000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bluntly, the
problem is that, typically, one would expect that when a large debt is
sold or purchased it would be broken into parts and resold. That
frequently happens with the sale of debts. The Minister feels that that
will not happen in this case. Indeed, he painted a picture of the
special purpose vehicle for the sale that almost prohibited that
eventuality&#151;it did not prohibit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>it legally, but made it less attractive, one might say. In those
circumstances, it might well be less attractive to buy the debt. If a
potential purchaser is unable to resell it, that will affect both their
likelihood to buy it and the price that they are prepared to pay. That
is what I meant about striking a balance between protection and
commercial viability. I want the Minister to be absolutely clear about
it. He has obviously taken advice on the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07120512000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the vehicle that he has described is designed to minimise risk for
the public interest and for the graduate population, but how does the
Minister expect that to interact with commercial viability when it is
marketed? Will it be marketed as something that is difficult to resell,
or that cannot be resold, or will it be marketed in an altogether more
permissive way? I began to get a picture of that this morning, but I
have yet to be fully convinced about how it might work out in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07120512000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point on the clause is a reprise of the question of the Secretary
of State&#146;s capacity to intervene in those kinds of commercial
matters. There is no question that the Secretary of State is given
powers by the clause; the word &#147;may&#148; rather than
&#147;will&#148; is used a lot, as we will debate later.
Notwithstanding that, it is not clear how far those powers are designed
to intervene in commercial decisions. Are the powers designed solely to
prevent anything untoward from happening as it is perfectly proper that
they should be? Or are they powers that are likely to be exercised,
that the Government expect to be exercised, and that will be exercised
if the Government are unhappy about some of the commercial
circumstances? For example, the book might be sold in parts, in the way
that I described&#151;notwithstanding the hon. Lady&#146;s caveat,
which I appreciate&#151;and there may be concerns about to whom it
was being sold. Would the book disappear abroad? Would we have any
concerns if it did? We might not, but let us at least have that debate.
I would like it to be clear in this and subsequent parts of the Bill to
what extent the Secretary of State is likely to intervene in some of
the commercial questions, rather than merely intervening to protect the
interests of graduates, important though they
are.</div>

					<a name="07120512000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of questions on which I would appreciate clarification. First, I
will pick up on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the purpose of
the clause. It would be very helpful if the Minister would lay out,
either now or at some stage during the Committee, which risks are being
transferred and which the Government are taking in a public and
transparent way for the organisation that is buying
it.</div>
					<a name="07120512000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, this morning we discussed that the Government are continuing
to take the risk of underwriting the debt if a graduate were to die, go
bankrupt, or fail to pay off their loan before the age of 60.
Presumably, that risk is accounted for in the sale, so the purchaser
would be aware that the Government were continuing to take it. I
presume that the Government have analysed exactly which risks they are
transferring, and it would be helpful to understand what those are. Do
the Government intend to hold a share in the special purpose vehicle or
will it be sold on in its entirety? Will they continue to have any
interest in it?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>
					<a name="07120512000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate on value for money
dealt with the extent to which we will realise the net current value of
the loans. Why have the Government decided to sell &#163;6
billion-worth of loans in one go, instead of testing the market by,
perhaps, first selling smaller amounts? The hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West spoke about private finance initiative deals
and the potential for large windfalls. If we sold loans in smaller
chunks, which is possible with such financial products, we could see
what happens with onward sales and whether initial estimates were
correct. Why have the Government decided not to do
that?</div>

							<b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab):
It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Miss Begg. I have a particular interest in this
Bill: the university of Wolverhampton is the most accessible mainstream
university in the United Kingdom with the fifth highest number of
students. Owing to that accessibility, it has a lot of poor students
taking out loans.</div>
					<a name="07120512000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister provide further details on &#147;transfer
arrangements&#148;? That term seems to be very broad, even though the
Bill contains some qualifications of it. What is the mechanism and
role, if any, for Parliament in the scrutiny of such
arrangements? As I read the Bill, that will not be done through
statutory instruments, but will be a commercial decision taken by the
Department. Ultimately, of course, it would be for the National Audit
Office to investigate and for the Public Accounts Committee to examine.
However, will he say a little more about parliamentary
scrutiny?</div>
					<a name="07120512000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 16
of the explanatory notes, which deals with clause 1,
states:</div>
					<a name="07120512000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
example, the Government does not intend to grant purchasers the right
to alter the repayment terms of sold
debts.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07120512000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">That appears
admirable. However, as far as I can see it&#151;I am always open to
correction&#151;that is not in the Bill. Why is it not? I am seeking
reassurance for those who have taken out loans or might do so in the
future.</div>
					<a name="07120512000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1(4)(f)
refers to</div>
					<a name="07120512000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specifying
consequences of the breach of a provision of the transfer
arrangements.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07120512000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister give one or two examples of what penalties might be included
should a loan purchaser breach the provisions of the transfer

					<a name="07120512000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

that others might not. Will he elucidate on
that?</div>

							<a name="07120512000270"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I shall try and respond to a number of the points
made.</div>
					<a name="07120512000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat to the
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings a point that I have made
a number of times, but which is important to state again for the
record: the terms and conditions will be exactly the same whether the
graduate repays their loan to the Government or to the private sector.
I welcome the fact that he accepted my reassurances on that
matter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>
					<a name="07120512000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman implied that
there are concerns about the Secretary of State&#146;s powers under
the Bill. However, let me be clear: the Secretary of State has the
power today, if backed by Parliament, to alter the terms and conditions
of access to student
loans.</div>
				
					<a name="07120512000231"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07120512000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
made a point at the general election about the policy of the official
Opposition&#151;I believe that is still their policy. They wished to
charge a commercial rate of interest on student loans, instead of no
real rate of interest, which continues to be the Government&#146;s
policy. If a Conservative Government were elected, they would be free
to introduce legislation and empower the Secretary of State to alter
terms and conditions. That would be the case even without the Bill,
because the power on terms and conditions resides with the Secretary of
State, whether the loans are owned by the Government or by the private
sector.</div>
					<a name="07120512000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings asked about the ability
to protect the graduate. It is through the measures in the Bill and
through the contractual process that we can afford protections to the
graduate. I gave instances this morning of how we will ensure that it
is the Student Loans Company that carries out the administration on
behalf of any private sector interest and how we will ensure that there
is access to the same independent assessor, where there are problems,
as is the case in respect of Government
debt.</div>
					<a name="07120512000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000271"></a>Mr.
Wilson:
						</b> The explanatory notes state that, under clause 1,
the Secretary of State can sell &#147;part of a
loan&#148;&#151;for example, 40 per cent. That could lead to there
being two owners of the loan: the Student Loans Company and a third
party. How would protection of the individual work in that
situation?</div>
					<a name="07120512000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000272"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> We are not anticipating that
part of a student loan will be sold to the private sector and part will
remain with the Government. Nevertheless, whether someone&#146;s debt
is owned by the Government or by the private sector, exactly the same
terms and conditions will apply and they will be governed by
regulations passed in the
House.</div>
					<a name="07120512000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for South Holland and The Deepings said that he had serious doubts
about the reason for introducing the Bill, and questioned whether it
was about the transference of risk or about an up-front income stream
for the Government. I said this morning&#151;and I repeat&#151;that
it is about both those objectives. On his point about risk, it is
certainly the case, looking forward, that having the ongoing income
stream from student loans on the Government&#146;s books entails a
degree of risk that ideally we would not wish to be on the
Government&#146;s accounts. Because the private sector operates with
that degree of ongoing risk, it would not be a problem for it to engage
with that. That is not inconsistent with the sale being an attractive
investment opportunity from the perspective of private sector
investors.</div>
					<a name="07120512000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made a point about value for money. For the record, I
reiterate what I said this morning. A robust value for money framework
is in place, and although we have made an estimate of the proceeds that
we anticipate gaining from the sales during 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>the next three years, that is not set in tablets of stone. If the value
for money framework is not met, the sales will not go
ahead.</div>
					<a name="07120512000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether the sales were not intended just to help
the Chancellor of the Exchequer meet the fiscal rules. That is
certainly not the case. The proposed sales represent the continuation
in principle of the policy to sell student loans that began in 1997
although, interestingly, it was undertaken using plans drawn up by the
previous Administration. It is also the case that the disposal of
surplus assets is a key part of the present Government&#146;s drive
to improve the efficiency of their asset base. Asset sales are
certainly not a short-term measure to shore up the fiscal position;
rather, they are a vital part of our wider aim to take a longer-term,
more strategic approach to asset management across the board in
government, as recommended by the Lyons
review.</div>
					<a name="07120512000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000273"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I just want to be clear about the
value for money framework, which the Minister says is well established
and robust. What legislative shape will it take, and will it be part of
the Bill? Will it be included in a supporting memorandum to the Bill or
in guidance? Exactly how will it find its way into the legislative
framework?</div>
					<a name="07120512000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000274"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> Again for the record&#151;I have made this
comment a number of times now&#151;I do not believe that the
framework needs to be in the Bill. I read into <i class="I">Hansard</i> last week
the criteria by which we will establish value for money. The Government
are responsible for proceeding with the sales, but the National Audit
Office has rightly said that during the first tranche of sales, it will
undertake an investigation. I am confident that we will be able to
stand up to that value for money assessment. There will then be a
report to the Public Accounts Committee. That process will give the
arrangements the rigour and robustness that Members would
expect.</div>
					<a name="07120512000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings made a point about the
reselling of the special purpose vehicle. It is important to make it
clear that based upon advice, my strong view is that the loans or the
SPV are unlikely to be sold on. If we consider mortgage-style loans,
for example, that has not occurred in almost 10 years with the previous
sales, so there is no track record of the SPV being sold on in that
way. We looked at the issue of windfall gains this morning, and I shall
make the point clear, having considered the issue in further detail.
The refinancing gains, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West mentioned this morning, are not analogous to
windfall gains for the purposes of allowing clawback in the event of
the onward sale of student loans. The 2002 private finance initiative
refinancing code allows for a 50:50 share of refinancing gains, should
private sector partners, during a project, be able to refinance it on
more favourable terms than was originally the case. For example, once a
building is completed, the risks may be reduced and the financier can
provide more favourable loans. However, the key distinction is that no
transfer of assets is involved. Conversely, for the sale of student
loans, we believe that we will achieve best value for money by fully
transferring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>the controlling risks associated with the loans to the private sector,
thus not retaining clawback rights over windfall gains in the event of
an onward sale of the SPV, which in any case, we regard as
unlikely.</div>
					<a name="07120512000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Brent, East asked why we did not start with a tranche of
sales smaller than &#163;6.3 billion. Again, that figure is
an estimate of the proceeds that we anticipate receiving during the
coming three financial years. We have broken the figure down, and in
the first year, we anticipate receiving &#163;3.4 billion. However,
that income sum is not set in tablets of stone. If the market
conditions are not correct and we do not believe that sufficient
information is available to investors to enable us to achieve value for
money, the sales will not take place.</div>
					<a name="07120512000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000275"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> That was not quite my question. I asked why the
Government wanted to do it all in one go. Why not sell a smaller amount
first, and test the market to see what happens to the onward sales and
whether we achieve the correct value for money? Why do it all in one
chunk?</div>
					<a name="07120512000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000276"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> With respect, that is what we are doing. The
student loan sum is &#163;18.1 billion, and we do not plan to sell it
all off. We are taking a prudent approach to the proceeds that we
reasonably estimate we can achieve from the sale in the coming years,
but the figure is not set in tablets of stone. If we do not believe we
can demonstrate value for money, the sale will not go ahead.</div>
					<a name="07120512000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West asked an important
question about the penalties in subsection (4)(f). They will be
determined in detail in relation to each sale&#146;s contract. For
example, they might include compensation to a borrower if there is any
breach in terms. This is an enabling Bill, and it is important that we
retain the flexibility to deal with all
eventualities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000277"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I sense that the Minister is about to reach his
exciting climax, but I want to return to the cost of sale. The stand
part debate, which is about fundamentals, is the best time to deal with
that. This morning, I asked about the cost of the sale. I did not mean
the value of the product being sold, but the cost of the process of
sale. The Minister said that he would make the Committee aware of the
costs that have been incurred so far, and that he would give us an
estimate of the likely costs of the process. Will he bring that figure
to the Committee during our consideration of the Bill or shortly
thereafter, and will he place it in the
Library?</div>
					<a name="07120512000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000278"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I shall certainly do so. As I said to the hon.
Gentleman last week, his definition of &#147;exciting&#148; is
somewhat different from mine. I gave that commitment, and I hope to be
able to provide the figure by the end of our proceedings today. If I
cannot do so, I shall write to members of the Committee and place the
figure in the
Library.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000280"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I shall set out in detail the warranties and
indemnities when I write to members of the Committee. As for the
question of which risks we are transferring, I set out this morning the
range of factors on which investors will base their judgment of risk
when deciding how much money to bid for loans. That will be assessed in
the value for money framework, and I am confident that we can
demonstrate value for
money.</div>
					<a name="07120512000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000281"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> I cannot believe that the Minister&#146;s
Department has not analysed which risks will be transferred, because
the transfer of risk is the whole premise of the Bill. If the Minister
does not have the information now, perhaps he could undertake to write
to us.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000282"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I can do so, but&#151;I may
be wrong&#151;I think that it is fairly straightforward. If the debt
is transferred from the Government to the private sector, a range of
factors must be taken into account to determine how much of the money,
if it remained with the public sector, would eventually come back to
the Government. That is the risk that we are transferring, and I set
out the risk factors this morning: the number of graduates in
employment and earning more than &#163;15,000 a year; the number who
die before their debt is paid off; and the number who become
permanently disabled. The purchaser of a debt will make a judgment on a
range of factors before making their bid. Similarly, the Government
will make a judgment, measuring a bid against the value for money
framework. I believe that, in those circumstances, we will be able to
demonstrate that we have achieved value for money and allow the sale to
go
ahead.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000283"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> The Minister mentioned
something else this morning that I did not know&#151;the Government
will underwrite a loan if a graduate becomes permanently disabled. That
is a risk that the Government will keep. I want a list of which risks
the Government are keeping and which they are transferring. I am sure
that that analysis has been
done.</div>

							<a name="07120512000284"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I think that this is a genuine misunderstanding.
I shall happily put the matter on record by writing to members of the
Committee, but the Government would not retain that risk; permanent
disability is one risk factor that is taken into account in the sale. I
shall happily write to the hon. Lady and set that out the
position.</div>

Hayes:
						</b> I am extremely grateful to the
Minister. As ever, he is being generous, and I am reluctant to drag out
his peroration with a series of Wagnerian peaks and troughs. However,
there are two matters that we must consider. First, to support a point
made by the hon. Member for Brent, East, rights and
obligations&#151;those are the words that she used&#151;must be
sufficient to effect a transfer. To amplify her point, what are those
rights and obligations? Secondly, the Minister has said that the
quantification of risk involves a fairly straightforward series of
actuarial calculations. If those calculations are in the public domain,
can they be collated for our scrutiny? If they are not in the public
domain, but will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>be made available to potential purchasers as he suggests, it does not
seem unreasonable that we, too, should know what they
are.</div>

Rammell:
						</b> No, it is not. I thought that
we debated that this morning. For the record&#151;I am happy to
follow this up in writing&#151;assessing the value of the loan book
requires a number of projections of the repayments that borrowers will
make far into the future. We estimate the rate at which graduates will
repay and the number of loans written off&#151;for example, when
borrowers become permanently disabled. Because such projections must be
based on assumptions and estimates, a degree of risk is built in. Those
risks are transferred to the private sector with sale. I hope that,
with those clarifications, we can agree that the clause should stand
part of the Bill.</div>

						</b> I have a couple of questions
about subsection (4). If the Government lowered the threshold at which
loans could be paid back, the purchaser would get more money than they
expected. The subsection will allow the payment of more money as

MPs&#146; offices. How will the Bill change those arrangements? Will
graduates have to deal with the private sector, or will they continue
to deal with the SLC? Who is the intermediary mentioned in subsection

question about the flexibility in sales contracts and the notes&#146;
reference to HMRC and the SLC, it will be enforced through the
contract, and we do not believe that it needs to be explicit in the
Bill. In response to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>hon. Lady&#146;s question about the transference of risk if the
repayment threshold is lowered, it could be described as a one-way
process. The measure is about the transference of risk. It is fairly
unlikely, whatever Government are in power&#151;although it cannot be
ruled out&#151;that the threshold will be reduced. The process is
about encouraging and asking the private sector to take on longer-term
risk, and protections must be in place for that to
happen.</div>
					<a name="07120512000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to the question of
why HMRC and the SLC are not included in the Bill in this regard, it is
possible that student loan repayment systems might change. The
legislation is enabling&#151;it is about a longer-term programme,
which is why it is important to include such measures in contracts and
not in the Bill.</div>

two thirds of the overpayments are of less than &#163;400. That
happens because it is difficult to predict exactly when somebody will
reach the end of their loan, given the nature of the taxation system
through HMRC. However, in response to Ministers, the Student Loans
Company is rightly looking at how it can improve the system in the
likely final year of repayments. It hopes to communicate directly with
the graduate in question to put a stop to the repayments at an earlier
stage, so that such overpayments do not take place. I hope that that
answers the question.</div>

							<a name="07120512000292"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>We are flying through the Bill, and I would
like to slow things down a little by encouraging a thorough examination
of clause 3. Clause 3 is a fundamentally important part of the Bill
with regard to resale, which was mentioned this morning and this
afternoon as an area of concern. I wish to draw attention to a way in
which the Bill might usefully be amended, and perhaps the Government
might consider it before Report or elsewhere during the Bill&#146;s
passage. This morning we focused on subsection (6) of clause
3&#151;on onward sales&#151;and particularly on line 16 and the
phrase &#147;Transfer arrangements may&#148;, which is followed by
a series of steps that the Secretary of State can take to limit the
circumstances in which transfer might take place. I am not sure why it
says &#147;may&#148; and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>not &#147;will&#148;. The point was dealt with earlier to some
degree, but I do not feel that we have had a satisfactory
answer.</div>
					<a name="07120512000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no doubt that the Government are determined to ensure appropriate
protection. However, it is unhelpful to leave doubts in the Bill about
whether or not the Secretary of State will use those powers. It is
useful for the powers to be stated in the legislation, but I want at
least to probe why &#147;may&#148; has been used, rather than
&#147;will&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07120512000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07120512000293"></a>
							<b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): The Bill provides for
transfer arrangements to be made without the knowledge or consent of
borrowers. That is standard practice in these matters. Does my hon.
Friend feel that something should be included in the Bill that provides
a duty to inform borrowers about the new company to which they are
indebted? Although they deal directly with the Student Loans Company,
borrowers should still have information on the company that is holding
their debt if it is different from the original
company.</div>
				
					<a name="07120512000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000294"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Yes, throughout this part of the
Bill there is a need to strengthen the kind of reassurance that my hon.
Friend draws our attention to&#151;I suppose linguistically that that
should have been &#147;to which she draws our attention&#148;; one
does not like to end sentences with prepositions.</div>
					<a name="07120512000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
about the intent of the Secretary of State. It is about whether we are
being slightly too permissive in the way in which we address those
issues of assurance, security and certainty, which are necessary if
graduates are to feel that their circumstances have, as Minister
assured us, remained unchanged by the transfer. Therefore, with respect
to clause 3, I wonder about both my own suggestion and that of my hon.
Friend.</div>
					<a name="07120512000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I would go further. If one looks at line 23, it might be useful
for the Government to prohibit transfers to an organisation, body or
individual outside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. The Minister
will have to tell me whether that is legally possible. I have a slight
worry that if we are passing into law an arrangement that gives the
Secretary of State certain powers to affect ongoing sales, and if that
happens to contradict the commercial reality of an ongoing sale to
another country, a multinational company, or a body that is outside our
jurisdiction, would that have much weight in terms of both the public
interest and, more especially, the interests of graduates? I wonder
whether we should be less permissive in respect of ongoing sales and
whether we should say something about risk, or perhaps about a
prohibition on the sale to multiple purchasers, although that is a
matter for the Minister to comment on.</div>
					<a name="07120512000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the point made by the
hon. Member for Brent, East that such a move is unlikely, given the
assurances that we have had. In respect of ensuring the kind of
certainty and security that we all want, the worst case scenario would
be for many people to purchase parts of this book all over the globe
and for us to feel that we have lost control about what then happens. I
guess that the Minister will assure us that that is fanciful and that
every step will be taken to ensure that that does not happen. However,
there is no mention of the word &#147;prohibit&#148; in the Bill.
We have a lot of mays, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>expectations and hopes, and a fair amount of good will, but we do not
really prevent any of those concerns in the Bill. I wonder whether we
should be slightly more restrictive about how we deal with this. I
raise the points for the sake of proper scrutiny and discussion, but
there are legitimate fears about resale in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="07120512000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3
specifically gives the purchaser the right to sell the loans to another
buyer after the initial sale and, subject to any limits on that right,
specifies the powers of the Secretary of State in that regard.
Therefore, we are accepting that the resale might take place and that
we need to be cautious about that, otherwise we would not have included
anything in the Bill about the Secretary of State&#146;s capacity to
intervene.</div>
					<a name="07120512000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The necessary
safeguards are of critical importance, given that history has taught us
that loans can be repackaged and can involve a large number of
different players, some of whom could be outside the jurisdiction of
the Secretary of State. It is appropriate to say another word about the
security of data. We do not want to dwell on the Government&#146;s
misfortunes because that would be both unkind and unheroic. It is
important to point out that the greater the number of people involved
in this, and the further the chain moves from its place of origin, the
more those doubts will loom large. I think that the safeguards are
critical. I am grateful for what the Minister has said both on Second
Reading and again today, but this is critically important to clause
3.</div>
					<a name="07120512000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second Reading,
on this very subject, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made such
a point when he described the hypothetical example of a Lithuanian bank
securing a package of loans. Under the current proposals, it seems
entirely possible that a foreign bank could purchase part or all of
this package, and that would create all kinds of issues regarding their
relationship with both the debt and their own local policy, in as much
as it contradicted our approach. I have nothing against Lithuania, by
the way, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has
not either.</div>
					<a name="07120512000233"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="07120512000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also wonder whether we might think about the position of EU students.
Again, we had some discussion about that this morning. There is a
question of how this will change over time. The Minister
accepts&#151;he predicted it&#151;that this is a growing issue. The
changes to the entitlement of EU citizens are only just beginning to
take effect. Indeed, they will take effect during the course of the
sale of this product. Given that we might not sell the book in part or
whole for some time&#151;perhaps some years&#151;by the time that
it is sold, this will be a matter of even greater significance. We
could well be dealing with a larger number of people who are not living
in the United Kingdom. There are questions about both the management of
this process and the collection of debt. This seems to be the aspect of
the Bill on which Minister might want to reaffirm one or two
points.</div>
					<a name="07120512000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to establish how far the Secretary of State is likely to
intervene in any commercial issues associated with the sale. I am sorry
to return to this, but it is relevant to the clause&#151;I made the
point on clause 1. I am still not clear whether the Secretary of State
would intervene if he felt that certain commercial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>arrangements were not in the interests of the graduate community or the
nation. Would he intervene in such circumstances? It says in the clause
that he might, or may, but we are not really clear about whether he
would. Quite how would he intervene, given that this sale might take
place some way down the line? It might not happen in the first six
months or the first year. Indeed, we might be talking about events that
take place a good time after the original transaction.</div>
					<a name="07120512000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that with those points
on the clause we have once again highlighted some of our concerns about
resale and the way in which the Bill is framed in that respect. I press
the Minister once again to look more closely at this to see whether
these words might be strengthened so that no one can be in any doubt
that the Secretary of State would have not only the power, but the
duty, to intervene if the circumstances of resale were unacceptable or
inappropriate.</div>

							<a name="07120512000295"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> I want to pick up on the points that the hon.
Gentleman has just made and also our discussion this morning. I was a
bit baffled by the reply that changing &#147;may&#148; in
subsection (6) to &#147;shall&#148; would completely change the way
in which the sale would be recorded on the Government order books. I do
not understand that, so will the Minister explain it? Using the word
&#147;may&#148; seems to make it perfectly clear that the
Government intend to use this power. I cannot see how changing the word
to &#147;shall&#148; alters
that.</div>
					<a name="07120512000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further answer that was given this morning suggested that the reason
that the power was permissive was because circumstances could change
and the Government may or may not wish to use that power. Surely if the
power is there, it will be written clearly into the Government&#146;s
contract with whoever buys the debt. If it is not written into the
contract, I cannot see how it can be changed retrospectively, if we
suddenly find that circumstances have changed and the Government really
want to use it. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain
that.</div>
					<a name="07120512000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another question
that I asked this morning that was not really answered was about what
circumstances would be required for the Government to use any of these
powers. I accept that the Minister might wish to use the three powers
separately, but could he outline some of the likely circumstances that
would trigger the use of the Secretary of State&#146;s
powers?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000296"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> Following on from the comments of the hon. Member
for Brent, East, I understood what the Minister said this morning about
the use of the words &#147;may&#148; and &#147;shall&#148;, and
whether or not this is on the public accounts. The situation seems
strange, but that is the advice that has been given by the experts. The
hon. Lady&#146;s point was that if there was no prohibition in the
original sale, could a prohibition be retrospectively inserted into the
original sale document?</div>
					<a name="07120512000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there was no prohibition in
the original sale, company A, having bought from the Government, can
sell to company B so that it owns the loan book. Can the Secretary of
State insert a prohibition for the future into the arrangements with
company B, or is it the case that once the Government have decided, as
they might, not to insert that prohibition in the original sale to
company A, they cannot insert it later, even if the loan 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>book is sold on down the line to various financial institutions that are
perceived by the Government to be dodgier and
dodgier?</div>
					<a name="07120512000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Secretary of State intend to insert into the transfer arrangements any
prior notification clause so that company A, if it considers selling
the loan book to company B, must first notify the Secretary of State to
give him the opportunity to consider whether to insert a prohibition at
that point? Otherwise, if no such protection is built in, company A
could buy the loan book and subsequently sell it on to company B,
potentially without the Government even knowing. If the Government took
a different view of the suitability of company B, they would have
missed the opportunity to review whether the arrangements needed to be
amended.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000297"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> That was precisely the point that
I was trying to make when I spoke, rather inelegantly, about a chain.
Given that the process that the hon. Gentleman has described might take
place over many months or years, it is entirely possible that the
Government might be unaware. The Bill suggests that the Secretary of
State may include provision to make himself automatically a party to
any onward sales contracts, but, frankly, if that were to involve a
multiplicity of bodies over a considerable period of time, there would
be real doubts as to whether he would have that capacity, purely
because he would be ignorant of the facts.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000298"></a>Rob
Marris:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am probing the
Government on whether there would be some kind of notification clause,
if I can put it like that. With the greatest respect to my hon. Friend
the Minister, for whom I have the greatest regard, this is arguably a
Treasury Bill, and this is probably the ninth such Committee on which I
have sat. People who deal with the Treasury are seared by the
experience of Mapeley&#151;that name might mean something to my hon.
Friend.</div>
					<a name="07120512000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mapeley
bought Government buildings and sold back the lease. Unfortunately, the
then Paymaster General was, to put it charitably, not fully informed by
her officials as to the identity of Mapeley. There were two Mapeleys.
One was called something like Mapeley Holdings UK Ltd and the other was
called something like Mapeley Holdings, Bermuda Ltd. Hon. Members can
guess which company ended up owning that estate and not paying tax in
the UK, which was rather ironic given that the buildings had formerly
been owned by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and had been
leased back to it. I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Minister can
assure me that there will not be any transfer to an offshore financial
company that will not be subject to tax in the United
Kingdom.</div>
					<a name="07120512000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
thought be given to putting prohibitions in the sale agreement in
respect of a further transfer from an onshore company, or company A in
my example, to an offshore company&#151;company B&#151;because
otherwise the Government will be losing out on tax revenues? If the
loan book ended up in the hands of an offshore company&#151;for
example, &#147;SLC (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd&#148;&#151;that might
ex post facto affect greatly all the value for money calculations that
had been made before the process was put in train. One part of the
value for money calculations would be the potential corporation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>tax payments from the purchasing company, as a trading organisation,
back to the Government. However, if that trading company, or an
ultimate purchaser down the line, were not UK-registered and not paying
UK tax, it would somewhat change the
equation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000299"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> Let me set this out in as up front a way as I
can. I hope that I can reassure members of the Committee. It is
pertinent to ask how the Government will be sure that an ongoing sale
on the part of a special purpose vehicle has taken place, despite the
fact that for 10 years we have been operating a special purpose vehicle
in respect of mortgage-style student loans and there has been no onward
sale. There is no question of the Government being unaware because we
will have used, in the initial contract, one or other of the powers
under clause 3(6) to ensure legally that we are a party to the onward
sales contract. We would expect a notification clause to be part of the
contract, and we would ensure that there was. I hope, on that basis,
that members of the Committee are
reassured.</div>
					<a name="07120512000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
question asked by the hon. Member for Brent, East, I am not sure,
according to the rules of the House, whether I am allowed to
acknowledge that I have debated it with my officials. I am sure that
<i class="I">Hansard</i> will correct me if I was not supposed to have done so.
Were we to say &#147;shall&#148; instead of &#147;may&#148; in
clause 3, that would be contrary to the current accounting rules in
that the proceeds would not count as a sale and thus release resources
to
reinvest.</div>

						<b class="B">

basis?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000301"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I am more than happy to do so. The reason for the
proposal, as a possible tool in our tool box, is that the rules
governing the classification of Government debt change from time to
time. As I said this morning, the rules are different in respect of the
mortgage-style student loans, which is why the sale under discussion
will be undertaken on a different basis from the basis of the original
loans. I will happily write and confirm
that.</div>
					<a name="07120512000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
question asked by the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings,
we have made matters clear. Our views will be reported in
<i class="I">Hansard.</i> As with any commercial sale of debt, it is not normal
practice to write to the borrower in advance. However, as soon as a
sale has taken place, the Student Loans Company will write to the
individual graduates who are
affected.</div>
					<a name="07120512000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for sales to bodies outside the United Kingdom, to which the hon.
Gentleman referred, there is a track record. Thinking back to asset
sales undertaken under the Conservative Government, I do not recall
them saying that there ought to be prohibition on the sales of gas and
water. The key protections are that borrowers should be protected, that
we have sufficient mechanisms in place to give us control, and that
loans remain governed by English
law.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000302"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> There are two issues. One is the protection of
those graduates involved, which is critical in respect of multiple
sales and sales that take place outside UK jurisdiction. Indeed, we
would not have to build so many caveats into the Bill if that was not a
problem; we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>are giving the Secretary of State additional powers partly to ensure
that very protection. The other of my concerns, the effect on the
public interest in respect of offshore companies, was raised by the
hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West. I use the term
&#147;outside UK jurisdiction&#148; broadly, but it might include
the sort of concerns that he raised. I speak not only about the
protection of the graduates concerned but about the public interest.
Multiple purchasers in foreign countries and a range of offshore
companies&#151;is that the future we want to see for the student loan
book?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000303"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> If we look at the track record,
that is not the scenario that we are projecting. It is my understanding
that through paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to clause 3(6), which put a
number of tools at our disposal, the Secretary of State will be able to
make judgments about the onward sale in order to protect the graduate.
That is of fundamental importance. It is clear&#151;for the
record&#151;that we have those protections in
place.</div>
					<a name="07120512000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also raised some questions about data&#151;an issue
that was the subject of some debate in Committee this morning. He
argued that the greater the number of people involved, the greater the
potential for risk. It is important to state, as I did this morning,
that for practical purposes personal data will remain with the Student
Loans Company, which will act as agents of the purchaser. The bonds
will be tradeable in the market, but loans will remain with the special
purpose vehicle, which is most unlikely to be sold.</div>
					<a name="07120512000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The criminal
penalties in respect of the untoward and illegal onward passing of data
are significantly increased under the Bill, with a maximum prison
sentence of two years. We have a very robust
framework.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000304"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> There are two circumstances in
which data may need to be made available. The first is in order to
tempt a prospective buyer. That would not mean that the data did not
need to be anonymised, but enough information would need to be made
available to potential purchasers to ensure them of the character of
the risk and the value of the product. The second circumstance, which
was alluded to this morning, is for audit purposes. Will the Minister
explain both circumstances in more detail, so that the Committee can
give them full and proper
consideration?</div>
					<a name="07120512000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120512000305"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> I am happy to try to do that.
Before a sale takes place, a potential purchaser needs to understand
the type of debt being purchased. For example&#151;I think that I
used these words this morning&#151;an indication would be given of
the graduate income level, age and other such factors, but it would be
given on an anonymised basis so that it could not be traced back to
individuals. That is an important protection. There would also be a
need for information, after sale, for audit purposes. To some extent,
audits are undertaken on a sample basis, so a sample of individual
personal details would need to be transferred to the special purpose
vehicle. However and as I said this morning, that would be undertaken
in respect of the existing mortgage-style student loans. That data
transfer is undertaken by a protected, encrypted channel, and that
would be our intention for the income-contingent loans.</div>

					<a name="07120512000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the hon. Gentleman
raised points about other European Union students. I made the point
this morning that European Union students have been able to access
loans for fees only since 2006, so we are not yet into the repayment
phase. There is EC directive 2001, which, crucially, enables us to take
action in the UK courts to chase a debt that is in default, and then to
have that ruling enforced within the court of the country in which that
individual resides.</div>
					<a name="07120512000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that that will give
us a robust protection over time. We want certainty that, even if a
European Union student comes from a country where the cost of living
and average income are less than in this country&#151;so that they
are probably unlikely to end up earning more than &#163;15,000 a
year&#151;the banding system for thresholds will reasonably ensure
that people repay, wherever they reside after
graduation.</div>

							<a name="07120512000306"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> This is an important issue, and the reason is that
we may not be selling the loan book in the short term. We have all been
clear that this may take place over many years, according to market
conditions. Given the likely change in the character of the student
population, and the changes that the hon. Gentleman has detailed, it
would be interesting to know whether he and his Department have done
any modelling on the nature of the student population, and the
consequent nature of debt. He has indicated that they have, because he
started to talk about the circumstances in some of the countries of the
EU and their ability to repay loans. That modelling would be critically
important to the sales, would it not? If I were a potential purchaser,
for example in 2009 or 2010, I would want to be looking at the
proportion of people who had taken these loans who live in different
parts of the EU. By the way, Miss Begg, when I mention the EU, I expect
a thunderclap and a streak of lightning, but we will leave that to one
side. I would want to conduct that examination so that I had a
reasonable chance of accurately assessing repayment profiles. Is that
reasonable? Is that modelling taking place, or has it taken place? If
not, should it take
place?</div>

record is not known, because the loans for fees for European Union
students started only in 2006. There is, however, a certain amount of
good track record for UK citizens who live abroad or who emigrate to
other countries&#151;where such records exist and where there are
robust repayment systems. With the legal processes that are now in
place, which have been achieved only by co-operation with our European
partners on repayment mechanisms, I am confident that we can ensure
that wherever students reside their loans will be
repaid.</div>

						</b> I am not sure that my hon.
Friend the Minister had the opportunity to answer my question on prior
notification by company A of a proposed sale to company B, and I wonder
whether he could deal with that. Let me mention another issue, however.
I might have misunderstood what he said. My understanding is that what
he said this morning about the word &#147;shall&#148; in clause
3(6) was slightly different from what he said this afternoon. I am in
no way suggesting that he is ducking and diving, but I want to be
clear.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>
					<a name="07120512000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding this morning was that if the word &#147;shall&#148;
replaced the word &#147;may&#148; in clause 3(6), that would mean
that the loans would stay on the public account. I understood my hon.
Friend as saying that, were we to leave the word &#147;may&#148; in
the Bill, and the Secretary of State then inserted a prohibition in the
sale agreement under that permissive power, the loans would not go off
the public account. If we get the wording one
way&#151;&#147;shall&#148;&#151;it means they will not go off
the public account; on the other hand, if we leave &#147;may&#148;
in the Bill, and the Secretary of State then inserts a prohibition,
they also will not go off the public account. If it be the latter case,
that would tend to militate against the Secretary of State using the
permissive power to insert the prohibition. I would like some idea as
to which of those two scenarios might be the
case.</div>

						</b> I am genuinely not trying to
duck and dive. It is not my style to do so. My clear understanding is
that, were we to insist upon the use of clause 3(6)(a), that would lead
to a reclassification of the debt, and we would not be able to transfer
the debt from the public to the private sector. However, the rules on
classification may change, which is why, at this stage, we feel it
prudent to keep that provision in. We would not want to have to come
back and legislate were the rules to
change.</div>

Government are very unlikely to use this power until such a time as

that the Government do have the power to effect these further

the clause should not say &#147;shall&#148;. Either the Government
have these powers, or they do not. Either they intend to use them, or

drawing up the rules on the classification of Government debt, although
clearly I support them. They are there for good reasons. My clear
understanding is that were we to insert the word &#147;shall&#148;
in clause 3(6)(a), that would make us unable to classify the debt as a
transfer from the public to the private sector. However, there are
other protections available to us in clause 3(6)(b) and (c) to enable

say, clearly and precisely, is that the advice I have, based on the
accounting rules, is that the mechanisms available to us in clause
3(6)(b) and (c) enable us to protect the graduate interest. Were we to
insert the word &#147;shall&#148; in respect of paragraph (a) so
that in all circumstances we would have to prohibit the making of
further transfer arrangements without the consent of the Secretary of

						</b> I am genuinely seeking clarification. I am not
trying to prolong the Committee. I understand the Minister&#146;s
point about inserting the word &#147;shall&#148;, but that is not
the discussion that we had a few moments ago, which was that if he
enacted paragraph (a), it would affect the way in which the loans were
recorded on the balance sheet. I thought that we had come to a point
where we understood that the Government are very unlikely to use the
powers under paragraph (a) until the Government accounting rules are
changed. Therefore, for the Committee&#146;s purposes, paragraphs (b)
and (c) are essential in terms of the protection that is enabled. I am
trying to get the Minister to clarify what those protections really
mean.</div>

						</b> My apologies. Perhaps it would help if I set this
matter out in writing. We will certainly have at our disposal the
protections afforded by clause 3(6)(b) and (c), which will enable the
Secretary of State to insert into a contract, for example, the
stipulations that we expect the Student Loans Company to continue to
administer the loans on behalf of the private purchaser and that the
graduate will continue to have access to the independent assessor.
Those are two examples, but I will happily set out for the hon. Lady in
writing the kind of examples that those paragraphs will give
us.</div>

						</b> Perhaps I might make a suggestion to the Minister
because it seems to me that we are in a bit of a pickle. My
understanding is beginning to emerge from the murky darkness into a
clear light. It seems that the Minister is telling us that paragraphs
(b) and (c) are sufficient, in his judgment, to offer the kind of
protection that hon. Members in the Committee&#151;and I am sure in
the whole House&#151;would seek. In that case, the questions are
begged: why are paragraphs (b) and (c) grouped with paragraph (a), and
why can they not be prefixed with the word &#147;shall&#148;? Why
are those paragraphs all part of the same
provision?</div>
					<a name="07120512000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with the hon. Lady that the likelihood of using paragraph (a), given
the current rule, is small. That is why &#147;may&#148; is there,
but I am not sure that that is a convincing prefix for paragraphs (b)
and (c). I want to revisit this issue on Report because it is clear
that the eagle eyes of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have
focused on it. We all spotted this &#147;may&#148; and
&#147;shall&#148; issue and thus we all spotted what seems to be a
potential
weakness.</div>

has gone some way to reassuring us that there is strength at least in

power to collect student loans lies with HMRC and the Student Loans

of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions, we have made it clear that we
intend to ensure, by use of contractual obligations, that the private
purchasers, through the SPV, use the Student Loans Company to
administer the loan repayments on its behalf. We intend the Student
Loans Company to carry through its review of the administration of
student finance, which is called &#147;Customer First&#148;. That
is very much our intention. However, if we were to stipulate in statute
today that the Student Loans Company would carry out that task for ever

come back to legislate on that issue when there are already other

are specified in legislation. The nature of legislation is that
sometimes one has to specify those agents and bodies&#151;those
organs of government. The Government would be much more likely to
satisfy the doubts and assuage the fears of those who have reservations
about this matter if it were to put what the Minister said at the

my goodness, if that view prevailed in respect of legislation, we would

						</b> This clause would, in effect, extend the power of
the Welsh Assembly to administer these matters. That may be a slightly
clumsy way of putting it, but I think that is its gist. For the
purposes of the record, can we have an assurance of what that would
mean in practice? Presumably, it means that the Welsh Assembly might
take a different view about when to sell, what to sell and how to sell
the loan book. Also, what estimate have the Government made of the
incompatibilities that that situation could
produce?</div>

						</b> I asked a question this morning during the
pre-legislative scrutiny and the Minister said that the proceeds from
any sales would come straight back into the Treasury. It is not clear
to me what benefit&#151;if any&#151;there is to the Welsh Assembly
in enacting any of these powers.</div>

							<a name="07120512000337"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> That invites another question, about the proceeds
from the sales generally, but it is a very good point. We are not for a
moment suggesting that the proceeds of the sale should be hypothecated,
because that would be a spending commitment and if I were to make that
I would be on the carpet, even though the Opposition Whip has briefly
left the room. However, the hon. Lady is right that there is an issue
about the receipts of the sale. That raises the question why the Welsh
Assembly was included. More especially, there is an issue about the
compatibility of any policy that might be enacted in Wales that was at
odds with what was done here. Given that an immense number of students
from Wales study in England and students from England study in Wales,
it would seem to be in all our interests to ensure that policy is
consistent and coherent. Has the Minister made any assessment of that?
In offering that assessment to the Committee, will he address the
pertinent point raised by the hon. Lady?

Rammell:
						</b> Let me set out the general
framework, and then I shall respond to those two points. As
responsibility for student loans in Wales was devolved to Welsh
Ministers back in 2006, it is important that the provisions apply
equally to Wales. Any decision on the future sale of the Welsh loan
book needs to be made in Wales by Welsh Ministers. Clause 8 gives Welsh
Ministers the power to do that in the way that they have requested.
Welsh Ministers are keen to ensure that maximum value for money is
achieved for Welsh student loans and the powers are in place so that we
can ensure that they do so. The Bill will enable them to decide when
they deem it appropriate to use the powers, bearing in mind the
relevant economic and value-for-money considerations&#151;exactly the
same value-for-money considerations that govern our decisions in
England.</div>
					<a name="07120512000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
accordance with the new devolution settlement agreed in 2006, the Bill
will confer executive powers on Welsh Ministers to sell loans for which
they are already responsible, mirroring the powers that it gives the
Secretary of State for loans for which he is responsible. Those mirror
powers are appropriate in these circumstances, as it is clear that that
is what Welsh Ministers require. The clause confers on Welsh Ministers
functions of an executive nature; it does not give them the power to
make that legislation.</div>
					<a name="07120512000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me pick
up on the points that have been made. The first was about the
difference of treatment that we may end up with between Wales and
England. The responsibility is devolved. Part of the settlement of
devolution is that the Welsh Assembly is allowed and empowered, in
areas for which it has responsibility, to make decisions that may be
different from those in England. In terms of the scale of things, the
sums of money are relatively small, as Wales
represents &#163;1.1 billion of the &#163;18.1 billion
total student loan book. On whether there is an incentive for Welsh
Ministers to undertake the step because money comes back to the
Consolidated Fund and not the Welsh block, the money coming back to
Government will give the Government as a whole greater flexibility in
determining its spending priorities. Welsh Ministers cannot have the
money directly attributed to their block but, as a DIUS Minister, I
cannot have that money directly attributed to DIUS. Nevertheless, I am
delighted and delirious to be taking the Bill
forward.</div>

							<a name="07120512000339"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> It is, however, rather odd. The Minister is a
Minister in the Westminster Government. It is odd for Welsh Ministers
to make a decision that will have an effect only on the books here and
that will have no obvious direct impact on their budgets. Is he aware
of any discussions between the Treasury and Welsh Ministers about
whether that will have any impact on that
budget?</div>

Rammell:
						</b> Just as I do not comment on discussions that I
and the Secretary of State have with Treasury Ministers, it is not
appropriate and would not be right for me to comment on any discussions
that may or may not take place between members of the Welsh Assembly
Government and the Treasury.</div>
					<a name="07120512000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fundamental principle
governing sales in both England and Wales is that they will enable the
transfer of risk and an income stream that enables us to make choices
about where that money should be spent. That was the principle on which
we had cross-party support for the Bill on Second Reading. I hope that
we can maintain that support in Committee.</div>

						</b> Thank you, Miss Begg, for
presiding over the Committee smoothly, efficiently and effectively. I
congratulate all Committee members on the good-humoured nature of the
discussion. A number of hon. Members commented on the fact that this
might be a Finance Bill rather than an education Bill. I do not believe
that that is the case. It is appropriate that education spokespersons
lead this discussion. Important points of principle have been at stake
that will bring real benefits to the Government. Through the mechanisms
that we put in place, we can protect the graduate
interest.</div>

You have shown remarkable indulgence to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>Committee members, which has allowed us to debate these issues, even
though our consideration has been concertinaed.</div>
					<a name="07120512000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
couple of points to make, however. First, we learned a great deal this
morning, but I wonder whether it would be better in the future&#151;I
make no criticism of today&#146;s proceedings&#151;to have a gap
between the evidence-taking sessions and subsequent consideration of
Bills. My second point is that we look forward to further consideration
of the legislation and perhaps to tabling one or two amendments on
Report, as we were encouraged to do by the Minister, when we can
explore matters in even greater
detail.</div>
					<a name="07120512000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is always a pleasure to serve in Committees opposite the Minister and
with such an immensely sagacious group of colleagues. I thank all hon.

						</b> I, too, thank you, Miss Begg, for the way in
which you have chaired this Committee. I found it a very useful debate,
particularly this morning&#146;s session. I hope that this innovation
in Public Bill Committees will be taken up by all Members.</div>
					<a name="07120512000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to add to the point made by the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings. It would be useful to have a gap between sessions, because
this morning&#146;s opportunity to question witnesses changed the way
in which I thought about the Bill. It was a good example of the way in
which Members on both sides can contribute and ask pertinent questions.
The Committee was able to move forward considerably from the point at
which we started this
morning.</div>
