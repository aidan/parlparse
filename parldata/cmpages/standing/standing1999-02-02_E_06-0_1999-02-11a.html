<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I beg to move amemdment No. 17, in page 4, line 45, after `Wales)' insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) in sub-paragraph (1),'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 18 to 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> May I start on this bright and early morning by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Cook, and to what we very much hope will be the last lap&#151;[Interruption.] well, I may have spoken too soon&#151;of what has been a good-humoured and worthwhile Committee stage.
<P>
The amendments provide for a lower age limit of 20 on the requirement to register under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 in all three jurisdictions&#151;England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. That means that those committing the new offence who are under 20 do not have to register. Our starting point is that someone is working with young people who have been identified as sufficiently vulnerable to need the protection of the new offence, and who abuses that position of trust should be subject to registration.
<P>
There is an argument that, given the consensual nature of the sexual activity, the offence of abuse of trust differs fundamentally from other sexual offences and, hence, registration is not appropriate in any circumstances. I am not convinced by that. However, there is an important difference between culpability, which applies to all those committing the offence, and risk, which may not. Under the Bill, abuse of trust in specified circumstances should be viewed as criminal, provided that the offender is over 18. Under the Bill, a 19-year-old who has a relationship with a 17-year-old in respect of whom he is in a position of trust is properly guilty of an offence.
<P>
However, judged in terms of risk to the community, which is the principle underlying the Sex Offenders Act 1997, an age limit of 20 can be justified. The risk to the community is much less if a 19-year-old has consensual sexual relations with a 16 or 17-year-old, irrespective of the relationship of trust. The age limit achieves consistency with schedule 1 of the 1997 Act, which exempts certain offenders from the requirement to register, depending on their age and the age of their victim. For example, an offender who is under 20 and who is convinced of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged between 13 and 16 is not required to register. It would, therefore, be anomalous if those under 20 were required to register for the abuse of trust offence, but not for unlawful sexual intercourse.
<P>
For the reasons that I have outlined, the amendment is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> I welcome you, Mr. Cook, to what I, too, hope will be our last sitting. We welcome the Government's amendment because it would remove an anomaly, as the Minister explained. It makes sense for him to refer back to the original point of the sex offenders register, which is to keep control of people at risk of further offending. We accept the amendment and look forward to our discussions on other requirements in respect of the sex offenders register.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison (Hertsmere):</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook. I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation. His last point was the strongest. There would be an anomaly if an offender had to register for the abuse of trust offence, but did not have to do so for the other offence.
<P>
Although we are fixing on 20 as the starting age for entry on the sex offenders register, we must not thereby give a wider signal on the importance of the new offence. The offence applies to people who are 18 or over and are in a position of trust, but, despite the fact that people aged between 18 and 20 are not liable to have their names entered on the sex offenders register if convicted of an offence, we should still send out the message that Parliament has fixed 18 as the age of criminal liability for such an offence and that people in a position of trust who are over 18 will attract criminal charges if they breach the law.
<P>
As we made plain in other debates, we must be serious about the concept of breach of trust. I have reservations on whether the abuse of trust provisions that we have established are wide enough. In this context, we need to send out the same message that we are serious about the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I am slightly worried about the proposed change. If an employer who has in his charge children or young people in a sensitive situation wants to take on another employee, he will want to conduct himself properly and will consult the sex offenders register. If I understand the amendment correctly, such an employer will not be able to discover whether a would-be employee has been guilty of an abuse of trust if the offence was committed before the applicant's 20th birthday, however serious the offence may have been.
<P>
I realise that some offences may not be so serious. The Minister was dealing with such matters in a sort of shorthand, and he mentioned the pottery class, a situation that we can all understand. However, some offences may be severe and involve a gross abuse of trust, even though they are committed by people who are not yet 20. If a would-be employee is guilty of such an offence, I see no harm in his being at least being required to give an explanation to an employer. However, under the amendment, he will not need to say anything, because the employer will have no knowledge of the offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> This has been a short but useful debate. It enables me to underline the Government's absolute determination to send out the message that culpability applies at the age of 18 just as much as it does at the age of 20. My response to the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), however, is that we want to ensure a proportionate response that takes account of risk.
<P>
The question is a matter of risk and proportionality; most important, however, is consistency with schedule 1 to the 1997 Act, which exempts certain offenders from the requirement to register, depending on their age and the age of the victim. In the example that I gave, an offender under 20 who was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged between 13 and 16 would similarly not be required to register. That provision has been determined by Parliament in previous considerations. The Sexual Offenders Act 1997 is concerned with risk. It does not detract from the culpability of the offenders; the conduct is criminal whether the person is 18, 19 or 20. However, the balance of opinion in the Committee, with the possible exception of the hon. Member for Gainsborough, is that a person under 20 should have no need to register under the Act.
<P>
It is a question of judgment. The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and others take the view that 20 is right. I understand the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but I hope that he will reflect on my response, which was clear on the question of culpability. If he considers also the questions of risk and consistency, I hope that he will not feel it necessary to divide the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
I am sure that the amendment will find favour with the Government as it is in a similar vein to the previous set of amendments. It also relates to issues of risk and consistency, in particular that of whether courts should have the discretion to put someone on the register. We agree with the Minister that the register exists to prevent further risk to the public. The people whom we want on it are those who are likely to reoffend, so that we have an active register in which the police, probation service, and so on have active control over those who are on it.
<P>
On the other hand, we do not want people put on the register who are very unlikely to reoffend. The Minister identified those under 20 as a blanket category of such people. We believe that other categories&#151;not blanket but discretionary categories, which would have to be decided by the courts&#151;might also be identified. For example, a young teacher has a relationship with a 17-year-old. The teacher is taken to court under the abuse of trust legislation and may receive a caution, fine or other appropriate punishment, but the couple may subsequently marry. That is not inconceivable; teachers have in the past married their pupils. The abuse of trust is reprehensible and should be punished, but to put such a person on the sex offenders list for some years because he committed a consensual offence with a person who is now his spouse would not benefit the system or the community.
<P>
The courts should have discretion, given that cases will often come up some time after the offence was committed and that events such as a subsequent marriage may have occurred. The courts will be able to judge whether the offender is a serial offender who might get a job in another school and abuse more 16 and 17-year-olds, or whether the incident was a one-off, perhaps leading to a substantive relationship, and there is no risk of further offences.
<P>
We need such a discretion and the working of the amendment is one way of achieving it. When the previous Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), wanted to include a similar discretion in the Sex Offenders Act 1997, the distinguishing feature that he used was whether the person had been given a custodial sentence. That is a proper test because the courts give custodial sentences for serious serial offences and are more likely to give a caution or small fine in the discretionary cases to which I have referred.
<P>
I am not wedded to the wording of the amendment, but it sets down the important principle, which the Government should accept, that, in line with the logic of the Minister's comments on the previous set of amendments, individuals who pose no subsequent risk may be caught by the legislation. To put such individuals on the sexual offenders register would be a waste of the time of the police and the probation service and would provide no benefit to the public.

<P>

<B>Mr Clappison:</B> With one exception&#151;to which I shall turn in a moment&#151;I am not sympathetic to the amendment. It would water down the Sex Offenders Act; registration under the schedule of that Act affords important protection to the public. As I understand it&#151;I may be corrected&#151;there is no provision in any other legislation for a court to have discretion over whether someone should be registered on the sex offenders list. If someone commits an offence of sufficient seriousness, he should be liable to registration. In its own way, it is an important form of protection, so I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman about its generality.
<P>
I have one reservation, which arises out of the debate that we had yesterday evening on another group of amendments. I hope that I am not returning to a matter that we dealt with on clause 1, on the Floor of the House, but the decision that we took yesterday evening influences my attitude towards the amendment. The decision on the registration of people between the ages of 16 and 18 committing the offence of buggery inclines me to be sympathetic towards giving some element of discretion on the matter.
<P>
The level of seriousness that an offence has to reach before there is a requirement for registration under the Sex Offenders Act is set out in schedule 1 to it. An offence has to be fairly serious before it reaches that threshold. As the Minister pointed out in his reply yesterday evening, some offences are quite serious but not serious enough to meet the requirements for registration under the Sex Offenders Act.
<P>
9.15 am
<P>
It is clearly the will of the House that, in due course, the age of consent will be lowered to 16, but offences will still exist for some activities carried out by homosexuals between the ages of 16 and 18, as they will for people who are over 18. I refer especially to 16 and 17-year-olds who commit homosexual acts such as anal intercourse and buggery that are not in private. They will still be committing an offence. As I understand it&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;they will still be liable for registration under the Sex Offenders Act. We have decided that such acts will remain an offence and that they are sufficiently serious to require registration.
<P>
If we take that view, we have to consider consistency with the schedule to the Sex Offenders Act and to consider providing some discretion on the matter. As the Minister pointed out in his reply yesterday evening, other offences are not of sufficient seriousness to come within the scope of the Sex Offenders Act. I apologise if my comments are not as considered as they might be, Mr. Cook, but we have only limited time to reflect on and digest such matters now that the Committee is sitting at 9 o'clock in the morning. However, even at this early hour, I have had the opportunity to obtain a copy of Hansard. The Minister referred to dealing with the age limit of 18, and I quote from his words of yesterday evening:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Committee will find under offences that attract age-limit exceptions to registration in schedule 1 of the 1997 Act, that offenders who are guilty of indecent assault on a woman and on a man do not have to register if the victim is 18 years old or over and the sentence is under 30 months. Offenders guilty of assault with intent to commit buggery must register only if the victim is under 18 years old. Such provisions relate to girls as well as boys, where the age of consent is already 16.''&#151;[Official Report, 10 February 1999; Vol. 325, c. 348.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take the first of those examples to consider how serious such an offence can be. An offence of indecent assault on a woman or a man in which the victim is over 18 incurs a sentence of under 30 months, and offences embraced by that can be quite serious. I could read to the Committee examples of offences that attracted less than 30 months' imprisonment, and of an offence that attracted a 30 month sentence. Let us be clear what is involved&#151;indecent assault on a woman or a man is not consensual and involves indecency as well. If any members of the Committee want to challenge the fact that such offences can be serious, I will happily read examples to them. Attacks on strangers, attacks on people outside night clubs, assault and the fondling of people's private parts are all serious, yet Parliament has decided that they are not of sufficient seriousness to be included in the sex offenders register. That was the will of Parliament.
<P>
I accept that there must be a threshold above which offences are so serious that they must be registered on the sex offenders register and below which they are insufficiently serious to be registered. However, I have compared the decided cases of indecent assault on women or men, which attract sentences of less than 30 months imprisonment, with cases of 16 or 17-year-olds who have committed the offence of buggery&#151;it is an offence if committed not in private but in public&#151;and I wonder whether there is consistency.
<P>
I shall not say whether or not buggery not in private should continue to be an offence. I accept that it outrages many people. However, I have considered its seriousness and decided what worries me most. While waiting for my daughter to come back from a night club, I would not be kept awake by the thought of people committing acts of buggery together in a group of more than two, whereas I would be by some of the individuals on the streets who might commit an offence of indecent assault of the type that I have described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I can assist the Committee. The phrase ``not in private'' does not mean in the street; it means that another person is present. When discussing such offences, we must be clear about the definition of that phrase. Some people think that it means a public display, which is not at all the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. I was using the legal sense of the phrase ``not in private''. Such matters do not keep me awake at night, but the threat of indecent assault on any member of my family, or anyone else's family, does keep me awake at night.
<P>
I raise this issue so that we can consider whether the law is consistent, not whether or not such acts should be an offence. If we are to have a sex offenders register, let it be consistent and deal with offenders who are a risk and might commit serious offences. I wonder about all that. Perhaps Parliament needs to revisit the sex offenders register and include some of the serious offences to which I have referred.
<P>
Given that the will of Parliament is to lower the age of consent for homosexual sex from 18 to 16, we must ask ourselves whether we should require offences involving 16 or 17-year-olds to be registered on the sex offenders register. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Dr. Evan Harris </B>(Oxford, West and Abingdon): I did not plan to speak in this debate, because my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) has made the point that I wanted to make, but the hon. Member for Hertsmere has made an important contribution and raised some significant concerns about the scope of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. That contribution might equally have been made last night in the clause 1 debate on amendment No. 4, which my hon. Friend tabled, in the Committee of the whole House. However, similar issues are raised in this debate.
<P>
In a previous debate, the Minister said that the criteria to determine whether people should be on the sex offenders register were, first, risk and secondly, consistency. He also said that arbitrary age cut-offs were not the basis on which the sex offenders register should be run, and that judgments should be made of the risk to people.
<P>
I am concerned that the offence decriminalised under clause 1&#151;consensual sex between people over the age of 16, which does not involve an abuse of trust&#151;will still be liable for registration on the sex offenders register. If such an act does not involve an abuse of trust and is wholly consensual, it will be registered on the sex offenders register only if it is otherwise an offence under the privacy rule.
<P>
I know that hon. Members from all parties are concerned about the scope of the privacy rule. Sixty hon. Members signed an early-day motion about the Bolton Seven, and Members from all parties tabled an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Bill last year to remove this additional discriminatory privacy provision from the statute book. It is not appropriate to debate that now. However, there is concern that the Sex Offenders Act 1997 is being undermined because it will now cover consensual offences between people who are no longer minors for the purposes of criminal law, when no perceived risk is presented to anyone else. It will cover people such as the Bolton Seven, who were convicted for labelled ``sex offences'' which took place in a private home, but which happened to have been videoed by a third person present.
<P>
It seems wholly wrong to dilute the effect of the sex offenders register by including such offenders while we are signalling that equality&#151;a word much used in our consideration of clause 1&#151;should be an important consideration. The privacy provision can never catch a man, no matter how old, for having sex with a woman aged 16 or 17, when that is a consensual act. In the light of comments made in our discussion, especially those that the hon. Member for Hertsmere made, I ask the Minister to reconsider how such laws interact with the sex offenders register and to bring back a rational approach before the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, for his characteristic succinctness and brevity in moving the amendment. I understand that he wants consistency, but he is perhaps slightly naive to believe that the way to achieve consistency in criminal law is to give judges discretion. That has not been the case in my experience over many years, and I say that with great fondness for the judiciary, which includes some of my best friends.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere is right to point out some of the difficulties and inconsistencies. Although it is not easy, we must strive to restrict as far as possible those inconsistencies, and to address the anomalies as far as is consistent with the point that unites almost all of us, namely, the importance of maintaining the integrity of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, and of ensuring that the provisions that relate to registration continue to enable us to keep tabs on people who might present a risk to vulnerable people.
<P>
I must reject the amendment, because it would weaken the 1997 Act by leaving the requirement to register under the Act to the discretion of the court, which would have to state its reasons for imposing the registration requirement. But the purpose of the Act is to ensure that a body of information is available to the police so that they know the movements of people who have been convicted of an offence under schedule 1 to the 1997 Act and may pose a risk to the community. That applies to people convicted of an abuse of trust offence as much as any other offence. People convicted under the Bill could pose a risk.
<P>
We are conducting a review of the effectiveness of the sex offenders register, which should be completed later this year. That review will provide the basis on which to consider whether amendments to the Act are necessary, and that will be the occasion for us to clear up some of the inconsistencies and anomalies that I readily accept exist.
<P>
Discretion for the courts is one of the issues that will be considered as the review proceeds. It would be wrong for me to prejudge the outcome of the review, but we shall bear in mind the suggestion that it would be an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion. The Bill should not be used as a vehicle for remedying anomalies in the Sex Offenders Act 1997, nor should it be used for making piecemeal amendments to that legislation.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam will glean from those remarks that I cannot accept his amendment. The arguments have been made, the points have been put and the anomalies have been revealed. I am grateful for that and we shall take them into account, but, for the reasons that I have given, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment if the hon. Gentleman presses it to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's courteous and considered reply. Not for the first time in this Committee, he has put the best case forward, but it did not bear too much relation to the issue that I raised. The only reason for looking with any favour on the proposal to give discretion is the risk of creating anomalies and inconsistencies, such as in the example that I described of the offence of buggery that is not in private being committed by 16 and 17-year-olds.
<P>
The Minister made some remarks, which I welcome, about the review of sexual offences legislation. I hope that the review will take a close look at the level of seriousness that is required for someone to find his way onto the sex offenders register.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman should not confuse two things. A review of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 will take place to consider the relationship between the Act and other pieces of legislation, and it will report by the end of the year. Another review of sexual offences generally is also taking place. The two are connected and the latter will certainly consider the anomaly to which he referred about otherwise lawful acts between consensual people in circumstances in which the law determines that such acts are public. I agree that it is an anomaly and, in some ways, an unacceptable situation. It is right for us to examine it and I am grateful to him for saying that he believes that it is proper for us to look at the problem in terms of the risk and mischief that it presents to the public. The group conducting the review will bear in mind his remarks and those of other hon. Members when it considers that issue.
<P>
This is a rather long intervention, but if I may say so now, Mr. Cook, to help hon. Members, it is our intention to have a parliamentary seminar as part of the review of sexual offences generally. Members of the Committee will have pride of place in terms of making contributions based on their wisdom and experience gleaned from this Committee, and the remarks of the hon. Member for Hertsmere will be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for being so generous in his intervention, if I can put it that way. My only reservation is that the Minister has argued that we should not seek to remedy defects or revisit other issues in the sex offenders register. That is a fair point, but the Minister should consider my view, which is not so much about remedying a defect as creating one by reducing the age of consent from 18 to 16, while some offences of consensual buggery will remain offences at the ages of 16 and 17. Through that decision, we are creating an anomaly in the operation of the sex offenders register.
<P>
I return to my first point. If I had to say which offences worried me most&#151;consensual offences not committed in private, including homosexual acts of buggery, or some of the other offences that will not be entered in the sex offenders register, including offences of indecent assault that attract less than 30 months imprisonment such as offences attracting only 12 or 24 months for indecent assaults that were not consensual but which involved violence&#151;.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman moves off the point, we are talking not only about consensual buggery but about gross indecency. Gross indecency will still be covered, due to the anomaly created by clause 1; yet gross indecency is whatever the prosecutor deems to be grossly indecent. Gross indecency can be committed only between men, and it does not need to involve penetration or buggery. It can range from a close embrace to mutual masturbation, and includes activities that are on a different level of sexual activity to anal intercourse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Well, there we are, Mr. Cook.
<P>
I hope that no one will accuse me of not taking the matter seriously. Protecting people, especially the young, is my prime concern. However, we need to consider the risk of inconsistencies and anomalies. I shall leave it at that, but we may need to reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's gracious response in slamming the door on the amendment. The amendment was about a presumption in favour of registration, with the courts creating specific exemptions; it was not about a presumption against registration, with the courts having to demonstrate why someone should register.
<P>
I was interested to hear the Minister's comments on judicial discretion. I am rapidly learning, from attending home affairs Committees, that the Government sometimes wish to leave things to the good sense of English judges and juries, but that they sometimes find judicial discretion to be inconsistent and inappropriate. It can work both ways.
<P>
The Minister said that the Sex Offenders Act 1997 would be reviewed, so it may not be appropriate to press the amendment. We should remember that that Act is about protecting the public from risk, and I am pleased that the Minister shares that view. I hope that the review takes account of the anomalies&#151;for instance, of people who pose a serious risk of not being on the register, or of people who are not a serious risk being on it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss new clause 12&#151;Notification requirements&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) In section 1 (sex offenders subject to notification requirements) of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, there shall be inserted the following subsection&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(4A) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a person subject to the notification requirements of this Part by reason of an offence which ceases to be an offence after the commencement of section 1 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1999 (reduction in age at which certain sexual acts are lawful) shall no longer be subject to those notification requirements after the commencement of that section.''.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Dr. Harris:</B> New clause 12 touches on some aspects that we have already discussed&#151;I shall not go over them again&#151;but it is analagous to amendment No. 4 to clause 1, which we briefly debated last night. The new clause would effectively amend clause 1, dealing as it does with issues relating to a reduction in the age of consent for homosexual acts. If there was a free vote on clause 1, there should certainly be one on this clause. We shall treat it as a free vote issue.
<P>
	Amendment No. 4 dealt with the anomaly that the hon. Member for Hertsmere so clearly and eloquently identified in our debate on amendment No. 24. The House must re-examine issues relating to amendment No. 4, in the light of the acceptance of Government amendments Nos. 17 to 22, through which certain groups of people are removed from the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act. I strongly believe&#151;but will not press the point because it properly belongs to amendment No. 4&#151;that we shall need to reconsider that later, given that the Government have conceded that the scope of that Act can be reduced in this Bill.
<P>
New clause 12 is similar to the provisions of amendment No. 4; since that amendment was not acceptable to the Minister, I suspect that he will find the new clause similarly unacceptable. However, it raises serious issues about natural justice and about how anomalies are dealt with. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam said, it is not appropriate to remedy all the unjust and discriminatory anomalies relating to the Sex Offenders Act, but it is vital to ensure that we do not create more. If we are reducing the age of consent, it seems logical to ensure&#151;as amendment No. 4 set down&#151;that people are not prosecuted under the Sex Offenders Act for an act that clause 1 of the Bill decriminalises. That Act is designed to protect people from offences&#151;in this case, young people below the age of consent. The House has lowered the age of consent for homosexual sex and it should be consequential that the significant provisions of the Sex Offenders Act no longer apply to acts that have been decriminalised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to assist the Committee, because I am confused, as I think are other members of the Committee. The amendment to which the hon. Gentleman is referring is amendment No. 4 to clause 1, which was debated in the Committee of the whole House yesterday&#151;not the amendment No. 4 that was tabled in this Committee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that clarification. Amendment No. 4 to clause 1, which was debated yesterday, provided that consensual acts between a man over 20 and a young man aged 16 or 17 should no longer require registration in the sex offenders list for new offences. That is the anomaly identified by the hon. Member for Hertsmere; such offences, if they really are offences, will remain registrable, but only if they occur in public&#151;which can mean merely a third person in the bed, in the room or in the building. It seems strange that the Government recognise in their amendments that the Sex Offenders Act should be limited to certain groups, but did not accept amendment No. 4.
<P>
I now turn to what makes new clause 12 different from amendment No. 4. The new clause seeks to remove from the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act people who are subject to them only by virtue of offences that we have now decriminalised. We do not seek retrospectively to wipe out the fact that someone committed such acts when they were an offence and was once registered. However, it seems wrong that offences that were subject to the registration requirements&#151;which generally, in these cases, last for five years&#151;but which from the moment of enactment of Parliament's will, were no longer considered to be criminal should not, by extension, be considered to be a potential danger to the young. It is peculiar that people who have to register for that offence should continue to have to do so. If that were allowed to happen, it would represent a continuation of the discrimination and inequality of which the Minister spoke so eloquently last night during the clause 1 stand part debate.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are dealing with real people. I saw in today's headlines that the Court of Appeal is due to give its judgment in the appeal of the Bolton seven. That case involved seven men who had consenting sex; there is no doubt that it was entirely consenting. There was no sado-masochism involved&#151;people often confuse the Bolton seven case with the Spanner case. The Bolton seven were prosecuted, convicted and sentenced for two reasons. First, one of the men involved was 17&#151;the 17-year-old consenting boyfriend of one of the men&#151;and, secondly, there were more than two people involved&#151;although not seven at any point&#151;and a home video had been made which proved that. That was an offence under the Sexual Offenders Act 1956, as amended by the 1967 Act, because it was not in private. That is wholly discriminatory on both counts because no such rule applies to heterosexual sex, no matter how many people are in the room. Heterosexual acts in public are anyway generally treated as public order offences rather than serious sexual offences. Matters of the privacy provision are rightly matters for the sexual offences review, which was first announced by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth when he was the Minister of State, Home Office in response to concerns that had been raised about the privacy provision by myself and other hon. Members of all parties.
<P>
Two members of the Bolton seven are on the sex offenders register solely because they committed consensual acts of buggery and gross indecency&#151;which can be acts that are far short of anal intercourse&#151;with a 17-year-old. That was, undoubtedly, illegal at the time, although the majority of Members of Parliament felt that it should not have been so. I am not suggesting that there should be a pardon or an ablation of the fact that they were subject to criminal sanction. However, it has now been recognised that it is discriminatory, wrong and no longer in the interests of natural justice or the public interest to prosecute such cases. It is therefore appropriate that people such as the two members of the Bolton seven, who are on the sex offenders register solely for the age of consent offence, not for the ``public sex offence'', should no longer be subject to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that someone who introduces a 17-year-old to group sex of any nature is doing something very wrong indeed?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I do not pass judgment on the matter. What consenting adults&#151;that is, people who are no longer under the age of consent&#151;get up to in private, where no public order issue is involved, is a matter for them. The state should not intrude into the bedrooms of private individuals who are above the age of consent and acting with consent. Many hon. Members, certainly Conservative Members, would be concerned if the state were to be watching what happens in the bedroom. It should be remembered that the application of the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act to men such as the Bolton seven was due not to the group nature of the sex but to the age of consent offence that is to be decriminalised from the moment the Bill is enacted.
<P>
This is a reasonable and just measure, which is trying to atone for some of the discriminatory provisions of our criminal law. I intend to press the new clause to a vote, because I believe that members of the Committee should say where they stand on matters of natural justice. I stress that we are dealing not with retrospectivity, but with something entirely prospective from the moment of the Bill's enactment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) argues his case with obvious sincerity, passion and conviction. However, I am not able to accept his new clause. It would lift the requirement for those required to register for offences committed before commencement of clause 1, which deals with the proposed change in the age of consent, if their offences subsequent to commencement were no longer criminal.
<P>
It is a basic principle of justice that individuals are answerable under the law as it stands at the point at which the conduct that led to a criminal prosecution took place. As a general rule, we do not retrospectively impose new requirements or laws. Similarly, when previous offences are repealed, we do not attempt to wipe the slate clean retrospectively, as if the offence had never been committed. To do otherwise could have major implications for criminal records, recompense for sentences served, and a range of other factors.
<P>
Decriminalisation is not something new. The age of consent has been lowered in the past without retrospective amendment to criminal records. If some of the hon. Friends of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon had their way, a royal commission would be established to determine whether cannabis or other soft drugs should be legalised. I understand that that was part of the Liberal Democrat party's manifesto at one time. Such a determination may or may not lead to legalisation of cannabis. But if it did, would the hon. Gentleman then suggest that people who have in the past been convicted of supplying, using or importing the drug should have their names retrospectively removed from the criminal records? I suspect that he would not, but perhaps he would.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am sorry that the Minister has misunderstood my point; I thought that I had made it clear. The new clause would not remove or change criminal records, or shorten sentences. Registering under the Sex Offenders Act is a measure of public protection, not an act of punishment. The legislation will not have to protect the public from an offence that has been decriminalised and is no longer an offence. It is not a question of going back and changing criminal records, or even of letting people out of prison or off probation. The new clause would remove the need for public protection when that need no longer exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's position is that the criminal law reflects the social and moral position of the time. Therefore, we cannot adjust it retrospectively in the way that he suggests. The registration requirement under the Sex Offenders Act forms part of a wider picture. It is not, of itself, a penalty; it is an administrative requirement. While some of those who register are paedophiles or other serious sex offenders, some are not. The requirement for registration is widely drawn not to act as a judgment on individuals or an additional penalty, but to ensure that all those who may be a risk to society are comprehensively contained within it.
<P>
I see the hon. Gentleman's point. However, the new clause is technically flawed; I see little point in taking him through those flaws, but would be happy to write to him if he would find it of assistance.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Rather than give way to the hon. Gentleman, perhaps I could take him briefly through the flaws that we identified.
<P>
The retrospective removal of the registration requirement would not be straightforward, as not all those guilty of the offences in question would fall within its scope. For example, conduct involving more than two persons would fall under the same offence as the conduct between two people who were previously under, and would now be over the age of consent&#151;they would be unaffected by the hon. Gentleman's proposed change. Similarly, the act that resulted in prosecution could have been non-consensual&#151;although now that it is possible to prosecute male rape, non-consensual buggery is not likely to be charged under section 12. Nevertheless, it could have been non-consensual. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman intends the new clause to have that effect.
<P>
We believe that the new clause is wrong in principle, and that it would create enormous technical problems in practice. Although it is likely to affect only a small number of people, a disproportionate amount of work would be involved in trying to identify who should or should not be exempted from the registration requirements. If certain case records had not been retained, that might be impossible. Perhaps I can give an example of just how difficult such a process would be.
<P>
The offences of gross indecency and buggery contain three elements, the presence of any one of which is sufficient to found a conviction. They relate to the age of the parties, whether the parties are consenting, and whether the activity takes place in private. If a person is convicted of one of these offences, there is no way of knowing from the criminal record which of the three elements was relevant in securing a guilty verdict or, indeed, causing a guilty plea.
<P>
If we said that those convicted in respect of activity involving someone between the ages of 16 and 17 should no longer be required to register, a mechanism would need to be devised to consider applications from those who claimed to fall into that category. Any person who had been convicted of or pleaded guilty to gross indecency and buggery might well have tendered a guilty plea or been convicted for one of the other two reasons, so a further mechanism would be needed to determine which one it was.
<P>
It may be a party political point, but members of the Liberal Democrat party tend to treat public expenditure in a rather casual way. Is the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon seriously suggesting that we should impose on the taxpayer the additional burden of setting up a whole new set of machinery in order to identify, at the very most&#151;in the two years about which we are talking&#151;78 people? If he is, we should know about it. If, however, he is merely making a point, he has made it, and we understand it.
<P>
No one doubts the sincerity of the hon. Gentleman's concern about that relatively small group of people, who may well feel a sense of injustice. That sense of injustice is not founded on any adverse moral judgment against them, but rather as a result of our approach to the issue, which is to maintain the integrity of the register and to ensure that we do not corrode a basic principle of criminal law&#151;retrospectivity. I hope that when the hon. Gentleman considers the difficulties in terms of the massive edifice that would have to be constructed to identify that group of people, he may feel that for those technical reasons, apart from reasons of principle, he should not pursue the matter in the way that he proposes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I shall reply briefly. The Minister spoke of drafting errors. It would have been inappropriate to draft the proposed new clause to remove from the register people who have been subject to the requirements for registration by virtue of an act deemed not to have occurred in private. Such drafting would have put at risk selection of the new clause, because it would not have been in the scope of clause 1. In the new clause we could hope only to recognise that people convicted of an act that is now decriminalised should no longer be subject to administrative requirements, although they are still subject to punishment requirements.
<P>
I do not understand the Minister's point about looking at the conviction record when somebody is convicted of gross indecency or buggery and it is not clear whether the offence was consensual. One hopes that non-consensual offences would be charged as indecent assault or as male rape. It is not difficult to determine, however, whether such offences depend on the discriminatory and unjust law on the homosexual age of consent, which we are decriminalising, or on the unjust and discriminatory extra privacy provisions that we are not yet decriminalising and which are imposed on consenting homosexual adults of whatever age.
<P>
I do not believe that being unable to read that from the court conviction record should be a problem. The category into which a person falls is clear from the charge and from the prosecution case. The proposed new clause would be competent in discriminating between those who fall into either category. It points out that people who are on the register only because of the age of consent offence&#151;rather than the privacy offence&#151;should no longer be subject to the administration that the register involves.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): Surely the register is a list of people who were prepared to break the law of the land in pursuit of their own sexual gratification. Is not any subsequent change in the law therefore completely irrelevant?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Punitive measures are directed at people who are prepared to break the law of the land regardless of whether they or anybody else considers their actions unjust. That is what punishment is for. However, the Minister rightly made a point that has been made also by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). Registration on the sex offenders register is an administrative matter for the protection of the public. It is not a list for punishment, or of people who are convicted, imprisoned or sentenced and who are prepared to break the law. The new clause is reasonable because the list is an administrative matter for the protection of the public. I know that the Minister will not agree to it, but I do not accept that its drafting is incompetent, for the reasons that I have given.
<P>
The Minister made a final point about the small number of people whom the new clause would affect, and what he described as the disproportionate cost in considering the reasons for their conviction. There will be a small number of people. However, we will not have to look back far, because only the five-year provision for registration applies. We will not have to go back into the middle ages, or even into the early 1990's. The Sex Offenders Act took effect only in 1997, so the provision cannot mean looking back especially far. I do not believe, therefore, that an effort of the scale suggested will have to be made. After giving way, I shall explain why some effort must be made in the interests of national justice.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing against having a register at all. If, under previous legislation, people over the age of consent have decided to risk having consensual sex with somebody under the age of consent, thay have put that person at risk and are a risk to the community. As they have been put on the sexual offences register having broken the law before, who is to say that they will not do so in future? That is why there is a time span in which to see if they can be trusted to be taken off the register in future.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The hon. Lady misunderstands the purpose of registration. She must remember that this offence and registration requirement applies only to homosexuals. I thought that she believed that there should be equality before the law for all sexualities. To continue to defend the requirement for registration to protect the public from consensual offences among people that the House is about to consider adult for those purposes undermine what I thought was the hon. Lady's established position on equality.
<P>
<B>Caroline Flint:</B> I voted for equalisation of the age of consent, and I look forward to that becoming law. However, I strongly believe that we should all abide by laws that are on the statute book. Whether laws are changed in future does not affect whether an illegal act was committed, the consequences of which must be faced. That is not a piece of bureaucracy; it should act as a deterrent. If people take part in an act that breaks the law as it stands, they must face the consequences.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The consequences for the individual who breaks the law are sentencing and punishment. Registration under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 is for public protection.
<P>
The hon. Lady's earlier point that the sort of people&#151;homosexual men&#151;who have consenting sex with 17-year-olds might well be hidden sex offenders continues the argument that we have heard from Conservative Members that homosexuals are somehow uniquely liable to be sex offenders. The hon. Lady must realise that the current law is discriminatory. Part of that discrimination is being removed, but we should drop the measures to protect the public from people whom we no longer deem to be offenders. We have decided that the public no longer require protection from consensual homosexual acts above the new age of consent.
<P>
I shall finish by responding to what the Minister described as a party-political point. He deems it inappropriate to ask for public expenditure to right what I consider to be a wrong&#151;I accept that he does not consider it a wrong&#151;and an injustice done to a small number of people. That is a dangerous road to go down. The Minister may remember that in previous debates when we discussed child asylum seekers, he labelled me an extreme liberal. I am happy to be labelled an extreme liberal if that means that no expense will be spared when it come to civil liberties and the operation of natural justice for even a small number of people&#151;although I do not believe that the expense would be so great. I am supported in that view by some of my right hon. and hon. Friends, including senior Liberal Democrats, who first suggested the change during debate on the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. For that reason, that is a matter or principle, and I shall press the motion to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is important that we get one thing crystal clear. I suggested that the hon. Gentleman was being cavalier in his apparent disregard of the public expenditure implications of the course that he is proposing. Is he seriously suggesting that police time should be spent going through the charge sheets of individuals who have pleaded guilty, been convicted or been cautioned for the offences in question, in order to determine into which of the three categories they fall, and so whether his new clause will bite? Does he consider that to be a justifiable use of police time?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman claimed that my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) was suggesting that people who have been convicted, pleaded guilty or been cautioned in relation to consensual acts that are now to be legal are by virtue of that conviction, caution or guilty plea likely to be sex offenders. She was saying no such thing. That is not right or fair of the hon. Gentleman. I understand his conviction and his passion on the issue, but he must not cast such aspersions on those people who dare to argue that perhaps his response is not proportionate or sufficiently balanced.
<P>
There is a legitimate argument to be had. The view that we take&#151;and if the hon. Gentleman persists in dividing the Committee we shall see who else takes it&#151;is that the proposals in the new clause would undermine the concept underlying the register and the concept of lack of retrospectivity. The new clause would not be a proportionate response to the issue that he has identified. Not accepting it would not, in any way, countenance an injustice as we do not believe that an injustice has taken place. That is the point. The register is not designed to be a penalty. It is an administrative device to make information available to protect the public and to reduce risk.
<P>
I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do. However, he must not suggest that Committee members who oppose his new clause do so because they condone injustice, oppose the principle of equality or are acting reprehensibly and in a way that is contrary to the spirit of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Borrow </B>(South Ribble): As the debate has continued, I have become increasingly confused about what we are discussing. I accept and understand the arguments about whether the new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is technically correct. I understand that there may be an argument about the difficulties of devising a list of people who should be taken off the register. We could also argue whether the list should exist because of the implications for public expenditure. I shall listen to those arguments. However, I am confused about whether the sex offenders register is meant to protect the public from risk or whether being on it is a punishment.
<P>
I accept that punishment should not be lifted retrospectively for people who were convicted of an offence and punished by the courts. I have no problem with that concept even if we decide, at some point in time, that the offence is no longer an offence. I am happy to accept that people who were convicted of an offence which, as a result of the Bill, will no longer be an offence, should not have their punishment removed. They committed the offence when it was one.
<P>
However, the sex offenders register exists, not to punish the individuals on it, but to protect society from those individuals because they are considered a risk. If Parliament decides that certain individuals are no longer a risk because the offence for which they were convicted is no longer an offence, I cannot for the life of me understand why it is right to keep them on the register.
<P>
If the people are no longer a risk, they should not be on the register. Please explain to me why they remain a risk even though the offence for which they were convicted is no longer an offence. I am totally confused as to how we reached this position and I am becoming more confused the more my hon. Friends speak. I shall wait to hear what the rest of the debate reveals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Although I do not often agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, he may have the kernel of a point. One can be convicted of a serious indecent assault&#151;that has been, is and will continue to be an offence&#151;without being put on the sex offenders register. However, one can be convicted of an offence that, under the Bill, will no longer be an offence, and remain on the register.
<P>
The following report describes an interesting case of someone who would not be placed on the sex offenders register. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The appellant pleaded guilty to indecent assault. The complainant, a woman aged 18, applied for a job at the appellant's business. The appellant interviewed her, took her into a locked room and offered her money to perform sexual acts with him. When she refused''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I will not say what he did for reasons of modesty. I hope that the Minister will agree that that is a serious offence. The man, who grossly misused a position of power over a lady, is not on the sexual offences register.
<P>
We heard earlier of a young man who did something wrong in my opinion. However, as far as Parliament is concerned, he is no longer guilty but he will remain on the register. Surely there is an anomaly, with which the Minister should deal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): I was the only person during the debate in 1997 to sound a strong note of caution about a sexual offenders register. Such a register seemed to be a way of producing bizarre rulings, and could lead to mob rule.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, I do not think that the Minister has been convincing. My position on the age of consent is well known and I spoke against clause 1 yesterday. If someone is on the sexual offenders register, that is for public protection, as the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow) has suggested. How can we protect the public if the House, in its so-called wisdom, decides that an offence for which someone has been put on the register is no longer an offence? The Minister must answer that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have no intention of prolonging the debate. I am convinced, having heard my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow), that if I say any more he will become even more confused.
<P>
We have heard all the arguments during the debate. I am interested in the position taken by the hon. Members for Gainsborough and for Blaby (Mr. Robathan), and it will be interesting to see whether they feel compelled by the logic of their arguments to vote for the new clause.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I shall deal first with the point raised by the Minister in defence of the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint). The record will show that I said that I did not doubt the sincerity of the hon. Lady's drive for equality. I thought&#151;though we shall have to check&#151;that the hon. Lady argued that people should be placed on the sexual offenders register regardless of the offence that they committed because they might be a danger to the public and we do not know what they might turn into. If there was such an intimation, she and the Minister have corrected that.
<P>
There might be logic in the point. Any of us might be a danger to the public at an undefined point in future.
<P>
However, heterosexuals are at no risk of ending up on the register if they commit equivalent acts. They might not be on the register even when they are a risk to the public. Therefore, the Bill will be discriminatory. The comments of the hon. Member for Don Valley, although they do not show proper understanding of the sexual offenders register, do not affect the obvious sincerity of her wish to ensure equality. Members from both sides have made a cogent case for supporting the new clause. The hon. member for South Ribble said four times that he was confused. His speech showed that he was not confused. In fact, he was very clear. I believe that he asked his hon. Friends whether the requirement for registration under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 was a punishment, in which case he could not support the new clause because punishments must stand, however wrong the law is&#151;if people break the law, they must pay the consequences, and generally people are not automatically released prematurely on the basis of subsequent decriminalisation. I have made the point&#151;several times&#151;that we are not seeking to end punishment.
<P>
The hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) intimated in his speech&#151;which may have confused the hon. Member for South Ribble&#151;that the sex offenders registration requirement was some sort of penalty, but it is clear from what the Minister said that it is an administrative act, performed to protect the public. On that basis, the hon. Member for South Ribble is clear and not confused, and people who take his view must support the amendment.
<P>
I was interested in the contributions of the hon. Members for Gainsborough and for Blaby. [Interruption.] I believe that the hon. Member for Blaby, in saying ``disturbed'' was saying that I might be disturbed to have his support, rather than that he and his hon. Friend were disturbed in some way.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen are well aware of a clear anomaly. I make no judgement on his story, because I have not considered whether the sex offenders register should go wider and include assault cases, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere said earlier. Many of the points that the hon. Member for Gainsborough made are appropriate to a rediscussion of the issue that was raised by amendment No. 4 to clause 1, which came up on the Floor of the House last night but was not fully debated. I will not go into that now, but if, as he said, the hon. Gentleman recognises that this is a matter of public protection against people from whom the public do not need to be protected, he and his hon. Friend the hon. Member for Blaby should have the courage of their convictions; they should vote for the amendment because it is safe to do so, just as it is safe for the public if those people are no longer registered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands our position&#151;[Laughter.] Why is the Minister giggling? Our position is that people such as the gentleman to whom I referred should be on the register. That is our point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> But the hon. Gentleman said that he felt that the sort of people about whom I am talking, in the very narrow sense of the wording of the new clause, should no longer be subject to the registration requirements. My proposals applies only to those who are registered because of acts that will be decriminalised from the moment that the Bill is enacted.
<P>
With regard to police expenditure, I repeat that I do not believe that this would be an expensive measure. Even if it were, the cost may be proportional to the number of people affected. Those people, who are suffering the injustice of administrative registration requirements that are no longer necessary, deserve some public expenditure, if that is what it takes. The police should be asked whether they feel it is better merely to consider charge sheets rather than continually to monitor the addresses of people who are clearly not a danger to the public&#151;which should be the only reason why they are subject to such administrative arrangements. I am sure that the police would argue that they would rather the money be spent on clearing the register of those who are not and never were a danger to the public&#151;and whom the law recognises are no longer a danger to the public&#151;than on continuing to register people whom the House recognises in clause 1 should be fully admitted as equal members of society.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with all the points that were raised in the debate. On behalf of Liberal Democrat Members in Committee and others in the House, I shall press the new clause to a vote.
<P>
Question put, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:
<P>
The Committee proceeded to a Division.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. If hon Members want to vote on new clause 12 but not necessarily for the clause to stand part of the Bill, do they do so by voting against the clause standing part, or will there be a separate vote on new clause 12 later?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to clarify the issue. I have it in my authority to allow a vote on either issue, but I am minded to allow a vote on both. We will vote on new clause 12 when we come to the relevant point in the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Short title, construction, commencementand extent</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 5, line 17, after `(3)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `Section 1 and this section come into force on the passing of this Act; the other provisions of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the debate will be brief. We are trying simply to assist the Government. The amendment is in no way a criticism of those who drafted the Bill. The Government would, however, find it helpful to be more explicit about the enactment of clause 1, which I am sure that they want to come into force straight away. Home Office Ministers must feel a tremendous burden with the Sutherland judgment hanging over them. They will want clause 1 to be brought in as quickly as possible to satisfy the UK's requirements under the European convention on human rights and to put right the situation on the equal age of consent, which should be corrected in any case.
<P>
The amendment would ensure merely that the equal age of consent was introduced at the earliest opportunity&#151;namely, on Royal Assent. It may take more time to establish and bring into force other provisions in the Bill. If the Minister says that the Government intend to introduce clause 1 at an early opportunity and not to use clause 5(3) to introduce a statutory instrument some way down the track, the amendment will be redundant.
<P>
I look forward to hearing whether the Government intend to bring clause 1 into force as soon as possible and thereby to lift the terrible burden of the European Court judgment from Ministers and all those of us who take seriously our commitments under the European convention on human rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his concern about the burdens of office. However, I feel able to withstand them.
<P>
The Government are keen to end the inequality of different ages of consent as soon as possible. That may be possible immediately on enactment. A commencement order could provide for that, and a separate order could be used for the new offence of abuse of trust at a later date.
<P>
The use of commencement orders provides our approach with flexibility. The House may be content for the age of consent provision to commence before the additional protections for 16 and 17-year-olds, which are afforded by the new offence of abuse of trust. That would be a reasonable view given the overriding need for equality. The House may, however, prefer the two provisions to be brought into effect together. If so, immediate enactment may not be possible.
<P>
Introducing a criminal offence earlier than two months from the date on which Royal Assent is given to its parent statute would involve a grave breach of an important constitutional convention. That convention is aimed at ensuring that those who are subject to criminal sanction have a reasonable prospect of knowing the consequences of their actions at the time of their commission. Our research shows that, in recent memory, the convention has been breached only in special circumstances.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for courteously giving way. Before he gallops along too quickly, will he tell us the Government's preference for the date of commencement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to gallop a little longer, that will become clear.
<P>
Clause 5 provides the flexibility that we need to deal with the commencement of the relevant parts of the Bill in a way that reflects the will of the House. The amendment would remove that flexibility. I therefore cannot accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand the Minister's point about allowing a passage of time before new criminal offences come into effect. However, we are specifically considering decriminalisation issues, and I assume that the constitutional principle of waiting two months&#151;to which the Minister referred&#151;does not apply to them. If the Minister could at least give us an idea of how those considerations would work, I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment. The Minister outlined two scenarios&#151;that the Government come forward with a joint order, or with separate ones. How will that decision be made? Will attention be paid to the will of the House and the right hon. and hon. Members who voted for clause 1?
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Our approach to these matters is flexible, and is informed by the expression of the will of the House. That expression has yet to reach the final fulfilment. When it does, and in the light of the expressions of view and opinion displayed by right hon. and hon. Members, we shall arrive at a conclusion.
<P>
Our overriding concern at this stage is to maintain flexibility. Therefore, we are not prepared to accept the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, because it would remove such flexibility. We will listen to and gauge the opinion of the House. I should have thought that all right hon. and hon. Members would want us to proceed in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am particularly interested in when the offence of breach of trust will be put into place. The coverage given by the new offence will not be as comprehensive as it could be, and contains a number of loopholes and weaknesses. Nonetheless, it is better to have some protection than none at all, even if that protection is imperfect.
<P>
As the new offence will contain the defence in subsection (2), which allows a pre-existing relationship to continue after the date of the commencement of the legislation, I should have thought it prudent for the legislation to be implemented as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I have tremendous confidence that the House will continue to express its will hugely in favour of clause 1. Therefore, I am pleased at the Minister's indication that he will listen to the will of the House. I am prepared to place trust in the Minister to seek enactment at the earliest possible date, because I know of his commitment to equality of treatment. On that basis, having tested the issue, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
: Before we start our debate on the new clauses, I ought to record my permission for members of the Committee to divest themselves of their jackets.

Secondly, it is to remind other members of the Committee that in other places and at other times, other Committee Chairman might not be quite as considerate of members' comfort as I have been. Although it can become rather warm in here&#151;arguments get heated, and people get excited&#151;it is a requirement to gain the permission of the Chair before starting to disrobe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. May we divest ourselves of our ties as well?

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I draw the attention of the Committee to the effect of new clause 7. Under section 58 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, courts in England and Wales have the power to impose extended sentences in respect of the sexual and violent offences listed in section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The new clause inserts the new offence of abuse of trust into the list of sexual offences which can attract a period of extended post-release supervision in England and Wales. The changes to the Scottish legislation will have the same effect. A number of other minor risk-related provisions will also be attracted to the offence by virtue of its inclusion in the list.
<P>
The new clause brings the offence into line with the other sexual offences that are covered by section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. That is in line with our decision to make the offence registrable based on the possible subsequent risk to the community when the person who abused that position of trust is released. The main consequence is that it will add the offence to the list of those offences eligible for extended supervision under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
Extended supervision will not apply automatically: it is a matter for the court when sentencing. That will, I am sure, gladden the heart of the hon. Member for Hallam, who is anxious to introduce an element of discretion into the courts' approach to these matters. We entirely agree with him about that. There is a job of risk assessment to be done, and it is for the courts to do it. I can see that the hon. Member for Hertsmere is eager to make a point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I should like not so much to make a point as to ask him a question. Will he assist the Committee by clarifying the length of the maximum period of extended supervision for the offence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I hope to come to that matter in the fulness of time&#151;before the expiry of the maximum period, the hon. Gentleman will be glad to know.
<P>
As I said, extended supervision is a matter for the court when sentencing. When doing so, a court could require the offender to undergo a longer period of supervision following release than would otherwise apply. The amount of time that is spent in custody would, of course, be unaffected. That is an important proviso, bearing in mind the discussion on penalties that took place during an earlier sitting. A court may impose an extended sentence in cases where it considers that the sentence that it would normally apply does not carry with it a period of supervision that would be long enough for the purposes of preventing the commission of further offences and securing the rehabilitation of the offender.
<P>
An extended sentence comprises the period of imprisonment and supervision which would normally apply, followed by an extension period during which the offender continues to be on licence. An extended sentence, including the extension period, must remain within the maximum penalty that is available for the offence in question&#151;in this case, two years. That is relevant to the point that was discussed, as I said, at a previous sitting.
<P>
I should reiterate that we need to look carefully at the issue of penalties and the period of extended supervision. An extended sentence may be imposed on an offender of any age. Similar provisions exist in Scotland, and we are proposing amendments which would have the same effect there. The purpose of extended supervision is to address the issue of risk, which has rightly exercised the Committee. We must ensure that any potential risk to the public is minimised.
<P>
For the reasons that I have outlined, I commend the new clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I noted the Minister's comments about the need to consider the question of extended supervision: I agree with him about that. His remarks stand in contrast to some of those that were made by Ministers at the time of the passage of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>
Members of the Committee may be surprised that the maximum period of extended supervision for this offence will be only two years. That is because the Government brought in extended supervision for sentences under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 by confining it to the maximum period of the sentence. Two years does not fit the bill for extended supervision. I am a believer in supervision: it plays an important role in keeping offenders on the straight and narrow after they have served their sentence of imprisonment, and before that, when they receive a sentence of probation or supervision.
<P>
Unless my memory is playing tricks on me, the position is perhaps even worse. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but not only is the maximum period of supervision just two years, it is also restricted to the unexpired portion of the sentence. As I recollect the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, an offender convicted of a serious offence or breach of trust and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment&#151;the offence would have to be serious&#151;[Interruption.] The Minister is coming to the point. I shall develop it for the benefit of the rest of the Committee. An offender who has committed a serious breach of trust will receive a period of extended supervision of only six months, which is the maximum period that can be imposed.
<P>
An offender who commits a less serious breach of trust and is sentenced to three months' imprisonment can, however, receive extended supervision of 21 months. The less serious the offence, the longer the period of extended supervision. The more serious the offence, the shorter the extended supervision. That is nonsensse, and it was nonsense when the 1998 Act took effect, because offenders who commit the most serious offences are clearly those who are most in need of supervision.
<P>
The Government should have addressed the matter when the Act took effect. Ministers refused to do so at the time, so I welcome the Minister's comments today, and his indication that the Government may be prepared to reconsider the provisions. The Opposition believe that supervision has a role to play, and that, to be meaningful, extended supervision should in some cases be longer than the maximum sentence period. Hon. Members should get rid of the ridiculous anomaly whereby the more serious the offence, the shorter the supervision period.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The new clause is welcome in a sense, because it tries to ensure that anomalies do not exist throughout the system and that sexual offences are treated holistically. I am pleased that the Minister has proposed it.
<P>
Dealing with sexual offenders is very much about minimising risk, in which extended supervision is an important tool. Liberal Democrats are keen for a package of measures dealing with initial sentences and extended supervision, and including restrictions such as sex offenders orders that would subsequently be placed on people who behave inappropriately.
<P>
I am pleased to hear from the Minister that discretion is allowed and that, in this instance, it will be exercised sensibly by our excellent English judiciary. The assessment of risk will involve an important discretionary element, in that judges, informed by people at the probation service, which is becoming skilled in risk assessment, will be able to put together appropriate packages of measures. Extended supervision will be an important tool in dealing with worst offenders of the sort that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) has drawn to the Committee's attention, in the context of care homes, community homes, residential homes and so on.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere spoke about an important anomaly&#151;that the ability to impose supervision is inversely proportional to the seriousness of the offence, if the original sentence is taken into account. Liberal Democrats believe that that should be examined, so that sex offenders who commit serious offences and engage in predatory behaviour in inappropriate settings are given appropriate packages. Such packages may involve more extended supervision, if the offender in question received a heavier sentence in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The length of the debate is no reflection of its quality or significance&#151;on the contrary. It is important to recognise the vital necessity of informed risk assessment in sexual offences. The hon. Member for Hallam was right to say that advances in risk assessment in relation to sex offenders have been made in recent years, not least by the probation service. There is still some way to go, because there is much that we still do not fully understand or comprehend about the nature of offences relating to sex and sexuality. We need to get still better at that. It is therefore important that extended supervision is as flexible a tool as possible for the courts. It may well be necessary, in the course of reviewing the whole gamut of sexual offences, to reconsider the particular role of extended supervision for sex offenders. We are not dealing with common or garden thieves, burglars or robbers&#151;who may require different forms and durations of supervision.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is good reason to believe that sex offending requires a particular form of supervision, which may well need to be longer than that applied to the generality of offending. The review of sex offences will need to take into account the adequacy or otherwise of extended supervision under existing law.
<P>
I told the House on Second Reading, and reaffirmed in Committee, that in any event we shall reflect on the issue of penalty. I gave that undertaking to my hon. Friends the Members for Bassetlaw and for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). In doing that, we shall bear in mind the way in which extended supervision bites at present.
<P>
I hope that, in light of that, the Committee will accept the new clause.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am conscious of the limited time left to the Committee in this morning's sitting, so I shall quickly whip through the justification for the new clause. During the previous Division, I was joined in the Aye Lobby, as it were, by Conservative Members, and there was an abstention by a Labour Member. There is an even stronger case for including this new clause, which I shall explain.
<P>
New clause 13 would add a defence to charges of consensual buggery, or attempted buggery&#151;or, indeed, gross indecency or incitement to gross indecency&#151;for certain categories of men under certain conditions. That does not mean that offenders will get off with the offence, but they will be allowed to mount a defence that the court must judge.
<P>
We have been using the vernacular of A and B when discussing clauses 2 and 4. The new clause would allow a man A who is under the age of 24, and who has not been charged with a similar offence, to mount a defence against the charge of buggery with B below the age of consent, if he believed B to be above the age of consent and had reasonable cause for that belief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Is that when the older man is in a position of trust?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman asks whether the amendment applies to someone in a position of trust. I should have stressed at the outset that the new clause relates to clause 1 matters. It does not relate to any matters in clauses 2 and 4. If it did, I would have tabled an amendment to those clauses instead of proposing a new clause. It is clear from the wording that the amendment cannot include people in a position of trust. The defence would almost certainly fail, for the reasons that I have explained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am worried about the new clause because we have had numerous assurances during the debate from the Minister and others that there was no question of ever reducing the age of consent to below 16. This is the famous thin edge of the wedge. At last, here is an amendment&#151;[Interruption.] The amendment states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A man (A) is not guilty of an offence . . . against another man (B) under the age of sixteen''.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Dr. Harris:</B> The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. As I was about to explain, such a defence exists for heterosexuals when the age of consent is very much 16. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured in his bed that even if the new clause were added to the Bill, it does not break new ground, for reasons that I shall explain.
<P>
In the Sexual Offences Act 1956&#151;which I commend to the Committee as an interesting read&#151;the statutory defence applies in section 6(3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A man is not guilty of an offence under this section because he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen, if he is under the age of twenty-four and has not previously been charged with a like offence, and he believes her to be of the age of sixteen or over and has reasonable cause for the belief.
<P>
 In this subsection, `a like offence' means an offence under this section or an attempt to commit one''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision has existed not only from 1956&#151;I believe that it was brought in just after the first world war as a compromise between the two Houses to ensure that there was not entrapment of men, I imagine, by young females. It does not apply to homosexuals at any age of consent, except&#151;the Committee will be interested to know&#151;in Scotland, where the Criminal Law (Consolidatoin) (Scotland) Act 1995 shows exactly the same statutory defence for buggery, attempted buggery and gross indecency. We must remember that gross indecency is also included, which means anything that the arresting officer, the prosecutor or the court deems to be grossly indecent. In this country, there has always been a different level of judgment of what is grossly indecent between two consenting men and a consenting man and woman. Gross indecency covers a huge variety of acts, of the like that we often hear about in the news, but which society now judges should not necessarily&#151;certainly if carried out in private&#151;be subjecct to the oversight of criminal law.
<P>
We are talking about not only a reasonable defence for young men to advance in court but a measure that is clearly unequal and that discriminates between heterosexuals and homosexuals. There is support for that suggestion from many sources, including Stonewall and the austere body that is the Criminal Law Revision Committee, which took the advice of the Home Office's policy advisory committee when it reported in 1984 on the homosexual offence of buggery. Paragraph 6.14, under the heading ``Defences'' states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At present a man whose liability to conviction for buggery between males depends solely on the age of his partner cannot plead that he believed his partner to be of or over the minimum age. For the reasons that led us to this conclusion in the case of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
meaning that that defence should stay&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we recommend that a man in these circumstances should have a defence if he genuinely believed that his partner was aged 18 or over'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, over the age of consent as it was at that time. That is why the new clause seeks to ensure equality, and it is consequential on clause 1, because we are reducing the age to 16.
<P>
Paragraph 6.18 of the Criminal Law Revision Committee report says that for gross indecency the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``defence proposed at paragraph 6.14 above for buggery between males should apply to this offence too.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Criminal Law Revision Committee was not an especially radical body. It did not recommend a reduction in the age of consent to 16 for homosexuals; it recognised but did not seek generalised equality between heterosexuals and homosexuals in terms of buggery versus unlawful sexual intercourse. However, it clearly felt that, if a statutory defence is available to men charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with females, it should also be available to men charged with the equivalent offence of unlawful buggery under the age of consent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee why he did not move the new clause in the debate in the House yesterday?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The hon. Gentleman may not be aware that I sought to table the new clause as an amendment to clause 1, and I can show him the documents that confirm that it was my intention to do so. The new clause applies only to clause 1, as drafted. However, it could not be selected as an amendment, so it had to be tabled as a new clause. I would not question Madam Speaker's selection of amendments.
<P>
In any event, the defence is clearly not going to work when the two people know each other well in other relationships. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw expressed concern about abuse of trust cases. If a man picks up his partner after school it is clearly unreasonable for the defence to claim that he had reasonable cause to believe that his partner was older than 17 or 18. By contrast, we are all aware that people mislead others as to their age&#151;perhaps at nightclubs where someone has lied their way in, claiming to be over 18 when they are under 16. I think hon. Members will know that nightclubs can be frequented by young people who mislead authorities as to their age.
<P>
It could be argued that the defence should not exist for anyone. I would be surprised if any review committee decided that, because there is a huge danger of blackmail for consensual offences under the age of consent. Entrapment can occur. I am not suggesting that it applies in anything other than a minority of cases, and I believe that it is incumbent on men not to be reckless with regard to consent, the welfare or the age of their partner. For example, that is why far more cases involving young people should be brought as indecent assault, not as consensual cases. Consent may be obtained under duress.
<P>
But there is an enormous risk of blackmail, which is why that defence has always existed. The problem occurred throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the gay community. Enormous concern was felt about whether people were being entrapped into consensual acts that were not legal because of the privacy provision. Indeed, one of the few things that has mitigated the likelihood of a blackmail attempt was the criminality of the person under 16 if a charge was brought.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have rightly said that it is wrong to criminalise under-16-year-olds. If anything, that means that abusive cases should be brought to light more often&#151;something that I wholly welcome. By the same token, we must accept that there is a danger that men may be entrapped in such situations because, having been told that their partner was above the age of consent&#151;and even seen documentation to that effect&#151;they discover that the partner was in fact under 16, and that they may be charged as a result. It is wrong that birth certificates need to be demanded before homosexual relationships are entered into, when they are not demanded for heterosexual relationships.
<P>
The new clause would restrict the possible defence to young men. It would not deal with unlawful sexual offences or with dirty old men, but with men under the age of 24. It already applies to men in Scotland. I cannot understand why it should be presumed that, before devolution, men in Scotland are more likely to need such a defence in homosexual cases. We are discussing people who have never previously been charged with a like offence. If the defence is accepted, it would be a case of ``two strikes and you're out''. I make no judgment whether that is appropriate, but if such a defence exists for unlawful sexual intercourse between heterosexuals it should exist for homosexuals. Surely no one would be reckless enough to consider that that defence would give people carte blance. I do not believe that, in general, young men have knowledge of such a defence in respect of young women.
<P>
The defence under the new clause would not apply to positions of trust where the person knows the other person, becaue he will not have reasonable cause to believe that the person is 20 when, in fact, he is 15. It has always been difficult to judge age and it is becoming increasingly so in modern society. The new clause would not diminish what I believe is a serious offence of sexual intercourse or, indeed, homosexual acts with someone below the age of consent, even when they are consensual. It would simply ensure that the same defence applies to both homosexuals and heterosexuals.
<P>
I hope that the Government accept the new clause; it would have a similar effect to an amendment to clause 1 that they have agreed to take on board. We should have a decent debate on the matter. If the new clause is not acceptable or no concessions are made, I shall press it to a Division, because it deals with the fundamental matter of fairness and equality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I know that there are fewer Conservative Members of Parliament now, but I am delighted to be the sole representative left to speak to the new clause.
<P>
The Minister is in some difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister shakes his head, but once again the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has shown himself to be rather an astute parliamentarian.&#151;[Interruption.] Just wait a moment; he gave me an astute answer. I shall have no difficulty in voting against the new clause. I hope that I reflect the public's repugnance of people who bugger 13-year-old boys, and I certainly would not support a provision that would allow that to happen.
<P>
The Minister's difficulty is that his entire defence of the Bill is based on equality and the belief that homosexuals should be treated exactly the same as heterosexuals. Unfortunately for the Minister, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon rightly explained in his reply to my intervention, in this instance, the law treats heterosexuals quite differently from homosexuals. If we support the Bill on the basis of equality, what can we say against the new clause? That is why we say that there will be continuous pressure on us&#151;perhaps not this year, but certainly thereafter&#151;to widen the scope of all legislation until there is absolute and complete equality between homosexuals and heterosexuals in all aspects of the law. The Minister must reply to that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have come to an important issue; I make no criticism, but I understand those who think that it is a clause 1 matter.
<P>
If I have not already made it abundantly clear, Mr. Cook, I shall do so now; my remarks are my personal views. I shall speak in this debate as an individual member of the Committee, and I shall seek to exercise my judgment and to arrive at a decision that I believe to be right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has presented a fair argument for such a defence. It is worth considering. One way of looking at it is that someone would have to establish it as a defence in court. The other way, taking the inverse proposition, is to ask whether we want to criminalise people who have had anal intercourse if they genuinely believed that the other person was over the age of consent. Do we want to criminalise such a person&#151;particularly people with such a proximity of age?
<P>
I would be less sympathetic to someone at the higher end of the age bracket than to someone at the lower end. I do not want 16, 17 or 18 year-olds to have sexual relations&#151;I voted for 18 as the age of consent, but we have to take things as they are. Do we want people of that age not to have a defence if they had sexual relations with someone below the age of consent but genuinely believed that that person was over the age of consent? We shall have to exercise our consciences on that matter.
<P>
What should happen if the person under the age of consent told the older person that he was over the age of consent? We know what people are like at 16, 17 and 18. If someone says that they are over the age of consent, and they take it on trust, what should we expect them to do? What do we expect their attitude to be? We must be reasonable, and put ourselves in the place of those 16, 17 and 18-years-olds. We need to think very carefully about it. A 16, 17 or 18-year-old may reasonably believe that the person with whom they are about to have sexual relations is under the age of consent. Do we want to make that person a criminal, with no defence? We must exercise our consciences. I shall certainly exercise mine.
<P>
My problem with the new clause is one mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, which is that we are going too far, too fast. We are changing the age of consent too soon after 1994.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is your true voice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has not yet heard my conclusion. Many ordinary members of the public will agree with that; they will have noted that that defence was not available when the age of consent was 18. However, I happen to think, as did the Criminal Law Revision Committee, that it might be a more appropriate defence if the age of consent was still 18. I would be more sympathetic to it for the reasons given by the Criminal Law Revision Committee. The Minister may think that that is my true voice, but I tell him that my true voice is to exercise my conscience on the matter.
<P>
I shall not rush to deprive anyone of a defence in such circumstances. We must consider what will happen in real life and imagine ourselves in some of the predicaments that may arise. I shall have to think extremely carefully and reflect on the matter. Some important issues have arisen. It is very much a matter for individual conscience. I shall consider it, and may want to reflect on it further.
<P>
I do not approach the matter as someone who has signed up to an equality agenda, with a checklist on equalising one thing after another. I want to try to be fair, just and exercise common sense in individual cases as they arise. I shall consider the matter extremely carefully from that point of view, and may need to reflect on its implications.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I listened with great care to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who makes his points with conviction, passion and obvious sincerity. [Interruption.] Well, he does, and I think that it is important to say so. I understand what he is saying; his is one of several possible views. He did not fall prey to the temptation&#151;to which, I am afraid, the hon. Member for Hertsmere fell&#151;of parading his conscience. All hon. Members have consciences. I am always slightly sceptical when people talk a great deal about their conscience, because it implies that their conscience is to be held above something else. Everyone here has a conscience, and everyone here is very exercised about the difficult and complex issues with which we must grapple. The issues are not easy. Human sexuality is not easy; it does not fall into nice, convenient little boxes. The business in which we are engaged can be messy and difficult, with anomalies and inconsistencies that are not easy to handle, and we must do the best that we can. Opposition Members point the finger at us and say, in a disparaging tone that we have signed up to an equality agenda, but that does not do justice to the quality of our debate or to the care and thinking that all hon. Members have put into the exercise.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough needs to understand what we are debating in clause 1 and the new clause. There are good technical reasons why the new clause was not selected yesterday, although it undoubtedly touches on clause 1, as we all understand. We are debating a relatively modest measure, which does not pretend to be anythng other than what it is.
<P>
The Government have decided to give Parliament the opportunity to make a simple, straightforward change&#151;based, admittedly, on the principle of equality before the law&#151;in the age of consent in England, Wales and Scotland for homosexual and heterosexual activity. The Government are also giving the House an opportunity to determine whether the age of consent in Northern Ireland should be set at 17.
<P>
In considering the Bill, we are not about to open up the entire area of sexual offences. We have all imposed that discipline on ourselves. Undoubtedly, some people would like to open up the lot, and would like us to debate all the issues. Some would like us to do so from the point of view of essentially making no changes, or, in so far as a change be made, re-entrenching discrimination. That is their right: they are perfectly entitled to express such a view. They want to re-entrench and reaffirm the status quo. Others want to change everything and move to equality immediately&#151;which, I think, is the honest position of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. That is what I understand from his contributions to the debates. He wants to move now to a position of complete equality between heterosexual and homosexual acts.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is not what the Bill is about, and it is not what the Government are trying to do by introducing the Bill and allowing its consideration in Committee. I cannot accept the new clause, which touches on the undoubted difference between the way in which the law approaches homosexual and heterosexual activity. The matter that we are considering is a modest one; it is about the age of consent and that subject only. The sexual offences review will consider the wider picture, and it will do so in a way that generally engages in an open and inclusive debate. It will initiate debate in the wider community, which, in time, will enable the House to address the issue holistically.
<P>
If we acceded to the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, we would undermine the integrity of the process and engage in a piecemeal, ad hoc reform along the lines that he undoubtedly prefers, but not along the lines for which there is consensus in the country. It would also not accord with the context of this debate, which is about the protection of children and young people, of whatever sex, from people of whatever orientation. That is the reality. We do not intend, at this late stage of consideration in Committee, to go back on our stated purpose. For those reasons, we cannot accept the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There is no logic to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am sorely tempted to respond to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, who shouts from a sedentary position. The logic of his position is that there should be no change at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is logical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> That is your position.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not my position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> You are, mercifully, above these matters, Mr. Cook. I wish that we all were, but I have to confront the hon. Member for Gainsborough. His position is clear; he wants no change. At every given opportunity, he seeks to widen the debate in ways enabling him to say that the proposal is not logical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Well, the Bill is perfectly logical. It has a limited purpose to eqalise the age of consent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No. [Interruption.] Listen. We do not have the wider purpose that the hon. Member for Hertsmere would impute to us and that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon would impose on us. The hon. Gentleman's come at the matter from the same direction, but we decline to go down the routes that they suggest.
<P>
We have brought a modest proposition to the House for its free consideration, and we have opened up the wider debate of the sexual offences review to the whole country. I commend that approach to the Committee and, for that reason, reject the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was not going to speak again, but I have been moved to do so by the Minister's contribution. I am sorry if the Minister interpreted anything that I said as an attack on him. Nothing was meant as such an attack. I wanted to set out the factors to take into account when approaching the issue.
<P>
The Minister suggested that I was parading my conscience. I remind him that Conservative Members have a free vote on this matter of conscience. We can say what is in our conscience in that context.
<P>
It sometimes happens that consciences happily coincide and everyone is able to vote the same way. I do not want to speculate about either the vote, or what the Minister's position might be were he not in his current post. That would not be fair to him. I make no apologies for setting out the factors that I think are important as a matter of conscience.
<P>
I reassure the Minister that I was not accusing him of being signed up to equality agendas. I do not know whether he is, but I was certainly not seeking to accuse him of that. Some people are, although I am not one of them. I thought that 18 was the appropriate age of consent. That is probably the most important aspect of the equality agenda for many people.
<P>
The Minister said that we should be honest and admit that we did not want any changes. I accepted in my opening remarks that, although I wanted 18 as the age of consent, it is obvious from the scale of the majorities in the House that 16 will be the age of consent. As responsible legislators, we must look at the situation that will then arise in order to make proper provision. We must be sensible because the changes made by the Bill will affect our constituents.
<P>
When I look at the matter as one of conscience, I see some considerations in favour of the new clause. There are conflicting considerations about it in my mind. Some fair points have been made in its favour and there is some risk of injustice should it not be accepted. However, I am also concerned that we are going too far, too fast.
<P>
The Minister may say that I am trying to have it both ways, but that seems to be just what the Minister is trying to do. He said, ``We don't want this, but there will be a review so we hold out hope for the future.'' He also said that the Government do not want piecemeal change, but that is what is occurring as a result of the reduction of the age of consent and the provisions about abuse of trust. Change is being thrust upon us whether we like it or not. Therefore, we have to do the best that we can under the circumstances.
<P>
I have conflicting considerations on this matter of conscience. At this stage of the Bill, I want to reflect carefully. I will neither vote in favour of the new clause, nor oppose it. I shall think carefully about it for the future.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I shall make general points in response to the Minister and a specific point about why it is vital that the new clause is included. I was not convinced by the Minister, despite his initial kind remarks. His general point was that the proposal is too much, too soon and that it is an attempt to move immediately to a full equality agenda.
<P>
Many Members want to see an end to discrimination. I recognise that the Bill is not the way to bring about full equality immediately. It could be argued that a review is a more orderly way of achieving that, which is why I was pleased when such a review was announced. Ministers have other matters to consider, and if we were discussing a general sexual offences Bill, we would be here for weeks. That is why I have not sought to reintroduce the same provision that I&#151;with Members on both sides of the House&#151;proposed during passage of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to deal with anomalous, discriminatory and unfair provisions affecting privacy.
<P>
We have the opportunity to deal with matters relating to the age of consent that fall within the remit of clause 1. I will explain why it is vital that we do so. Certainly, the relatively small measure proposed in the new clause would give a statutory defence to homosexuals that is already available to heterosexuals. It is not moving too fast, too soon. The proposal is integral to the issues covered by clause 1; otherwise, it would not have been selected for debate.
<P>
Some of us, including many Labour Members, see that the presumption should be in favour of equality, so I reject the Minister's charge that the provisions in the new clause would be going too fast. The perilous discrimination that results in people finding themselves in the dock has existed since time immemorial. It has been flagged up since the early 1920s at least, and has been raised time and again since the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and the Sexual Offences Act 1967. To move one step in 70 years is not to move too fast.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the new clause. If it is passed because there is a free vote, but they do not believe that my proposal is quite right, they can still include the proposal in the review if they feel that there should be equality. I suspect that that is what they will do with a series of measures that have been raised during discussion of the Bill. The Minister suggested that several matters raised earlier by the hon. Member for Hertsmere and others will be subject to the review even if the Bill is enacted. That is appropriate; there should be nothing outside the review. However, the current Government cannot predict what will happen in future Parliaments, when they may not be in power. Simply to say that there will be a review without making a commitment to legislation in this Parliament is not good enough when we face grave injustice.
<P>
The threat of blackmail has existed for homosexuals for some time. If anything, the threat will be increased by the decriminalisation of the younger person involved. Some people have grudges or other agendas and will seek to ruin the lives of the other people by bringing them to court. But for heterosexual young men only, there is a defence that can at least clear them of conviction of an offence, if not rid them of the shame of appearing in court. Caution is always required when convicting young people of sexual offences because of the shame that accompanies conviction.
<P>
The other concern is that an offence may be committed as a result of a genuine error. The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to a 16-year-old who may have sex with a 15-year-old. That need not be full sexual intercourse. The offence of gross indecency applies to mutual masturbation. Even deep kissing and groping in some cases involving homosexuals is believed to be grossly indecent by some British courts or police.
<P>
The offence may be caused by a simple error resulting from someone saying, ``I'm 16'' and someone reasonably believing that the other person is that age. That should be an allowable defence. It is a fundamental principle of human rights that people should be allowed to use the same defence as others, regardless of their sexuality.
<P>
We have heard talk, perhaps correctly, of a clampdown on offences involving someone below the age of consent. The hon. Member for Hertsmere wishes to see more prosecutions for consensual sex offences involving persons under 16. He was concerned that the lack of prosecutions sends the signal that consensual sex involving a person under 16 is okay. The Minister did not object to that proposal. In the climate of decriminalisation of the younger party, the possibility of blackmail and the clampdown already referred to, we must preserve the right of 16, 17, 18 and up to 24-year-olds engaged in homosexual acts to have the same defence and human rights as heterosexuals.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government could not accept the new clause. I remind Labour Members that it will be a free vote. I have heard many of them say that they subscribe to an equality agenda and I urge them to cast their free vote in favour of the small but critical equality measure in the new clause.
