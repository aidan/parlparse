                           </strong> I welcome hon. Members to what looks to be a fairly
substantial marathon of sittings lasting until 24 May. With 140 clauses
and 13 schedules, it will be a magnificent effort. It is nice to see
such a tiny Committee ready to deal with it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000007">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To deal with
a couple of housekeeping points before we begin, I take a rather
old-fashioned view of dress sense. If people are uncomfortable, they
may of course make a point of order and ask to remove their jackets,
but otherwise I think that we should maintain the same dress sense in
Committee that we do in the main Chamber, if that is all right by
everyone. Mobile phones and pagers must be turned off, and other
electronic devices may not be used, pending Thursday’s report by
the Procedure Committee, which might or might not change that view. For
the moment, electronic devices—apart from mobile phones, and
pagers, on silent mode—should not be used in
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000008">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendments, as a general rule, we do not intend to call starred
amendments that have not been tabled with adequate notice. The required
notice period for Public Bill Committees is three working days between
tabling and the sitting, so amendments should be tabled by the rise of
the House on Monday for consideration on Thursday and by the rise of
the House on Thursday for consideration on Tuesday. Any less notice
will not be acceptable.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000009">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Not everyone
is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, which is what we are doing today, so I will explain briefly
how we intend to proceed. First—I suspect that this will be
largely formal, although we will see—the Committee will be asked
to consider the programme motion discussed in the Programming
Sub-Committee last Thursday, which is on the Order Paper with one
amendment. Debate is permitted, if anyone wants to do so, and may last
for up to half an hour. If not, we will proceed to a motion to report
written evidence and then a motion to permit the Committee to
deliberate in private before the oral sessions. That will happen
shortly, and we will ask the public to leave and for the TV cameras to
be switched off.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Assuming that
the programme motion is agreed to, we will then move into a private
session, in which Committee members can discuss how we intend to
proceed with the evidence-gathering part of our work, after which the
witnesses and public will be invited back into the room. We will then
spend this morning and afternoon, and indeed Thursday morning and
afternoon, taking oral evidence before moving on to the more formal
part of our deliberations, starting from next Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000011">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Thank you all for
coming along today. I start with a fairly broad question. Part 1 of the
Welfare Reform Bill provides the legislative framework for the
universal credit, but much of the detail is to be set out in
regulations. I would be very interested in your views on how you think
the proposals will work in terms of the stated aims of simplifying the
system and making work pay? I address that to Matt Oakley
first.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000049">&#160;</a>

Oakley:</strong>
                           </em> It is definitely going some way to
simplifying the system. At the moment, I think everyone would agree
that the system is terribly complex and depends on how you classify up
to 50-odd benefits or elements. Bringing some of those together and
trying to simplify them into a universal credit is obviously an
improvement. Where Policy Exchange and I think that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                           </div>it probably has not gone far enough is in relation to the fact that
there is still a lack of clarity over things like council tax benefit
and whether that is being brought inside. The Department has left out a
number of other elements. For instance, it has left out child benefit,
which has probably led to a confusing system of how child benefit is
removed for higher rate taxpayers. It has left out disability living
allowance and a number of other elements that could quite easily have
been brought inside universal credit to make the whole system a lot
simpler.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That leads on
to our view of the impacts on work incentives. Although there has been
some progress in reducing the marginal deduction rates or marginal
effective tax rates for some groups in the new system, they have not
really gone that far. A lot of people will still face effective tax
rates of around 76%, which is really quite high. Unless you really
simplify the system, such small changes and incentives are unlikely to
produce massive results, so we think that more probably needs to be
done in other areas—for instance, in terms of
conditionality—to get the reduction in workless households and
people into work that the system is trying to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000051">&#160;</a>

Ghelani:</strong>
                           </em> I would like to answer. First of all, the
whole thing with the universal credit is to simplify the benefit system
and make work pay. But there has been an awful lot of focus on the role
that the financial impact and the financial incentives will play in
making work pay. There is a very important point here around
simplification and the transition into work being as smooth as
possible. That should be one of key drivers in measuring how successful
the reform is, as well as the ability to understand clearly exactly how
much better off you will be in work. Those two key elements are
obviously an intention of and part of the Bill that deserve ongoing
scrutiny going forward. The financial element is one of the key
drivers, but the simplification could perhaps have as large an
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000053">&#160;</a>

Brewer:</strong>
                           </em> The important thing about the universal
credit is that it is integrated. People talk about simplicity a lot.
The credit is not particularly simple, but it is integrated. That means
when you are in work, you get just one means-tested programme and, when
you are out of work, you get just one means-tested programme, and they
are the same programme. It is simpler in that sense, but the formula
will be complicated. That integration and the transparency that it
brings about will probably do as much to improve incentives to work as
will the change in the financial pay-off to work. They are fairly small
and are commensurate with the relatively small amount of money the
Government are putting into universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000054">&#160;</a>

Sainsbury:</strong>
                           </em> I agree. This is a
simplification—or partial simplification—of the benefits
system, which is entirely welcome and would answer a lot of the
problems that benefit claimants face. But we should not make the
mistake that the universal credit itself is still going to be
complicated and will mirror many of the provisions of existing
means-tested benefits, which people find very hard to understand. It is
good because many people will not have to switch between benefits or
understand which benefit they need to claim to make the most 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                           </div>money and so on. Advisers will find it much easier to advise claimants
on claiming benefits and how much they will get from working. It is
important to realise that the simplification is of the system and not
of the benefit. I doubt whether we will see massive effects on things
like error rates, for example. That is not one of the main objectives
of the reform, but it is certainly one of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
change will make work pay. Work pays now under existing arrangements,
but probably not enough. We will not know whether it will pay enough in
future to make people change their decisions about working. We still do
not know the exact taper that will be put into force and how that will
interact with other benefits to create even higher tapers—76% is
mentioned as one of the higher rates that we might see. We still do not
know whether the provision will change people’s minds about
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must also
remember that people do not work just for money—they do not only
need a work incentive to make them look for work. Work is so important
on so many levels that this measure is just one part of the answer.
What people really want is an opportunity to work. As the universal
credit will hopefully bring more people in and increase take-up of
benefits, it will also bring people into contact with Jobcentre Plus,
initially, and the Work programme in due course, which will be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000057">&#160;</a>

Nolan:</strong>
                           </em> I do not think anyone would disagree with the
ideas of simplification in making work pay, but I guess the big concern
with the Bill is that the thinking has not been done in enough detail
and whether it will happen. Mike mentioned that it is going to be an
integrated programme, which will help some simplification, but how will
we treat things such as housing costs, child support and so on? The
risk is that we will simply layer all this extra simplification back
into the programme. Because we have not done the detailed work

bring about behavioural change, and part of that will come because it
is an integrated benefit. The idea is that an integrated benefit will
be more transparent, so it will be easier for people to work out how
much better off they will be when they are in work and it will be
easier for advisers to tell them how much better off they will be, as

are important, and currently they do not always happen. It is not
always easy to get an accurate better-off calculation, even if you go
to a Jobcentre Plus. I often refer to the Department for Work and
Pensions research report, which stated that Jobcentre Plus advisers
were not sure about housing benefit and how it worked as an in-work
benefit. That situation seems ridiculous. It is partly ridiculous that
Jobcentre Plus staff advise people on how tax credits and housing
benefit work when they administer neither benefit at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000064">&#160;</a>

own research has looked at where claimants find the most hassles in the
current system. The particular pinch points are when people move into
work, when their circumstances change or when they receive multiple
benefits, particularly housing benefit and tax credits. Most of those
problems have the potential to go away if the universal credit is
successful, and I believe that would encourage people to work as a
result.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000065">&#160;</a>

simplification with universal credit removes some of the misperceived
barriers that sometimes stop people from going into work. It will
provide transparency and simplicity, the value of working will be
demonstrable, and there will one figure—there will be no
doubt—which will serve to remove some of those

the work we did for the DWP last year, which looked at public opinion
around benefit simplification, some of the key things claimants told us
they wanted from a benefits system were stability and certainty. If you
are on a very low income and do not have them, those are the things
that could make you very frightened of trying work. It would stop some
people from even trying a job, because they feared losing benefit and
the hassle of going in and out of work, as Mike has said. Universal
credit has the potential to remove some of these barriers, which would
be a good thing. People on a very low income are understandably very
risk averse, and the current benefits system makes trying work very
risky. So I can see that universal credit certainly has the potential
to cause some behavioural change at that

actually do through the income transfer system? If you look in
particular at the reforms throughout the world—the US, New
Zealand, Australia and other countries—they have always
struggled with these sorts of problems because there are those inherent
trade-offs. Are you going to have a system that focuses on ensuring you
do not have these work poor households—where you have at least
one person in work—or do you have a system that tries to
encourage second earners into work, which has been the UK focus over
the recent decade or so? Which is the right answer? I do not know,
because you cannot reconcile those goals—you have to choose one
or the other. As well as using the financial system, we have to think
about what else we can do to encourage people into work. That is why
the Work programme is important, but there are also things such as
conditionality, because the issue is not just about financial
incentives. If we try to develop a system of financial incentives that
does everything, the risk is that it does nothing well, so we really
have to think about our
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000069">&#160;</a>

simplification of the benefits system as something that has been
overdue for many years, decades probably, but if we try to sell it as a
simple benefit—semantic difference is very important
here—I think we will disappoint people. Universal credit will be
a means-tested benefit, and I have not seen anything in the Bill that
suggests it will be any less complex than income support or housing
benefit is now, that was my only point. In fact, as I have mentioned to
Stephen Timms, because we are bringing in extra elements within
universal credit—particularly tax credits—people might be
asked even more questions. The claim form might go from thick to even
thicker, so the experience of claiming might still be difficult, and we
have to be aware of that, because that claiming process puts people
off.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000073">&#160;</a>

there are specific parts of universal credit that are very
complex—it is not just a general point. We know that there will
be a complex interaction between housing costs—people on what
will be the housing element—and the disregards they will
receive. We do not know what the disregard will be for a certain
household because it depends how much housing cost you get. Every
£1 of housing cost reduces the disregard by £1.50. That
is a complexity that has been built into the system. Similarly,

council-tax benefit and how it was paid and withdrawn in local areas.
How do I claim child benefit? How do I claim disability living
allowance? All those are decisions people need to make outside
universal credit, so, yes, systems are complex, but there could be a

Brewer:</strong>
                           </em> Yes. This is one area where we would welcome
more detail from the Government about how this transitional protection
will work. What we know is that families will receive this transitional
protection until their circumstances change, but we do not yet know
what counts as a change in circumstances. The general point I was
trying to make was that family circumstances change over time and the
idea is that, as soon as one of these things changes, the transitional
protection goes away again and the family will become a loser. It is
not clear what would count as a change of circumstance. It might be
another adult coming into or leaving the household, or it might be a
child growing up, but if it is something like somebody getting a job,
increasing hours or getting more earnings, we will find that this
transitional protection may last for only a few
months.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000077">&#160;</a>

looked at the proposals in the White Paper. We tried to work out what
it would mean for families—who would win or lose—and
essentially, the finding was, as you have said, because of the choice
the Government have made about the disregard and the level of the
disregard for lone parents and couples. It seems to us that they have
set the level of the disregard for couples, particularly couples with
children, at a relatively high level, which means that working couples
with children tend to gain from the reform. At the same time, the
disregard for lone parents, although appearing very high, is not
actually that high compared with what they get under the current
system—working lone parents tend to lose, on average. It seemed
to us that these were not inevitable consequences that arise when you
integrate and merge things together; they came about because of the
Government’s choice of the disregard. That is not a

did for DWP on pathways to work and other welfare-to-work programmes.
When claimants talk to a personal adviser, whether in Jobcentre Plus or
an employment provider, overwhelmingly, the first question they ask is,
“How will this affect my benefits?” Just imagine that
conversation in the future, under transitional protection. We still do
not know what these rules are going to be—they are still up for
grabs, it seems to me—but we tend to make an assumption that, if
circumstances change, that might be the trigger for forgetting the old
benefit and reassessing under universal credit rules. That makes a lot
of sense, but just imagine that conversation with a personal adviser
when I say, “How will it affect my benefits if this job does not
work out in a couple of months? I now get £100 and whatever a
week; what will I get in the future?” If the answer comes back,
“£65”, what is that going to do to my decision
about trying work in the first place? It could well have the
behavioural effect that we do not want, with the risk-averse person

are other ways of designing transitional protection. It could be that I
get my job and my universal credit would have been £65, but I

complexity and so on, but it would reassure me, asking that initial
question, that I would not lose out and then I could try that job. Once
I am in that job, of course, we hope that people progress in these jobs

protection could work, but there are no details about what is meant
here. You can understand why there is some concern, because
people’s circumstances change with remarkably rapidity. I am
doing a good job of selling old research here, but we did a project
once on changing circumstances. The average number of changes in a
six-month period, for people on means-tested benefits, was something
like six. That is the average for six months, so some people were
having considerably more. The likelihood of a claimant being reassessed
because of a change of circumstances would come round pretty quickly
for a lot of people, so you would find that transitional protection
would not last very long at all for possibly the majority of people.

If you are on a means-tested benefit, your benefit changes up or down
accordingly. In that sense, I suppose, yes, winners and losers are
always there—people will see their benefit go up and down. It is
not going to create any more or less losers or winners. It is a fact of
a means-tested benefit, under whose rules people have to report their
changes in circumstances straight away. It generates an enormous amount
of work. It can generate quite small fluctuations in benefit, but that
is the way in which means-tested benefits have been constructed in this
country for many, many years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I could throw
in that there is another way in which you could do this, and that is
the old family credit model, for those of you with very long memories,
where the benefit—and it was a benefit; it was not a tax
credit—was paid for six months, no questions asked. That creates
the stability and certainty that people really liked about that. That,
actually, was taken forward into tax credits. We have created this. It
is our own construction that we require people to report changes in
circumstances so often and so frequently about so many
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000089">&#160;</a>

dysfunctions to that, actually. The piece of work that I am referring
to is a bit old now, but I do not see any reason why these findings
should not still be valid. It creates a great deal of anxiety among the
claiming population about what they have got to do and what they should
report. People worry. You get a lot of anxiety about benefits being
affected and overpayments resulting. In fact, one bizarre effect of
requiring people to report a change in circumstances was that some
claimants reported things that they did not need to report. Can I do
this? Can I have a holiday or whatever? Can I buy this? And so you are
actually generating more work through this regime of constant reporting
of changes in

a way, we are linking the issue of transitional protection with tapers,

gainers from universal credit would be £3.6 billion
and the total loss of the losers would be £1.9 billion. I am
assuming that tapers and disregards are one of the critical ways that
will determine whether people are in that category. Could you start by
telling us a little about the key characteristics of the group of
gainers and the key characteristics of the group of
losers?<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000092">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Okay. First, most of the winners and losers
come from working families, because the Government have said that they
want to set the level of universal credit broadly to replicate existing
out-of-work benefits, so if you are currently not working and have no
other income, you will probably be unaffected, in financial terms, by
the move to universal credit. The winners and losers, therefore, come
from among working families. Families who have very low earnings or low
weekly hours tend to be winners and, in some cases, very large winners,
because of the high disregard in relation to universal credit compared
with the 100% withdrawal rate in relation to existing out-of-work
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Beyond
that, it is hard to generalise, because it depends on the precise
choice of disregard and the way in which that varies by family type and
housing costs. As I said in an earlier answer, the choice of disregard
means that working couples with children tend to gain. Working couples
on low earnings tend to gain. Working lone parents on average tend to
lose. There is no real magic behind that. It just depends on the choice
of disregard and the way disregard falls with housing benefit, as
Mr Oakley

                           </strong> Can we broaden this out to the taper?
Obviously, one of the central elements of the universal credit, and a
welcome one, is that it reduces the rate of taper—the marginal
rate of reduction—to 65%. What is your view, as a group, of the
extent to which that in itself, taking out integration, simplification
and other factors, will impact on decisions to go into
work?<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000097">&#160;</a>

Brewer:</strong>
                           </em> The choice of the taper means that many
working families will see a rise in their marginal effective tax rate,
as various of us noticed, so 65% is not really a cut; it is in effect a
rise. The rate that the Government would have to choose to preserve
most people’s marginal rate would be 60%. That would be the
neutral rate in relation to universal credit, but they have gone for a
higher rate. Gains in relation to work are strengthened under universal
credit because of the disregard compared with no disregard under the
current system, and the fact that universal credit combines all
benefits, so the Government can say that the maximum marginal
withdrawal rate will be 76% and not in the 90s, as can currently be the
case. The integration of benefits brings about the fall in marginal
rates, not the choice of what is actually a higher taper with universal
credit than is the case with current tax
credits.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000098">&#160;</a>

higher marginal reduction rate. We think roughly the same number of
people will see a fall as will see a rise in the marginal reduction
rate—about 1.7 million either way. One key group that sees a
rise in the marginal rate is those people currently on tax credits and
in work, who will see their rate go up from 72% or 73% to 76%, so it is
a small rise, but others—some people who will be brought on to
universal credit who are not currently getting tax credits—will
see a much larger rise. The people who see a fall will be the people
who are currently experiencing a multiple withdrawal of tax credits and
benefits, or the people currently facing the 100% withdrawal rate on an

effects will come from the change in the earnings disregard. That is
one issue that we have had concern about at Reform. If you look at the

labour market has been very
limited.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
you look at the US in particular, a lot of research has been done on
its temporary assistance for needy families. Different states have
different levels of earnings disregards, so the researchers were able
to see whether that translated into different labour market effects in
different states, but that did not happen. There were a couple of
reasons for that. One is complexity, which we may or may not address
with the universal credit; we still have not figured that out. The
other issue is that the earnings disregards operate only when people
make that initial decision to work, and particularly if they are
working for low wages or for a small number of hours. These disregards
are also based on a household level. What all that means is that if I
am sitting here out of work and I have the choice to take on part-time
work, I might be encouraged into work. But if I am sitting here with a
chance to go into a well-paid, full-time job or a full-time job in
which I would still be eligible for some universal credit, the
disregard will not improve my incentives to work. If I am already
working and I have a partner who is a second earner and who wants to go
and work as well, the disregard will not improve the incentives. So the
disregards have a very mixed effect on improving work incentives, and
the international evidence suggests that they are not
effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000102">&#160;</a>

not necessarily answer your question directly—is that we are
focusing a lot on the financial incentives, and there is a lot more
than just the financial incentives. As Patrick said earlier, the
international evidence is somewhat mixed on the impact that increased
financial incentives can have on large proportions of the labour
market. Yes, they will help some marginal groups. For instance, lone
parents are cited as a group that is quite responsive to financial
incentives. But for the majority of what we used to call prime-age
males, whom a lot of the research focuses on, the impact of financial
incentives is quite small, whereas the impact of other things, like
conditionality and enforcing sanctions properly, is much stronger. I
would like to move away from thinking about what the optimal deduction
rate is, because there are things that could have a much stronger
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000108">&#160;</a>

could have a lower deduction rate, but you will then push the abatement
further up the income distribution. That will mean that people who

disregards. Patrick Nolan has just explained to us that one consequence
could be that they discourage second earners and couples from entering
the labour market. To what extent is that because the benefit is
designed as a household benefit? Could that be addressed by assessing
each member of a couple individually?<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000110">&#160;</a>

family-level benefit. There are many ways the Government could solve
this. The suggestion that I made in my work two or three years ago was
that each person in a couple might have their own disregard. That would
not be a full separation of benefits, which I think is what you were
asking about, but it would ensure that the second earner’s
incentives were not that different

as Patrick said, the consequence is that it would extend universal
credit further up the distribution to slightly better-off couples. But
if you are particularly concerned about second earners, my preference
is to give each person in the couple their own disregard, perhaps at a
lower rate than the current
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000111">&#160;</a>

I wanted to pick up on the discussion about household versus individual
assessments. I am not quite sure how much it is on the table as a
possibility, but I just want to inform the Committee that, in the piece
of work on radical benefit reform that we did last year with members of
the claiming population, individual assessment spontaneously arose as a
thing that people were very keen on. They saw it as beneficial to
understanding their situation, and to understanding how the benefits
system and work would
interact.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000114">&#160;</a>

together is the single most common or highest value reason for benefit
fraud; it is higher than earnings fraud and so on. It is an interesting
idea. I am not quite sure how far the Government are thinking about
individual assessment, but it has some traction with members of the

for Social Justice opted for payments on a household basis in
“Dynamic Benefits”. Fundamentally, it is because it
concentrates work incentives on workless households. By concentrating
the disregard on the first earner, you maximise the incentive of having
that first earner in a workless household going to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000116">&#160;</a>

Brewer:</strong>
                           </em> In the current system, if you are receiving
help with housing costs, you effectively face a higher marginal
withdrawal rate, because you lose your housing benefit and your tax
credits at the same time. The Government did not want that; they wanted
a single deduction rate to apply to everybody. If they did not reduce
the disregard for those receiving housing support, the universal credit
would go way up the earnings distribution to ridiculous, unaffordable,
unimaginable amounts for somebody receiving housing benefit. Having a
lower disregard for those receiving help with housing costs is the only
way the Government can afford to implement the universal credit and
have a single withdrawal rate—maximum 76% applying to everybody.
It is almost inevitable. Essentially, it is broadly replicating the
current system. Basically, with the universal credit we will start
tapering sooner but at a slower rate than under the current system,
where we start a bit later and taper it away more quickly. It is not
quite as discriminatory as you might think it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000120">&#160;</a>

income rule. The fact is that somebody with £15,000 of capital
will have an income imputed to them of something in the order of
£40 a week. In many cases, that will remove all entitlement to
universal credit, so it is not the cliff edge that is the important
thing; it is the £1 of income imputed for every £200 of
capital that

Sainsbury, you mentioned family credit earlier. Was it the case in
family credit that there was a savings cap such as this? It certainly
wasn’t present in the tax credit system, but I wonder whether it

Centre for Social Justice was critical of the effect of the savings cap

your advice on this and to extend the cap into in-work benefits. Can

I think that the savings limit for people who are not working and are
on benefits has been £16,000 for I am not sure how many years,
but certainly rather a lot. The limit has not been uprated for at least
a decade I would say, and possibly a lot longer. By extending that to
people who are working, people who get close to that threshold might
suddenly realise that it does not pay to save and that there are
perhaps other things that they should be doing with the money, whereas
saving is in itself a protection against
dependency.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000132">&#160;</a>

extension of the means-tested rules into in-work benefits is the effect
on unearned non-investment income, and the IFS preliminary analysis
picks that out. Could you tell us what kinds of income will be treated
less generously under universal credit than under the current tax
credit system? You mention in your analysis widows pensions, private
pensions and maintenance payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000133">&#160;</a>

this was our interpretation of what the Government said in the White
Paper and we do not yet know all the details. You have listed some of
the income categories. Certain benefits, including statutory maternity
pay, the widows pension and maintenance payments that are made by a
former spouse to the adult rather than the child—child
maintenance will be disregarded—would be counted as income. The
key difference from tax credits is that those things will be tapered
away at a 100% withdrawal rate, and not at the 65% rate that we talked
about earlier, which applies to earnings. That rate is much higher than
the one under tax credits at the moment, which is 41% or 43%, or in
some cases, for example with statutory maternity pay, it is disregarded
entirely.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000134">&#160;</a>

Benefits” that child care be the subject of a separate piece of
research. It is an important area and it deserves its own detailed
investigation. Having said that, there are some challenges that we
face, and I would like to make three points about child care. First,
the fundamental cost of child care in this country is extremely high,
and that is perhaps the first policy issue that needs to be resolved.
The second point is about incentives, about the difference between the
cost of child care and the capability to earn per hour of a lone
parent, or a mother or father, versus the hourly cost of child care.
That is the driver. Thirdly, at the same time, and at a time of very
tight fiscal constraints, there perhaps needs to be some open debate
about the extent to which subsidising child care is the best use of
funds. That is where we were with the debate, and it is partly why the
issue was not something that could easily be addressed as a subsection
within “Dynamic Benefits.” It certainly deserves its own
investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000136">&#160;</a>

is that it is always a good thing that the Government are thinking
about how best to support child care. They probably cannot just
directly import what we have at the moment into universal credit
because the current system relies on hours rules and the Government do
not want to have hours rules in universal credit. Quite rightly,
therefore, they are thinking about what else they could do. It is also
the case that the administration of the current system is not at all
ideal. The child care element of tax credits is disproportionately the
cause of loss, overpayments, and fraud and error. I welcome that the
Government are thinking about how better to administer

flexibility of the hours of the job that you are going to do and the
flexibility of child care also need to accommodate that. Those are

the potential implementation of something like dynamic benefit before
the election. There are some passported benefits, such as free school
meals, which are relatively evenly distributed. The way that you might
deal with those is to impute the financial value towards the value of
that benefit—something like free school meals might be
£25 a week or so, although I am not sure—and tapering
that away from the award, either at the start by reducing the disregard
and thereby reclaiming the money sooner, or at the end by extending the
taper, by £25 further. That would be one way you might be able
to reclaim that. Where that system falls down perhaps is where you have
very irregular types of passported benefits, such as prescriptions and
dental care. The imputed cash value does not necessarily work quite so
well

previously, and I think that some of the answers around the issues of
child care and passported benefits kind of talk to that as well.
Universal credit can’t do everything. It is not possible to get
all of this into universal credit without getting back to the situation
we have just come from. We have a very complex system because it tried
to take account of all of these problems. I think that is why
Government are not saying very much about some of these things, because
it is so difficult. I wonder whether we should be putting all this need
into the universal credit and whether we should be thinking about
things separately—our child care system, passported benefits. It
is so, so
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000154">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Summing
up, I think financial incentives are not necessarily everything. Yes,
we give passported benefits for a reason—because people who are
on very low incomes benefit and need that kind of support—but,
just because they go to work and lose that, doesn’t mean that
they shouldn’t go to work. It should be about

recognise that, if the work is available and adequate, and the person
can have a reasonable life—however we define that—then
the person should take that work. Whether or not they are better off on
a benefit should be irrelevant. It sounds like a hard-nosed thing to
say, but the reason that I say that is because, if you look all around
the world, every country is having these sorts of problems and debates,
because you can’t ever design a system in which everyone at
every time is always better off in work. At some point, there has to be
at least a nugget of responsibility where we have to say to people,
“Actually, you can have an adequate life in work, you have to go
and
work.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000161">&#160;</a>

is not so much a moral issue, but how we see benefit claimants interact
with the system. If, actually, so many other parts of the system need
to play a role—conditionality and back-to-work support being

terms of the affordability of going back to work. I speak as someone
who pays £48 a week for school meals, because I have so many
children perhaps. It is a crucial issue because, quite often, the money
comes from the mother. The whole thrust of the Bill is to make work
affordable, so the act of physical transfer of money at the end of the
week is an important
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000163">&#160;</a>

have a second point on passported benefits that I would like you all to
comment on. In Wales, we have a devolved Administration responsible for
the payment and administration of free school meals. It is imperative
that, in an area such as Wales where there is such a dependency on the
welfare state, any system brought into play takes into account the
difference from a devolved system’s point of view. Is there any
evidence to show that free school meals are an important issue when
people make decisions about whether to
work?<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000164">&#160;</a>

they are administered, so they act as cliff edge at the
moment—you can see how that might impact on people’s
decisions on whether to work, particularly if their earnings do not
accommodate for what is lost through passported benefits. The point I
made earlier was that through the universal credit, it does not
necessarily have to have that

evidence that shows it is an issue, but there is a great deal of
qualitative evidence of people on benefits saying that it is a major
barrier to moving into work. It makes sense that it would be. If you
have several children of school age, paying for their lunch is a big
deal. I think that it is an important issue. The previous Government
announced that they would extend free school meals to people on working
tax credits, and it would have been very interesting to see not only
how that affected children’s behaviour at school but whether it
affected work incentives. This Government decided not to go ahead with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000166">&#160;</a>

appreciate that you might not be able to answer it. Obviously, the
current system is not perfect, and there might be flaws in what is
proposed, but do you feel that there is a signal in this in terms of
the tacit understanding that many people have with the current benefits
system? Fundamentally, at its core it is trying to give the ethos that,
regardless of whether people are worse off or better off, it is to
everybody’s benefit—not only the individual’s, but
society’s—that work should pay. I appreciate that I am

hoped-for computer system that will work in real-time with PAYE and
make immediate adjustments of universal credit as earnings change will
help. It will certainly help to cut down fraud and error in that
particular area. However, most fraud and error does not occur because
of earnings. I mentioned earlier that the big one is living together.
Earnings account for a small percentage of fraud and error. Fraud and
error are very different between different benefits and tax credits.
Undeclared partners, child care costs and the number of children are
all reasons for fraud and error on tax credits, and universal credit is
not going to make it any different. There are still people who will be
able to declare the wrong number of children or claim different child
care costs and so on. I must admit that I fail to see and have seen no
justification for those savings figures. I fear that we may be
disappointed, because, although universal credit will bring benefits in
many different ways, it will not be the answer to fraud and

incredibly important. In particular, if such a small proportion of
fraud and error is related to earnings, it means that we have to
monitor things like changes in family circumstances, how long a child
is staying with different care givers and separated households. Those
are the things that we cannot actually use smart automation to address,
so we are trying to develop this IT system. We have quite a poor record
of developing IT systems in this country—look at the child
support programme in 2003 and Connecting for Health. When you add on to
that the complexity of dealing with some of the most complex families
in the country—people who are, inherently, dealing with
difficult lives and whose circumstances are changing a lot—I do
not think we are going to be able to develop the IT

obviously driving what makes this affordable, so you have to worry that
you are over-egging that slightly. If you take away the fraud and error

change in circumstances—you have an overall cost of £4.6
billion. You have to think about whether that is a cost-effective way

conditionality and sanctions on people’s behaviour is much more
mixed. There seems to be an over-emphasis on that in policy. I am sure
that you will all agree from your own experience as MPs that most
people want to work. They do not need sanctions or conditions; they
need help, jobs and opportunities. I can understand why there is an
interest in a hard core of people who resist work at all costs. Of
course, as one of you said, we need to draw a line somewhere. What is

something other than universal credit. There are major provisions in
the Bill about disability living allowance and I want to take the
opportunity to focus on the new assessment that we are looking at.
Disability living allowance currently relies on self-assessment of an
individual of their own condition. That has led, by necessity, to a
very complex assessment form.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000190">&#160;</a>

that you have been involved in how that might be improved in future.
Vicki might also want to contribute. How have you been able to look at
the assessment; how might it be improved; how have disabled people been
involved in the process; and how might they be involved in
future? After all, they are the people most affected by the provisions
we are making in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000191">&#160;</a>

Rickell:</strong>
                           </em> We start with an issue around the concept of
assessment generally—the idea that somebody comes and makes an
assessment of a disabled person. One issue has been to try to find a
way to create an assessment that disabled people feel is
credible.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Traditionally
and interestingly, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced the
concept of the assessment, he used the word “medical”.
That brings into disabled people’s minds a whole range of things
that we have been working really hard not to introduce into the
assessment. We have tried to avoid things such as the concept that
disability is all about someone’s impairment; that somehow
disabled people cannot be trusted to identify either intelligently or
accurately what their needs are; that such support is because someone
cannot do something rather than being an enabler to do something; that
each bit of support requires an appropriate and different assessment.
Of course, this assessment would be on top of all the other multiple
assessments that disabled people experience. The feeling in disabled
people’s heads is, “This is about protecting the
Exchequer rather than giving me a good deal.” All those are
things that you are trying to avoid in introducing the
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The group was
keen to look at how best to address that. We absolutely wanted to avoid
the medical-model concept of, “It’s all about your
impairment. Find your condition, and that justifies your level of
entitlement.” That is one of the reasons why we have avoided the
concept of automatic entitlement in the case of terminal illness. A key
thing that we discussed was identifying barriers to participation. That
was the fundamental basis on which the assessment seeks to work. It is
a bit like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and so on: identifying
basic needs and working backwards.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given that
the Government have given a steer in terms of identifying the people
with greatest need, we started on that basis and came up with a number
of different areas of living in which people might be regarded as most
disadvantaged if their needs are not met and the barriers are not
addressed. The obvious ones are feeding, clothing and so on. In
particular, introducing a priority for communication is one that I was
very keen to push on. Often, in these assessments, it sounds like the
disabled person gets treated as a dumb animal, yet communication is a
fundamental human right, and is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 27<a class="bkMark" name="Column27">&#160;</a>
                           </div>actually the precursor to all the other things. If you cannot
communicate, then all the other things that might be done are done to
you rather than being something in which you have a say. That was an
important introduction.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000195">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am aware
that in terms of the consultation that was done on the 10 or so
different areas of need, the consultees generally said yes, they
thought that we had hit the button. We were hitting basic issues of
daily living and the basic barriers that disabled people face. They
want their needs recognised in the process, but they also identified
one or two other needs that we had not met, such as parental
responsibility, which I have been pushing to get into the assessment,
as I think that it is a key issue for disabled parents and an issue
that the current assessment fails to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000196">&#160;</a>

right: it needs to be an assessment that disabled people feel has some
credibility. In that process, several members of the assessment group
were disabled people or the representatives of disabled people. Those
voices were certainly heard loud and clear. In terms of the process,
there is then going to be a whole raft of testing processes; I am very
pleased about that. Disabled people will be tested at various levels,
and the various different assessments will be judged against that.
There needs to be a consultation on the actual assessment. It is all
very well saying what those will be in terms of regulation and law, but
the fundamental thing is how the assessment works in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000198">&#160;</a>

Nash:</strong>
                           </em> From a mental health perspective, the
absolutely important point to get across is that DLA has provided a
real lifeline for many people with mental health problems. It helps to
have a smaller top-up so that people do not live in social isolation
but get out and have contact with their friends. The fact that the
individual can spend that money in a way that supports them is
critical. In any reform to the process, we would want to make sure of
that going forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000200">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Like any form
filling, it can sometimes be incredibly difficult. You need to have the
support in place to help see that through. A lot of the feedback that
we have from people is that it feels like they are not only having to
fill in forms for DLA but for a whole variety of different benefits and
processes. They are trying to engage with systems in health and social
care and work and pensions. It is incredibly complicated for people, so
obviously, again, any way to help to improve that system from a
user’s perspective would be helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000201">&#160;</a>

work for the majority of people. As

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of taking that to the next level, the challenge with DLA and its
successor, and with broader benefits is that because mental health
problems are often seen as an invisible illness, there is a stigma of
discrimination, and people don’t understand why it is needed. We
asked people on Facebook and Twitter to tell us what they wanted to say
to you about the impact of welfare and the changes that are coming. One
person commented, “I am ultra aware that others may think that
I’m a scrounger or a loser because I don’t have a real
illness and I don’t have a job. This is not a lifestyle I would
wish on anyone.” That is critical to the people we’re
talking about
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
challenge with trying to engage with the Bill at the moment is the lack
of detail of what is in the Bill and what it will cover, so it’s
difficult to work out what might work and what might not. Obviously,
we’re seeking to work with the Bill team and officials as it
goes forward. Specific to the DLA—obviously, Andy has spoken
about the efforts to try to make sure that we learn the lessons,
particularly from the work capability assessment—is that despite
the best intentions in terms of the language, it still uses medical
terminology and words such as “descriptors”, which
immediately send shock waves through the disability community, because
we’ve had such a difficult time getting the WCA to work for us.
Essentially, it’s not fit for
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000206">&#160;</a>

with the challenges of the assessment and people’s fear and

really helpful to get them on the table. Perhaps I could just clarify
that obviously the budgets we are talking about are keeping expenditure
at the same level as last year, and the reduction in expenditure is
about a reduction in the growth of expenditure. It is really important

Committee to explore, but I’m frustrated because I can’t
possibly ask as much as I would like to. I want to ask both of you a
couple of questions. One is that DLA, warts and all—many
improvements are required—is still a valued and important
benefit. It is well understood, and people know its purpose. It is
important to understand
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000210">&#160;</a>

second point, particularly to you Andy, is about the assessment
process. One thing disabled people tell me is that they are worried
about the term “greatest need” in the context of cuts,
particularly in relation to mental health, because they worry that the
benefit will be targeted at people with noticeable disabilities, and
that there will be a hierarchy of disability, and only those with the
most noticeable disabilities will attract the benefits. There could be
difficult cuts, and the assessment process might be the means to do
that. Are

                           </em> Yes, and in a sense what it looks like on
paper is one thing; how it’s delivered is another thing
entirely. The Harrington review picked up on issues about the
relationship between the assessment and how it’s delivered, and
how it can have a major impact on how people feel about it.
Effectively, a lot of the detail will be how it is delivered. You are
going to make a judgment about the high-level stuff. In reality, it
will be the lower level stuff and what happens day to day that will
make the big difference. If you can influence that, it would be really
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
are a number of things that I think can help the process. One is to get
away from the idea of where the assessments are located; they should
not be to do with anything medical. There is something about who might
do the assessment process, and it might be good to get away from the
concept that it has to be done by a medically qualified professional;
we would argue that disabled people have a competitive advantage in
potentially being very good assessors.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
something about the assessment process allowing the person to put their
case in the best way that they can—it might be online, it might
be on paper, it might be face to face. A face-to-face interview might
be what a person wants rather than having to fill in a form first,
because that might be a barrier. It is a means by which a person is
able to have a genuine dialogue with the assessor, being able to put
their case across, with support if necessary, and being able to
challenge any views that the assessor has about what they think they
might be going to do to that individual, so that the person can then
challenge it. It is something about enabling the person to get their
case across.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You are
absolutely right that there are issues around how you assess,
particularly given that mental conditions are often fluctuating or
variable, and how you go about doing that. If someone does not have a
leg, they do not have a leg; it is clear, and it is not going to
change. In terms of fluctuating conditions, on the day that they are
being assessed or being asked about their assessment the person may not
be able successfully to put their case across.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
issues for me when talking about the assessment process in the group is
how to ensure that people with fluctuating conditions are able to give
the genuine worst-case of a situation that they are in, rather than
being asked a general average. There is something about really being
able to understand what this is.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
problems might be if one was to include the question, “What is
your condition most of the time?” Again, that creates a
requirement that may not necessarily apply for a mental health
condition; the person may have episodes that are extreme but not
necessarily for 50% of the time or more, but the nature of their
situation means that they ought to qualify for the benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
something about getting away from the idea that it is a lot easier to
assess a physical condition; the issue in the assessment process,
particularly in the testing, will be how to ensure that those other
conditions, which are not so easy to judge, can be judged
fairly.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000218">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Thank you. Our assessment, broadly, is that
we think it will make it easier for people to understand whether or not
they are better off in work. Previous work for a range of organisations
has shown that, under the current benefit system, most people are
better off in work. The question is whether or not they believe that
they are better off in work. The combination of housing benefit, tax
credits and the main DWP workless benefits is difficult to navigate.
The universal credit promises to be very much simpler, and people
should be able to understand whether they would be better off in work
without having to make complex calculations. However, it is still
complex to some extent. Unfortunately—I do think it is
unfortunate—the decision on council tax benefit adds an extra
level of complexity that we would rather not have.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000221">&#160;</a>

of information on which you can base an answer to that question. You
have the impact assessment from the DWP and the work by the IFS. Both
rely on an econometric approach to work incentives, and I think that
you have to incorporate other research that looks at what work
incentives are salient to people who are currently on benefits or in
low-paid work. I am not sure that they are exactly the same thing. The
qualitative research that we have funded has asked people on the
margins of low-paid work what they look for in jobs and so on, and it
shows that they have a very high work ethic. I think, therefore, that
some assumptions about what work incentives are doing to people in the
econometric models may not be playing out on the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000224">&#160;</a>

tries to understand and develop a theory about how people behave. That
is different to quantitative work, which tests those theories on a
broader basis. It is wrong to talk of it as representative, in that
sense, because you are trying to develop a theory of how people behave.
The people that we talk to in our research present a very strong work
ethic, and that is represented in lots of studies around the country
over the past 10 or 20 years. It is not a matter of it being a number
of people; it is based on talking to people and representing what they
tell us. Therefore, if you want representation, you have to look at
quantitative work. What I am saying is that you should not prioritise
one over the other; you have to look at both together. The danger is
that there is too much emphasis on financial work incentives, at the
risk of looking less at what are salient work incentives to people who
are in that
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000228">&#160;</a>

said that, because the universal credit will make it easier for people
to do low hours work, and possibly make it easier for them to do
low-paid work, there is a chance that in-work poverty could rise. If
more people are going from benefits into low hours, low-paid work, they
will not be workless, obviously, but they may still not be earning
enough to take them over the poverty line. There is an issue in the UK
labour market with a dual approach, where there is one sector which
very much has low-paid, insecure jobs. Trying to get from that sector
into the more mainstream sector is quite difficult, and that is linked
to geographical patterns of worklessness and where the jobs
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000229">&#160;</a>

linked to labour market growth policies and skills policies. If those

from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, about the potential winners and
losers from the universal credit—who they are, and what their

will gain and who will lose.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000231">&#160;</a>

things. One thing that we are particularly concerned about is that we
cannot define who will win and who will lose to quite the extent that
we would want to, because there are things that are left open at this
stage. I am thinking particularly about child care at this point. We do
not know whether the child care regime will be more or less supportive
of parents working than the previous one. We have very little clarity
on that. There is a danger, given the total budget allocated, that
things could go the wrong way. Depending on the regulations and the way
in which it is managed and set out, it could possibly go the other way.
We have not gone into the same level of detail as the IFS. We are more
concerned about the dynamics of things.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000232">&#160;</a>

the perverse consequence of making the tapers better, because they will
not be included in the calculations, but they could leave people with a
larger cost and, therefore, potentially push them into poverty. Is that
something that we should be concerned about and are there ways of
monitoring it more closely or finding a way round
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000234">&#160;</a>

huge proportion of many people’s budgets. Those two interfaces
are the most critical. The changes that are proposed to the percentage
of rent that housing benefit will cover are completely critical to
whether or not people can afford to meet their basic living costs. The
changes that are proposed to housing benefit and the way in which they
interface with universal credit are very worrying, particularly as
housing benefit will cover a smaller proportion of people’s
actual housing costs in the future. We do not know at the moment how
universal credit will work on child care costs. We do not know exactly
what proportion of people’s child care costs it will
cover.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000235">&#160;</a>

two areas that run the real risk of undermining the idea of work
incentives. I completely support the principle of universal credit and
trying to make it possible for people to take work that it is not
logical for them to take at the moment. If you are on a very low
income, your overriding concern is your security of income. Universal
credit will make it more possible for people to take work, which they
are not secure in taking at the moment. To make sure that people remain
in that position, by giving them security over their housing costs and
clarity over how their child care costs will be covered, is
fundamental.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000236">&#160;</a>

very supportive of the principle of trying to make a system that is as
easy as possible to navigate. We do not think that the changes to
universal credit will be the silver bullet to make a dramatic impact on
the number of people with mental health problems going back into work.
It is important to make that point when discussing the long-term goal
of getting people back into work. The changes deal with a number of
issues related to providing that tailored support to get people back
into the workplace. Equally, they have to tackle the existing employee
discrimination that is live and present in our

will have an increase in entitlement to £5.40 a week. According
to the impact assessment, universal credit is sharply focused on the

plausible. They are based on extra money for people who are receiving
benefit who tend to be at the bottom of the income distribution, and
that is based on increasing the take-up of benefits—there is a
low take-up on certain benefits at the moment. Both those will be
progressive, in the parlance. We are funding IFS to look at the impact
of universal credit on poverty up to 2020, which we hope will come out
in the summer. I do not know whether Mike Brewer mentioned that work
earlier. So we will be number crunching to look at what we think will
be the impact on poverty. I agree that it will be beneficial if it does
what it says it will do, but that relies on jobs being available that
take people out of poverty when they go from benefits into

raised another issue that is important in terms of work incentives.
There are extra costs of working that people need to take into
account—that is what the work incentive calculation consists
of—but it might be worth their while taking a hit in the shorter
term if the job will lead to higher wages and a more secure future in
the longer term. Thought needs to be given in the Bill about how
conditionality can be used in a positive way to try to encourage that
route out of poverty, so that people do not get stuck in insecure,
low-paid work. There is a risk that the Bill looks at work as the end
point, and not what happens to people’s careers and earning

impact assessment—not the extent to which it is economically
progressive but the impact on women and gender. One particular concern
that we have is the move to a single payment per household, and the
decision-making structures around that—how a household decides
who the payment is made to. We think it is an unsafe assumption that
the income will be fairly distributed within households. About 70% or
80% of household payments are currently claimed by men, and we have
evidence that shows that it is not safe to assume that they are then
spent equally to the benefit of all members of the household.
Basically, it matters who payments are made to. If they are made to
women, they are far more likely to be spent on children than if they
are made to men. That is the evidence
base.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000242">&#160;</a>

that underlies that question. This follows on from something that one
of your previous panellists said and also from what Chris said. I
believe very strongly that work incentives are not the root of the
issue for the majority of the people who are on benefits. The universal
credit, which is trying very hard to sort out our current benefit
system, will make it far more rational and secure for people to take
the sort of work that is often available to them. At the moment, it is
a rational decision not to take short-term, insecure work because of
the way that the benefits system is structured. Once that has been
resolved, it will be much easier to see whether there is an issue with
people’s actual motivation to take
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000249">&#160;</a>

is a distrust of qualitative evidence bases, but I think that the
qualitative evidence base is worth scrutiny. It shows that there are
very complex and often very rational reasons why people are not taking

I am opposed to anyone being left in destitution in the UK. Secondly,
the conditionality regime will capture and penalise an awful lot of
people who it is not designed to penalise. When I spoke to Lord Freud,
he said that he believed that the only people who would fall foul of
conditionality regimes were those who were working informally. I think
that it will also hit people with mental health problems, those who do
not have one secure address and who miss letters and all sorts of other
people who it is not intended to hit. We will leave some of the most
vulnerable people in our country with no incomes. We will then have to
pick up the pieces of those decisions, in terms of the impact on their

the more you do the research on it, the less the impact of skills
training appears to be. In fact, most research that we have seen
recently shows that basic skills training has a negative impact on
employment chances and earning chances. That is international, in the

not a good idea. We recognise the issue of the casualisation

how the work programme is being funded, it recognises sustained work as
being spells of four weeks, of which there can be a substantial number
of spells that are funded and regarded as a job that a provider gets
funds for. I think that it is the right approach to try not to see it
as a single job, but to see moving from one job to another without
troubling the DWP as the aim of moving people from welfare to work.
People see a sustained job as being a single sustained job, but we do
not necessarily see it as that. It can be a process of moving from one
job to another without claiming benefits in between. People will claim
benefits in between, and they need help to go straight back
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000254">&#160;</a>

to which conditionality goes beyond a tipping point, because
it means that people lose the will to engage. Conditionality works up
to a point, but beyond that point, considerable numbers of
people disengage. We have some of that with the large numbers of people
who are unemployed under the International Labour Organisation
definition but not claiming benefits. They are therefore not receiving

to the rule, but generally there is a real lack of understanding about
mental health. Obviously, that does not just have an impact on the
welfare and benefit side, and the changes proposed in the health and
social care systems at the moment are of significant concern. How do we
ensure that GPs have expertise in commissioning services that are
appropriate for such people and supporting them if they are trying to
get back into work?<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000259">&#160;</a>

assessment are absolutely valid in terms of the issues we have been
thinking about. One point is certainly that the assessment will not be
a snapshot in time, and the assessment of the person’s
experiences over an extended period will be sufficiently large to
capture the variation in need. Sometimes the best person can be the GP.
We have said that the claimant can provide whatever evidence they find
is best to justify their situation. The issue is about finding
independent evidence for themselves. That could come from a number of
sources—the GP might be one, secondary services might be
another. It could be anything that helps to get an accurate
understanding of the reality of the situation, so that the assessment
can be
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000264">&#160;</a>

people to take the sorts of work that it is not rational for them to

are the move to a monthly payment and no flexibility around that, which
will leave a lot of families very short of money at the end of the
month, and the linking of that benefit payment to CPI, which will
increase the gap between people on benefits and people in work in terms
of how much money they have. That does not reflect the inflationary
pressures that people on low incomes face in terms of fuel and food

the system at the moment is people not declaring
relationships. One of the main reasons for that is because
they fear making themselves economically dependent—women, often,
on a man who is at that point not the best known prospect. Again, with
a shift to universal credit and a shift to one payment per household,
the risk for that woman is going to increase. If
she invites a man to form a relationship with her, the risk
to her entire income, now, rather than just the housing-related
component, is going to grow. When we are looking at the payment
structure, we need to think about what that looks like from the
perspective of an individual making a choice. If that woman is entering
into a relationship, her choice will become one of making herself
totally economically reliant on her new partner, or not declaring that
relationship. It is upping the game in terms of what that system looks
like from her perspective.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000272">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding a
lot of the fraud that we have talked about relating to cohabitation,
one of the relevant issues is the extent to which the JSA system
promotes that. If you are a man in a casual job with a girlfriend and a
baby, and you are a construction labourer going from one site to
another, you claim JSA in between and your housing benefit. You have
waiting days for JSA. You have a housing benefit claim that cuts in,
and when you are in work you may have an in-work housing benefit claim.
Those systems do not work together if you have a family and children,
because you will end up with the housing benefit administration not
working in time, and you will end up with large numbers of waiting days
for your JSA claim.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000276">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We need the
system to be able to manage the situation for that sort of family, so
that they can claim legitimately. The temptation in those circumstances
is for the man to disappear from any claim. We do not know the extent
to which that happens, but we have some idea that it might be
occurring. There is a fraud, but in a sense it is a fraud that is
promulgated by the system. I am hoping that UC should, in principle,
provide some ways of handling this. I am not sure, however, because a
lot of this is regulations about things such as waiting days for those
claiming unemployment-related UC, and the extent to which the housing
element will work its changes in circumstances as quickly as the JSA
one does. There is an awful lot of detail about administration and the
IT working, but I think that that system actually promotes a nominal
fraud, because the system does not work for families—that is the
JSA system and the HB administration together.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000277">&#160;</a>

Nash:</strong>
                           </em> I think it is important to put the question of
fraud into a broader context. We are talking about universal credit,
but if you take the example of DLA, only 0.5% of claims are fraudulent
and there is 2% of error. The lesson to learn from that, and where we
have other problems in the welfare system, is not to develop a system
that is built around the very small minority of cases where things do
not work, and instead to focus on the majority. I think that that is
why we have a real problem with the welfare system as it stands at the
moment, because it really is quite unfair and ineffective for the
majority. Take, for example, the large numbers of people with mental
health problems having to struggle through the system at the moment. It
simply does not work, and the sanctions do not seem to work to get
people back into the workplace. In fact, they exacerbate
people’s stress and anxiety. When the Burnley and Aberdeen
trials were announced for the work capability assessment, we saw a peak
in our information lines, in terms of the cause of people experiencing
distress and, to some extent, suicidal thoughts. Those people are very
frightened at the moment and we are trying to support them as much as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000278">&#160;</a>

impact of sanctions internationally and it shows that using sanctions
gets your benefits bill down but the research does not really show what
happens to people after they come off benefits. An interesting study
was done in Switzerland, which tracked people after they came off
benefits. It found that people who had been sanctioned went into less
secure and less well-paid jobs than people who had not been
sanctioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000281">&#160;</a>

punishing people for not complying with the

disability elements into one element, so that you have one gateway in
which the disability element of the universal credit is obtained.
Potentially we are then into another assessment process and it would be
good if we take the opportunity to get an assessment process that is
fit for purpose and if possible to bury the work capability assessment,
given that there is an opportunity to do so. There is something there
about thinking through a process that, again, is as streamlined as
possible for disabled people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000285">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I would be very worried if prescriptions and
free school meals were to become a cash amount that was built into a
weekly budget, and tailored out as part of universal credit.
The reason is that, particularly with prescriptions, it is actually a
lot of money to hit in a week. If you need two items and you suddenly
find that that is the amount that you need to pay out of an incredibly
tight weekly income, you are very likely to decide not to redeem those
prescriptions and to deny yourself medical
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
we need to retain a way of enabling people on very low incomes to
receive free prescriptions, particularly because it is not a regular
sort of expenditure. Lord Freud has talked about a waterfall, rather
than a cliff edge. I completely see the problem of having a passport to
benefits with a cliff edge attached. The other side to that, though, is
that we need a system that means people do not have to face the choice
of whether they can afford to meet such a large expense if it falls in
a particular week, I would leave prescription charges outside of the
universal credit, and I think they should remain passported in some
way. In terms of free school meals, I think the waterfall approach that
has been talked about has a lot of merit. It will enable people to
budget in a way that they can handle, and it will mean that kids still
get fed at
lunchtime.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000290">&#160;</a>

in our work with homeless people, we see people with both housing
benefit issues and a history of substance abuse and other such

for prescription charges, it is actually a very severe issue. People in
such circumstances, generally speaking, are not in a position to buy a
season ticket for their prescription charges. I do not have a solution,
unfortunately, but I think it is something that Ministers need to
ensure they negotiate with the Department of

                           </em> There is an issue. Going back to the earlier
point, it can only help to have one agency administering the benefits,
rather than three or four. Council tax and, to some extent, the social
fund seem to be entirely against the fundamental principle of the Bill
that there should be a simple one-stop shop for your benefits. So
devolution of council tax and the social fund to local authorities does
not seem to fit with the principles behind the Bill. I know it is being
looked at, but I would add my own thoughts to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000295">&#160;</a>

not take account of the size of your family and, therefore, what your
needs are. Rather than having a link to average earnings, your needs
are determined by your situation. I can see the rationale for a cap,
but I think it would be better if it related more to people’s
real needs, rather than being an arbitrary, “This is what the
average earnings in society
are.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032297000297">&#160;</a>

the cost of a benefit package is housing costs. Such costs give someone
access to a property; they do not give that person a large amount of
money in benefits as such. I do not think a cap is a sensible approach.

worried about the uncertainty that there still is in the Bill about
whether or not child benefit will come within
