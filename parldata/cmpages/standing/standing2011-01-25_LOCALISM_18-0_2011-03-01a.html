                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked whether particular officers of her authority would feel
able to respond to the pressures on planning that might arise in the
future. One of our proposed changes, which is out to consultation, is
that planning authorities should be able to recover the full costs of
their service in a way that they cannot at the moment. It ought not to
be the case that a planning authority cannot afford to put in the
necessary work to consider planning applications because of the
resources
available.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a good opportunity to address the points that the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington made about Planning Aid. When drawing up the
neighbourhood planning provisions, I insisted that we make support
available to communities and local authorities to ensure that people
could avail themselves of the rights that are available. The Committee
has had various discussions about how the capacity for communities to
put together 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 710<a class="bkMark" name="Column710">&#160;</a>
                           </div>neighbourhood plans will no doubt differ from place to place, although
where there will be differences is not entirely predictable. The hon.
Gentleman mentioned Castle Vale in his constituency several times, and
I know from visiting it that it is a remarkable place with strong
capacity and a tradition of strong community leadership. Nevertheless,
there will be other parts of the country that should benefit from the
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In what was
clearly a difficult public spending round for the comprehensive
spending review settlement, we have been able to secure £5.5
million to support the early stages of the new neighbourhood planning
system. We have made sure that £2.5 million over four years will
go specifically to the Planning Advisory Service so that local
authorities can develop their skills and knowledge, and build up the
expertise that is necessary to be able to operate at the optimal level
of capacity. We have also provided—I was very keen to do
this—approximately £3 million of funding a year so that
neighbourhoods themselves have access to independent advice. I
am proud that we have managed to secure more than £5
million of funding for support, and that is over and above the new
burdens funding that automatically flows from the costs arising on
local authorities and others. At a time when it is apparent that there
was great pressure on programmes, it is an achievement that we have
been able to secure such important
funding.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question is what to do with the money and how to allocate it. The
intention of the Bill, as I think all Members know by now, is to try to
move our system towards a plan-making basis where communities have the
chance to express their aspirations in plans, rather than relying, as
we have to date, on what is in effect the development control process,
which often involves arguing with lawyers—it is certainly a
litigious process—about particular planning applications. Our
approach explicitly reflects the policy intent of the Bill: we should
use money to provide communities with the chance to build up their
capacity to develop plans, including neighbourhood plans.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the issue
of allocation, it seems to me that there is no monopoly on wisdom.
Different groups of experts and different bodies throughout the
country, especially national ones, will be able to give advice to
communities. I felt that to have a single body as the only source of
advice to communities on neighbourhood planning would be wrong and
inconsistent with the type of approach that we have taken elsewhere in
the Bill on community rights, for example, under which we have enabled
other bodies to express an interest in providing a service.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For that
reason, we have invited applications for the fund. I have been advised
that Planning Aid England is one of the applicants. This is a big
opportunity, not just for Planning Aid—obviously I cannot
prejudice the determination of its application—but for other
organisations that have, for the first time, the chance to come
together and prepare a means of supporting communities in producing
plans. I can tell the Committee that we have had 37 applications for
funding under this programme from organisations up and the down the
country. As one might expect, we are going through a rigorous selection
process, including shortlisting and then further assessment of their
applications. One question that we particularly want to assess is what
added value can be brought by different types of organisations. We want
to bring experience of different types of communities

unfortunately I do not have with me. That has been communicated
publicly, and bidders will be rigorously judged against those criteria.
We indicated in that letter that we would like a small number of

                        <p class="tabbed">Inspiration
has reached me about the selection criteria, which are in the
prospectus that has been published and is widely available. The key
considerations that have been suggested for applications are that
advice, assistance and guidance should be made available in respect of
as many areas in England as is practical and that communities should
have a choice of the provider of assistance, advice and guidance. There
are various other things about which I will not detain the Committee
with too much detail concerning the track record of the organisation

                           </span> I have two points.
First, our concern is that looking at the totality of support on the
one hand, and the funding within local authorities for planning
departments on the other, we will see less overall, although much more
is demanded of planning departments and also those who assist
communities in the development of neighbourhood plans. For all the
reasons that we have rehearsed this morning, we are worried that a
problem of capacity might get in the way of communities’ ability
to take advantage of the opportunities that are now open to them. To
that end, we will monitor the situation carefully as it unfolds, as I
hope that Government will. The Select Committee on Communities and
Local Government might also want to keep the matter under
review.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, we
have no problem with the notion of a diversity of provision of advice
to communities and local authorities. We want to place on record,
however, our regret that the arrangements that have successfully
pertained for some years with Planning Aid have been dismantled in such
a way. Although we accept that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 712<a class="bkMark" name="Column712">&#160;</a>
                           </div>those involved will be able to make an application, the fragmentation at
the next stage will not be helpful. Planning Aid is an excellent
organisation with a tried and tested record. The key thing now is to
keep experience under careful review as it unfolds. I stress again that
we do not want any community to lack support, advice and capacity if it
wants to take advantage of the opportunity to draw up a neighbourhood
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000046">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with the hon. Gentleman’s points
about the importance of ensuring that capacity is available. However,
he is a little too pessimistic when it comes to local authorities. As I
said earlier—I see that the hon. Member for Lewisham East is now
in the room—we have freed up an opportunity for local
authorities to recover the cost of the work that they undertake on
planning matters. If they avail themselves of this opportunity and
there is an increase in their planning work load, they will be able to
recover the costs of that in a way that they cannot at the moment
because the fees are capped. I repeat that we have made a commitment to
monitor the burdens on local authorities that arise from some of the
additional provisions in the Bill and to fund those new burdens. There
is no reason why local authorities should feel
disadvantaged.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
neighbourhoods, we are establishing the fund. We drafted the clause as
we did because it is currently not possible for the Secretary of State
to provide grants directly to neighbourhoods in such a way. The direct
provision of funding for that capacity represents a progressive step.
It was clearly significant that we secured the level of funding that we
did. However difficult a time this is for the employees of Planning
Aid, I dare say that they expected a difficult funding settlement.
Moreover, if they looked at the direction of the proposed policies of
the two parties that formed the coalition, it was clear that
neighbourhood planning would be an important theme, so I
think—and hope—that they have prepared for the increased
emphasis that we are putting on neighbourhood planning. However, as I
say, that will be a matter for Planning Aid’s application, which
has now been submitted and will be considered very
rigorously.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000048">&#160;</a>

123 (Disposal of Land by Principal Councils) of the Local Government
Act 1972 delete subsection
(2).”.<p class="tabbed">This
important amendment would introduce much-needed flexibility, with a
caveat that I will mention at the end of my remarks. The amendment
would give councils greater freedom to dispose of their land for the
price and purposes of their choosing. Section 123(2) of the Local
Government Act 1972 imposes a duty on local authorities to obtain best
consideration for the disposal of land. The statutory duty to obtain
best consideration is often cited as a reason why local authority land
cannot be disposed of to community groups or for affordable housing
use.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although there
are consent procedures to obtain permission, the statutory restriction
creates a culture in which immediate financial considerations are
thought to outweigh other social, environmental and economic interests.
Repealing the duty would allow local authorities to dispose of and
treat their assets more freely, and would be consistent with the aims
of localism. Such a policy would effectively reinforce what I hope will
be the impact of the forthcoming community right to reclaim land, and
would enable a step change in the transfer of surplus public sector
land for affordable housing and other sustainable
development.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
my conclusion, I shall mention the caveat. When it comes to public
assets, of course it is right to ensure that local authorities proceed
in the public interest and with due prudence. We do not for one moment
believe that, for example, fire sales of local authority assets by
authorities that are strapped for cash are appropriate. However,
conversely, we should have flexibility, so that valuable social,
environmental and housing initiatives can be proceeded with and are
driven by the public interest and the community. We hope that the
Government will agree to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000054">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s amendment. As he says, it is consistent with the
direction of our reforms to give more power and discretion to local
authorities, rather than requiring the Secretary of State always to
intervene. My reaction to the amendment, however, is that I am not sure
that the proposal is a matter for the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">First,
such applications are made relatively rarely in practice. I am told
that in recent years an average of just seven applications a year have
been made to the Secretary of State. I have made one or two such
decisions in the name of the Secretary of State, and they have always
been pretty straightforward, so it is not a huge burden. Secondly, I am
advised that it is not necessary to change primary legislation to
effect such a change; there is enough flexibility in existing
legislation, and it can be done administratively by amending the
general disposal
consent.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000056">&#160;</a>

undertake to reflect on alternative ways of addressing the issue, which
has merit. This is a slightly separate matter from the others that are

response. It is accepted that the existing arrangements are rarely

principle that the amendment has a noble objective, and there is
flexibility in existing legislation to facilitate the change, so we
welcome the Minister’s assurance that before Report he will look
at how we can take the matter forward, including promoting the

design is key to ensuring sustainable construction, sustainable
developments and, I dare say, environments in which people want to
live. We are all scarred by the lessons of the history of some of the
developments in our constituencies. I mentioned Castle Vale earlier; it
was a nightmare, with people queuing up to get out. It was a high-rise
estate clearly designed by architects and planners who never intended
living there themselves. It has since been levelled, rebuilt and
regenerated into fine two-storey housing that people are queuing up to
get into. It is of the highest importance that design is of the kind
valued by
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Design
review would ensure that proposed developments co-ordinate well with
their surroundings. Given that the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport has unexpectedly withdrawn funding from the Commission for
Architecture and the Built Environment and has announced that CABE will
merge with the Design Council, can the Government be sure that quality
design will continue to be a priority? Only 20 members of staff from a
previous total of 125 are expected to move to the new organisation. Do
the Government believe that they can continue to ensure that design is
represented properly in the planning process? Given the withdrawal of
funding and the merger, amendment 189 is all the more important in
ensuring continuing good design.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Such local initiatives are welcome, but
previously, organisations such as CABE with good track records of
advice, assistance and support worked strategically with Government and
local authorities. Where a reorganisation of the kind that I described
has taken place, the legitimate question that must be asked is whether
the Government can be sure that the objective of high-quality design
continues to be central to the planning process. I know that my right
hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich will go into further
detail on the subject, and I hope that the Government will hear what I
think is a good argument.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 152
ties in with our earlier helpful debate on the “town centre
first” policy. I do not intend to tread the same ground that we
trod earlier, but I would just say that it was absolutely apparent from
our debate in Committee and from the Westminster Hall debate held
before Christmas that Members of Parliament from all parties are
committed to ensuring that we have thriving town centres.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 152
seeks to strengthen the clause by placing a statutory duty on
developers to consult before applying for planning position. Developers
carrying out pre-application consultation must provide an independent
examination of the economic and social impact of the proposed
development. The scope of such an examination will be agreed by the
developers and the local planning authority before the
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The duty to
consult is an important and positive innovation in planning law. The
key to its success is ensuring that communities are provided with the
objective information that they need to make decisions, including
information on the potential impact on town centres. The amendment will
ensure that a meaningful assessment is made of the impact of
developments such as out-of-town shopping centres on the local economy
and the social fabric of the community. I stress in the spirit of
localism that the amendment would not impose the scope of the
examination—that is for the local planning authority to
decide—but it does empower local planning authorities to assess
what is best for their locality. I hope that the Government will feel
that they can support the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As my hon. Friend highlighted, amendment 189,
which I tabled, is concerned with design review and seeks specifically
to encourage developers entering pre-application discussions with a
local authority to have regard to the views of design review panels. I
will explain the logic behind the amendment in a moment, but I should
reiterate at the outset that, as I said at the beginning of our
proceedings, I am an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British
Architects; I say that only because it is responsible for
promoting amendment
189.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000072">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are all conscious of the importance of good design. I do not intend to
go into too much history, but as the Member of Parliament for Greenwich
I cannot but make the point that areas that have some of the finest
historical buildings in our country are immensely proud of them, and we
know the value that good design has given to our society over the ages.
Periods that have generated buildings of wonderful quality are looked
back on as high points in our country’s history.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Poor-quality
design has the obverse effect. People feel cynical. People feel that
developers are simply trying to put buildings up to make money, without
any regard to the impact on the environment and the area in which the
buildings will sit. In some cases, it leads to outright opposition and
hostility to development; communities do not want to have buildings or
developments that they regard as tawdry, poor quality and badly
designed imposed on
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is an absolute common interest across the Committee in trying to
promote good-quality design, but I am not so naive as to believe that
good design is something on which there is automatic agreement. There
is always a degree of subjectivity. If I might go on a slight
historical journey, we now regard many Victorian buildings as being
absolutely magnificent—some of the finest buildings in our
capital city. St Pancras station is one example, yet it was nearly
demolished, because there was a period when views were hostile to the
Gothic revival, and there was a willingness to demolish such buildings.
I do not pretend that the amendment is an absolute panacea and that
there will always be consensus. I do contend, however, that buildings
of quality enhance our environment, and it is in our interests to
ensure that we try to promote good-quality
design.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
previous Government were concerned with that issue, and did a lot to
promote good-quality design. We commissioned a report from Lord Rogers,
entitled “Towards a Strong Urban Renaissance”, which
highlighted many of the practices that are now taken for granted and
which should help to promote high-quality design in new developments.
We also established CABE. It is a mistake on the part of the current
Government greatly to reduce CABE’s funding and to force it into
a merger with the Design Council. That merger may well have some
beneficial consequences, but forced mergers with organisations facing
financial difficulties are not easy. In the case of CABE, one of the
risks is the potential loss of design review, which was one of the
methods that it adopted to try to promote good-quality design. I will
come in a moment to the point that the hon. Member for Crawley made
about the role of local design review, as opposed to a central
organisation, but I will say, in tribute to CABE, that it helped to
promote the concept of taking the design review process much more
seriously and encouraging local authorities to adopt it as part of the
process of considering planning
applications.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, good design is more than just development control, as the
Minister highlighted earlier, and the design process should feed into
the whole development procedure from the outset. Design is about more
than the quality of individual buildings. It is often about the
landscape, the environment, the relationship between buildings and how
the whole urban fabric works. We should not limit our attention to the
quality of individual design. The design review process is able to make
a positive contribution, both helping to improve the quality of
individual buildings and leading to a greater understanding of the
importance of good design in fashioning the future of our built
environment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Design
review is an established method of providing informed and critical
advice to schemes working towards securing planning approval. It
consists of a panel of multidisciplinary professionals, providing
constructive 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 717<a class="bkMark" name="Column717">&#160;</a>
                           </div>appraisal of a proposed scheme or development. It is felt by the Royal
Institute of British Architects to be most successful when carried out
at the early, conceptual stage of design, preferably at the
pre-planning stage. Panels operate across England at national, regional
and local level, and they help councillors, planners, clients and
designers to improve design quality and better meet the needs of their
communities and customers. It is a tried and tested method of promoting
good design, and a cost-effective and efficient way to improve quality.
At its best, design review considers more than the single building as
an object—it considers how the building works with the existing
and future fabrics surrounding it. That is important for communities,
as it takes into account how a development will contribute to the
functionality of an area, and not simply the appearance of the
area.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Design review
can be a powerful tool for improving new developments, and the
amendment is designed to support that process and give design review
greater weight in the planning system. If that were achieved,
developers would have more confidence that applications would not be
arbitrarily turned down on design grounds, and there would be an
opportunity to consider, together with professionals who had an
understanding of the issue, how a design might be altered to meet any
objections. In every way, that seems to be a positive contribution to
improving the design process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Crawley referred to local panels. If he looks at my
amendment, he will see that that is precisely what it proposes. It does
not propose an overarching national quango, but that advice given by a
local design panel be taken into account as part of the pre-application
process. It goes on to define a local design review panel
as<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I
hope the hon. Gentleman will recognise that my amendment is absolutely
in keeping with his objective of localising the focus on design, and
that the Government will recognise that it would have that
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would reinforce a cross-party wish to improve the quality of design,
and I hope that it will be accepted. I do not expect that its precise
words will be, and in this case I have to argue, because there are
words, and there is not simply a vacuum. I hope that the Minister will
take on board the thinking behind the amendment and will consider
incorporating such a provision in the Bill in this House. I know from
past history that in another place the issue of design is taken
seriously, and I have no doubt that the matter will be returned to
there, if we do not do our job properly in this

contributions made by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
and the hon. Members for Birmingham, Erdington and for Scunthorpe, but
I shall disappoint all three of them by not accepting the amendments.
That is not because the intention behind them is not shared, but
because such a method of delivering that aspiration would not be likely
to succeed and, for reasons I shall come on to, might make things
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000085">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Design
and contribution to the economy are at the heart of what we are aiming
at. On design, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich might
know that I have invited discussions with RIBA to see how we can
advantage good design in the planning process. After the many hours
that we have spent scrutinising the Bill, if there is one outcome that
we would all want to see, it is that the built environment is better
than it otherwise would be, and that it is beautiful and functional for
people to live
in.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">While
I think we share the same ambitions, however, I do not agree with the
method outlined by Opposition Members. On amendment 152, we share the
admiration for the Association of Convenience Stores. It rightly wants
us to make a commitment to recognise the important role that stores
play in our communities. However, the proposal to require, as
part of this pre-application scrutiny, developers to undertake an
independent examination of the proposed development, to be presented to
the local planning authority and to as many persons as specified,
introduces a new stage into the planning process.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The intention
behind the clause is to get applicants to consult directly with the
affected communities. By interposing a new independent examination, the
amendment would do something very different. It is not clear who would
carry out the independent examination or at what stage it would appear.
At a time when all Committee members—certainly Front
Benchers—are calling attention to the delays in the current
planning system that act as a deterrent to investors and to economic
activity, the introduction of a requirement for an independent
examination and report would have the opposite of the desired effect.
It would make proper economic regeneration less likely, rather than
more likely. I am happy to restate a commitment I have made before: the
importance of town centres will continue to be reflected in planning
policy. Amendment 152 would entrench a different stage in the planning
process for matters of economic activity, and that would be the wrong
approach for the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000088">&#160;</a>

outcome of the processes that local authorities go through. However,
the previous Government did not introduce such a requirement in all
their different planning Bills—I dare say they did so
advisedly—and my concern is that the one way to turn something
that can be appreciated and make a positive addition to scrutiny into
something that is resented and imposed on people is to make it
mandatory and a burden that people reluctantly have to deal with. To
succeed, the initiative has to be something that authorities such as
the one to which my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley referred take up
willingly and voluntarily. It has to enjoy the volition and good will
of the community. I would like to see more of that. Imposing the

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman rightly makes the
point that he wants this to be voluntary rather than obligatory. I put
it to him that this is a different context. It was voluntary under the
previous Government, because CABE was in place as a large and powerful
body that was feared and listened to by developers. If developers felt
that their scheme was likely to attract a negative CABE report, they
were usually willing to explore alternatives. Given the scaling down of
CABE’s capacity under the present Government, there will not be
such influence. In such circumstances, there needs to be an additional
impetus if we are to avoid developers simply saying, “We can
avoid that. We can ignore that. We can get away with the scheme we are
putting forward and not push up design
quality.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000090">&#160;</a>

advocates would not mitigate what he regards as the potential for
reduced adherence to good practice in design. I want to advantage good
design. As members of the Committee know, the consultation to invite
suggestions as to what should be in the new national planning policy
framework closed just yesterday. That framework seems to be a place in
which good design ought to be advantaged, and applicants ought to know
that if they submit a high-quality design, they are more likely to
obtain planning permission than if they do not. I understand that
representations and suggestions were made in the consultation as to how
that might be achieved. This is unfinished business, but this is not
the right place in the Bill to deal with it—this whole aspect is
about developers consulting the local community. In any case, making
something mandatory and therefore likely to be resented is the wrong
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000091">&#160;</a>

states:<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the purpose of the clause. As the Government are concerned
about delays in the enforcement of planning control, they wish to
ensure that those who seek retrospective planning permission for
unauthorised development do not have the opportunity to delay
enforcement by running concurrent—or indeed
consecutive—planning and enforcement notice appeals. That is a
worthy aim, as I am sure that Members on both sides of the Committee
will agree, especially those who have seen how developers use the
system to frustrate the local planning committee and avoid enforcement
action.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
will insert proposed new section 70C into the Town and Country Planning
Act 1990, which will give local planning authorities the power to
decline to determine planning applications if the giving of planning
permission involves granting planning permission in respect of the
whole or any part of the matter specified in the enforcement notice
that constituted a breach of planning control. The clause also amends
section 174 of the 1990 Act by inserting proposed new
subsections (2A) and (2B), as well as amending section 177
to remove the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 721<a class="bkMark" name="Column721">&#160;</a>
                           </div>deemed application provisions unless an applicant specifies that he
requires planning permission for the development set out in the
enforcement notice. I think that the clause gives rise to the danger of
unintended consequences, so I beg the Committee’s indulgence as
I explain
why.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I understand it, if the provisions become law, the local planning
authority would be able to use the powers under proposed new subsection
(2A) of section 174 of the 1990 Act to issue an enforcement notice
within a certain period—usually about six weeks, although it can
be up to six months—after receiving a planning application for
retrospective permission, and then use the power of proposed new
section 70C to refuse to determine the application. The applicant would
not be able to appeal against the enforcement notice on ground (a),
given the strict wording of the provisions, and would be restricted to
making an appeal on ground (g) or perhaps on grounds (b) to (f), but
would not be able to challenge the planning merits of the proposed
development. That is the crux of the matter, because it would result in
there being no determination of the planning merits under section 78 or
proposed new subsection (2A) of section 174. I am curious as to whether
that is what the Department and Ministers intend. I realise that this
is a highly technical matter and that Ministers might wish for urgent
inspiration or want to take advice and answer the point
later.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We all know
that retrospective planning applications are a common feature of
development control. For instance, house owners may erect a fence
adjacent to a road or build a structure on their property without
realising that planning permission is required. At present, local
authorities know that if they serve an enforcement notice, it
automatically triggers a deemed planning application for that
development, so they may invite home owners to submit applications for
retrospective planning permission rather than issue enforcement
notices. They often deal with the matter by imposing conditions or
alterations rather than having the matter go straight to
appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a
proven and established method of development control. Crucially, it
allows the planning merits of the development in question to be
considered and dealt with in an efficient, fair and cost-effective way,
without exposing the householder to appeals and possible prosecution.
That saves local planning authorities huge sums in costs that they
would otherwise incur by having to take cases to appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am more than
happy to be proved wrong, but I understand that the effect of the
clause would be that if a home owner realised his error and put in a
planning application, the local planning authority would have the
power—merely by issuing an enforcement notice—to prevent
the planning merits of the development being determined. As a
consequence, the householder would be required to remove the fence or
structure without any determination whatsoever of whether that
structure or fence was in keeping with the planning merits that the
local authority was seeking to uphold. Indeed, although this is
probably a worst case scenario, the householder could be subject to
criminal prosecution for breach of the enforcement notice—again,
without ever had had the planning merits of what he had done being
properly considered.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under section
189B of the 1990 Act, local planning authorities have the power to seek
injunctions to restrain a breach of planning control, or a perceived
breach, instead of issuing an enforcement notice. Under the Bill,
members of the public could be subjected to High Court injunctions
without any right to a determination of the planning merits of what
they wish to achieve. In most cases, the best way to defend claims
under section 189B would be for the householder to show that he had
sought retrospective planning permission and that the planning
application had a realistic chance of success. Given the proposals in
the Bill, however, such a course would not be open to a householder,
save perhaps with the agreement of the local planning authority that it
would not exercise its new
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Bill is passed in its current form, to defend a claim for an
injunction, the householder will have to persuade the court that the
local planning authority should serve an enforcement notice before
seeking an injunction, thus giving them the opportunity to appeal and
to have their case determined on its planning merits. However, there
would be absolutely no guarantee that that argument would be
successful. In the event that the court was persuaded by such an
argument, it would lead to yet further delay and expense, all of which,
I am sure, is contrary to what the Government wish to achieve under the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I humbly
suggest that the provisions should be altered to ensure that the power
cannot be exercised when the result would be that no planning
determination would be made either under section 78 or under section
174 of the 1990 Act in respect of the matters specified in the
enforcement notice. That would be in line with the Government’s
aim that an applicant should not have the opportunity to delay
enforcement by running concurrent or consecutive planning and
enforcement notice appeals. However, it would safeguard the right that
the planning merits in regard to a breach of planning control would be
determined before a householder could be exposed to possible criminal
prosecutions and further
injunctions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
unintended consequence of the clause will be to stop the planning
merits being re-argued on an enforcement notice when things had
changed. As the clause is drafted, the decision of a local planning
authority to decline to determine an application under proposed new
section 70C could be taken to judicial review if it failed to take
account of the fact that circumstances had materially
changed—planning is often a movable feast. However, if a
planning appeal had been determined and dismissed and the local
planning authority chose to issue an enforcement notice, there would be
no option to have the planning merits considered, even if there had
been a material change in circumstances. There could be no judicial
review of the inability to seek permission under ground (a) in an
appeal against an enforcement notice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That issue
could arise if a new policy—a development plan or a national
policy—came into force, or if a material consideration had
changed substantially, such as if a family bought a property that was
the subject of a recent refusal of planning permission but significant
personal circumstances, such a sick child with special needs, might
require the planning merits to be looked at again under an application
for adaptive measures. Another example would be if planning permission
had been refused on technical grounds that were capable of resolution, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 723<a class="bkMark" name="Column723">&#160;</a>
                           </div>such as the lack of a flood risk assessment, an environmental survey or
an appropriate section 106 agreement. The clause would prevent such
matters from being reconsidered once an enforcement notice was issued,
but I do not think that that is what the Government are trying to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
practice, I suspect that when faced with such an issue, a planning
inspector would lengthen the compliance period to more than two years
to ensure that the appropriate planning merits could be heard at a
later stage. Unfortunately, that is a Kafkaesque approach, but it would
be an effect of the changes. If the clause is passed without looking at
this issue again, there is a real risk that we will take away important
rights and safeguards that have been inherent in our planning system.
Furthermore, it likely to give rise to confusion, yet more contentious
litigation and the possibility of a challenge to its compatibility with
the European convention on human
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
combined effect of the proposed changes to section 177 will be to take
away the deemed application protection and to require the applicant to
specify that he wishes to have planning merits for the development
determined when he appeals or he loses his right. The safeguard of the
Planning Inspectorate reminding the applicant of that right when he is
asked to pay a fee will go. All that is unlikely to cause a problem to
the professionally represented client, but it could cause a severe
problem to a householder trying to represent themselves in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000114">&#160;</a>

exactly what those sections do. In essence, they give local authorities
the power to intervene and serve notice upon owners of ill-maintained,
neglected or badly damaged buildings that are causing a detriment to
the amenity of surrounding buildings and properties. It is extremely

in itself can illicit some action by an owner to tidy up a building,

often as my hon. Friend describes. It is also a matter of some regret
that public bodies are often the worst offenders. Land

of the most badly maintained civil engineering infrastructure, which
becomes a blight on the urban landscape through which the railway

through my constituency, but along it there is a range of very badly
maintained pieces of civil engineering. Although I welcome many of the

215, which was the subject of a recent Adjournment debate that I
secured on behalf of my constituents to which the Under-Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst responded. A major property owner, Criterion Capital,
owns a large number of properties around central London, including the
Trocadero at Piccadilly circus. Unfortunately for me and my
constituents, it also owns the Brown and Root tower which stands
outside Colliers Wood tube station. Anyone who lives in south London
will know that tower. On various TV programmes, it has been voted the
most hated building in London and the third most hated building in the
country. It is a big black tower in the middle of a south London
suburb. It has been empty for several years. Its safety condition is
quite appalling and the application of a section 215 notice has made it
worse, as green netting has been hung up on two sides of the building
to prevent falling masonry. Although it now might be slightly safer for
people passing, it looks considerably
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
owner of that property is particularly litigious and well connected,
and it stands against residents who rail against it and a local
authority that, with the best will in the world, is terrified of the
litigious nature of the company. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Gateshead suggested, we have got short-term improvements by issuing
section 215 notices. We have managed to have boarding put up around the
half-demolished, multi-storey car park at the rear of the building,
preventing people from getting access to the masonry around the place,
which could be used as missiles in all sorts of fights. We have also
managed to get the grass cut at the front. Ultimately, there is no
sanction for the council or local residents to force that landlord to
be a good neighbour. It does that in my constituency, in Brixton, in
Dulwich and in Streatham—it is a blight to south-west London.
Somehow, somebody should have the power to do something about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I hope to
reassure my hon. Friend first and then I will come to the other points.
The proposal is not intended to restrict the rights of those who are
genuinely seeking retrospective permission. We accept that applications
for retrospective planning permission are a legitimate part of the
planning system. Sometimes, they are necessary, because we are all
aware of a person who in good faith genuinely made an error and carried
out a development without realising that permission was needed. The
obvious example is the person who extends a house and goes beyond
permitted development rights. They should have had planning permission,
and they apply for retrospective permission to regularise the
situation. I do not think anyone has a problem with that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay rightly divines, the
objective in the clause is to tighten up the rules where an abuse takes
place—precisely the point that he referred to—with either
the tandem or consecutive use of retrospective applications and appeals
against enforcement notices. The provision is intended to apply to all
classes of development. We have all seen examples; I have seen one in
my constituency, where a development was built not in accordance with
the plans and caused significant detriment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The sort of
people who do that are ruthless and determined, and money is involved.
The local authority is often frustrated because that method is used to
spin out the length of time. Sometimes, it can be a deterrent to local
authorities to taking enforcement action in the interests of the
broader community. That is important, but I recognise that safeguards
for applicants are needed, because by its nature any planning regime
involves an interference with property rights. It is right for
people to have the ability to seek permission under those
circumstances. That is why we seek to limit more effectively, with the
proposed new section in the 1990 Act, the use of retrospective
permission, so that it is genuinely focused on the honest
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State used the phrase that the intention should be to protect the
gormless but deter the greedy. I might put it a little more kindly and
say to protect the innocent or the not terribly well informed, and to
deter the unscrupulous. That is a cockney version, as opposed to the
Secretary of State’s Yorkshire version. Against that background,
perhaps I can reassure my hon. Friend that proposed new section 70C
would only apply if a retrospective planning application were served
after the enforcement notice. It would prevent that tandem
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
rightly refers to the situation of someone being honest about an error,
getting in touch with the planning authority and the case being
resolved amicably by imposing conditions, or something of that kind. It
is inconceivable that enforcement action would be taken in such
circumstances. That would only happen if, having been enforced against,
the developer came along and sought to spin out the process by
submitting a retrospective application that was intended to bite. I am
grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that matter carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
non-determination, the clause does not contain a requirement for the
local planning authority to decline to determine; it will have a
discretion to do so. In turn, such a discretion must be exercised
rationally and in

safeguard if there were a wilful and perverse refusal to determine by

reflect on them, and I am happy to discuss the issues further with the
hon. Gentleman to see whether there is an appropriate way forward. The
Government’s instinct has been that, properly used, the powers
should be adequate, but I take on board the points that they have made,
and I understand the hon. Lady’s experience of her local
authority. If there is a sensible formulation to improve the matter, we

                           </strong> We welcome many of the changes on enforcement.
However, a number of concerns about the proposed time-limited immunity
for planning enforcement have been expressed to us by a range of
organisations. Historically—let alone what might happen in
future as a consequence of the 28% cuts to local authority budgets over
the next four years—enforcement has tended to be underfunded in
local authorities. Detecting breaches can therefore take
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause’s time-limited immunity provision could be regarded as
legitimising actions as long as they remain undetected for a certain
period of time. We would therefore welcome clarification from the
Government. Does the time-limited immunity for enforcement regarding
advertisements in proposed new subsection (7) not weaken current
controls?<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000135">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
raising the point. The clause seeks to strengthen and rationalise our
position, in particular against an abuse that, although not common, is
serious when it occurs—the deliberate concealment of breaches of
planning law. We have heard about two well-publicised examples: the
case of the person who received permission for an agricultural barn but
equipped it as a house inside, and the issue of straw bales. Here we
seek to deal with time limits and
penalties.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
enforcement offences, such as failing to comply with an enforcement
notice or a stop notice, already carry maximum penalties in the
courts—£20,000 in a magistrates court or an unlimited
fine on indictment, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington will
know. Some offences that are only triable summarily carry lesser
penalties. The Government’s intention in the clause is to ensure
that failing to comply with a breach of a condition notice attracts
what we think is a requisite and appropriate level of penalty, hence
the proposal to raise it from a level 3 fine to a level 4
fine.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman’s second point relates to how we are seeking to make
it easier for local planning authorities to bring prosecutions.
Sometimes there is difficulty in establishing with clarity when an
offence was committed. That is the reason why we are adopting the time
limit of six months. That is the normal time limit for bringing
prosecutions in a magistrates court, so there is no departure from the
normal procedures that apply to a traffic offence or any other
summary-only procedure in a magistrates court; it is simply an
alignment. We are seeking to make the process easier, because the exact
date upon which an offence was committed may not be apparent for some
time. Many such offences are termed immediate offences, and we want to
avoid a situation where someone may escape prosecution for damaging
behaviour by that technicality. That is the idea behind the provision,
and I think it will assist the hon.

of the representation of the shires saying, “Not in our back

projects are of vital importance to the nation as a whole. Typically,
major infrastructure projects are highly technical. Crucially, they
need a long-term vision and, as I have described it, one that is in the
best long-term interests of the general public and the

these issues. I completely agree that the provision of a fast-track,
dependable process for consenting national infrastructure is of prime
importance. Our reforms to the Infrastructure Planning Commission are
designed to improve it rather than to introduce delays. We will
increase its dependability and, if we can, increase the speed of
decision making, and I can certainly, hand on heart, give the hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
essential problem with the arrangements the Labour party introduced
late in its term of office is that they lack democratic
accountability—all accountability—and that view is widely
shared across the House. The Chairman of the Communities and Local
Government Committee was one of the principal voices warning against
the lack of legitimacy, and the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)
has made some strong interventions on the issue. It is not acceptable
for major decisions affecting our communities and our country to be
taken by a person or group of people with no accountability to
Parliament, Ministers or the people in this country. That cannot be
right. A degree of ultimate accountability for important decisions is
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000162">&#160;</a>

Member for Birmingham, Erdington has a history in this field from his
work in the nuclear industry on the trade union side. For 18 months
before the election, I was the shadow Energy Secretary and I spent a
lot of time with the energy companies that formed the first wave of
prime users of the provisions. We took great care to ensure that the
changes that we made not only would not introduce a scintilla of doubt
about the continuity of the arrangements, but would remove one of the
most significant risks to the necessary projects covered by the regime,
including nuclear power stations—the threat of judicial review,
a significant risk due to the lack of democratic accountability in the
arrangements. National planning statements that are merely presented to
the House rather than being ratified by Parliament, and appointed
decision makers who have no reference to any democratic mandate, create
a significant risk that decisions ostensibly taken by the IPC will be
dragged through the courts for many years.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
we made some progress on satisfying people that it would be beneficial
to root such important decisions in clear democratic accountability,
which gives them greater standing before the courts than decisions
taken, perhaps inappropriately, by administrative bodies. That is
absolutely the direction of our reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000164">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I could not help thinking of an analogy. The same
argument could be used regarding the Monetary Policy Committee.
Following the logic of everything that the Minister just said about the
planning context, we could look at the economic management of the
country and say, “There’s no accountability to
Parliament. The Monetary Policy Committee is off doing its own thing;
it’s completely independent.” However, I think we all
accept that there is a rationale for having the committee in that form.
It is analogous. We must think about how to manage such things, because
there is a real danger. Once infrastructure planning becomes tainted by
the political process, the planning of important projects that are
absolutely in the national interest could
stagnate.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000165">&#160;</a>

such politicisation. That issue was clearly flagged in both
parties’ manifestos when we were in opposition, due to great
concern about the lack of democratic accountability in the
arrangements. If hon. Members look at our reforms and how we have
translated them into practice, they will see that the best elements of
the system that was introduced—I agree with the previous
Government that it was necessary to introduce a new
regime—maintain and build on that fast-track process, including
by creating a dedicated unit to  scrutinise the decisions taken
there, subject to the same
timetables.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000166">&#160;</a>

two principal reforms are, first, that the national planning statement
will be ratified by Parliament to give it the standing that we think it
requires; and, secondly, that the ultimate decision will be taken
within the same time frame or sooner by the relevant Secretary of
State, rather than by someone unelected. We are absolutely clear about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000167">&#160;</a>

business commentators on the matter, if hon. Members talk to the
leading firms in the energy sector, which are the most likely to make
use of the provisions the most quickly, they will find, as I have said
in conversations with them, that we have been careful to ensure that
there is no possibility of delay in such crucial projects. The
arrangements that we have put in place will introduce a change that I
hope will be permanent; I hope that we will have settled on the right
model for our major infrastructure projects. There will be a dedicated
unit and projects will operate to strict time frames. As now, it will
be necessary to put in the information in advance, so that proposals
can be considered in the round, and the Secretary of State will take a
decision subject to the existing timetables or faster. If we can
squeeze some time out, consistent with due process, we would like the
process to be even quicker, but at the very least it will be subject to
the same timetable as the one that currently prevails.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000168">&#160;</a>

will be considering their case. There will be enough continuity with
the existing arrangements to ensure that no skills are lost. The new
system will not only correct a matter of principle—the
democratic flaw—but in so doing it will give greater certainty
in the courts to the decisions that will result from this important set

                           </strong> The history of planning as it relates to major
infrastructure projects is, sadly, one where time and again
politicisation of the wrong kind has been the enemy of sensible,
long-term decision making. I remember more than 20 years ago the
chairman of Electricité de France, when he was here in England,
talking about the process in France. Representatives of the British
nuclear industry asked him, “Why is it that in your country from
inception to coming on stream typically takes five to seven years, when
in our country it typically takes between 12 and 14 years? Do you not
have problems with your planning process?” The typically
Napoleonic response, referring to “les intérêts de
l’état”, was, “If you drain the marsh, do
you consult the frogs?” I am not sure that we would quite go
down that path in Britain, because public acceptability is important in
the planning process generally and in infrastructure planning in
particular.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000170">&#160;</a>

timetables. If the Minister’s assurance to the House means that
under the proposed arrangements there will be no delays, or at the very
least the same time frame will be observed, that is a welcome
statement.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000172">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I feel that three things need to be said in
response to the Minister’s remarks. It is simply not true that
the previous system lacked democratic accountability. The system
provided for that democratic accountability at the earlier stage, when
the national policy statements were prepared. We can have an argument
about whether the statements should be approved by Parliament or simply
presented to Parliament, but there was a clear understanding that at
that point, when the policy was being framed, the accountable body
should be the Minister and Parliament should certainly have to approve
that document.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There was an
element of democratic accountability. The problem with the
Government’s configuration is that it puts that at the end of
the process and, as the Minister knows only too well, that is an
inevitable recipe for delay. How will a Secretary of State take through
an unpopular recommendation—say, to build a new
airport—when there is a huge body of his own supporters saying,
“No, no, no! Don’t do it.”?<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We heard what
the CBI had to say in the evidence session. It was extremely nervous
that this was going to be a recipe for delay. I asked the CBI’s
witness whether she knew of any instance in which the Secretary of
State had taken a decision within three months, and she did not know of
any at all. I asked that question rather carefully, having prepared the
ground. I am well aware that there has been no instance in which a
Secretary of State has taken a decision within that time
frame.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s bland assurance that decisions will be just as quick
as under the IPC is worthless. Let me tell him why—it will be
painful for him to hear. Judicial review. He accused me of chutzpah in
an earlier sitting. With his record of already having had one of his
decisions overturned on judicial review, it is probably not a very good
example to take; none the less, let me put it to him. If there is the
slightest element of doubt on the part of his officials that the
Secretary of State could be subject to judicial review for overturning
a decision coming from the body that replaces the IPC, those officials
will insist on that decision being checked, checked again and
lawyer-proofed to ensure that that does not happen. That takes time.
The IPC, or its replacement body, will have already gone through that
same process: it will have looked at the issue, consulted the lawyers
and tried to ensure that its decision was not subject to judicial
review, and the whole thing will happen again. When there are a number
of baying Members of Parliament who do not like the policy and who are
pressing the Minister in a series of private meetings and saying,

are introducing a very risky policy. A sensible way forward was to
accept the previous framework, require the national policy statement to
be approved by Parliament as the democratic accountability at the start
of the process, and then respect the procedure for the IPC to determine
the outcome in line with that democratically agreed policy. That would
have given us a fast-track procedure, certainty about infrastructure
provision and taken out the really serious risk, which I am afraid to
say that the Minister has built into the system, of further delay and
the risk of judicial
review.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000177">&#160;</a>

Birmingham, Erdington has raised the matter, I shall have to say that
we are very clear about the contrast between different systems. We
believe that we should consult the frogs. That is fundamental to the
way in which we approach things. People should have a chance to have
their say, and we do this deliberately.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To reply to
the arguments made by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich,
the key requirement is that there are statutory time lines. This is not
something that can sit on the desk of the Secretary of State for as
long as he wants to have it there. We are subjecting Ministers to the
same time frame that governs appointees to the IPC. We are doing that
deliberately to provide that certainty, and we are looking into the
possibility of advancing that. That is the right approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000179">&#160;</a>

listened very carefully to them through our consultation papers and how

everyone in this Committee sees is necessary for our country in the

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
238 seeks to clarify whether draft development consent orders submitted
to the IPC/MIPU can be amended as part of the decision on the
application. The wording of section 114 of the Planning Act 2008 is
causing some anxiety among promoters of infrastructure projects as to
whether consent orders can be amended. We would welcome the
Government’s clarification. Clearly it would be preferable that
this small technical change could be made during the process, which
would not change the substantive nature of the application.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 241
seeks to clarify whether requirements—in other words,
conditions—attached to development consent orders can be
discharged by local authorities and whether they can be appealed in the
same way as conditions attached to planning permissions. That is not
clear in section 120 of the Planning Act 2008. It would seem sensible
and more efficient to allow a local authority to discharge the
requirements. Otherwise, the MIPU could be burdened with unnecessary
work that could be better carried out by local authorities. An example
of such a requirement might be the landscaping around the site of a new
power station, which would be better overseen by a local authority.
Amendments 242 and 243 seek to provide clarity about the deadlines for
the MIPU and the Secretary of State. These are issues that we referred
to earlier, when we discussed the recommendation that the MIPU have a
three-month deadline, followed by a three-month deadline for the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 737<a class="bkMark" name="Column737">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Secretary of State. However, the deadlines are calculated by reference
to the deadline for the previous stage rather than when the stage is
actually completed, so no time is saved if a stage is completed early.
The amendments would start time running from the actual completion of
the previous stage in each case. In light of what has been said
earlier, I hope that the Government will welcome these
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
244 and 245 seek to increase the incentives to ensure that decision
making is carried out on time. The Bill removes the requirement for the
Secretary of State to notify all interested parties if the three-month
deadline for decision making is to be extended. These amendments would
reinstate that requirement, to increase the incentives for decision
making to be carried out on
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then
there is new clause 16. At present, the regime is one-size-fits-all. In
other words every project, no matter how large or small, must go
through the full process. The new clause is based on the Transport and
Works Act 1992 and it would allow the Secretary of State to waive
procedural requirements in some cases. Like the other amendments in
this group, the new clause will contribute towards fast-tracking of
decisions, so that we can deliver the infrastructure that the country
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
246 would relax the acceptance criteria for applications for
examination. Some people consider that the application for examination
is unduly strict and that it runs the risk of applications being
rejected on purely technical grounds when there is no prejudice to any
party. Amendment 246 would relax the strict requirements somewhat. The
original Planning Act 2008 regime did not allow offences to be included
in development consent orders, as concerns had been expressed that
decisions were being made by an unelected body. The Bill reintroduces
offence-making powers now that the Secretary of State will be making
decisions, but only for a fixed list of offences. In the future, it is
likely that relevant new offences will be created, or it might become
desirable for further existing offences to be included in development
consent orders.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 247
would allow the current fixed list to be amended by order. That might
include trespassing on to the line in railway schemes, for example. I
hope that the Government will consider the amendments, which seek to
ensure that major infrastructure decisions are delivered as quickly and
efficiently as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000211">&#160;</a>

conclusion, the amendments are technical, and raise some important
issues of concern, which have been brought to our attention by
developers and investors. They make legitimate points, which should
rightly be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000212">&#160;</a>

moved the amendment. He has clearly enjoyed some technical advice from
experts in the field, and of course we will consider the amendments. We
are sympathetic to the direction of some of them. They are technical
amendments, which will require us to reflect further on whether they
can achieve the intended
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000213">&#160;</a>

note with a certain irony that, with amendment 247, the hon. Gentleman
is, in effect, urging a Henry VIII power on us. Earlier in the debate,
he warned us that there were too many of them. A degree of pragmatism
is entering the Opposition party.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will reflect
on all of the amendments now, but because they are technical, I
undertake to go away, and consider each of them for later stages of the
Bill. Amendment 246 would amend section 55 of the Planning Act 2008 by
specifying that developers and applicants had to comply only
substantially with the requirements contained in the Act. The proposal
is intended to be a helpful relaxation or more generous interpretation
of provisions, but it comes with the risk that
“substantial” might itself become a contested word and
could be subject to legal wrangling, having the opposite effect to the
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, the requirement, which some people regard as rather
box-ticking, is to supply all the pieces of evidence, to show complete
accordance with the requirements. That is at least clear—if
everything is supplied, we have done what we need to do. Introducing
the test of substantially complying would open the way to people who do
not like the way things are going to say that something was not in
compliance. That is why we will take advice, including from the current
IPC and the expert bodies, to ensure that the direction is helpful and
would not have unintended
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
242 and 243 would have the effect, as the hon. Gentleman said, that the
deadlines would be made by reference to the dates on which previous
stages were completed, rather than the deadlines set out in
legislation. Again, I completely understand and appreciate his point,
and have sympathy with the intent. However, as drafted, the amendments
risk having unwanted, adverse impacts. If the examination were
completed or the report received later than the deadline, the examining
authority would still have three months in which to make the decision.
We want to keep the pressure on, so that unacceptable further delay is
not introduced. Again, we will reflect on whether we can accommodate
the issue in a different way, while achieving the desired
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
244 and 245 would reinstate a requirement of the 2008 Act, which the
Bill will remove, for the notification of affected parties. However,
the removal of the requirement has a simple, modern reason. The
required method of notifying is a letter in the post, but a discretion
to allow notification by e-mail, for example, might be more appropriate
in the
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000218">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
238 would clarify the power of the Secretary of State to modify the
proposals contained in an application when making the order. Our
initial view is that the amendment is unnecessary. Orders made under
the Planning Act would be made by the Secretary of State, who has the
flexibility to make such changes, as necessary. Again, we will reflect
on the technical aspects of that, to double-check that there is nothing
that we have not
seen.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000219">&#160;</a>

247 is a Henry VIII provision that would allow the Secretary of State
by order to add, without restriction, to the list of offences covered.
I note the Labour party’s change of view. We do not see any
justification for the

are widely drawn, as the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst, says. We are being urged to follow a precedent that some
might see as “a constitutional outrage,” to recall a

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
241 would clarify the power of local planning authorities to discharge
requirements imposed by the Planning Act. We think that it is
unnecessary, but I am happy to restate for the record that we expect
the requirements to be discharged usually by local authorities; we see
no change in that. Section 120 of the Planning Act places no
restriction on who may discharge the requirements, but it would usually
be appropriate for that to be done by the local planning
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000221">&#160;</a>

clause 16 would insert a new section into the 2008 Act, with the aim of
allowing compliance with the requirements of the Act to be waived in
certain circumstances. Again, we are not convinced that the new clause
is necessary, but we will reflect and consult with the members of the
current IPC and expert bodies on whether there is a need for greater
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000222">&#160;</a>

have sympathy with the intent behind the amendments, and some technical
changes might be appropriate. We will have the opportunity on Report or
more likely, given the technical content of the amendments, in the
House of Lords, to accept any changes that are in keeping with the
spirit in which they were tabled by the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Erdington, to speed up and to increase the certainty of the speed of
those processes. With that in mind, I hope that he will withdraw the

                           </strong> The current Planning Act regime imposes
responsibilities on local authorities that are neighbours—at
county or district level—of any local authorities where the
project is to be situated. Given that the neighbours can be of either
tier, that potentially involves a large number of local authorities,
which in some parts of the country could be up to 40. Many of those
local authorities might have no interest in the project, given its
distance from them. The Bill rectifies that somewhat by removing the
requirement to involve district level authorities that are neighbours
of a county level host authority. That reduces the number of
authorities involved, but it could still involve a large number, some
of which might be many miles away. Amendments 248 to 251 would reduce
the list to neighbours of a host district level or unitary authority
only. That is a technical but important amendment that those involved
in infrastructure projects believe would be appropriate. We support
that
view.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000240">&#160;</a>

                        </strong> I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman’s
intention to simplify the matters before the MIPU, but it is worth
reflecting on the fact that the purpose of the IPC process and the
succession arrangements that we have in mind is to front-load the
application and make sure that all the necessary consultation has been
done at the beginning of the process, so that anyone who ought to be
consulted has been, and their views can be taken into account right at
the beginning. The Bill provides for excluding the need to include
lower-tier authorities that are at some distance from the application.
However, given the range of the upper-tier authorities’
strategic responsibilities—we discussed the duty to co-operate
in relation to an earlier part of the Bill—it is safer to
require that they should be invited to contribute, even to an
application in a neighbouring authority, from the outset. If they are
scarcely affected, there will be little requirement on them to
contribute much substantive work, but it is right that they should be
included in the list of authorities to be covered by the front-loading
of the consultation. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman’s
intention of reducing and rationalising the bodies to be consulted,
there is a danger that larger than local aspects may be missed out if
upper-tier authorities are not consulted. For that reason, I cannot
support the

                           </strong> I am pleased to be serving under your
chairmanship this afternoon, Mr Amess. These are the first Opposition
amendments to the housing part of the Bill, about which we have
significant concerns. I suspect that there will be less consensus than
there has been thus far. That may be down to the fact that my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington is such a charming chap and
extraordinarily persuasive. The Minister is obviously extremely
amenable, but we may not find quite the same level of
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Social
housing is an integral part of the housing mix in this country. It
provides secure and affordable accommodation for low-income families,
for pensioners and for people who are unable to work or who cannot find
a job and are vulnerable. Historically, it has been a safety net
ensuring that the most disadvantaged in our community, as well as those
in housing need for a very broad range of reasons, retained the human
right to a roof over their head. Housing is a human right that was
upheld by the Supreme Court in a ruling on Manchester City Council
<em>v.</em> Pinnock, and more recently in the case of Hounslow LBC
<em>v.</em> Powell, in which the judges who heard the appeal talked about
“respecting a person’s
home”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
importantly, social housing—I would prefer not to label it in
that way—forms an essential part of many communities. They are
homes, sometimes occupied by successive generations of the same family,
which make up communities. Communities come in all shapes and sizes,
but even those that may be seen by the outside world as difficult areas
have a sense of strong community.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000250">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
there is a major regeneration under way in Swilly, or North Prospect,
in my constituency. The residents want a strong say in how their
community is shaped and they want to continue living there. A large
number of those residents have lived there all their
lives—through good times and bad, in employment and out of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The most
recent statistics from the Department for Communities and Local
Government show that 17% of households in England live in social rented
housing; for pensioner households, the figure rises to more than a
fifth. About a quarter of ethnic minority households live in social
housing. The median household income in 2007-08 in social housing was
just £10,900 a year. Those living in social housing are not in a
land of milk and honey, as is sometimes suggested. Many are vulnerable,
many are poor and any changes to the social housing system need to be
approached carefully and with sensitivity.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If only the
Government had taken such an approach. The Government did not approach
their desire for change by producing a draft Bill, or by fully
consulting prior to the publication of this Bill. They launched a
consultation on their proposals on how social housing was allocated,
managed and financed on 22 November, in the pre-Christmas
period—with the closing date just eight weeks later, on the
Bill’s Second Reading. The consultation ran in parallel with the
Bill at a time when most people would not be considering responding to
consultations. It was rushed, like so much of what we are being asked
to consider. This rushed, slap-dash approach to reforming something so
critical to people’s well-being is an affront to the normal
procedures that we would expect Ministers to adhere to in the pursuit
of good government.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We would
expect a consultation to last 12 weeks. That is the normal run of
things, but the Government set aside only eight weeks. They were
concerned more with sticking to their delayed legislative programme
than with ensuring the best possible response from the public,
stakeholders and tenants. As it is, the Government have embarked on the
most radical reforms to social housing in history, with the media
observing that the cumulative effect of the reforms is, as <em>Inside
Housing</em> put it,<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000254">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
the proposals in the Bill did not feature in manifestos; they were
either opposed or denied by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
The Minister repeatedly put his name to early-day motions in the
previous Parliament on matters which now fall within his portfolio. We
want to understand at which point he changed his mind on the importance
of security of tenure and affordability. Was it before or after he was
appointed to a position within a Government led by a Tory Prime
Minister?<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
seek to amend the Government’s proposals in order to increase
protections, defend the long-held rights of those in social housing and
those who expect to move into social housing, and provide safeguards

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 121 and
related clauses effectively establish two waiting lists. Will they
support tenants who wish to move and make space in the sector for those
who need a new home, as the Government clearly believe, or will they,
like a jigsaw puzzle with an extra piece, simply 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 744<a class="bkMark" name="Column744">&#160;</a>
                           </div>move the problem around the board? As one piece is replaced, another
pops up. Unfortunately, the pieces that keep popping up are the poorest
and most vulnerable in our society. The Minister must explain whether
this is really just smoke and mirrors.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I cannot
understand why, before drafting the Bill, the Government did not try to
understand waiting lists properly: who is on them, how many are on
them—owing to duplication, there is a lot of confusion about the
precise number—why they are on the list and what their
aspirations and expectations are. We know from research on the impact
of choice-based lettings that the number of people on lists rose by 79%
over four years in authorities operating the new system, while in other
areas the number rose by only 40%. Such inexplicable outcomes must be
considered when new allocations policy is being developed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To change
allocations policies without a proper review of how they operate is
extraordinary, but I am afraid that it is par for the course for this
Government. Some local authorities have done detailed work on their
lists and have, as a result, cut the numbers by ensuring that
applicants have good advice and are given pathways to alternatives. Can
the Minister explain why waiting list registrations vary so enormously
around the country? Why does Sheffield alone contribute 97,000 to the
total—more than the figure for the whole of Wales in 2009? If he
does not know, that will reinforce our case that the clause and this
area of the Bill have been produced without a full understanding of the
beast that they seek to
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
all support the idea of local authorities undertaking a detailed
assessment of their list and housing needs in their area—during
debate on the planning section of the Bill, the importance of
understanding housing need was discussed—and an awful lot of
work by the Chartered Institute of Housing and other organisations
supports that position. The last Labour Government favoured a housing
options approach, which enabled housing departments better to
understand applicants’ circumstances and
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hard-pressed
housing departments will find it difficult to do such work effectively
now, particularly given the introduction of affordable rents, flexible
tenancies and the need to know whether a tenant’s income has
increased, which will obviously be required as part of ongoing
assessment due to the cuts to local government. With that in mind, I
support the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 220
is designed to ensure that the rights of people already living in
social housing are protected. The Government have said time and again
that existing tenants’ rights will not be changed. We must
ensure that they are held to that promise, not least because it appears
less convincing when we read the small print. However, we believe that
in order properly to protect people living in social housing, the
Government must go further than protecting those whose names appear on
the tenancy agreement; as we all know from our constituency surgeries,
life is much more complicated than that. People and relationships do
not fit neatly into compartments. We need flexibility and an extension
of the criteria to ensure that the allocations policy meets a wider
range of
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the past, it was not necessary to ensure that all the relevant
people’s names were on a tenancy, because no loss of rights was
involved if, for example, cohabitation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 745<a class="bkMark" name="Column745">&#160;</a>
                           </div>came to an end. The Government’s decision to embark on a model
with two tiers of tenants—those with existing rights and those
without—changes everything. Under the Government’s plans,
for example, what protection will a woman have who lives with her
partner or husband in a social rented home where only his name appears
on the tenancy? None. If she is the victim of domestic violence or the
relationship simply breaks down, she will not have what she believes to
be her existing right to a secure tenancy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such a woman
could be offered one of the Government’s proposed flexible
tenancies. We think that that is wrong. She might be put either into
the private rented sector or into a new affordable tenancy, with all
the potential cost implications of that move for housing benefit. She
might well have left home in a hurry, with no source of income and a
lot of uncertainty about her future and any joint assets apart from the
home that she and her partner might have had.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 220
would give meaning to the Government’s promise on existing
tenants’ rights by extending that formal protection to an
allocation to three extra groups. First, the amendment would extend
protection to people living with their spouse, civil partner or someone
in that capacity. The amendment uses the phrase “subsisting
relationship” to cover all three areas, which is drawn from
immigration legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
amendment would extend protection to family members who live together
because one acts as the other’s carer and therefore deserves
protection from what the Government are doing. Their name might not
appear on the tenancy, but they would be living in social housing and
giving their time to act as a carer for a loved one. We should support
them and extend protection to them as well. The Minister may say that
discretion is being given to housing authorities to deal with such
cases, but we genuinely feel that the provision needs to be in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, there
are many instances where siblings cohabit in social housing and only
one of them is named on the tenancy. We want both siblings to be
equally protected from any changes to tenancy rights. Why is it fair
for one sibling to benefit from a social tenancy while the other may
well have to pay a new affordable rent if for some reason the
relationship falls apart and they fall out? These things do happen.
Amendment 221 is consequential and arises from amendment 220, so I
shall not spend time on that. These changes are fair and reflect the
realities of many social housing households. They give credibility to
the Government’s promise that the rights of existing social
tenants will not be abridged by the reforms.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 222
comes with the full support of the National Housing Federation. It is
designed to secure flexibility for local housing authorities, housing
associations and their tenants in boosting mobility. The amendment
would guarantee that social housing tenants would be able to seek a
transfer through their local authority allocation scheme—or,
indeed, outside it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The current
drafting of the Bill will prevent tenants with reasonable preference
from transferring outside the allocation scheme and from using the
allocation scheme. The Chartered Institute of Housing has also
expressed concern about the running of these dual lists

                           </div>and would prefer there to be some reform of the existing framework. It
would be helpful if the Minister explained the logic behind the clause.
I am not clear about the Government’s reasoning on the matter or
why they are pursuing such a course. It is clearly not a route that the
housing associations want to go down, and I am sure that they did make
representations to the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000269">&#160;</a>

say to the hon. Lady that social rented housing is a vital resource
that is definitely in short supply. It is trying to make the most
effective use of a very scarce commodity that has led the Government to
introduce the proposals in this section of the Bill. In 1997,
4.386 million homes were available for social rent in the
housing association and local authority sector; when the coalition
Government took over last year, 3.966 million such homes
were available in that sector. The number of socially rented homes
available had fallen in that 13-year period by
420,000.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000273">&#160;</a>

resource is in short supply and we need to make sure that it is used 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>properly. About 230,000 of the homes that we do have are officially
overcrowded and in breach of the overcrowding standard. More than
400,000 homes are under-occupied to the extent of more than one spare
bedroom.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000278">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked me when I changed my views. I did not change my views
at all. I want to bring to the attention of the Committee one of many
cases since I have served as an MP. During the past couple months, I
have seen a lady in my constituency who lives in a two-bedroom council
house with her partner and three teenage children of both sexes. It is
an increasing unsatisfactory situation, with three teenagers sharing a
bedroom in the two-bedroom house. They urgently need to find larger
accommodation, but they have little chance of achieving sufficient
priority to do so at the present moment. The hon. Lady might wonder
what that has to do with anything. Well, on the same estate are many
three-bedroom houses occupied by elderly widows whose families have
grown up and left the
area.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us take the argument a little further. When my constituent has the
opportunity for a new tenancy, it is right and sensible for the housing
authority to consider giving her a 10-year tenancy. In 10 years’
time, her youngest teenager will be in her 20s, and it will be the
right moment to re-appraise whether the larger house into which that
family had moved was still required by them. We are discussing an
enabling provision. Nothing is compelling housing authorities to change
their existing practice if they choose not to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000280">&#160;</a>

allocate a substantial proportion of their re-let properties to the new

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman asks me to make the
point that it is for local housing authorities to take a decision about
what policies they employ for the letting of tenancies in the future.
They can take account of advice or information that they receive from
anyone, including himself or the Homes and Communities Agency. I say to
Opposition Members that this is enabling legislation, and it permits
local authorities to do things that many of them wish to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000282">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
draw the right hon. Gentleman’s attention to the responses that
we have received, which show that two thirds of housing authorities
would look to use at least some of the flexibilities that we have given
them. They have also responded on particular aspects of those
flexibilities—on which parts they would prefer to have presented
as an open door, and on which parts they feel should still be
constrained by legislation. We have responded to that in our feedback
on the consultation, setting out what the Government intend to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000283">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 748<a class="bkMark" name="Column748">&#160;</a>
                           </div>rushed. I believe that by providing, with no compulsion, a power to
local and housing authorities to have flexible tenancies in future, and
by ensuring that every existing tenancy is protected—housing
authorities cannot vary them, even if they want to—we have set a
practical back-stop. When we debated that topic, I inadvertently became
a little overheated, but I say to the right hon. Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich that the literature that is being circulated implying that
the Government intend to take away council tenants’ tenancies is
completely wrong and
misleading.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000284">&#160;</a>

121 takes all social tenants seeking a transfer out of the statutory
allocations framework, unless they have a reasonable
preference—a priority for social housing. As a result, social
tenants will find it easier to move within the social sector, and local
authorities can better manage their stock and strike a balance between
the needs of existing tenants and those with priority on the waiting
list.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000285">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
220 would add to the list of people to whom the allocations legislation
will no longer apply. As far as I can see, the intended effect of the
amendment is to allow those people to move into another social property
without having to queue on the housing waiting list. That is not
sensible, and we do not believe that the drafting of the amendment
works, either. We are trying to give back to local authorities the
power to decide who should and should not qualify to go on the waiting
list, and many of the local authorities—including, incidentally,
the London borough of Greenwich—that responded to the
consultation welcomed the flexibility and said that they would use it.
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View, knows that, but if she has not
had an opportunity to study the detail of the consultation, I hope that
she will do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000286">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would restrict the flexibility, because it would allow
certain people to get into social housing without having to meet the
local authority’s qualification criteria. There does not seem to
be any justification for allowing some people to circumvent the rules
that determine who should access social housing simply because they
live with someone who qualifies. The amendment would also mean that
people living with a social housing tenant would be able to jump the
housing queue and gain an allocation, ahead of others who could be in
much greater housing need or might have been waiting for far
longer.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000287">&#160;</a>

what my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View, said about
live-in carers. The Minister is not paying enough attention to that. It
is not like the situation with teenagers. As people become more frail
and more vulnerable, they may often need to have a family member move
in with them. That is a special consideration. Such people often give
up a career and a salary—their own lives—to take that on,
and the words that the Minister has just used are not appropriate. A
carer makes a very big sacrifice, and it is appropriate for that to be
considered in some way in the allocation.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000289">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I go back to the point that I made at the
beginning: the provision will apply to new tenancy arrangements only.
If there is a new tenant under the new arrangements, and if a carer
proposes moving in with them and that carer wants to register their
interests, they can do so. Specifically, if that carer has come from
another council home, having surrendered one tenancy and having moved
in to help somebody else—I am sure the hon. Lady has many
examples of that; I do, too—it is entirely right that there
should be a lettings policy that recognises that. It will be in the
hands—in the ownership—of the housing authority to be
able to say, “Yes, you have surrendered a tenancy, you are doing
that caring duty or job, and when and if that caring duty and that
tenancy end, we will safeguard where you have come
from.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000290">&#160;</a>

Minister’s line of argument. The Minister and the Front-Bench
team should think about this. We do not want to give rise to a perverse
disincentive for looking after members of one’s own family.
Ultimately, if people are disinclined to look after their own family
members because of the implied threat to their livelihood, the cost to
the public purse could be an awful lot more, and it could create a much
unhappier family situation. The Minister and his team should think
about that a bit

                           </strong> Let me say a couple of things that may be
relevant here. First, the situation that the hon. Gentleman described
is, of course, already the case with registered social landlords. We
are talking about those who have what have traditionally been called
council house tenancies. We need to understand that there are already
different situations applying to different sets of tenancies, if we are
talking about carers moving in from outside, as opposed to spouses and
direct family members. We will return to that in a subsequent clause
that looks in more detail at the requirement on local authorities to
have a transparent housing allocation policy. I am happy to return to
the issue at that point, and to discuss it in more detail then. There
is a broader context about the terms, which we are saying housing
authorities have to be explicit about when a new tenancy policy is
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
reassure Opposition Members that no existing tenant will have their
tenancy interfered with in a way that would create the situation that
they have described. A tenant would be moving into a tenancy where the
situation was already known, so there are no surprises coming to
existing tenants as a result of that particular element. I hope that on
that basis the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View, will agree to
withdraw her amendment, but if she does not, I will encourage my hon.

                           </strong> May I take the Minister back to his opening
comments about his concern that there are fewer social housing
tenancies and social housing properties available than there were in
1997? Would that be in part due to the take-up of the right to buy? Not
everyone on the Labour Benches will agree with me on this, but I am
sure that a significant number of Government Members will: I think that
the right to buy was one of the most successful policies, allowing
people a foot on the ladder.

it came to work, ensuring that their kids got on, and getting on in
future. The reduction is in part due to the right to buy, which I
believe was a particularly successful policy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000294">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am not sure
whether the coalition is split on the issue, and whether the Liberals
are opposed to the move. My concern about a lot of the clauses on
housing is that they do not so much nudge people as head-butt them in
the opposite direction to working, looking after their family and
getting their kids to university. We will have opportunities to discuss
some of those clauses later
on.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000295">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Often,
it is people who buy their homes or stay for a long
time—sometimes when it is not necessarily in their financial
interests to do so—who are the anchor in our estates. Those
people are families that others look up to, saying, “Gosh, you
know, Mr and Mrs Smith down the road have put a new porch on. They are
going to work and their kids are doing well. I want to be like
them.” The downside of two-year tenancies is that we will move
those people out, and there will be no role models or anyone who is
getting on, taking a chance or giving an opportunity. I desperately
want those people to stay in their
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000296">&#160;</a>

Mitcham and Morden and my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich
and Woolwich, whose history of working in the housing sector before

of the reason why there was a good turnout—I am pleased that
there was, given the short consultation period—is that
Opposition Members did everything they could to encourage people such
as tenants groups, housing associations and local authorities to
participate. We highlighted the importance of contributing to the
consultation. Just imagine how many people might have contributed if
the consultation had run for 12 weeks instead of just eight.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000298">&#160;</a>

the Member for Mitcham and Morden talked about the right to buy, and
the fact that a significant proportion of those who left the system did
so as a result of the right to buy and, in part, our decision to

repairs programme that was left to us by the Conservative
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000299">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister raised an important issue about over and under-occupation. It
is something that we all struggle with. We all know people in our
constituencies who are under-occupying, and we also know that there are
people who are attached to their houses, having put 30 years or so of
commitment into them, repairing and improving them. They are not easy
to move. A number of local authorities have historically tried to move
people, including by offering incentives, and there are all sorts of
things that can be done under the current system. However, unless we
have good-quality housing stock to move them to, there is no reason why
a lot of them would go. They do not want to move to one-bedroom flats;
they want at least two bedrooms, because they know that in six months
or a year, they might have a caring need

the issue, but I do not think that the clause is the way to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000300">&#160;</a>

Chartered Institute of Housing and others are concerned that the
clauses will have unintended consequences because of the way that they
are set up, and will damage the good work that has gone into mixing
communities. Interestingly, the right to buy was part of that process;
as it was taken up, people with different targets and aspirations
lifted the area.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000301">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is an unfortunate downside to the right to
buy. When residents who bought their council houses sold them on to the
private rented sector, it led not to a mixture of tenures on council
estates, but to a mixture of one type of tenure—private rented
and local authority rented properties. In areas where local authority
properties have been improved through the decent homes programme,
private rented accommodation often stands out like a sore thumb, as it
has not been improved to the same
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000302">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend flags up a matter that we will
come to later: the general state of the private rented sector. He is

said that the amendment was not perfectly drafted. I wish that I had

may not be perfect, but the principles are thoroughly
laudable.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000304">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South mentioned the importance of
carers. People often move in with an elderly parent, perhaps from the
private rented sector. They could live there for a considerable time
looking after that person. They will not necessarily think, “Oh
my God, I’ve got to put my name on the tenancy,” or
“I’ve got to set up a joint tenancy,” because they
are busy caring. Then the parent dies, and they discover that they
should have done that, and find that they have no entitlement. A number
of people in my constituency have approached me with concerns about
some of the Government’s proposals on caring, but they
themselves have problems and are in need of support. Those people will
not always understand their rights in such circumstances. That is why
we want this protection in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103021000305">&#160;</a>

the need for flexibility, and we understand what the waiting lists mean
in fact, rather than simply from making assumptions, as the Government
do. We believe that there should be transparency in the system. It is
important that people should have good access to advice from officers,
and free housing advice—things that have been desperately hit by
Government cuts. We believe that the proposals will not be to the
benefit of

housing of last resort and that, over a long period, ghettoisation will

close the housing register to certain groups. It will not create more
