<P>
Question proposed [27 January] That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. It will be in your recollection, as you shared a large part of the burden of the Chair during our deliberations on Tuesday which, of course, extended to 1 pm on Wednesday that it was not an entirely normal Committee sitting. I make no complaint about that, Mr. Atkinson. If hon. Members on either side of the Committee had behaved in a way that was inappropriate or outside the Standing Orders of the House, I am sure that you and your colleague, Mrs. Dunwoody, would have intervened to prevent us from doing so. Indeed, it is very important that the Bill should have a long and extended debate.
<P>
Owing to the unusual circumstances and the protracted nature of one sitting of the Committee which I believe is the first time that a Standing Committee has sat round the clock since 1972 our proceedings attracted rather more attention in the press than usual. Some of us believe that in view of the importance of the matters concerned, that that is, in principle, welcome. However, I am slightly concerned about what was said. I understand that when everyone is tired and when there is a somewhat brief encounter with the media who appear on these sorts of occasions, matters might be got slightly wrong. I am reported in one of today's newspapers as having said that the long sitting may have been necessary to ensure proper debate. It is true that proper debate is important and that such debate is likely to be long. But it is much more questionable whether we needed a long debate all in one go or, indeed, that I said so. I make no complaint about that, however; I can raise it with the press myself.
<P>
My specific reason for raising the point of order is the reported remarks of the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry. I am sure that the press must have got it wrong because she is reported to have said the Government had given the Tories plenty of opportunities to agree a proper timetable for the Committee stage of the Bill, but they had refused to strike a deal.
<P>
I have in my hands a scrap of paper. It is, to my knowledge, the only piece of paper that has been generated in the exchange, although I am not privy to exchanges between the usual channels thereafter. My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) made this piece of paper available to me. It was tendered to the Government two weeks ago or more. All I know, as a mere shadow spokesperson in this Committee, is that my hon. Friends and I debate the clauses. We are anxious to give them the attention that they deserve, because this is a very important Bill of principle. We therefore facilitated, on the Committee's very first morning, a sittings motion to provide for afternoon sittings on both Tuesdays and Thursdays, commencing on 15 January, the first Thursday afternoon of the Bill. We were somewhat surprised that on that occasion the representative of the Patronage Office, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), moved an Adjournment so we did not sit on the first Thursday afternoon. We did rather better on the second Thursday, 22 January: we started the sitting at 4.30 pm and debated the Bill until dinner.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Lazy shirkers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend intervenes from a sedentary position. I am sure that they cannot be that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a lengthy point of order. If he brought it to a hasty conclusion I should be grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Atkinson. I was doing precisely that.
<P>
On 22 January, we got on rather better, but the hon. Member for Attercliffe moved the closure motion just before dinner. My hon. Friends divided the Committee, which is rather unusual, and voted against. We felt that the Committee should be debating. Having gone through a rather crab-like procedure, Labour Members decided to compress the debate into one mega-sitting. They failed. That is a bad way of doing business.
<P>
I hope that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry will reflect on what is, I am sure, the mistaken press report of her remarks on our intentions. We are anxious to debate the Bill in full. I hope that we shall soon be able to do so.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me first deal with the point of order, which is not a substantive one for the Chair. What is said to the media and how it is reported is a matter for the media and hon. Members. The Chair, of course, knows nothing of negotiations through the usual channels, which are not a matter for it. When the Committee sits is a matter for the Committee, not for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I should like the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry to know that there has only ever been one proposed timetable. I gave a copy to her colleague. He has never given a copy to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Those negotiations are not relevant to the Chair. They are matters for the usual channels and should be dealt with by them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If it is a different point of order I shall accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am a new Member and not so schooled in the ways of Standing Committees, but it seems to me that it is a matter for the Chair that a member of the Committee the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) is reported as saying that we have not had a sensible debate. We have considered only reasoned amendments and the debate has been in order. The suggestion that things have been otherwise seems to be a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As I said earlier, what hon. Members say or do not say and whether they are reported accurately or inaccurately by the media is nothing to do with the Chair. The Chair is extremely thick skinned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Good morning, Mr. Atkinson. I am glad to see everyone in their places and looking as fresh as a row of daisies. I had hoped to find the report of proceedings on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning on the Table so that I could remind myself of where I had got to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to stop the hon. Gentleman, but, for the convenience of the Committee, I should say that Hansard has been struggling with our deliberations and will make available as much of the debate as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Hon. Members on all sides of the Committee have put on the record their appreciation of the manful efforts of the staff to cope with this situation, but is it satisfactory for the Committee to sit when the Official Report of our deliberations on a clause that remains under consideration is unavailable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a frequent occurrence. The Committee sits in afternoons without the report of morning proceedings being available. It is something that we have to live with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hope that I can crave your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, if I inadvertently trespass on ground that I have already covered.
<P>
Because of the extraordinary circumstances of Wednesday morning, I cannot remember precisely where I had got to. I think that I had run through the structure of the clause and had addressed the likely circumstances in which an officer would deal with a dispute over whether the national minimum wage had been paid. Such a dispute probably would not involve an employer's straightforward refusal to pay the minimum wage in cash. It is more likely to revolve around a dispute over the value of the benefits in kind that form part of remuneration. It could revolve around another component of remuneration, such as gratuities if, in time, the regulations prescribe that they should be considered as part of remuneration. A dispute could, indeed, revolve around the calculation of hours worked and the remuneration received by home workers and, in particular, piece workers. Of course, we have no indication of how the regulations will be framed, so that remains largely a matter of speculation.
<P>
I alluded to the requirement in the Bill that an officer must be only "of the opinion" that a worker who qualifies for the national minimum wage has not been remunerated at the appropriate rate. The point that I sought to make was that, in those circumstances, the officer's opinion will be just that it will not be a precise analysis that makes reference to pay records. If a component of remuneration is disputed, the officer's prima facie opinion will determine whether the requirements of the Act have been breached. Under the terms of the clause, an officer would then be empowered to issue a notice. The serving of the notice would presume that the employer was guilty of not paying the national minimum wage. That would throw the burden of proof of innocence on to the accused in a way that is contrary to the traditions of our legal system. The notice would require the employer immediately to start paying the minimum wage at the rate specified in it.
<P>
On the face of it, that seems a reasonable requirement. The wages in question may be paid wholly in cash, and the employer may incontrovertibly have been paying œ3 an hour, while the minimum wage rate was œ3.50 an hour so it would not seem unreasonable for the officer to serve a notice to require employees to be paid henceforth at the rate of œ3.50 an hour. That is probably what the draftsman of the clause had in mind. When issuing a notice, however, an officer is more likely to find himself in circumstances in which there is a disputed element of remuneration. I concede that there may be bad employers and that all sorts of funny business goes on, but there will also be genuine disputes about whether elements of remuneration should be included.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Several factors determine the wage rate. Many of those are much more likely to be the subject of dispute now than they were when staff operated on a clocking-in basis. With flexitime, hours worked may be one of the principal bones of contention and may be much more difficult to resolve on an evidential basis than the question of remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That problem becomes more important and relevant when the normal burden of proof is reversed and the employer is presumed to have committed an offence unless and until he can prove otherwise.
<P>
I want to move on to the requirement that the employer will, from the date of issue of the notice, pay at the rate specified in it. How will the officer arrive at a specification of that rate? That is a problem in the context of complex remunerations.
<P>
Suppose, for example, the dispute involves an employee, part of whose remuneration is a benefit in kind, such as accommodation. Perhaps there is a dispute as to the availability or the value of that benefit in kind. What is the officer to do? Is the notice simply to say, "From this day forward the employer will pay a rate of œ3.50 per hour" assuming that that is the minimum wage? In the case of a genuine dispute, would not it be in order for the employer to say, "That is the rate that I have always paid. Taking into account the benefit in kind, which I maintain has value x, I am complying fully with the notice in continuing to pay exactly the same package as before"?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would an employer who paid a complex remuneration package which involved several different elements as well as the hourly wage or salary be able to obtain from an officer an informal determination as to whether that package was acceptable, whether a notice might be served or whether the package could be adjusted so that it was acceptable? I ask the question of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire in order to put the matter in the Minister's mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B>  That is an interesting point; perhaps the Minister will deal with it when he replies to the debate. It seems unlikely that the notice will say, for instance, that the employer will henceforth pay the worker at œ2.50 an hour plus a meal, which must be of a certain quality, once every six hours and a bed that must have its sheets changed twice a week.
<P>
If the dispute revolves around the value of a component of remuneration, it is not clear how the notice will be framed and how the employer will know whether he is complying with it. That will become important when we reach clauses 18 and 19 because of the possibility of an employer, having been held not to have complied with the officer's notice finding himself subject to a penalty notice.
<P>
Two issues arise from that. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, there needs to be some provision for an informal consideration or an arbitration procedure at the point when an officer is minded to issue a notice, but has not yet done so. I conceded entirely that there will be hard cases of recalcitrant employers who pay wages in cash and simply will not comply with a notice. Such situations are straightforward and we need not be concerned about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am not quite following my hon. Friend's argument. What about the pay reference period to which the notice will apply? The Bill suggests that it can apply to a pay reference period that continues after the date of the notice.
<P>
Therefore, if the pay reference period were a year, for instance, an enforcement notice could be served six months through that year. Does it make sense to place an obligation on an employer an enforcement notice, in effect before he has had an opportunity to fulfil his legal obligation at the end of that pay reference period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is an interesting point. The Bill indeed appears not to restrict the officer to serving a notice in respect only of a pay reference period that has already expired. However, I take it that that is the Government's intention and that it would not be possible for an officer to serve a notice in respect of a continuing pay reference period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The first subsection appears to refer to a pay reference period that has expired. If it had not expired, how could an enforcement officer say that the remuneration did not comply with the national minimum wage, as a supplementary payment could be made within that reference period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That would appear to be the logical conclusion, and I hope that the Minister will deal with that point.
<P>
An employer who pays remuneration that is not made up of cash alone, and who is served with an enforcement notice, can be certain of meeting the requirements of the notice and therefore not liable to the penalties imposed by clause 18 or 19 only by paying the minimum wage in cash until an appeal is determined. The Bill appears to contain no provision enabling that employer, as a defensive move, to begin paying a rate in cash which, coupled with benefits in kind and other elements of remuneration, would amount to an overpayment that could be recovered after a successful tribunal appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a series of valuable points. Might not the employer in the quandary that he has described about whose compliance with the national minimum wage there might be a genuine difference of opinion suffer, as well as an enforcement notice, a penalty notice under clause 19? That would put him in an awful dilemma.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is exactly my point. An employer faced with an enforcement notice under clause 17 would want to do whatever was necessary to avoid a penalty notice for non-compliance. The employer must not be denied a just outcome by being forced, to protect himself, to pay at a rate above the legal requirement. If overpayment is determined to have been made, the employer must be able to recover it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is right there should be some guaranteed means of recovery. If the employee involved was temporary, and had done a runner, how could that excess and inappropriate payment be recovered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Recovery of excess payment in that case would be difficult, but the Bill makes no provision at all for such recovery. Normal employment law does not give the employer the right to recover excess payment.
<P>
The officer issuing the notice on the basis of an opinion will exercise an almost quasi-judicial function in assessing the prima facie evidence of a breach of law. An enforcement notice has consequences for the employer, as it involves the presumption of guilt until that employer is able to prove his or her innocence.
<P>
The enforcement officer is not a neutral party. The clause reads as if the officer were a neutral intermediary between the employer and the worker. Later in its consideration of the Bill, the Committee will see that such officers have powers to take up cases and to commence civil proceedings on behalf of workers. The officers have the right of entry into employers' premises, the right to inspect their records and the power to issue them with notices. In such circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect employers to regard such an officer as a neutral and quasi-judicial official who acts from a neutral position.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I am grateful to my hon. Friend I confess that I have not reflected on that point. Is my hon. Friend suggesting that the relationship between the officer and the suspected employer should be likened to the relationship between the European Court of Justice and the House of Commons?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I advise the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge to avoid pursuing that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am glad that you said that, Mr. Atkinson. If I were going to engage in such a debate, I would not do so with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who is far more knowledgeable about the subject than I am.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There is a very close analogy in this matter with other aspects of employment law. Does my hon. Friend agree that a much closer analogy would be the case of an officer who took up an unfair dismissal case in which a Minister had dismissed his diary secretary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. That observation is very pertinent.
<P>
In the interest of making progress, I shall simply flag up my anxiety about the neutrality of the officers, and about the way in which they will be perceived. The Committee will want to return to the matter during its consideration of clauses 18, 19 and probably 22, so I shall not pursue it now. A disturbing trend is visible beneath the surface.
<P>
The second possible effect of the notice relates to its specification that arrears of underpaid wages should become payable by employers to employees. Once again, if a breach has clearly occurred, and wages have been paid entirely in cash and not at the correct rate, some I suspect not many problems will arise. One problem, on which the Committee has touched, would be the treatment of those payments for taxation purposes, and for calculating whether the national minimum wage has been paid. I understand that under the clause, any payments of arrears that result from past underpayment will be discounted from computation of whether the minimum wage has been paid, in the pay reference period in which they are made. I also understand that such payments will be treated for taxation and for national insurance purposes as if they had been paid in the period in which they originally fell due. That could cause administrative difficulties for both the employer and the Inland Revenue. The matter should be dealt with, otherwise there could be unintended, unforeseen and unfair consequences for employees and employers.
<P>
The issue of notice, and of the specification of an amount of arrears that results from underpayment, will give employees the workers two possible routes of remedy. They will be able to seek to recover the underpaid amount by civil proceedings, while the statutory procedure will work through the employment tribunals with the employer appealing if he considered the decision to be unreasonable.
<P>
I have said more than once that I am not a lawyer. It may be simple for someone better qualified to clarify this point: which procedure has precedence? Could an employee pursue the supposed debt through the civil courts? If the courts found that the debt was not properly due and owing, would the procedure instigated by the officer and pursued through the employment tribunals be automatically terminated, or am I correct in saying that civil proceedings could not commence until the employment tribunal procedure was exhausted?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I may be demonstrating my ignorance once again, but would not civil proceedings initiated by a worker against an employer for the payment of the national minimum wage be bound to fail if the worker had not sought to mitigate any loss by complaining to the appropriate inspectorate to secure an enforcement notice?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues down that road, I should tell him that the clause deals with the issuing of enforcement notices. His point relates more to clause 18. I ask hon. Members to stick as closely as possible to the matter that is before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Atkinson. The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, who is qualified in such matters, has heard my point and might return to it under clause 18. We would be better informed if the Minister also touched on the matter.
<P>
Having been served with a notice, the employer can appeal within four weeks to an employment tribunal. The worker is likely to be supported by the officer, who would presumably be backed by public funds. Serving of notices will be based on the opinion of an officer who would take the employee's part at the tribunal. Would an employer's attempt to demonstrate his innocence be supported by public funds? The Bill shifts the burden of proof in a way that is, I understand, unusual in English law.
<P>
Which employers are most likely to be caught by the provision? I take it as read that failure to comply with the law by a large employer who pays wages in cash and has good records would be transparently obvious. Such employers are unlikely to tempt providence by breaking the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a large employer would probably transgress by accident rather than by calculation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There may also be genuine dispute about what comprises the remuneration package. In those circumstances, it would be far better to have an arbitration procedure prior to the issue of a notice.
<P>
An employer who is likely to be a victim of this procedure will almost certainly be a small employer; he may not have the resources to mount a defence of his position and thus prove his innocence. It is offensive to me that someone should be presumed guilty until proven otherwise.
<P>
My understanding of the legal aid rules is that unincorporated businesses and sole traders may be able to secure legal aid in appropriate circumstances. The legal aid budget is under tremendous pressure and it is not always possible for people to secure legal aid. An incorporated business, however small and lacking in resources, is ineligible for legal aid under the present system.
<P>
Under the clause, an employer is deemed to be guilty of an offence. He then has to prove his innocence if he can. The sums of money involved will probably not be very large. The explanatory and financial memorandum says that the costs of current enforcement to a tribunal are estimated at œ750. There is no estimate of the cost for an individual to present a case at a tribunal.
<P>
A business in dispute over paying the minimum wage will probably be small and marginal. Someone could be declared guilty who does not have the resources to take up the cudgels against the power and resources of the state which will be ranged against him, with the officer acting for the employee at the tribunal, and prove himself innocent. That is a Kafkaesque nightmare which I would not like to see become a reality in England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): Quite apart from the Kafkaesque elements of the clause, there are some practical elements that my hon. Friend may wish to consider. Most of the businesses on the receiving end of enforcement will be small consisting, perhaps, of one owner with a few employees. If the owner has to prepare for or bother with a tribunal or an enforcement mechanism, he is not doing his job, and that will directly affect his business prospects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That will be a problem for very small businesses. It is difficult for the Government to consult with such businesses because, almost by definition, they do not have time to get involved in the consultation mechanism. Owner-managed businesses are unable to deal with the regulatory systems surrounding them, when that involves paying expensive lawyers to represent them or giving up their own time which is money to represent themselves, perhaps inadequately. Not all owners and managers of businesses are highly skilled and articulate. Many of them are not; they are competent in their own field but would be bewildered in trying to deal with the legal procedures of an employment tribunal and the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
The intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) brings me neatly to my final, substantive point. It relates to financial support for employers who are forced to defend themselves against the issue of notices. I refer to redress. If an employer, using his own resources, defends himself against a claim and that claim is found to be false because the notice is determined to have been wrongly issued, the Bill does not provide for the Secretary of State, whose officer has issued that notice, to reimburse that employer's legal and business costs, to compensate for his time and effort, or to pay damages for the loss of reputation that he will have suffered as a result of the notice's presumption of guilt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most appreciative of the positive tone of my hon. Friend's remarks. Is not it the case that in the absence of a redress procedure, an aggrieved employer would have to sue through the courts on the grounds that the officer of the Secretary of State was in some way deficient or had failed to discharge a public duty? That would be a very expensive, highly speculative and, for a small employer, a most unfair procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Such a remedy would be available but it would probably be prohibitively expensive. I suspect that it would also require the employer to prove that the officer had acted negligently or maliciously, not merely that he had been wrong.
<P>
The Bill seems to be framed with the large employer and the individual employee in mind. If that were always the case, it would be right to bias the Bill so as to help the little man against the big man. I suspect, however, that in cases where the clause will bite, the employer will also be a little man. I see no provisions to protect the employer from the detrimental effects of being issued with a notice, even where it is subsequently proved to have been wrongly issued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I interrupt my hon. Friend's interesting peroration to point out to him the dangers of sexism. I am not sure that the phrase "little man" is acceptable in the late 1990s and suggest that, in his own interests, my hon. Friend refers to little persons.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That has nothing to do with enforcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his suggestion, but as he may know, I attempt to avoid political correctness and seek political incorrectness wherever possible. I shall stick to the term "little man" and be damned for it, if that is my fate.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham raised in an earlier debate the issue of compensation for individual workers who had been deprived of payment that was rightfully theirs over a period of time. I believe the Minister accepted that that issue needed to be dealt with.
<P>
As the Bill stands, any penalty exacted from a recalcitrant employer would go to the Secretary of State, but there is no provision for any compensation over and above the wages that were due and should have been paid to go to an employee who had been deprived of his rights. That seems wrong. Perhaps he could claim interest under the civil procedure, but it is obvious that if employees are fortunate enough to be supported by the Department of Trade and Industry officer in pursuing a case through an employment tribunal, many will not want to go through the expense of a civil procedure.
<P>
The mirror image of that argument is that where an employer who seeks to defend himself against the issue of a section 17 notice is shown at the conclusion of the employment tribunal to have committed no offence, he should clearly be entitled to some recompense. Will the Minister consider, equally seriously, my hon. Friend's point about compensation for employees and the issue that I have raised? If he adopts the mindset of a sole trader who runs his shop with the help of one or two employees, he will quickly see that the Bill's provisions on enforcement, penalties and record-keeping obligations need to be symmetrical for the employer and the employee. I fear that the draftsman and the Government have boxed themselves in by always thinking in terms of large employers and small, defenceless employees.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> This has been a wide-ranging clause stand part debate, as one would expect. I appreciate that this is your role, rather than mine, Mr. Atkinson, but I should say that the debate has been more wide ranging than the clause itself.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the Minister rightly notes, it is for me to determine whether hon. Members are in order. I have listened extremely carefully to the debate, but so far hon. Members have remained largely in order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As I said, you are the judge of that, Mr. Atkinson. I will seek to make sure that I keep in line with your wish that we consider the clause.
<P>
The clause is a simple clause about an officer's power to issue enforcement notices. It enables an enforcement officer who believes that an employer is paying below the national minimum wage to serve an enforcement notice on him. The notice may require the employer to start paying the national minimum wage to the worker or workers concerned and to pay arrears.
<P>
I should deal with the issue of the enforcement officer's opinion, which the hon. Member for Daventry raised in our deliberations yesterday I am not sure at what hour and which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) echoed at the beginning of his remarks this morning. Of course, the officer's view has to be based on an objective test and on what is reasonable. If it is not reasonable, it will be dismissed. That is a longstanding principle of our legal system and should not give rise to problems.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I defer to the Minister's legal knowledge. I think that she is saying that any public servant has to act reasonably by definition and that any opinion that they hold should be reasonable. The concern is, however, that if a provision is not made in the Bill and I suspect that the Minister is arguing that it would be redundant to insert one the reasonableness of the officer's opinion would have to be tested in a tribunal. That would be particularly true if insult were added to injury and the employer thought that he was being victimised by the officer. A small employer might not have the resources or inclination to go through the tribunal procedure.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. At the beginning of his remarks, I thought that he was going to make my case for me. The expression in the notes on clauses is "if the officer believes", which is clearly subjective. [Interruption.] It is based on a belief. The officer's view must, however, be objective and it is implicit in the Bill that it must be based on reasonableness. That is how it will be interpreted. The hon. Member for Daventry was right to say that that is what we expect of public servants: the law expects the same.
<P>
The question of the burden of proof is not new. The shift of the burden of proof is evident in employment law in general, including legislation passed by previous Administrations. The law covering unfair dismissal provides that an employee must show that he or she was dismissed unfairly. Once that is shown, the burden shifts to the employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I understand what the Minister has said about reasonableness and the burden of proof, but does the Bill provide that an officer must give an employer the chance to present his or her version or does the officer form an opinion solely on evidence from an employee?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The clause is part of a proper and effective strategy, which I expect Conservative Members to welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, of course.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees. A strong theme in Conservative Members' arguments has been that they want the Bill to be effective and so have drawn attention to perceived problems with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall just finish my point. There needs to be an effective enforcement strategy, but I assure the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) that the notice is not even a yellow card: it is just a warning. An employer can comply simply by paying the national minimum wage to workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister spoke of a yellow card. I assume that an officer could make informal contact, perhaps by telephone, to tell an employer that a problem has been detected in his pay structure and to invite that employer to explain. Perhaps the Minister used the yellow card metaphor with precision: the problem need not be a sending-off offence meriting a red card. The interaction of conciliation and enforcement is important and we shall discuss it further.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I used the yellow card metaphor to connote a warning.
<P>
I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's helpful intervention. He and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge have opened up the issue of arbitration. The vast majority of employers and business people want to and will comply with the law. When problems arise, the enforcement officer much more often than not will contact employers, by letter or telephone, and conduct informal discussions before deciding to issue an enforcement notice. We do not need a complicated arbitration procedure because common sense dictates that the enforcement officer will almost invariably have acted.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Buckingham, and then to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I accept that in many cases informal contact will have been made, but why do not subsections (4) and (5) provide for the employer who knows that he is in the right and will therefore win to resolve the matter informally with the officer? That would avoid spending time and money on the industrial tribunal hearing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is amazing that the hon. Gentleman, whom I would not have thought of as interventionist in this aspect of industrial relations, should want to make the law even more complex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I promised to give way to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I assure the hon. Member for Daventry that no discourtesy is intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend has made my point. I accept what the Minister says, but would not it be helpful it could hardly be unhelpful if the Bill required informal contact to be made prior to the issuing of a notice or referred to the officer exploring the issues with the employer and the employee?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Perhaps it will help me to reply fully if I give way to the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Perhaps the obligation to afford the employer the opportunity to make representations is required.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the point, but an enforcement officer will almost invariably make contact with the parties straight away. It is not necessary to legislate.
<P>
Questions were posed about remuneration disputes, which can be complex. Regulations made under clause 2 will determine how remuneration is to be calculated for the purpose of the national minimum wage. Clause 47 requires the Secretary of State to publish information. If there is a dispute about the make-up of remuneration, employers can lodge an appeal. This is not a matter for enforcement. An enforcement clause 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way on a different point?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. I am going to make progress.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge I intend to flatter him referred uncharacteristically flamboyantly to a Kafkaesque situation relating to this rather humble clause. I remind Conservative Members that the provisions are in line with previous legislation. The Wages Act 1986 dealt with enforcement and penalised accidental non-payment. The enforcement provisions in the Bill attack only deliberate non-payment, but the previous Conservative Government penalised accidental non-payment, often when firms lacked resources. However, the Bill considers the practical realities of the workplace and of small businesses.
<P>
We are aiming for quicker and more effective processing by making it possible for the enforcement notice to cover groups of workers, so long as they work in the same company. The same enforcement notice may apply to groups of workers in the same company or to individuals. The clause gives the employer a right of appeal against the enforcement notice. It also provides sufficient flexibility for group enforcement for those in the same company.

</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Far be it from me to criticise the Chair, but I should like it on record that our deliberations on the clause have extended over two days of debate. That has meant having to pick up some threads. It has also been interrupted by extensive exchanges on points of order on another matter. The Under-Secretary declined to give way on a number of points. [Interruption.] The hon. Lady answered my points but not those of two of my colleagues. It is most unfortunate that we could not at least have given them a chance to express their views on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. It is important to seek your ruling on this point. The Under-Secretary knew perfectly well that a number of Opposition Members were seeking to intervene on points with which she had not dealt and to which, in her reply to the very circumscribed debate, she did not refer. I seek your guidance, Mr. Atkinson, because it is most important that hon. Members should have their rights protected in these circumstances. The clause now stands part of the Bill and I have had no answer to my legitimate concerns. How am I to respond to my constituents, who are writing to me on this matter in some numbers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We now have to put the Question of whether the clause, as amended, stands part of the Bill. What the Minister says and whether he takes interventions is a matter for him and not for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is this on a similar subject?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> On a different point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Is it in order for a closure motion to be proposed for a debate when the points at issue have not all been presented? Opposition Members asked questions to which the Minister responded, but I, for one, had a point that I wanted to make on the clause, on which I did not have the opportunity to speak.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether the Chair accepts a closure motion is entirely a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I rise reluctantly, but it is important to place on the record why we have moved the closure motion. This morning alone, on a clause to which the Opposition had failed to table any amendments, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke for 40 minutes, thus depriving his hon. Friends of the opportunity to participate. That is discounting the length of time for which he spoke in the previous sitting.
<P>
For the first 15 minutes of her reply, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary consistently took interventions from Conservative Members on specific points. A note from the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) said that the Opposition did not want to reach clause 4 by the end of today's business. Conservative Members are making these interventions because they do not want to process the Bill sufficiently quickly.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. What the Minister says is not a point of order for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it a separate point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I have two separate points of order. I seek your guidance, Mr. Atkinson, because the Minister seemed to be positing the doctrine that if no amendments have been tabled to a clause, it is somehow improper to have a full debate on it. Will you confirm that what the Minister said is complete rubbish and an abuse of procedure?
<P>
For my second point, I find myself in the unusual position of speaking on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. Although the presence of Liberal Democrat Members in Committee is often sporadic, I note that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) has been following the debate carefully this morning. He was out for two minutes, fully expecting the debate to continue becuase he knew that many Opposition Members wanted to speak. He returned, however, shortly after the vote. It is clearly unfair to his party that it will be seen not to be interested 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order. Whether hon. Members are present in the Committee Room is a matter for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Doran </B>(Aberdeen, Central): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Perhaps you could give me some guidance. I am not a new Member, but I have been out of the House for five years and may therefore need some refreshing.
<P>
I understand that a clause stand part debate is about whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. It is an opportunity to revisit the principles of the clause, but what we have heard in the past two days is Opposition Members raising issues that should properly have been made via amendments. They claimed that there were serious deficiencies in the clause and in the way in which the Government had approached the issue, and yet they chose not to table any amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. When no amendments have been tabled to a clause, the Chairman is likely to be more flexible with the clause stand part debate. I hope that that helps hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I hope that you will forgive me for asking this, but as a newer Member than the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran), it is important that I understand.
<P>
I thought that if we had not proposed amendments but nevertheless had many questions about the clause's structure and implications, as well as how it would operate, that would give rise to a debate that should not be artificially limited, even though we had not tabled amendments. A clause stand part debate deals not only with the principle of the clause, but can also deal with the practical implications of the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman should understand that the Chair has the discretion to accept a closure motion, depending on whether he or she is of the view that the issues have been fully aired. In forming that view, the Chair takes into account the time, the number of speakers and the number of interventions. I hope that that guidance will be helpful to hon. Members in their future conduct of affairs.

</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have one or two narrow points to make about the clause. Mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, and of your comments on the Committee's discussion of the previous clause, I should like to make some more general points about the clause.
<P>
Will Ministers clarify the basis on which they anticipate that an officer would choose between an employment tribunal, or its Northern Ireland equivalent, and the civil courts? An officer deciding on a course of action may take account of the size of the sum involved. For example, a case may involve what the notes on clauses describe as a class action on behalf of a group of employees rather than the recovery of an individual's entitlement. In those circumstances, would the officer decide to go to a civil court, or a tribunal?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
An alternative approach the two approaches are not exclusive, however would be to take account of the degree of perceived fault on the part of the employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend has a greater knowledge of legislation than I have. Is there a precedent for officers, using public funds to act on behalf of the Secretary of State, to take a civil action on behalf of another party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The industrial employment tribunal procedures may contain some such procedure, but I too should be grateful for clarification of that question.
<P>
A tension emerged in connection with clause 17 between an officer's roles in securing a worker's rights, in securing a balance between the rights of employer and employee, and in acting outside the court of tribunal as a more proactive conciliator facilitating a fair outcome and achieving the proper payment of remuneration.
<P>
The financial and explanatory memorandum does not give an aggregate of the costs of enforcement or of conciliation, but it shows that conciliation is a much cheaper option. A figure is quoted of some œ266 per unit in a cleared case: in contrast, the court option, depending on length and complexity, could cost several thousand pounds.
<P>
By style and inclination, I am attracted to the principle of conciliation leading to agreement, provided that the outcome is reasonable and is more than a way of splitting the difference. That is better than hacking the hard route through the courts or tribunals, and is in line with Conservative Members' constructive attitude to the Bill and the sensitive issue of industrial relations.
<P>
Neither I nor my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is a lawyer, and although I know what he meant I do not think that he was quite accurate in his description of civil and criminal proceedings. My understanding is that the nub of the matter concerns an employee's civil rights under an actual or deemed contract, which feeds into the Employment Rights Act 1996. The penalty notices provided for in clause 19 are to be recoverable as a civil debt.
<P>
At no point does the Bill talk about the boys in blue and about locking up the employer and I am not canvassing for it to do so. We are talking about several ways of securing the employee's rights or determining whether they are being infringed. That is a perfectly proper discussion.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister could provide a little more light and shade about the role of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, to which the financial memorandum, but not the Bill refers. Will she tell us about the role the enforcement officer will play on behalf of the employee? How will that be balanced against the need for fairness and neutrality towards the parties?
<P>
It emerged strongly in our debate on an earlier clause and I had some exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about this that an employer should have an option to make representations in response to informal complaints before a case gets to the formal stage of enforcement. By inference, there should at least be the option of conciliation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but the clause relates to what the officer can do in the face of non-compliance. I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman is talking about conciliation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Let me explain why the issue, which Conservative Members may subject to your guidance, Mr. Atkinson raise in another context, is relevant. It is important that the Government give us a little steer as to the balance between the various possibilities. On the one hand, parties could take the compliance route, which I hope would be their first recourse; on the other, employees could, if necessary, assert their individual rights in a tribunal. Equally, and probably more typically, the officer acting on an employee's behalf could assert his legal rights, as in the clause.
<P>
That brings me neatly to my second point. The Minister may want to consider whether those involved with the compliance side the initial approach and exchanges are the right persons to carry through court or tribunal action. There is a distinction between those roles. In one case, the person acts with a perceived bias, if not quite as an advocate for one of the parties; in the other, he is in the middle seeking agreement.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. Does he think that the bias in the clause suggests that the Government do not intend officers to be neutral? Has it occurred to him that the Secretary of State might use her apparently unfettered power to appoint trade union officials as officers, for example?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That has nothing to do with the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will not be tempted on those points, although the Minister may respond to them at some stage.
<P>
I am generous to Government on the whole, so I take the view that they have, at least in principle, set out to achieve a degree of fairness, conciliation where that is appropriate and fair treatment in court or tribunal. There is, however, a danger that, through a sidewind, they will create circumstances that are biased against employers or which employers not necessarily the bad ones or the cowboys see as biased against them.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister could tease out the role of conciliation and of the enforcement officer, who is ready to take up an employee's case in the tribunal. That bears on an issue to which my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred. There is an apparent asymmetry in the Bill between an officer taking up an individual employee's case, but not being in a position readily to compensate in cases in which employers have been unduly and unreasonably bothered.
<P>
Another point on which I should like the Under-Secretary's response relates to costs and public funds. Are those costs to public funds recoverable from the employer in the case of an adverse judgment at a tribunal or through a court and therefore recovered by public funds? No one is suggesting that the public interest should make a profit out of this operation that would be wrong. The strong implication of this and the explanatory and financial memorandum is that there will be a degree of cost. Any recovery from a delinquent employer, as seen in the courts, might be some mitigation of those costs.
<P>
My final point is general. It does at this point begin to bear on the role of the enforcement officer in taking up the case but it would be helpful if at some stage, perhaps by correspondence, the Under-Secretary could clarify the timing for the Committee. It is increasingly apparent, as we dig into the Bill, that every time we raise a comparatively minor issue another one emerges. I am a little concerned to have a view of the overall timing of events. I am assuming although I am not sure that I have reason to that all this will be done by analogy with the industrial or, as we must learn to call it, the employment tribunal and in relation to, for example, the fairly familiar procedure for considering cases of unfair dismissal. In the case of an unfair dismissal, as I understand it and I am not a practitioner in this area an employee has three months to take a case to a tribunal unless the tribunal decides that it is reasonable to allow a longer period.
<P>
I am not clear how far back the individual employee or an enforcement officer on behalf of that employee may take a case of non-payment of the national minimum wage. I may have overlooked that. However, I presume that there is some statute of limitations and that an employer will not get a letter in the post saying something like, "Mr. Boswell, we understand that you may have underpaid a farm worker in 1957."
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is developing an interesting argument. I suspect that the opportunities for vexatious litigation under the clause are great. There is no cost if an enforcement officer is use. There are many occasions on which employees who have been sacked reasonably may seize on the powers under the clause to institute vexatious litigation against innocent businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has a point, but I do not wish to extend it.
<P>
Perhaps it would be helpful for the Committee to have a schema. It could show the point at which offences or potential offences under the national minimum wage legislation can be considered, and the maximum time before complaints can be raised and heard, either in tribunal or court there may be a difference in most cases because of their differing procedures. In terms of the enforcement notices and taking suit on behalf of the employee involved, how long is it between the commission of the alleged offence and the current date before the enforcement officer is entitled to clawback and notify the employee of a particular alleged or prima facie breach of the rules? How long will it be from that point before the case goes to a tribunal or court? As a supplementary and final point, how long will it be after that before a penalty notice can be issued?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford is right. Most employers would comply with the legislation and most not all who were in breach would rectify anything that was wrong fairly readily, particularly if they received a notice or even a letter about it. Nevertheless, it is not reasonable for employers with few resources to be put at risk. Alleged offences or failures to comply from several years back, which have never come to a tribunal and about which they have never been notified, could suddenly involve them in litigation.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am concerned about the balance between tribunal and court and the cases in which their services might be deployed. I want from the Government a feel for the role of conciliation as against that of the enforcement officer, and for how the balance between the neutral duty to observe parity between parties and the role of stakeholder on behalf of one party is to be maintained. Some steer on the intended and the maximum timings for the various stages of the process would be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The clause strikes me, on careful reading, as one of the more extraordinary and most flawed. It starkly illustrates a fundamental imbalance in the Government's attitude to employees and employers. Can the Minister assure us that the Government's approach is evenhanded and say how the clause expresses that? It is flawed in its bias.
<P>
It is reasonable for the Government to think that low-paid employees may need helping through the legal minefield. Many of those who pursue legal action through an industrial tribunal or, more formally, through the courts might be unable to do so alone. They might be frightened of court proceedings because of a lack of experience or articulacy, or receive an affair result because of the way in which they have presented their case. More seriously, a lack of skill might discourage them from even taking up their case.
<P>
I do not object to help being provided in certain circumstances by an enforcement officer, but it is bizarre that the Government do not appear to think that an employer might be in the same situation. The clause represents a view of the world in which all employers are large, well-funded, articulate, well-rounded individuals who can produce skilled legal advice, or the money to buy it, when a problem arises. I cannot believe that the Government hold such a view; it is self-evidently not true.
<P>
The legal consequences of the clause will mostly affect the small business sector. Many small business owners would find any legal process not only off-putting in terms of expense, but rather frightening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point, so I shall not deal with it later. I shall give an example that I hope he will specifically address. An employee who is under 26 could deceive an employer into believing that he or she is subject to the minimum wage by claiming to be aged over 26 if a regulation was in force that exempted people under 26. I can see no provision in the clause or elsewhere in the Bill that would enable an employer who had been so deceived to recover the overpayment involved. I doubt whether it would be recoverable in law. The Bill does not contain provision for an officer to take up a case on behalf of such an employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. He gave a vivid illustration of the practical disadvantages of the imbalance in the clause.
<P>
What sort of people does the Minister think that employers are? Underlying the clause is the assumption that all employers have the skills, competence, money and general articulacy either to cope with legal proceedings or to buy professional help to cope with them.
<P>
The clause is also based on the assumption that employers are all essentially guilty unless they can prove themselves innocent. The only feature that is needed to make the powers of officers outlined in the clause operative is for an officer to believe that an offence has been committed. That is monstrously unbalanced. It is not feasible that enforcement officers will be right in 100 per cent. of cases.
<P>
Many of the relevant cases will be messy, and will occur in very grey areas. Many will not simply involve somebody being handed œ2 an hour instead of œ3 an hour or instead of whatever rate at which the minimum wage is set. Rather, they will involve argument about which benefit in kind should be made available in which pay reference period, and questions of whether a certain benefit in kind is shared between a group of three or four workers. I suspect that such arguments will dominate the enforcement officers' lives.
<P>
The Government are setting up a system under which an officer's opinion is the only hurdle that employees need to jump to enter a legal situation in which they can be professionally represented by an expert for free, while employers have to decide whether to represent themselves or to hire expensive legal help to assist them through the legal process. That is a strange attitude, and it is bound to cause injustice.
<P>
I should be grateful for the Minister's help. Roughly how many cases does he think will arise, in which an enforcement officer is required to represent individual workers? Will that be the norm? It is very likely that it will be. If the Government came to me and told me that they knew that I had a problem and that it would have to be resolved in court, and if they offered for free the help of a specialist who dealt with such cases all of the time, I should thank them, and tell them that their offer was very generous.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause is perverse and peculiar in two respects? First, it obliges employers to pay to prove their innocence, rather than to defend their reputation against an allegation of guilt. That goes against all the traditional principles of English jurisprudence. Secondly, even when an employer has gone through that process and has paid for it, he or she is vulnerable to double jeopardy under paragraph (c).
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is true, and it is a slight peculiarity. My hon. Friend's first point was good. The balance of proof has to some extent been reversed. That strengthens my argument that the hurdle over which a person has to jump into the proceedings should be considerably higher than the opinion of one enforcement officer. I am a generous minded person, and I do not share the suspicions of some of my hon. Friends that enforcement officers will over time be appointed by the Secretary of State on what might be regarded as a politically motivated basis. I assume for the sake of argument that they will all have an entirely upright and balanced attitude to the labour market and will not try to demonise employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My intervention is prompted by the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham.
<P>
My reading of the Bill is that the word "or" in lines 30 and 35, which relate to the two routes of tribunal or court, is disjunctive and not conjunctive. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that the officer involved on an employee's behalf cannot go on a shopping expedition, first having a go at the tribunal and then, if disappointed, in the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is a good point. It is reinforced by the fact that there will be a free ride for both employee and officer. All the finance is being provided, so they can spin out the legal proceedings for as long as possible and choose any possible route.
<P>
Assuming that enforcement officers are entirely reasonable and are simply trying to do their job, and accepting that some employees will be treated unfairly and will not have the skills to enable them to represent themselves, I nevertheless put it to the Minister that many employers will be in exactly the same position. They may not be competent and they may well be treated unfairly.
<P>
It is not as though employees are required to take along an enforcement officer. At least enforcement officers would be able to advise that a case was unlikely to be successful; if so, they might not want to waste their time in taking it further. Subsection (2) allows an employee to go his own way. Even if he cannot persuade an enforcement officer to spend time taking legal action, he has the power to do so himself.
<P>
One envisages professional complainers we have all met them in our surgeries. They are extremely articulate and good at arguing their own case, but they may not actually be right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend consider, as I have often done privately, the possibility of a down payment to a third person or charity to be paid by those who make representations to Members of Parliament? Unfortunately, the making of such representations is a costly exercise as we tend to attract those who avail themselves of the facilities for nothing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, we do. However, I should like to put it on the record that I am entirely happy to meet any of my constituents who want to come to me with a problem, as, I am sure, is my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
I think we agree that there are professional litigants. The clause may have the perverse result of aiding an extremely articulate employee who is quite capable of using the legal system effectively against an employer who may not be very affluent and therefore unable to hire legal help, or who may lose a legal case simply because he is less able to perform well in front of an industrial tribunal or a court.
<P>
By drafting the clause as they have, the Government reveal a mindset wherein all employers are potential rogues. They think that they must therefore provide a great deal of legal protection for employees on the basis that no employees could ever be rogues or people willing to take vexatious or unnecessary action against a current or former employer. That is not just a bias, but a bizarre view of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Doran:</B> That is the second time that the hon. Gentleman has used the word "bizarre" in relation to the clause. The Member for Buckingham earlier described the clause as perverse and peculiar. To show that the hon. Member for Ashford take the clause seriously and is not merely filibustering, will he say why neither he nor the hon. Member for Daventry tabled an amendment to what they consider to be a bizarre, perverse and peculiar clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is because the clause is so bizarre, perverse and peculiar that I oppose it in its entirety. An amendment would be redundant. I want the clause to be removed lock, stock and barrel.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Conservative Members' opinion of the clause's bizarreness could be determined by the Minister's response. If we get a proper explanation of why it is structured as it is, we may be more satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Labour Members believe that the Committee cannot have a proper debate if no amendment is tabled. The Government want to use their majority to railroad through various clauses, and I am sure that further consideration of the Bill on the Floor of the House and in another place will focus on that.
<P>
Will the Minister say why there is no balancing power allowing employers without the resources, personal or financial, to make an adequate case to an industrial tribunal to have access to enforcement officers? How can that be fair?
<P>
The financial memorandum does not mention the cost implications of the clause. The Bill offers a free gift of professional legal advice, but that could cause the Government to get a hand bitten off. Almost every employee involved in a case will take along an enforcement officer, as it is always nice to have an experienced person around.
<P>
The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry said earlier that enforcement notices would be brandished like yellow cards, so many cases will end up in the courts. If each of those cases has an enforcement officer presenting an employee's case, the cost implications are huge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is not the clause's omission of any right for an employer to take advantage of the services of an enforcement officer against an employee especially unfortunate, given that many employees of small businesses are better off than the employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend is right, but the point of principle is that it cannot be fair for the state to offer free legal help to one side of a case unless the other side is guaranteed to be so well resourced that it does not need legal aid.
<P>
The clause will lead to many cases in which the parties will be relatively inexperienced in the law and relatively badly resourced. For the Government to offer free legal help to one party in all circumstances and never to the other party makes a mockery of fairness in the legal system. The system of justice will suffer, and the provision will be seen as a perverse form of legal aid. As my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham said, in some cases that aid will go to the richer of the parties involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> If the Government have not thought of that wider implication, they would be wise to have a word with Ministers at the Lord Chancellor's Department, who take a clear and realistic view of the cost of legal aid. There must be some communciation between Departments. I cannot believe that the DTI is setting up the structure without having a word with the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Even if she leaves aside those wider implications, the Minister may wish to consider the effects of the clause on the overall popularity of the minimum wage. It takes only one or two bizarre legal cases to bring a system into disrepute.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman and he is beginning to stray. I would be grateful if he returned to order and to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will precisely explain why the clause may bring the Bill into disrepute. An enforcement officer may use the powers that the clause gives him and find himself representing a relatively affluent, articulate employee against a poor, inarticulate employer. It only takes the newspapers to publicise one or two such controversial cases for people to say that the structure that the clause sets up 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not dealing with the point. Whether or not the clause makes the Bill unpopular or is reported on critically in the media is not relevant to clause 18. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman did not pursue that argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am seeking to help the Minister by pointing out to him that the Bill would be improved without clause 18. It would, therefore, be sensible of him to respond to the clause stand part debate by agreeing with Conservative Members that the clause should, in fact, not stand part of the Bill. I have already advanced one or two arguments as to why the clause should not stand part of the Bill. I am now making the point that it would help the Minister's presentation of the Bill if the clause did not stand part of it; if it does, it may bring the wider Bill into disrepute.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have spoken to the hon. Gentleman about the question of disrepute. Not only is he beginning to stray dangerously towards the edges of order, but he has repeated his point a number of times. I urge members of the Committee to remember that one of the rules by which we abide concerns repetition or what is sometimes called tedious repetition. The hon. Gentleman is not being tedious, but he is in danger of becoming repetitive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
Not only will the powers in the clause be bad for small businesses and lead to unfairness, but they may be bad for the small business sector as a whole. The clause will discourage people from setting up small businesses. They will see that they will be demonised by the clause and will be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. They will see that the person on the other side in a court case will automatically be given access to free legal help while they will not, under any circumstances. Anyone thinking of setting up their own business will weigh the pros and cons in the balance, and the clause will be a large con. I assume that the Minister not only wants to encourage existing small business, but wishes more people seriously to consider the option of setting up their own business. Members on both sides of the Committee agree that that would be a valid way of improving the economy.
<P>
For all the reasons that I have suggested, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the implications of the clause and, if possible, to withdraw it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford who has developed the arguments powerfully and in some detail. I want to refer to several points and would welcome the Minister's response.
<P>
The first point relates to the entitlement of "an officer" to take action on behalf of an aggrieved employee. I want to focus on the wording at lines 24 and 25. A specific reference is made to "an officer" who is
"acting for the purposes of this Act".<P>

<P>
That is a matter of concern. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry flagged up the fact that it might be desirable for a different enforcement officer to pursue the case.
<P>
The argument applies to both sides. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, bringing the eyes and experience of a new enforcement officer to a case might result in a more objective prosecution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To clarify the point, I envisaged, first, a solely conciliatory role for an officer; secondly, a role at the first stage of enforcement, when he might think that something was wrong with the employer's practice; and, thirdly, that the officer would appear explicitly on behalf of the employee during court proceedings rather than in a neutral capacity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Yes. I understand that the officer would be appearing on behalf of the employee, but he would have decided to do so after another enforcement officer had exhausted the alternative routes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Extending my hon. Friend's argument, would not it be desirable to have a separate service with responsibility for the two functions entering premises and establishing whether an offence had been committed prima facie, and making a claim on an employee's behalf through the employment tribunal or the courts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The appropriateness of legal experience might make it sensible to distinguish between the functions. An enforcement officer need not necessarily have legal experience to undertake the investigative or analytical function at the place of work. However, if the case was taken forward under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c), legal qualification and experience would be appropriate. There is value in what my hon. Friend says and in what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has argued.
<P>
The alternative argument is that it would be better for the officer who proceeds with a case to be the one who has dealt with it until that point. We all know of constituents I shall not animadvert for long, Mr. Atkinson who have been disadvantaged. Time and again, problems are casued or exacerbated by their case being handled by different members of staff at public agencies at different times. The staff perhaps do not know the full facts and have got into difficulty while trying to help.
<P>
There is an argument for an enforcement officer dealing with a case in court or in front of an industrial tribunal if he has dealt with it until that point. However, if that is the wish of the Minister, who is looking a little befuddled, I argue that it would be more appropriate for the clause to refer to "the officer" rather than to "an officer". I should greatly welcome enlightenment from the Minister on that point we have not had it to date.
<P>
I suspect that the Government probably have not given much thought to this point. They are so preoccupied with the desirability of the clause and of enforcement officers that they have failed to consider the real significance of whether one officer should deal with the case from start to finish or whether it is appropriate to have different officers acting at different times or for different stages of the case.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second point, of great importance, is the means by which the employee can secure redress. There has been a little debate on this point but we do not seem to have reached any conclusion. I am not even certain that Opposition Members are much clearer as a result of individual contributions and interventions.
<P>
Unless I misinterpreted what he was saying, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry wondered whether there was a mutual exclusivity between opting for one route or opting for another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's confirmation that my interpretation of his position is correct. He thought that there may be mutual exclusivity and that an employee could take one route through which to satisfy his grievance or another, but not both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Further to my hon. Friend's point, I suppose it would also be important to clarify whether it was possible for an employee to take the private route under clauses 15 and 16 and revert to the public route thereafter. That might make some sense. It would be more difficult if the case had initially taken the public route and then the employee decided to revert to the private route. The point is certainly worth considering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is certainly worth considering, as my hon. Friend suggests. I am concerned that in either case there could be I put it no stronger than that an unnecessary expense in terms of legal costs and time resulting from the pursuit of both courses of action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Double jeopardy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> From a sedentary position, my hon. Friend talks of double jeopardy. I referred to that point during the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford, and I should like to return to it. It is valid in its own right and important in terms of what it suggests about the Government's attitude.
<P>
It surely cannot be right that under the clause an employer should be subject to effective punishment and penalty by virtue of two routes. That seems extraordinary. If an employee, with the assistance of, and possibly by virtue of the decision of an enforcement officer, should proceed with a case against an employer under paragraph (a) or, in the case of Northern Ireland, paragraph (b), or should choose to institute civil proceedings on his own account, unassisted, under paragraph (c), it seems peculiar that he has the opportunity of the other routes available to him at the same time. That is apparently the position as it stands. The clause specifically states in subsection (2):
"The powers conferred by subsection (1) above for the recovery of sums due from an employer to a worker shall not be in derogation of any right which the worker may have to recover such sums by civil proceedings."<P>

<P>
If one is not intended to deduce from that provision that it will be open to an employee not only to deploy the services of an enforcement officer at public expense, but to take action in the civil courts, what is one expected to deduce? Later clauses deal with penalties and make specific reference to penalties against the employer. The truth, however, is that the clause also contains a potential and unspecified penalty. There is the penalty that will be exacted as the result of the successful pursuit of a case by an enforcement officer on behalf of an employee under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c), and the penalty that can be expected to result if an employee opts for civil proceedings. That seems wrong. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said from a sedentary position a few moments ago, it is a case of double jeopardy. How can it be justified?
<P>
It is entirely right that there should be powers of enforcement. Insofar as the Bill provides for an enforcement officer to proceed with cases of non-compliance, I have no objection to it it would be absurd for an Act entitling an employee to a national minimum wage to have no means of enforcing that. Obviously, there has to be enforcement officers to make enforcement a reality.
<P>
However, the idea that there should be not only the remedy of the successful pursuit of a case by an enforcement officer but on top of that, the right to secure redress through civil proceedings is absurd. My concern is that there could be, first, an excessive expenditure of time and legal cost and secondly, a reward or, more neutrally, a compensation to the aggrieved employee which greatly outweights the denial of entitlement that he or she suffered in the first place.
<P>
My credentials should not be in any doubt. I argued in another context that an employee's rights seemed inadequately protected or advanced by the Bill. The Minister cannot suggest that I am anxious to ensure that the employee has minimal protection. In certain respects no doubt entirely inadvertently the Bill does not provide fully for the proper compensation of an aggrieved employee. I want to ensure that aggrieved employees who can prove that they have a good case are fully, not partially, compensated. However, I do not want clause 18 to pass into statute unamended and so result in an employee getting far more compensation than is reasonable.
<P>
I resist the temptation to refer at length to the public popularity or otherwise of the Bill. If I were to do so, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford did so eloquently, I would risk being subject to your strictures, Mr Atkinson. Nevertheless, it is surely legitimate to ask whether the retention of the clause advances either the Bill's effectiveness or its credibility. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe appears to be amused by this, although he has shown no familiarity with the Bill so far only a determination to rush it through as quickly as possible.
<P>
I have no doubt that the clause could be effective if its intended purpose was to force employers to suffer large penalties, but that is not the same as being credible or ethical. My anxiety is that as it allows an employee to pursue a number not one of a number of routes to secure compensation, the threat of double jeopardy exists. If, as a result of the clause, employers suffer and incur great costs, there will naturally be a public outcry and people will be entitled to ask whether such an effect was pointed out at the time. They will ask whether anybody explained why clause 18 was unacceptable. They will want to know whether anyone invited the Minister to consider the possibility of its withdrawal or its amendment by a Government who recognise its inadequacy? It is legitimate of me to draw attention to that and to ask the Government to reconsider.
<P>
The clause is unacceptable also because it refers to an employee's entitlement to pursue a case but does not confer a similar entitlement on an employer. That is unfortunate. Non-compliance is deemed to reside only with the employee. That is important because loading the dice in that way is unfair. An employer should be entitled to pursue cases and to have access to some public subsidy for legal expenses incurred.The clause is unfair and injudicious, because it almost exhorts the employer to consider other remedies. Several of my hon. Friends have outlined circumstances in which an employee could mislead an employer about his or her entitlement. Yet the clause offers no means of redress for an employer against an employee who is in the wrong. It is therefore possible that the employer could take excessive action against the employee. That would be unfortunate, but the possibility could be avoided if the clause provided for an employer's right to legal action.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central asked why my hon. Friend the Minister for Ashford had tabled no amendment to the clause. My hon. Friend explained that the clause was serially deficient, fundamentally wrong and incapable of betterment, and that it should be deleted. I agree, and that is why I tabled no amendment either.

<P>

<B>Mr. Doran:</B> I hate to intervene, lest it appears that I am taking the hon. Gentleman seriously. No amendments have been tabled to any clause between clause 5 and clause 17. Is that a new tactic to throw Government off the scent about the Opposition's true intent.?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I blame myself, Mr. Atkinson. I should have known that the hon. Gentleman is not interested in serous contributions. I have never taken him seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is not one of the problems for Conservative Ministers that debates on amendments provoke no more detailed or considered responses from Ministers than debates on clause stand part?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is right: tabling an amendment makes no difference. Few Labour Ministers have anything to say about the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not continue that line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I certainly will not, Mr. Atkinson. Does my hon. Friend agree that a contract will be deemed, and an officer might sue, on the basis of remuneration at the national minimum wage rate, but that it may also specify the maximum hours to be worked? Employees might exceed those hours without the consent of employers. The two provisions might come into conflict. What does my hon. Friend think might be the result of that?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I had not previously considered that most interesting point. It merits proper scrutiny. I am not sure that we have had a full debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The officer is empowered to act on behalf of any worker, but there may be discrepancies when officers in different parts of the country exercise their powers. That could lead to inconsistency and unfairness. Would not it be beneficial to require the Secretary of State to issue guidelines, or even regulations, so that officers acted consistently?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I can see much merit in that. There is a lack of specificity on the Government's part. Whether it is calculated or the result of clumsy indifference or inattention is not clear. Perhaps that will emerge. There would be merit in the establishment and enforcement of national guidelines.
<P>
I referred earlier to the legitimate debate about whether the officer who had undertaken the preliminary investigation should take a case to an industrial tribunal. The toss could be argued wither way. On balance, I think that the officer who takes the case forward should not be the person who carried out the initial inquiries. In that respect, I am in line with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. If an officer investigated other employers in the same area and pursued cases on behalf of employees, partiality could be injected into the process.
<P>
As has been pointed out, the enforcement officer is partial an agent of one side of the argument, not a neutral arbiter. If a case was pursued by the officer who had dealt with it from the start, the employer might think that he was being hounded during the legal process by an agent of the state who had misunderstood or misrepresented him been agin him from the outset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I was thinking of a less sinister situation. Our hon. Friend the Member for Daventry suggested that there might be a limit beyond which it would be financially inappropriate for an officer to pursue a case. Limited resources will be available to officers, but in the interest of fairness between different workers, it might be appropriate to establish when an officer would or would not take up a case rather than allow resource constraints to determine that. An employee in one case might be supported by the Government-funded officer while another may have to pursue his case through the civil courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I entirely agree one needs clear guidelines. My hon. Friends and I are anxious to avoid a situation in which the enforcement officer has excessive power. He should not enjoy unfettered discretion because that would effectively become fiat. It is, therefore, right that there should be national guidelines as to who acts in particular circumstances. There should also be clear guidelines as to the criteria on which the choice is made to pursue one of the available routes for seeking redress under the clause. The enforcement officer's power, resourcefulness and skill should be available to the employer at public expense in the same way as it is to the employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend refers to public expense. Does he agree that we have no knowledge of the degree to which expense might accrue as a result of officers' actions? The Minister talked in relatively light terms about enforcement notices they might flutter across industry like so much confetti. If enforcement officers proceed to sue employers in great numbers on the basis of the enforcement notices, the expense to the Exchequer might be considerable. Does my hon. Friend have a comment to make on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I certainly do. I am concerned about the scale of public expense that is likely to result from the clause. It is entirely proper that proceedings should be instituted where due cause can be shown. We should not complain if public expense results from that because justice has a price and it must be done and be seen to be done. I do not complain about the fact of public expense. In view of our fiduciary duty to the taxpayer, however, it is essential to ensure that an enforcement officer does not take action under the clause unless he has good reason to do so.
<P>
I was disappointed by the Minister's response to an earlier debate. She did not offer a proper justification of the existing wording. As I understand it, the clause enables an enforcement officer to take action on the basis of his opinion or perhaps his prejudice. His opinion may be based on a rumour that somebody has spread, his particular dislike of an employer or several unquantifiables and undefinables. Considerable and possibly major public expense may result, and that cannot be right. It would be better if that were avoided.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford said, the truth is that the clause is poorly drafted and unsatisfactory. As constituted, it is unfair to the employer and it is not entirely clear that it is fair to the employee it may be generous to him, but that is not the same as saying that it is fair. One could argue in theory about whether the clause could be improved, although there is not much merit in doing so. Winston Churchill used to say that such matters should be judged on the whole, and, on the whole, I am inclined to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford that the clause cannot be improved. It would be far better if the Government went away and gave the matter some thought. The Minister should apply a hot towel to his head, surround himself with a clique of the most efficient and intelligent civil servants in his Department and see whether they can, with the assistance of the parliamentary draftsmen, come up with something more edifying and suitable for our consumption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Once again, Conservative Members have thinly disguised their total opposition to the concept of the minimum wage. They have barely concealed the fact that they act at all times as apologists for a minority of employers who wish to undermine the concept of the Bill. Those employers want to act illegally, to continue to undermine people who are entitled to their rights and to prevent them from enjoying those rights. The hon. Gentleman's general arguments and specific questions have all been about the protection of employers who wish to act outside the law with impunity.
<P>
I have listened to the Opposition, and I have taken copious notes. I shall not take interventions at present I shall respond to all of the points that are worthy of response. The thrust of the clause is its intention to entitle workers to receive payment when they have been underpaid by an employer. Various hon. Members have said that that is an imbalance, that it is undemocratic and that it demonises employers. That is complete nonsense.
<P>
The principle that an employer has a responsibility to pay the minimum wage and to keep records underlies the Bill. The only potential victim is the underpaid worker. The clause is based on one simple premise. The Government seek to enable workers to be represented when they are incapable of representing themselves.
<P>
I make no apology for that. The overwhelming majority of low-paid workers in Britain are unrepresented or under-represented. Even if they are represented, many employers do not allow them to bargain for wages on their own behalf. I am up front and honest about the fact that the Government do not wish to produce legislation that does not allow unrepresented workers to uphold their right to a minimum wage, or which prevents them from doing so. There is no escaping that principle, and I shall not attempt to do so.
<P>
Conservative Members have said that the clause provides for the opportunity I shall paraphrase for employers to be hounded by employees acting in a vexatious, underhand manner. The clause will not help employees to do that. The officer will judge whether there is a case, and decide whether to proceed with it. An employee who acts in a vexatious, underhand way, who provides information that is not verifiable or who tells an untruth, will find no assistance in clause 18. Clause 15 does not provide any such assistance, either.
<P>
When an employee decides to go to an industrial tribunal, a process of conciliation occurs through ACAS. I shall return to that matter later, as it concerns other clauses. After that process, ACAS will advise the employee whether he or she has a case. If the employee is advised that there is not a case but pursues it, the case will go to a tribunal. A pre-hearing will occur, at which the case will be struck out by the tribunal on the grounds that it is vexatious and has no evidence. If the employee loses his or her case because it is deemed by the tribunal to be vexatious, the tribunal can award costs against the employee.
<P>
At all stages, employer's legal rights are protected, quite rightly so. No one supports the idea of people trying to obtain wage payments to which they are not due. The Bill seeks simply to give people what they are entitled to. It does not seek to add to that entitlement, or to support vexatious attempts to secure additional payments. The case put by Conservative Members that employers are being dealt with unfairly does not stand up when it is tested.
<P>
An enforcement officer will not just wake up one day and decide to see an employer because he or she likes ordislikes that employer. That is an absolute nonsense. The Bill provides a process in which a complaint is received and investigated in the context of a relationship between the enforcement officer and the employer.
<P>
Employers will always be able to protect themselves against any unfair action taken by an enforcement officer. First, enforcement officers might decide as they often will on the basis of evidence and of their interview with the employer that there is no case. Secondly, if discussion and investigation show that there is a case to answer, employers have two options. They may comply, and pay the wage.
