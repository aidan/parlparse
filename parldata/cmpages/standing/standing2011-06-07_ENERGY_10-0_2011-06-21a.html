the end of this morning’s sitting, I was saying to the hon.

environmental activities. I referred earlier to the Prime

from the cabinet member for environment in West Oxfordshire district

said:<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000047">&#160;</a>

the issue is so important—some issues in society, such as child
protection, are very important—that every council must do its
bit if we are to achieve our national climate commitments. Councils
that are not already doing it cannot use the excuse that it is too
difficult or that there is too much responsibility and onus, which is
why new clauses 1 and 2 are so
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000048">&#160;</a>

almost everything the hon. Lady said. Local authorities have to get
involved, but councils that are already engaged, of which examples have
been given, are up for the plan because they are already engaged. If a
council is not engaged, being required to come up with a review, a
strategy or a plan will allow them, as ever, to do straightforward,
routine box-ticking. That is not what will drive councils to join the
examples of best practice; I have seen no evidence of

another. If a local authority has a large coal plant or a large road

                  </strong> The hon. Lady has misunderstood, but perhaps I
was not clear enough. One hundred per cent. of emissions happens in
local authorities. In many cases, those emissions will not be reduced
by local action, but by having a strong national framework. With the
landfill tax, a heavy-duty national stick has been applied throughout
the country, which has resulted in local authorities finding ways to
minimise their waste. It is not applied by the Government in a bespoke
manner for each and every local authority; it is interpreted by local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000056">&#160;</a>

large signals sent by the Government are what will make a difference:
the sticks and carrots across the board, the green deal, the green
investment bank, electricity market reform—we hope to see it in
the next few months and it may be a game-changer if the Government are
as ambitious as we are led to believe they will be—feed-in
tariffs, renewable heat incentives and, I hope, more action from the
Department for Transport, which is not yet doing as much as it should.
Those things will lead to a rapid reduction not only in our dependence
on overseas fuel, but in our
emissions.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000057">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Absolutely, and that is exactly what we are
doing under this magnificent Bill, which I believe is a great step in
the right direction. That is not to say that it cannot be improved. I
take this opportunity to say that our proceedings are probably the only
example since the election of a scrutiny Committee actually engaging in
real scrutiny, and that is a testament to the Department. It has gone
out of its way to find the most awkward people imaginable to apply
themselves to the job of scrutiny, and that is a great thing. It is a
template and adds weight to the argument that the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion has made many times for elected members of Bill
Committees. I accept that I am well off-track, Mr Crausby, but if we
did have elected members of Committees, we would have much more engaged
discussions than is usually the case in such
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000059">&#160;</a>

am a fan of the Bill. It is a step in the right direction. Many of the
other examples of action that I have provided are already in the
pipeline. The renewable heat incentive and feed-in tariffs are not
futuristic aspirations; they are happening. The green investment bank
is not as ambitious as many people hoped, but it is many times more
ambitious than most people expected. Electricity market reform in the
next few months could be—I think will be—an absolute game
changer. Such measures will put a price on pollution. There will be big
incentives for energy reduction and energy efficiency, and that will
necessarily lead to the action at local authority level for which

                  </strong> I can give the hon. Gentleman one example.
Clearly, EMR has not happened yet, but I hope that energy reduction
will be put on a par with energy generation, so that when local
authorities engage in or organise energy contracts, there will be a
direct incentive for them to pursue contracts that have energy
efficiency at their heart. If that happens, the dynamic will change
completely. Instead of companies having a direct incentive to sell as
much energy as they can, they will have an incentive to sell as little
energy as they can, albeit enough to power homes, hospitals and God
knows what else to keep the lights on. They dynamic will change so
profoundly that that in itself will probably be the biggest single
thing that the Government can do to start weaning us off dependence.
The reform must be ambitious, and I believe that it will be
ambitious.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000063">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman is so sceptical about what can be achieved at local

for national level, but not for what will happen at local level? The
new clauses are about empowering local authorities to take the action
that will be needed at local level if those national aspirations are to
come true. They are not about red tape, which can be used to

                  </strong> Perhaps I have misunderstood, but I do not
think that the measures are about empowering local authorities; I think
they are about providing direction for local authorities, which I shall
come to in a second. I am certainly not sceptical about what can happen
locally, but I am sceptical about targets because it is unclear what is
the responsibility of local authorities and what is the responsibility
of the Government. Where can the local authorities make a difference,
and where can they not? Because that is necessarily ambiguous, it is
hard to imagine what sanctions should be put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000065">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My
original question about sanctions at our previous sitting was not
mischievous. There is not much point in having specified and
prescriptive targets and goals unless we also have sanctions;
otherwise, they will be ignored. It is hard to imagine how we can work
out what sanctions to apply to local authorities for exceeding the
budget that is set for them, given that we do not even know which parts
they will have the power to deal with, and which parts they will not. I
can imagine the policy becoming an absolute bureaucratic nightmare. It
will not have the desired outcome. Local authorities that do not want
to engage will not engage. Most local authorities want to engage, but
they have no idea how to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000066">&#160;</a>

examples of what is happening in her local authority. We need to learn
from those examples. We will hear from the Minister later, but what I
hope we will be able to do is facilitate a process whereby best
practice is centralised, so that we develop a bank of best practice
that local authorities can draw on, because I do not think that the
expertise exists in many local authorities to pursue the types of
measures that we are talking about.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000067">&#160;</a>

I suggest to him that the expertise does reside in local authorities.
Because they have, not direct levers of power, but influence over waste
policy, transport, industrial development and so on, they can make
decisions such as the one my local authority made to have Tata Steel,
one of the most intensive energy users, on its doorstep, but to adopt
compensatory measures to minimise its carbon footprint, which it has
done so very intelligently. All the new clause would do is to allow
that sort of local determination in balancing the books on green
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000068">&#160;</a>

that there is a lot that local authorities can do. What I do not

must do about things over which it has control and then apply targets

authority is Richmond upon Thames and part of its area is in my

reduce emissions, and it introduced a scheme to try to reduce emissions
from cars. It turned out to be one of the least attractive, clumsiest
and most unpopular environmental initiatives that I have ever seen, and
it absolutely exhausted local people’s appetite for green
initiatives. It was very well intentioned and it was absolutely the
right aspiration, but it was completely the wrong idea and the effect
was that we took a big step backwards. Why? Because car emissions
cannot be addressed locally. It is an issue that we need our Government
to address and indeed it must also be addressed at the level of the

“You go ahead and determine how you will do that,” is
what local democracy is about. It seems that he is now arguing against
local determination of how local authorities can achieve reductions in
their carbon footprint.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000072">&#160;</a>

your eye, Mr Crausby, in a moment to expand on that, but landfill tax
is essentially a budget for landfill; it is not a target. Essentially,
that is why it has worked, because it says, “This is what you
can landfill and these are the decisions that you can make relative to
it, and you must work within a budget for your landfill.” I am
with him on that, but I think that what he is saying actually supports
our argument, rather than opposes it.

                  </strong> I am not sure that I completely agree with that
interpretation. The difference is that the landfill tax exists, and
local authorities can either minimise their exposure to it or they can
ignore it, but if they ignore it, there are financial penalties. I do
not think that it is a budget in the normal sense. My original point is
not about whether it is a budget, or a target or anything else, but
that it is a national disincentive that was created to turn waste into
a liability. That is the sort of measure that we need across the board.
We need incentives and disincentives to push us in the direction that

                     </span>
                  </strong> I do not quite understand certain elements of
the debate. In Climate Change Act 2008 we set a number of targets. We
subsequently went substantially beyond those in the architecture of the
Act to make things happen. In One can generally characterise targets as
similar to saying, “I want to lose a stone in weight.”
That is my target. Then the question is “How do I go about
it?” What I may do then is give myself a diet, or a budget, to
achieve that target. That is what was done with the Climate Change Act.
We have our five-year carbon budgets, which are not targets. They
constrain the overall envelope of what can be done; within that, it is
possible to move around considerably, but it provides the shaping for
the way forward. We produced a national allocation
plan—difficult to undertake, but we did it
nevertheless—for large parts of UK industry and electricity
producers on what their emissions could be and how they would need to
trade them to stay within the budget allocations they had been
given.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is how we have done it under the Climate Change Act, so it seems a
little odd that under the Bill, because we cannot easily determine what
is within the budget of the local authority, the instrument has
apparently no worth. I take the opposite view. Provided one states in a
budget its parameters, the value of the budget then relates to its
examination on the same terms over a period—it tells those
involved where they are going, and does it properly at each level of
governance. Indeed, it enjoins them to stick within it, but it does not
constrain their policy options, because it does not mean they must do
this, that or the other. It is not an imposition on local government to
do particular things. It is a shaping arrangement that ensures that we
have in common the ability to get carbon emissions down, while
retaining an enormous amount of initiative in different aspects of our
lives and in how we go about our business. It does not interfere with
or bureaucratise policy making, as has sometimes been
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000084">&#160;</a>

do. The council could make the case for not accepting the advice and
could draw up a strategy based on a larger or a smaller scale of
action. The difference is that the actions would be transparent and
that local people could hold the council to account. Most importantly,
no council would be able entirely to opt out of tackling climate
change, as they can at present. To respond to the hon. Member for
Richmond Park, there is an opportunity here for councils to put forward
a smaller strategy for action—not that we would necessarily

clause’s impact on local authorities. In many ways, it goes in
the same direction as budgets from the Committee on Climate Change. The
Government recently accepted the fourth carbon budget, but not every
element of the Committee’s recommendations. However, the climate
change budget is in place—a good thing too—and that
provides the shaping and the corset within which we then work through
different policies, perhaps, depending on one’s point of view,
towards that overall
target.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000087">&#160;</a>

compatibility of what is in the new clauses with what we are already

eminent common sense about where we should go. Over the next few years,
if we are to deal with the imperative before us and get anywhere near
our carbon abatement aims, we cannot avoid a degree of regulation and
shaping, alongside best practice and examples of people far exceeding
what the budget suggests. I hope that the provision will be the bedrock
of a process of people exceeding the targets. It is not a particularly
big ask, and it could be of great benefit to what we know we have to do
to achieve our climate change targets in the years
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000088">&#160;</a>

volume of asks that we are making of local authorities at this

wrong end of the telescope during this debate. We have been talking
about the many local authorities that are doing phenomenal things. Only
today, I heard that Birmingham intends to be a green deal provider in
its own right. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion

significant number of local authorities—we should not
underestimate their number—that will struggle to fulfil their
obligations under the green deal. The last thing that I want is to put
another piece of legislation on to the statute book—one that
becomes Home Energy Conservation Act 2. There is a real danger that we
will overload local authorities with carbon complexity. The arguments
advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park were right.
More work needs to be done to come up with a robust consensus around
what falls within a carbon budget and how it is determined.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000092">&#160;</a>

to focus not on carbon complexity or things that are outside their
control—motorways running through a constituency, large
industrial sites or worries about the impact that this will have on
planning permissions—but on the dynamic role that they can play
in rolling out the green deal and taking practical action. Perhaps this
is the mirror image of previous Government practice, which was to set
targets and obligations, then walk away from the responsibility of
delivering them. I want to give local authorities maximum opportunity
and capacity to deliver energy efficiency and to transform the housing
stock and small businesses. That is the transformational genie within
this Bill. If we introduce another layer of complexity, there could be
problems. Although some local authorities may be able to adjust their

in spades with a revitalised Home Energy Conservation Act. HECA is
exactly that, a focused and clearly designated piece of legislation
that imposes a legal obligation on local authorities to drive energy
efficiency throughout their areas. In the short term, HECA is the means
of delivering that. To add a further layer of carbon complexity, asking
councils to consider industrial gases, transport and other things,
could be quite baffling to under-resourced and overstretched local
authority officers. It would be a distraction from the real
opportunities of the green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000100">&#160;</a>

only as a result of reviews, strategies and targets being imposed, with

badly on it. The green deal ought to be attractive enough to
individuals, streets, businesses and local authorities to become a
runaway success without compulsion being necessary. Will the Minister
reassure the Committee that it is attractive enough, and that the

run all the way to 2030. The number of homes involved is so large that
it is mind-boggling. Ultimately, it will touch 26 million homes. I do
not suggest that we have anticipated the way in which the market will
react in the latter stages of this decade and into the 2020s, but I am
sure that we will need to return to secondary or other legislation and
financial incentives to drive the market
further.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000103">&#160;</a>

will return to carbon budgets and why we are taking steps in the right
direction. To move this agenda forward and to move closer to the point
where we can adopt a comprehensive approach to carbon budgets, we have
provided £2.5 million for local carbon framework pilots in nine
areas, involving some 30 local authorities. We will publish the lessons
learned from those pilots later this year, for the benefit of all local
authorities. In addition, we have agreed a groundbreaking memorandum of
understanding between my Department and the Local Government Group,
again providing a framework for local authorities to set their own
levels of ambition on climate change through a new Nottingham
declaration

would hate members of the Committee to have the impression that we have
set our face against carbon budgets. There is more work to be done,

local authorities, particularly on those who are least engaged in this
agenda, is the right priority, as we want them to engage in the green
deal through HECA. Once they have got to grips with the green deal and
rolling out energy efficiency, and once we have collated more
information from our local carbon frameworks, we will continue to push
this agenda forward. The new clause is asking for too much, too

from nine councils. All in all, 40 councils are signed up and want this
to go forward. The Minister mentioned the memorandum of understanding,
but it provides no clarity on the scale of action. It is not comparable
with what we are discussing today. The Minister has said that it is not
the last word and that there is a 20-year plan but, ultimately, the
time is now. These targets are too important. The reason and motivation
for these new clauses is that we have put this into action. It is
already happening in 40 councils across the country who are saying,
“We can do this.” I do not accept what the Minister is
saying, because we have already heard councils saying that they are
doing it pretty effectively and that it has worked. We used the example
of Manchester, where 100 organisations, businesses and local

               <p class="tabbed">The last thing
I want, because it is so easy to come here full of enthusiasm and
passion for this subject, is to put more and more on to the statute
book. It is that same passion and those same good intentions that led
to the creation of the Home Energy Conservation Act back in 1995, but
because there were not the resources available to roll it out fully,
because it was slightly ahead of its time and because it was out of
kilter with other policy sets, it languished on the statute book. It
was up to the coalition to rescue it.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000110">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The last thing
that I want is to push the local carbon budget to a point where it is a
universal obligation, but where only the faster moving councils pick it
up and run with it and it becomes slightly discretionary; the currency
of the local carbon budget would be slightly devalued. We are gradually
moving towards that point, but it must be on the basis of a strong
consensus. There must be funding, and people must feel that it is
right. The measure must not be only for the early movers, the fast
adopters and the big metropolitan authorities; we are talking about a
statute that will impose an obligation on every single local authority,
including a small rural district council with perhaps only a part-time
officer working on it.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000111">&#160;</a>

Minister’s point is that HECA is the mechanism that will,
effectively, ensure that local authorities are focused on delivering
the green deal. We all have ambitions to go further than that, but the
Minister is right in saying that some councils, such as
Stratford-on-Avon district council, are already resource-thin and
finding life pretty difficult in the current economic climate. Such
councils would struggle if we were to make it mandatory to go further
on carbon reduction without first having been responsible enough to
have costed that in. The Minister rightly makes the point that it would
be highly irresponsible to accept the new clause, which would, in fact,
damage what we all want to see: the success of the green

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is spot on. At this point, the
absolute priority of local authorities should be the green deal. They
should be focused on rolling out practical actions, not diverting
officer time to drawing up hypothetical carbon plans and grappling with
very complex issues. They should not be diverting very scarce, often
non-existent, resources into drawing up ambitious plans. I want real

it out in the following 12 months. We are a little way from the
aim—we are not so far away from it, but we need to take much
more evidence. The last thing I want is to distract local authorities
by making them start to think that they need to draw up complex local
carbon plans and strategies when they should be focusing absolutely on
rolling out the green deal and allocating the relatively scarce and

emissions come from properties, be they household or commercial. It is
great that councils can play a part in reducing that 30%. However,
anything between 80% or, as the hon. Member for Richmond

Obviously, 100% of our emissions come from localities; I cannot think

definition, unless they are in space, they have to come from within a
local authority area. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park made
a key point: the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree seeks to give
local authorities the responsibility for emissions that are created
within their area, despite the fact that they do not have the powers to
control them. That is the
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000119">&#160;</a>

finances of local authorities, although, under the hon. Lady’s
definition, local authorities are responsible for 100% of emissions in
the UK. There is a definitional inexactitude. We must define what we
really mean. This is a complex area. That is why I have spoken about
carbon complexity. I particularly do not want the smaller, less well
resourced local authorities wading into this issue unnecessarily,
potentially at the risk of distracting them from making real progress
and giving absolute 20:20 focus to preparations for the green deal. I

                  </strong> It was very positive to hear the Minister say that
he was not against carbon budgets and that he would like to see them in
due course, although not just now. However, we are ambitious; we think
that the time is now and that we should be doing everything that we
possibly can. We had the pilot and it worked very successfully. That is
why we think it should be extended and expanded across the country. On
that basis, we are going to be ambitious and press new clauses 1 and 2

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The new clause
would be an important step towards decarbonising the UK’s energy
supply. I am taking the opportunity to propose the introduction of an
emissions performance standard for the power sector, because it is
unclear when the next chance will come. At the earliest, I understand
that the Government do not expect a new Energy Bill to be presented
before next spring and, as I have said on many previous occasions in
Committee, the urgent need to tackle climate change does not allow for
that kind of delay. By inserting the enabling powers for an EPS into
the Bill, the Committee would allow the Government to set out detailed
EPS measures in secondary legislation immediately before the outcome of
the EMR, as opposed to having to wait for at least another
year.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Before
the general election, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer promised that they would support an emissions performance
standard, but it would restrict greenhouse gas from carbon gas plants
to the level of a modern gas-powered power plant—about 300 to
400 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2 </p>per kWh. Indeed, both coalition parties
criticised the previous Government’s policies which aimed for a
standard of 600 to 700 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kWh. I was surprised
therefore to find proposals for a standard of 600 grams of
CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kWh in the recent consultation on electricity market
reform. The Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change recently
argued that, in order to be worth while, the EPS level needs to be much
higher, stating that the Government<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“should either
abandon its half-baked Emissions Performance Standard proposals or
replace them with a much tighter option, with a long-term trajectory
for tightening the standard progressively over time.”<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000508">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <div class="columnNumber">

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">It is extremely
important, if we are to minimise greenhouse gas emissions from fossil
fuel power generation, to place a strong emissions performance standard
at the centre of the Government’s proposals for reforming and
decarbonising the UK’s electricity market. That is why I want an
EPS of 300 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kWh to apply to all new and
modified power plants of over 50 MW within 12 months of the
Energy Bill being enacted. The WWF, the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, Greenpeace, Christian Aid and Friends of the Earth
all support this approach, which would prevent the building of unabated
coal-fired power stations while ensuring that new gas plants would
require heat recovery, and hence a more strategic and appropriate
siting closer to demand centres.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s EPS proposals are much too weak, and will have
limited impact in producing the decarbonised electricity market that
they should be aiming for. Many observers have described them as being
merely a backstop. For example, I am greatly concerned that the
Government’s proposed EPS levels fail to ensure that the maximum
power will be extracted from each unit of coal and gas through the
inclusion of combined heat and power in all fossil fuel energy plants.
A stronger EPS, as set out in the new clause, should form
part of a formal decarbonisation objective for the power sector by
2030. Such an objective would help to provide a clear sense of
direction for the electricity market framework and ensure that the
framework as a whole is focused on delivering a low-carbon power sector
during the next 20 years or so. It would also ensure that investments
are directed towards the lowest carbon forms of electricity generation
by providing regulatory
certainty.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">5
pm<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000528">&#160;</a>
               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Experts
in the field have made it clear that an EPS is the only mechanism that
can guarantee that only the least carbon-intensive forms of electricity
generation will be allowed to be built in the UK. Without the EPS that
I propose in the new clause, there is a risk that the UK will be locked
into the use of highly carbon-intensive forms of electricity. The
standards proposed under the Government’s electricity market
reform mean that carbon capture and storage will need to be fitted only
to a limited amount of capacity in a new coal-fired power station,
which means both that new coal plants could still be built with a
significant amount of unabated emissions, and that gas plants will
continue to be built completely unabated for the foreseeable
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
contrast, a strong EPS would require the retrofitting of CCS technology
on existing unabated coal and gas plants by a particular date, thus
sending a clear and early signal to stimulate the CCS supply chain in
the UK. Given that coal plants have an operational life of up to 40
years or more, and that gas plants have an expected operational life of
25 years or more, it is clear that a strong EPS is needed if policy is
to remain consistent with the decarbonisation trajectory called for by
the Committee on Climate Change in the fourth carbon
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
addition, introducing a tight EPS structured to deliver a substantial
decarbonisation of the power sector by 2030 would send a strong signal
to the international community about the UK’s unequivocal
commitment 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 434<a class="bkMark" name="Column434">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to tapping its own emissions of greenhouse gases. If it does not
introduce a co-mechanism such as a tight EPS, the UK would miss the
opportunity of substantially reinforcing its negotiating influence at
international climate talks. While there would, of course, be some
costs related to introducing a strong EPS, the Government’s own
impact assessment of their electricity market reform proposals suggests
that there would also be significant savings. For example, even under a
weaker EPS, the UK power sector would have to buy fewer European Union
emissions trading scheme allowances, saving about
£11.8 billion, and the running costs per power
plant—fuel, for example—could be about £7.7
million lower. There would also be air quality benefits, which some
have estimated at between £500 million and £1
billion.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, by failing sufficiently to limit the emissions allowed from
electricity generation, the Government risk not only locking the UK
into carbon-intensive energy generation for the foreseeable future, but
dangerously limiting the attractiveness of low and dearer carbon power
alternatives.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000264">&#160;</a>

the new clause, it sets out not only a firm direction of travel in
decarbonisation, but the specifics through a detailed EPS right here,
right now under the Bill. The hon. Lady has explained eloquently why
she considers that that is not only rational, but appropriate. I wish
to explain why we need to apply a little caution right here, right now,
and that is related to recent
history.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government were wrong to rush ahead of their wider EMR reforms by
announcing the carbon floor price in the Budget. Carbon floor prices
are usually a signal, but that announcement did several things in a
“cart before horse” way. It put the Treasury clearly in
control of an agenda that should be driven by DECC through the
Government and assisted by the Treasury, not the other way round. The
carbon floor price has now set the context in which all other measures
will be framed and judged by industry and others, including the fear of
duplication of measures and the overloading of certain industry sectors
with unnecessary costs and complexity; and, of course, as has often
been remarked, the windfall that this has created for both the nuclear
industry and the existing renewables industry.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the latter
point, the Government still have the opportunity to rescue the windfall
in such tight, stringent financial times—of which we keep being
reminded—and target it effectively, if they want to, at
energy-efficiency and demand reduction in energy-intensive industries.
That is why I want to add a word of caution about adding another item
outside the whole package in one go. We have done it wrong already, and
we now need to bring forward a package as an entity.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We firmly
believe that the Government should have presented the elements of the
EMR together as a package, under the leadership of DECC. The Minister
should have explained the interrelationships between the elements and
how he will balance the different measures; it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 435<a class="bkMark" name="Column435">&#160;</a>
                  </div>should not be done in a piecemeal fashion. We would apply the same logic
to the EPS, the detail of which would best be dealt with together with
the whole of the EMR, albeit with the proviso that
one of the most significant elements has already
been laid out. I suspect that the summer and autumn will be a time for
lively debate and for fashioning consensus out of areas of agreement
and disagreement, including the calibration of the EPS and other
measures in the
EMR.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000268">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clause does not, as described in the very good and detailed
supporting brief from Greenpeace and others, constitute what is termed
an enabling clause that would allow the detail to be thrashed out
later; it puts forward a detailed, prescriptive and precise level for
the EPS that, far from enabling, is disabling of any further debate in
the light of other mechanisms in the EMR. If it were an enabling
clause, we might see more potential in supporting it to produce the
fine detail, but we will go into the autumn with the 40 or 50 other
pieces of secondary legislation in the Bill and the EMR, so we will be
busy.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000269">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
agree with the principle of an EPS—it is important to put that
clearly on the record—and the spirit of the new clause that,
with other measures, will ensure that the setting of the EPS drives us
with real determination towards a low-carbon future. We do not believe
that the Bill is the right place to repeat the lesson of the carbon
floor price and to glue another piece of the jigsaw immovably in place,
separate from the other pieces, so that we can unstick them only by
returning to primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is worth restating that Labour members of the Committee support an EPS.
We will have the opportunity to introduce real detail into the package
when the next energy Bill is brought forward. The detail in the new
clause may be appropriate in that context, and I recognise the
coalescence around the precise positions set out in the new clause of
the many organisations cited by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion,
including Friends of the Earth, WWF, the RSPB, Greenpeace and Christian
Aid. However, that needs to be done in context and not set out in
another measure on its
own.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
we recognise the need, in the transition to a low-carbon future, for
carbon sources—including gas, hopefully with CCS, at the
earliest opportunity, as we discussed in a previous debate—the
new clause gives us the opportunity to ask the Minister how he will
avoid the UK being drawn inadvertently into a high-carbon electricity
system by default. Month by month and year by year, he will come under
increasing pressure to consent to more and more higher-performing but
traditional unabated gas power stations before the EMR is fully in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
monitoring is the Minister doing of the growth in megawatt capacity of
consents both now, and of what he can see coming down the line? Will he
be willing to decline consents if, as was mentioned by the hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion, there is a fear of being locked into a
high-carbon future and he determines that there is a risk of that
happening? If so, at what point will that take place? What forecast of
the expansion of new gas generation does he anticipate, and has he
assessed whether that forecast is still compatible with the transition
to a low-carbon
future?<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister will know, we recognise that we need gas as part of the
transition to where we should go. But the question is: how far and how
fast should that be, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 436<a class="bkMark" name="Column436">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and how do we avoid getting locked inadvertently
into what might be a high-carbon future, simply because of the pressure
or because other things do not happen in time—be they CCS,
nuclear, grid connectivity, the round 3
renewables take-off or any of those “what if?” scenarios?
At what point will he say that we cannot rush headlong down the road of
unabated gas or, for that matter,
coal?<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the actual limit was not set in the new clause, could the Minister
accept it as a true enabling clause, thus allowing the levels to be
debated in full and set in secondary legislation, or is it his
intention to set the fine detail in the next energy Bill? If the
former, he could bring forward a wider enabling clause on Report. If
the latter, could he indicate his thinking on the appropriate
calibration, and whether the levels described in the detailed provision
are completely out of line, or broadly in line, with a scenario he can
envisage?<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000275">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a pleasure  to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Crausby, in  our final session. The Government
have made clear  their absolute commitment to introduce an
emissions performance standard, and to set it in law. We were the first
party to commit to an emissions performance standard. We have consulted
on the measure, further demonstrating that commitment. We propose that
the emissions performance standard should act as a regulatory backstop
regarding the amount of carbon that new fossil-fuel power stations are
allowed to emit, ensuring that new coal provides the UK with security
of supply consistent with our carbon targets.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The EPS should
also provide regulatory certainty. It must not deter the investment in
capacity we need over the coming years to keep the lights on, and it
should support our ambitious plans on carbon capture and storage, which
has yet to be demonstrated at commercial scale. Set at the right level,
an emissions performance standard can be a real driver for new
investment, but if set at the wrong level it will stifle the investment
we need to
see.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000277">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Member for Ogmore has said, this should also be seen as one of
a range of measures. It needs to be seen alongside the other measures
in the market reform package. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the carbon
floor price, which is a tax measure, so it is right that the Treasury
lead on that matter. That measure starts in 2013, and it is important
to give longer-term clarity ahead of other measures starting in about
2017. It was right for the Treasury to set that out, in order to give
industry clear confidence at an early stage. That is why the two
aspects have been separated. On all other measures within the
electricity market reform process, the Department of Energy and Climate
Change is clearly leading and developing
policies.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000278">&#160;</a>

needs to be taken then, will he consider advocating that the Treasury
ensure that, in these stringent times and as a general principle, we
target any windfall? It was described as a measure to incentivise new
low carbon, not to reward existing low carbon. Will he argue to the
Treasury that we should find a way to identify the amount of windfall,
and to target that at the energy-intensive industries with which he is
in discussion as a result of that measure?<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000279">&#160;</a>

to tax anything he sees moving. We do not share
that view. We believe it is right to try to give investors confidence.
One reason for the time scale we have set is that it gives clarity. Had
we said that we would introduce the measure in 2017, with an election
coming along in 2015, people would have said, “Well, we will
have to wait and see. We cannot make commercial decisions based on what
one Government say they expect their successors to

               <p class="tabbed">By introducing
the measure in 2013, we have given a much greater degree of investor
confidence. Alongside that, we recognise that there are other
consequences on high-energy users. That is why we are working with the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Treasury to
ensure we address those concerns. Having seen the effect in Germany, we
would not be tempted down the path of simply putting a windfall tax on
the renewable or nuclear
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000281">&#160;</a>

to the renewables industry—that he expects it to pay extra taxes

the technologies it wishes to see developed. We take a different view.

               <p class="tabbed">The
issue we must deal with is the need for a significant amount of new
investment in our electricity system. The words “barefaced
cheek” came to mind when I listened to the Opposition spokesman,
because we are trying to make up for an incredible lack of investment
in our energy infrastructure over a long period. Over the course of
this decade, we have to secure twice as much investment as we secured
in the last decade—when the last
Government were in power—every single year in order
to give us energy security and keep the lights on.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000284">&#160;</a>

incredible challenge. Had we not been almost at the bottom of the
European league table for renewables—above just Malta and
Luxembourg—and if we had had more investment in renewables, that
challenge would not have been so big. Had we not had the five-year
moratorium on nuclear under the hon. Gentleman’s Government, we
would have been five years further forward on new low-carbon nuclear
technology. The investment that is necessary was knocked back because
of decisions that were made, and that gives us a much greater mountain

Gentleman and his party said was not necessary when they were in

at all the areas of uncertainty to give clarity. Because of the
urgency—we are losing a third of our coal plant in the next five
years and much of the rest by the end of the decade, and we are losing
all of our nuclear except for Sizewell B by 2023—we must do much
more to bring forward investment. Nuclear will take, at best, 10 years;
the development of offshore wind will happen towards the end of this
decade; the development of carbon capture and storage on a commercial
scale will take to the end of this decade and into the 2020s; the
development of renewable technologies like wave and tidal will come in
the 2020s. We have a looming energy gap towards the end of this decade,
for which the Labour Government were directly responsible, so we are
going to need new investment in gas to give this country the energy
security it needs. Gas needs to be a more important part in the mix,
and we recognised in our “Pathways to 2050” that the role

the coal industry went into decline and the problems of security of
supply. Our coal supply became unreliable at the same time as gas
became more greatly available; the combination of those two factors

the carbon support price are designed to encourage people to invest in
low-carbon technologies and give a clear signal to investors. It is
against that background that the proposal for emissions performance
standards within our market reform proposals should be considered. The
EPS should support our commitment to decarbonisation and also provide
sufficient certainty to make the UK an attractive place in which to
invest.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We need new
gas plant to be built as we make the transition to a low-carbon
electricity system, so we must ensure that investors have sufficient
confidence and certainty to build these plants. That is one of the
reasons why we consulted on levels equivalent to 450 grams
per kWh and 600 grams per kWh, which are above the emissions of a new
gas plant. Those two very different perspectives were offered so that
industry could let its views be known on which it thought would stifle
or stimulate investment, and to ensure that we heard from the
environmental groups about their concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Introducing an
emissions performance standard now at 300 grams per kWh would require
plant to take measures that could prove to be both impractical and
uneconomic, and would be likely to make investment in gas unattractive;
that in turn would be detrimental to the security of the UK’s
electricity supply. The Government are already taking action on
measures such as efficiency in generation and the use of biogas. It
would also be a hammer blow to the long-term viability of the British
coal industry, which the hon. Member for Wansbeck raised this morning
and which the hon. Member for Blaydon mentioned just now. Any sense
that coal was being taken off the agenda for the future would make it
much more difficult to sustain the viability of the pits that have

expected of them in the future and so that there can be no doubt about
the long-term environment. That will need to be tied in with our wider

Gentleman asked whether we believe that this is a subject for enabling

legislation in due course, because I think that investors want the
clarity of knowing that it has been enshrined in primary legislation.
The sense that it is an enabling power, which in the run-up to every
election there is pressure on ministers to tighten through a statutory
instrument, does not give investors the secure investment scenario they
need. The right way to go is to be as definite as we can be in primary
legislation, but the approach the hon. Lady has set out is too tight.

follow his reasoning for opposing the amendment. I do not see the
negative implications of agreeing an EPS now—on the contrary, I
see many advantages. The key advantage is precisely the investor
confidence that the Minister says he supports. I am very glad that he
supports investor confidence. The Government have not demonstrated that
strongly in the energy field—we need only to look at the FITs
review to see that. If the Government do now care about investor
confidence that is a very good thing. Setting an ambitious EPS now
would send a clear message to investors that we are serious about this
agenda, and it would help to shape the decisions being made now about
the kind of energy mix that we will have in this country. I am glad to
hear the Minister re-emphasise his commitment to an EPS in

accept that there are some difficult questions to be answered. What the
strict EPS would do is send the message that there is no role in this
country for unabated coal. That is a bottom line if we are serious
about climate change. We need then to work with the miners and others
to make sure that there is transition and support for them into more
sustainable industries, but the idea that in the 21st century we are

new clauses make modest changes to the Bill—so modest that they
hardly dare point their shrinking little fingers at the last time the
building regulations were substantially revised to take account of
changes in how boilers might be installed in UK households. The change
to part L of the building regulations, which was undertaken on the
watch of a Minister whose name escapes me for now, was quite
revolutionary in the difference that a modest change could make to
carbon containment over a period of time. The change was that if people
were considering installing new boilers in their properties, they
should normally install condensing rather than traditional boilers.
Yes, the change in regulation shaped and directed, to an extent, in
that it backed a particular technology, but within a few years the
result of its implementation was that condensing boilers rose from 15%
of installations in UK properties to 85%. Each boiler saved 1.5 tonnes
of CO<p class="Sub">2</p>-equivalent compared 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 443<a class="bkMark" name="Column443">&#160;</a>
                  </div>with its forebears. With 1.5 million boilers sold every year, this has
been the single most effective measure for saving CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
emissions ever passed in this House. That change alone saves some 0.4%
of UK annual emissions per
year.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000315">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">After
many years of, I think it fair to say, some false dawns in the
development of microgeneration combined heat and power boilers for
domestic installation, we could develop a mass market for such boilers.
The change in emissions that would result from the installation of
large numbers of such boilers—which heat the home, work
efficiently and, with the conditions I mentioned, collect and recycle
flue gases and produce electricity as a result—would be of a
descending order similar to when part L was introduced in the early
2000s. There is a strong case for examining whether similar
arrangements ought to be undertaken, so that such technologies could
become widespread in UK homes, achieving a second generation of
substantial carbon savings to follow what condensing boilers did only a
little while
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000316">&#160;</a>

any such changes would need to be written carefully, as with the
previous changes in building regulations, and for that reason the new
clauses do not actually propose a change. They propose an examination
of the change required and of how the new forms of boilers would work
in conjunction with flue gas heat recovery devices to make the savings
I have described. These are modest new clauses with enormous
implications for a low-carbon domestic energy economy. I trust that the
Minister will therefore jump with alacrity at the idea that they should
be

Gentleman’s sentiments. New clause 49, which I have tabled,
differs from new clauses 19 and 20, in that it seeks to make the most
of the end of the Warm Front programme as a way of kick-starting the
use of passive flue gas heat recovery systems, so that the scale of
production can be ramped up and the costs reduced. I understand that
leading manufacturers have said that mass production of these systems
could slash retail costs from the current £600 to as little as
£100. When independent test results suggest an annual saving on
household fuel bills of £80 a year, it is easy to see why the
Minister said recently that it should be one of the products in the
green deal, if it meets robust consumer and certification
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000318">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Even
as Warm Front is being wound down, it will still install many thousands
of new boilers over the next two years. The sooner these devices are
fitted, the greater the benefits will be, both in terms of cutting the
cost and from the perspective of reducing emissions. The recovery
systems could also save water because they speed up the delivery of
warm water to the hot tap, thereby reducing the amount of time that
cold water is pushed through the pipes before the hot water starts to
come
through.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000319">&#160;</a>

have one final point regarding the inclusion of specific technologies
through energy efficiency programmes. I was contacted recently by the
Gas Safety Trust, which is concerned that, as homes become more
energy-efficient, they will lose a certain amount of their natural
ventilation. That could increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning,
so the trust is calling for the mandatory inclusion of carbon monoxide
alarms in all green deal packages. Given that the average cost of an

clauses 19 and 20 would be modest amendments, as my hon.

                  </strong> New clauses 19 and 20 concern two technologies
that, although in their infancy, have genuine potential to play a large
role in driving efficient heating in the future. The
technologies—micro-combined heat and power, and passive flue gas
heat recovery systems—are different in application but have some
things in common. Both have very low penetration of the market at
present, low consumer awareness and, like many new technologies, can be
rather costly. More than three years ago, I was renovating my house and
putting in various green innovations, and I hoped to install a
micro-CHP boiler. The technology, however, has not really come to
fruition; it has been on the cusp of happening not for months but
years, and we need to drive it
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
agree with the hon. Member for Southampton, Test and I share his
frustration. We should do what we can to tackle the situation, and I
fully empathise with the motives behind the new clauses. I should also
make it clear that we already recognise the technologies in some of our
support measures. Micro-CHP is supported under the feed-in tariff, and
passive flue gas heat recovery systems
technology—PFGHRS—could help its own cause enormously if
it got a snappier name. We do not need to put that in the Bill, but I
am sure it would be extremely
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000324">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Micro-CHP
is a new technology to the market, and domestic CHP units are the only
non-renewable technology currently supported under the feed-in tariff
as part of a pilot scheme. Many of us hoped that with the increase in
biogas in the grid and the use of other low-carbon alternatives to
ordinary gas, CHP could play a much more important role, not only as a
low-carbon technology but ultimately as a zero-carbon one. The
inclusion of the units in the pilot will be assessed as part of a
comprehensive review that will consider all aspects of the scheme,
including tariff levels, administration and eligibility of
technologies.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000325">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The industry
tells us that there are probably fewer than 1,000 micro-CHP units
installed in the whole country—that is
obviously why I did not get mine. That is in stark contrast to the 20
million gas boilers. I set those figures out not to be discouraging but
to explain the scale of the challenge we

               <p class="tabbed">Tomorrow,
the Department of Energy and Climate Change will publish its
long-awaited microgeneration strategy. It focuses on tackling
non-financial barriers  to microgeneration—such as
skills, technology, and information and advice—in the context of
the financial incentives that we are putting in place: the
feed-in  tariff, the renewable heat incentive and, of course,
the green deal. The strategy has commensurate ambition behind
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000327">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise that domestic heating requirements vary widely from situation
to situation, and that a range of technologies will be needed to meet
each situation in the most cost-effective manner. At present, I fear
that it would be wrong to mandate the use of a particular technology if
an alternative could deliver the same carbon savings more
cost-effectively. We will, however, continue to monitor technological
innovation across all technologies, including, among others, micro-CHP,
passive flue gas heat recovery systems, heat pumps and solar. There is
potential particularly for the first two of those systems, and we will
genuinely keep them under
review.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000328">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
share the desire expressed by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test to
see micro-CHP and PFGHRS develop alongside the other more mainstream
technologies, but for that to happen effectively we need to establish
the long-term potential of the growth of the technologies in the
market. As such, I propose to discuss new clause 19 further with
Members and invite them to talk about it with my officials. I intend to
come back on Report with further details on how we will progress those
two technologies, and on the course of action we propose in order to
deliver that enhanced level of

wish to say a few words about the important point that the hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion made about carbon monoxide, because cases
involving it can be a matter of life and death. Considerable work has
already been done, following a commitment made by my noble Friend Lord
Marland in the other place. I have met the all-party gas safety group
and a range of stakeholders to discuss their concerns in detail, and I
am grateful for their help and expertise in assisting my officials and
me in this matter. My officials then met industry stakeholders to think
through potential solutions. As a result, we have decided to make clear
requirements in the new green deal installer standards, which we are
developing with the British standards institute. I have informed the
group of my decision.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000331">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We think it
unlikely that the green deal will affect carbon monoxide levels
negatively; indeed, it will promote new boilers, which overall will
help to reduce carbon 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>monoxide emissions. Automatically fitting a carbon monoxide monitor to
every building as necessary could add to the overall costs of a green
deal package and could hinder the golden rule. Instead, we suggest
requiring green deal installers to assess the carbon monoxide impact of
their work—that will not be discretionary—and fit a
monitor where deemed appropriate. They will also be obliged to check
any existing monitors to ensure that they work adequately and have not
passed their use-by date. In addition, the energy company obligation
will be covered by the same
standard.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000332">&#160;</a>

details. I take on board fully the sense of direction, purpose, drive
and ambition that the hon. Member for Southampton, Test seeks to inject
into the technology agenda of micro-CHP and flue gas, and I assure him

Indeed, it was the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate
Change, the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, who, no doubt, has
those quotes written out on little bits of paper in his wallet. He is
absolutely right. That is increasingly an area that we need to analyse
in greater depth not only because it is right in principle, but because
of the projections we have in front of us on energy generation and
energy capacity.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have just
discussed what we will need in new forms of energy generation over the
next few years. The overarching national policy statement refers to the
fact that a doubling, or even a tripling, of generation will be
required by 2050. To my mind, that figure is very much based on the
idea that energy efficiency only has a certain way to go as a component
in the drive to decarbonise and produce far lower emission outcomes
from our general energy economy.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000347">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
contrary, the European Climate Foundation reported a short time ago
that if we combine reduction in demand and measures such as the
electrification of heating, around 90% of emissions from buildings can
be removed. Indeed, just a little while ago, I saw the passive house
concept in Germany, which effectively produces a minus zero-carbon home
through various energy efficiency measures. There is an enormous way to
go on that side of the equation for carbon emission
reductions.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The new clause
would essentially close the gap in the analysis of the relative merits
of different strategies on low-carbon energy. No long-term assessment
of the costs and benefits of energy saving compared with energy
efficiency have ever been carried out by the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 448<a class="bkMark" name="Column448">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Government. Although we are dealing with the sorts of figures and
potential savings that I have suggested, we do not know—and
there is no prospect in the near future—that we will know that
information. The new clause would ensure that such an assessment is
produced as a tool, which would rank alongside various other measures
that have been introduced on carbon budgets things to regulate the
overall approach that we subsequently take on energy. It would produce
a fairly clear pointer to the hierarchy of measures that should be
taken over the next period in energy saving and carbon
reduction.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is what the new clause would require the Secretary of State to do
within 12 months of the Bill being enacted. That would be of enormous
benefit to the in information in his statements and the overall
direction of future energy policy. Of course, he could in theory take
such an approach without legislation, and perhaps that would be a good
idea. However, it would be an even better idea to have the provision on
the statute book, because he could point to a reason why he has to do
it when responding to voices suggesting that it should be put off for
other purposes. That is the purpose of the new clause. I hope that if
it is not accepted by the Government, the intent behind it can be
agreed and that measures can be undertaken that give us a much better
handle on the distinction between energy saving and energy generation
and how that affects our pathways analysis and all the other things
that go towards our
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000350">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">During
the Lords’ consideration of the Bill, Baroness Maddock moved a
similar amendment on 19 January, requiring a crucial cost-benefit
assessment to be carried out. Replying on behalf of the Government,
Baroness Northover said that impact assessments of individual policies
were sufficient. We think that that is not entirely accurate, because
assessing the impact of individual policies is very different from
properly quantifying the full potential of further energy-saving
policies and then deciding on the level of energy demand that needs to
be satisfied. We therefore have a situation where the full potential of
the cheapest and cleanest method of achieving our energy policy
objectives has never been fully explored.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000352">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
measure that supports the new clause is early-day motion 644, which was
tabled with cross-party support and calls for a cost-benefit assessment
of energy demand. It now boasts more than 101 signatories, and on that
basis we support the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000353">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have a huge degree of sympathy with the spirit
behind the new clause, although not quite as much as my father. He has
been inventing and developing energy-efficient products for the past
20 years. In response to the recent spike in energy prices,
he wrote in frustration to <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>
                  <em> </em>to ask why
everyone 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 449<a class="bkMark" name="Column449">&#160;</a>
                  </div>always ignores energy efficiency. Unfortunately, they did not publish
his letter. He then wrote again, asking why they ignored him, but he is
yet to have a reply.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000354">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is a fact
of life that energy efficiency is almost explicitly overlooked, because
people rush to what are seen to be more technological but, invariably,
capital-intensive solutions to the challenges we face. It is absolutely
true that we need to do far more to drive forward energy
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000355">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion said earlier in proceedings, the green
deal is not the whole solution. We need to go further. In the
electricity market reform proposals, which we will publish soon, and
which will be taken forward in a further energy Bill, we will be
dealing directly with further ways that we can incentivise whole market
and whole economy approaches to energy efficiency and look at how we
can come at energy efficiency from the opposite direction to the green
deal. The green deal is a way of scaling up from the ground. In the
EMR, we will be looking at how we can take large-scale responses and
come the other way, as an alternative response to concerns about
capacity—alternative to building new generating

we get to that legislation, I can assure hon. Members that we are
already engaged with energy efficiency in the Department. The new
ministerial team has pushed energy efficiency up the policy agenda. We
will publish a report this autumn, which will provide an update on the
progress towards meeting the first three carbon budgets and looking at
the delivery of the fourth carbon budget. An essential part of that
report will be the ambition and progress of our energy efficiency
policies. The report will provide the type of whole-economy assessment
that the new clause seeks to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000357">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
costs of particular technologies are assessed through extensive
consultation with stakeholders. We are upping our level of engagement,
and therefore another aim of the new clause is already being delivered
and does not need legislative underpinning. We will be formally
consulting on the green deal in the autumn, and I reassure the hon.
Member for Southampton, Test that we are having extensive discussions
outside the formal consultation process with the organisations to which
the new clause refers. We have set up two green deal stakeholder forums
specifically looking at the costs and benefits of a range of
energy-efficiency measures and trying to quantify them with far greater
accuracy. They are also exploring the options for promoting the
appropriate sequencing of

               <p class="tabbed">I
will try to be brief, as we do not have that much longer. The intention
of new clause 22 is to make it mandatory for all commercial buildings
over a certain size to have display energy certificates. It is a simple
enabling clause, giving the Secretary of State the power to initiate
the roll-out of display energy certificates to the commercial sector.
It would require all the relevant details of the phasing of the
roll-out and so on to be dealt with in secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000365">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
motivation for the new clause is simple. If one does not know how much
energy one is using, it is hard to know how to manage it. We have no
idea how buildings up and down the country are performing, so mandatory
A to G ratings are the crucial first step in helping businesses
understand how to reduce their energy use. Display energy certificates
are currently mandatory for public sector buildings of more than 1,000
square metres, but they are not compulsory in the commercial sector. It
is worth pointing out that non-domestic buildings currently account for
up to 17% of the UK’s carbon emissions. The carbon plan
published in March this year already includes a commitment to extend
display energy certificates to commercial buildings by October 2012,
but to fulfil that commitment the Bill must be used to introduce the
necessary enabling legislation, which would simply give the Secretary
of State the power to extend display energy certificates through
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate and understand the concern about the risk of costs and

                  </div>commercial sector, but if display energy
certificates increase energy efficiency measures—there is
mounting evidence that that is the case—the commercial sector
will inevitably be making savings on their energy costs. I am pleased
to say that the new clause has had the full support of, among others,
the UK Green Building Council, the British Property Federation, the
Association for the Conservation of Energy and, according to an e-mail
I received a few minutes ago, even the CBI. From my endless discussions
with the Minister, I know that he is also supportive of the principle
behind the provision, and I very much hope he will support it. I look

I was pleased to see, as the hon. Member for Richmond Park has said,
that there has been so much support from businesses and elsewhere for
the proposal. An open letter was sent to the Prime Minister, the Deputy
Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
from the British Property Federation, the chief executive of Siemens,
Marks and Spencer and others. Those are leaders of the private
businesses that would be affected by the legislation. They stated that
they were absolutely delighted when the Government’s carbon plan
committed to extend the display energy certificates to commercial
buildings by October 2012. That is absolutely right. Given that
non-domestic buildings are responsible for up to 17% of the UK’s
carbon emissions, the anomaly whereby display energy certificates are
currently mandatory for public buildings of more than 1,000 square
metres, but not mandatory for private-sector ones, is hard to
justify.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000368">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
people may feel that a voluntary approach is more appropriate, but I
think it is interesting to look at the terms in which private property
owners and the business leaders who signed the open letter speak. They
state
that<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000369">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“a
voluntary approach to take up in the private sector will not work,
because without that level playing field there is a reputational risk
for those businesses that voluntarily adopt certification and achieve
poor

do not believe this will provide an undue burden on businesses of any
size, as evidence demonstrates that savings resulting from the
application of this scheme significantly outweigh any costs, from year
one. Indeed, DECs for small businesses could be automated and even

bills.”<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000513">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Since the 2002 energy performance of buildings
directive was introduced into UK law in 2007, there has been clear
evidence that display energy certificates have driven substantial
year-on-year improvements in energy ratings and reductions in energy
costs in the public sector. This has happened because they are a strong
reputational driver to improve energy performance and because of the
financial incentive that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 452<a class="bkMark" name="Column452">&#160;</a>
                  </div>comes from lower energy bills. We have heard about the breadth of
support for such measures not just from green
groups but from business, and I was delighted to hear that the CBI has
come out in support of this too.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000373">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The energy
savings and carbon reductions that could result are huge. Non-domestic
buildings account for 17% of UK carbon emissions. In its report,
“Building the Future Today”, the Carbon Trust reported
that the carbon footprint of the country’s 1.8 million
non-domestic buildings could be reduced by 35% by 2020 compared with
2005 levels, with a net benefit of £4 billion to
£5 billion delivered to the UK economy through energy
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000374">&#160;</a>

are supportive of the measure because we believe it feeds into the
wider debate about carbon reporting for business, something for which

it would be a big surprise if they did not support the measures

                  </strong> I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for
Richmond Park for driving the issue on to the agenda. It will be an
important step forward in the energy efficiency of our public
buildings, and I am indeed sympathetic to the proposal. Display energy
certificates show how efficiently a building is being used, its actual
energy use, its carbon emissions and its operational ratings. As the
hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion said, they are currently required in
large buildings of more than 1,000 square meters that are occupied by a
public authority or frequently visited by the public. The new clause
seeks powers to enable regulations to extend the requirement for DECs
to commercial
buildings.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000376">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise that DECs provide a very valuable tool to enable building
occupiers to save money in carbon. In addition, they create a
reputational incentive for action by businesses, because they broadcast
the energy efficiency rating and energy usage of their buildings not
only to their own employees, or the inhabitants of their buildings, but
to customers and wider stakeholders. The certificates provide a
consistent and robust way of collecting data on the energy use of
buildings. If they are aligned with other policies, they have the
potential to reduce the regulatory burden on business.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000377">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I, too, have
been impressed by the strong appetite for extending DECs in the
commercial sector from a wide range of industry leaders representing a
large proportion of the sector, including, as has been said, the
British Property Federation, British Land, Land Securities, Hammerson,
Siemens, and Marks and Spencer. As a result of that, we have put in a
lot of effort behind the scenes to take the thrust of my hon.
Friend’s proposal on board. The wheels of Government have been
turning. There is certainly strong support for the proposal in my
Department, but we must get the drafting right and go through various
clearances. We are making good progress with that process. I had hoped

                  </strong> This new clause seeks to introduce a reporting
requirement on the role of the
green investment bank within the green deal. Our position on the
financing of the green deal remains that it is primarily a commercial
matter, and that companies wishing to deliver the green deal should
seek finance from commercial sources. We are not saying that blindly or
just from a position of hope, but as a result of strong, detailed and
proactive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, particularly
finance and investing institutions in the City, and large corporates
with balance sheets that can take such
financing.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000448">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
we are aware of the arguments that the GIB could help to catalyse the
provision of finance, so we are not blind to the potential role that it
could play, however short-term and limited. The nature of that role is
by no means clear, and neither is the need for it. There is a view that
the green investment bank may be required a little later in the process
when the debt is securitised from hundreds of thousands of householders
and some liquidity is needed in the early stages of the new bond
market. Those are all vague
hypotheses.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000449">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are getting strong signals from our detailed engagement with
institutions that there is significant commercial appetite at
competitive interest rates for green deal financing. We will, however,
continue to engage both with companies seeking to be green deal
providers and with the finance community to further define whether
there could be, in either the short term or the longer term, a need for
green investment bank
involvement.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000450">&#160;</a>

are open to discussions on the potential role of the green investment
bank. It would not be helpful at this stage, however, to be forced into
an artificial time scale, six months or otherwise, for making such a
determination. Such a reporting requirement could in turn complicate
the Government’s discussions with financing institutions. On
that basis, we will not be supporting the new

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Members for Liverpool, Wavertree and for Ogmore have tabled new
clauses 44 and 45, which would ensure that oil pollution emergency
plans are made available for public consultation and comment and would
oblige companies registered in the UK to demonstrate that their
offshore activities outside UK waters meet the same standards as those
in UK waters. I welcome the amendments as an important step forward,
and I particularly value the requirement to allow public access to oil
spill plans. When it comes to oil and gas drilling in extremely
environmentally sensitive areas such as the Arctic, however, I do not
think any risk can be countenanced. Such habitats are simply too
important to risk polluting them with a spill of any
size.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000461">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Oil
and gas exploration in the Arctic has gathered pace in recent years.
Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Cairn Energy have secured drilling licences
for the area, and Cairn Energy has already started drilling.
Campaigners and experts believe that Cairn is unprepared for a spill
from a rig in the Arctic. Cairn’s current response plans assume
that the company will be able to drill a relief well in 37 days in the
event of a problem, but the Norwegian authorities say that it will take
around 50 days in the less remote and less extreme Barents
sea.<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000462">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Once
the winter sea ice sets in and starts to thicken, all drilling becomes
impossible in the Arctic. There are real fears, therefore, that oil
from a blowout on a rig in the Arctic will reach the sea ice and become
trapped underneath it for an extended period. Even as we speak,
Greenpeace activists have been taking huge personal risks to block this
reckless exploitation of an irreplaceable environment by boarding a
Cairn rig to prevent it from drilling. On Friday, Greenpeace’s
international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, was arrested by the
Greenland Government as he boarded Cairn’s Leif Eriksson rig in
the Arctic to hand the operators a 50,000-name petition demanding that
they release their plans for responding to potential oil spills. Naidoo
eloquently
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000463">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“For
me this is one of the defining environmental battles of our age,
it’s a fight for sanity against the madness of a mindset that
sees the melting of the Arctic sea ice as a good thing. As the ice
retreats the oil companies want to send the rigs in and drill for the
fossil fuels that got us into this mess in the first place. We have to
stop them. It goes right to the
heart”—<a class="bkMark" name="1106221000515">&#160;</a>

being a little premature earlier on, but I did want to place on record
my appreciation—and also that of my colleagues—for your
chairmanship and that of Mr Leigh, as well as for the considerable work
and effort of your Clerks and my superb officials. We should not to
forget the Doorkeepers, who have looked after us so well, and the

we have been

broad thrust of the Bill. I thank the Opposition for the way in which
they have, by and large, engaged constructively in our proceedings. We
have not been overburdened by experience of the ways of Committee
proceedings, but nevertheless we have managed to navigate our way
through, and I look forward to
