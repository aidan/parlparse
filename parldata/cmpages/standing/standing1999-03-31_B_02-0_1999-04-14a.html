<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be  made.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): We are greatly  privileged that you are presiding over our proceedings this  morning, Mr. Benton. I apologise in advance for a  discourtesy that I might commit this morning. My private  Member's Bill will enter Committee at 11.30 am, and I shall feel obliged to leave in good time to prepare for  that. I apologise if I leave before our proceedings are  completed, but I am sure that that will be a relief to some  members of the Committee.  
<P>
When we drew stumps at the previous sitting, I had  spoken to amendment No. 24, and I propose to summarise  in only two or three sentences what I tried to argue then.  My argument was that claimants under the land  compensation code are entitled to have their reasonable  professional advisers fees paid for them by the acquiring  authority, and that that should apply to mink farmers as  well. I expressed the hope and I do so again that the  hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle) will   accept the logic of that. Her Bill will create a unique  situation for a specialist form of farming, so it is essential  that those concerned have access to good quality  professional advice when negotiating their compensation  claims.  
<P>
I was mid-way through my argument for amendment  No. 25 when the Committee adjourned. It is an irrefutable  fact that since 1973, claimants for compensation under  the land compensation code have been entitled to request  advance payments on account of 90 per cent. of the agreed  compensation, or this is more usual of the acquiring  authority's initial estimate of their entitlement. The reason  for that is self-evident. It can take months sometimes  years before a final settlement is reached in a  compensation case. That is why there is provision under  the land compensation code for an advance down payment  of the stated proportion. The argument for that is that it  is reasonable for people entitled to compensation to be  enabled to reorganise their affairs for example, by  setting up another business by receiving up front a  substantial proportion of the compensation due to them.     
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for Garston to address that  argument. Surely it is only fair and reasonable that  provision for advance down payment under the land  compensation code should be matched by the  compensation scheme to be set up under the Bill.  Moreover, if the hon. Lady and the Government want  mink farmers to go earlier rather than later, the  mechanism that I propose would enable that. My  amendment would simply extend to fur farming the same  compensation rights that exist for land compensation, and  it would be unfair and unreasonable to reject it.  
<P>
Amendment No. 26 would add a new paragraph  between subsections (2) and (3). The argument for it is  straightforward and uncomplicated, but that does not  diminish its strength. I call this a natural justice  amendment, and I hope that the Committee will agree  with that assessment.  
<P>
It is self-evident that, until a claimant receives the  compensation award that he has negotiated, he cannot put  that award to use. He cannot invest it or earn interest from  it. The amendment would make provision for the  calculation of the interest that the final settlement would  have accrued between the day that the recipient became  entitled to it and the day that he eventually received it.  The recipient of the compensation would receive that sum  in addition to the final settlement.  
<P>
The precedent is well established. Claimants under the  compulsory purchase code are entitled to claim interest on  their outstanding compensation. My argument is simple:  the same arrangement should apply to fur farmers who  are put out of business by the Bill. I can see no reason  why that should not be the case. If the hon. Member for  Garston and the Minister disagree and reject the  amendment, I will be interested to learn how they justify  treating some victims of compulsory purchase differently  from others. I speculate that they will find that a difficult  position to justify.  
<P>
Amendment No. 27, the last in the group, would insert  another new paragraph between subsections (2) and (3).  Another unique feature of the Bill, and one of the unique  developments that will arise from it, relates to the capital   investment in mink farming. No professional opinion has  been given that mink farms' specialised buildings and  equipment can be converted to any other type of farming  or business use; they will become useless. Amendment  No. 27 would address that fact.     
<P>
If fur farming is banned, the land on which fur farming  is practised will have to be cleared. The estimated costs  of clearing land to bring it back to green-field site status  that I have received are £98,000 for a 6,000-female farm,  and £52,000 for a 3,000-female farm. Those are  substantial sums. However, land clearing must happen  before the land can be put to any other farming or  business use.  
<P>
Amendment No. 27 is another natural justice  amendment. It would ensure that the costs of clearance  were recognised in the compensation schemes. It would  be wholly unreasonable if that were not so. I hope that  the hon. Member for Garston will incorporate that  provision in the Bill and so ensure that the costs of  clearance become claimable under the compensation  scheme.  
<P>
To summarise, amendment No. 24 would allow the  inclusion of the reasonable fees of professional advisers  in the compensation award, as is the case under the land  compensation code. Amendment No. 25 would entitle the  recipient of compensation to payment on account of a  proportion of the acquiring authority's initial estimate  within three months. Again, such entitlement applies  under the land compensation code. Amendment No. 26  would entitle the recipient to compound interest on the  compensation award, as is the case under the compulsory  purchase code. Amendment No. 27 would ensure that the  compensation award includes the cost of land clearance. I commend the amendments to the Committee.  
<P>
<B>Maria Eagle </B>(Liverpool, Garston): I join the hon.  Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) in welcoming you  to the Chair, Mr. Benton. The Committee was well  controlled and guided by the hon. Member for Rayleigh  (Dr. Clark) in its first sitting, and I am certain that it will  be so this morning as well.     
<P>
I shall make a small number of points about the  amendments, but I shall leave answers to substantive  questions about the Government's thinking to my hon.  Friend the Minister, for which I hope the hon. Member  for Basingstoke will forgive me. The clause is intended to  set out provisions for compensation. It is not for me to  lay down the precise details, but to establish a fair  compensation scheme for people whose livelihoods will  be lost.  
<P>
All the amendments draw analogies with the removal  of land from private individuals, and the hon. Member  for Basingstoke spoke of compulsory purchase and land  compensation. The difference is that the Bill removes the  livelihoods of affected farmers, but does not take their  land from them. Therefore, the analogy with land  compensation and the various provisions in respect of it  is not as close as the hon. Gentleman suggested  redundancy is a closer analogy.  
<P>
I did not intend to set out in the Bill details of  compensation and the way in which it should be paid; that  is properly left to the Government, who will make the   payments. It is for me to try to ensure that the scheme is  fair, but not to attempt to settle its specific detail in the  Bill. That is why the clause sets out a general procedure  but does not go into the detail proposed in the  amendments.  
<P>
I shall make further points in the clause stand part  debate. I wanted only to tell the hon. Member for  Basingstoke that I do not accept his analogy between the  removal of people's land and the effects of the Bill. The  owners of land will still be its owners after the Bill is  enacted and farms have been closed.  
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of  Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley):</B>  I, too, welcome you the Chair, Mr. Benton.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Garston made her point  about land very well, and it should be emphasised. As she  said, the detail of the compensation is a matter for the  Government. As a Government, we have accepted the  implications of the clause, which makes compensation  available to fur farmers. The compensation will be  necessary only after the Bill has passed all its stages; the  Government can then deal with the detail.     
<P>
I can, however, give the hon. Member for Basingstoke  some reassurances. The Government consider that most  of his points are not unreasonable In respect of  amendment No. 24, we are prepared to consider  professional fees when setting up the compensation  scheme. We accept that fur farmers will need to be  advised, and it is not unreasonable to consider the costs  involved. However, the amendment is technically  deficient: although it restricts fees payable to "reasonable  fees"	, it does not appear to limit the number of  professional advisers that fur farmers can retain. I do not  think that the hon. Member for Basingstoke intends that  armies of legal advisers should be engaged to give advice.  However, we are quite prepared to consider the principle  of legal advice.  
<P>
Amendment No. 25 provides for an interim payment of  compensation. Again, we are not against the principle of  the hon. Gentleman's argument. If there were a  long-running wrangle about the level of payments, we  would have no objection to an interim payment.  Incidentally, if such a case went to the Lands Tribunal, it  may determine an interim payment. We would have no  problems with that.  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
However, the figure of 90 per cent. is rather high,  particularly in the case of a disputed sum. It is difficult to  accept the principle of paying 90 per cent. of a disputed  sum, and I do not think that we could accept an  amendment to that effect. If there were a discussion on  the compensation award, we would have no objection in  principle to an interim payment. We are certainly prepared  to consider the issue.       
<P>
On amendment No. 26, we are not against the principle  of interest if there is an unreasonably long delay in settling  a claim. Obviously, such a provision would need a clear  start date for interest payments, and the amendment does  not cover that. Again, if the matter went to the Lands   Tribunal, it might want to make a declaration on it as part  of its proceedings. As a general principle, however, we  are prepared to consider whether interest should be paid  in the case of unreasonably long delays.  
<P>
Amendment No. 27 deals with compensation for the  cost of clearing land. We do not dispute that putting a site  back into use or making it available for alternative use  may have to involve the demolition of some of the  buildings and fixtures. I can give the hon. Member for  Basingstoke an assurance that, as a general principle, we  are prepared to consider the costs of demolition in relation  to a claim.  
<P>
I should, however, make it clear that the hon.  Gentleman underestimated the possibility that some  buildings could be put to alternative business use. In that  respect, it would not be unreasonable for us to consider  claims on their individual merits. Individual fur farmers  would need to demonstrate that the costs of demolition  were absolutely essential to reclaiming the site. They  would also have to demonstrate that they had properly  considered whether there was an appropriate alternative  use for the buildings or fixtures on the site. That is not  unreasonable, and we would have to be persuaded that  those issues had been considered. If the case were made  that demolition was absolutely necessary, we would,  again, be prepared to consider the implications of that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am greatly encouraged by the tone of  the Minister's reply. I appreciate that there can be a world  of difference between considering something and  committing oneself to it. The Minister talked in terms of  consideration, and I welcome that move. I accept the  sincerity with which he made his case.  
<P>
On the four amendments, the Minister expressed the  opinion that amendment No. 24 was technically deficient.  I thought that the wording "reasonable fees"	 covered  matters, but the Minister objected and I may be mistaken.  There may be circumstances in which 90 per cent. could  be too high a figure for compensation in advance or, as a  down payment. I agree that there could be a wide  variation between the initial authority's estimate and the  mink farmer's expectations.  
<P>
I am pleased that the Minister is not against the  principle of compound interest nor could he be because  it is already established in law.  
<P>
On ground clearance, I appreciate that the odd lesser  building might not have to be cleared. I do not see that  anyone would object to individual on-site decisions being  made in that respect.     
<P>
In the light of what the Minister has said, we can  probably return to the themes of the amendments at a later  stage, and more dialogue can take place before that point  is reached. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page  3, line 37, leave out from `referred' to end of line 42  and insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to the arbitration of such person as may be agreed between the  person and the appropriate authority, or in default of agreement, to  an arbitrator nominated by the President of the Royal Institution of  Chartered Surveyors.'.   <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 5 gives the appropriate authority, as defined in  clause 6, power by order to make scheme for paying  compensation to persons who incur losses as a result of  discontinuing fur farming because of the coming into  force of the prohibition in clause 1.  
<P>
Subsection (3) covers disputes about a person's  entitlement under a compensation scheme or the amounts  of compensation. Such disputes are to be referred to the  Lands Tribunal. I have received a considerable amount of  advice and comment about this, as I have on other aspects  of the Bill. The stipulation that disputes are to be referred  to the Lands Tribunal has caused genuine concern, which  I shall explain.  
<P>
The Lands Tribunal is notorious for being exceedingly  slow in reaching decisions on disputes. It is also  exceedingly expensive in terms of professional fees.  However, those criticisms are nothing compared with the condemning findings of the recent Government- commissioned City university report on compulsory  purchase. I do not know if the Minister is familiar with  that report. It found that the Lands Tribunal I quote from  paragraph 5.72   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is not acting as an effective forum for settling compensation  disputes, especially for owners"<P>
</UL></FONT>	.     
<P>
Paragraph 5.74 states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Few of the professionals involved in the process have first hand  experience...Furthermore, experience levels are much lower for  those advising owners than among acquiring authority valuers"<P>
</UL></FONT>	.  
<P>
Paragraph 5.75 states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Owners who are not satisfied with the compensation they are  offered decide against challenging it formally because of the cost"	.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 5.76 states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The cost of taking a case to the Lands Tribunal is high...As a  result, the Lands Tribunal is not accessible as a forum for resolving  disputes and so is not fulfilling its role"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
None of that makes encouraging reading, to say the least.  
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Garston would  agree that justice needs to be done fairly, at a reasonable  cost and in a reasonable time frame. As amendment No.  28 suggests, the better solution would be for disputes to  be dealt with by arbitration. If the claimant and the  authority could not agree on the arbitrator, it should be  appointed by the president of the Royal Institution of  Chartered Surveyors. The RICS is the professional body  with the best expertise on valuation of land and business  for compensation purposes. I hope that the hon. Lady will  consider the amendment with a fair and open mind.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I wonder whether I may deal with this  matter, as it is an issue that the Government will have to  address if the Bill progresses successfully.     
<P>
As a general principle, when it comes to arbitration, a  formal judicial procedure is better than an informal one,  although informal arbitration is used quite extensively for  agricultural mattes. Although I think that there are  advantages in using a body such as the Lands Tribunal, I do not have particularly strong views about the matter.  There is an argument to be considered, and I approach it  with an open mind. If there are strong feelings about this  aspect of the Bill, we are prepared to listen to the  arguments and give further consideration to the matter.   However, I should like some time to reflect on this and  to engage the opinion of people who will be affected by  the procedures that will be available to them.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Garston has, quite  rightly, included in the Bill a provision for an appeal,  should the offers of compensation be thought inadequate.  From the Government's point of view, some form of  appeal procedure is important: the question is, what is the  best and most appropriate form?  
<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> My intention in framing the Bill in this  way was to ensure that there was an independent appeal  procedure in respect of the compensation clause that  would be able to resolve irreconcilable differences  between the Government and the farmers affected. I thought it important to make that a judicial appeal, not  because I used to be lawyer in my spare time, but because  there are certain rights under European legislation and the  European Court in respect of taking people's livelihoods  away from them which allow appeals to Europe if here  has not been a proper judicial procedure. I was seeking to  cover that element.     
<P>
My intention is certainly not to increase litigation, nor  to require mink farmers to go through European judicial  procedures in order to feel that they have got a fair deal.  I was seeking to deal with both those issues by including  an independent appeals procedure in the Bill.  
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Minister, I am perfectly happy  to listen to alternative proposals. However, I am worried  that the appeal proposed in amendment No. 28 is not  really a judicial appeal. If farmers are still dissatisfied at  the end of the arbitration process, it is open to them to  engage in judicial appeals. The amendment leaves the  Government open to further appeals beyond those  provided in the Bill. That would cause me some concern,  although, as a former lawyer, I understand the criticisms  that the hon. Member for Basingstoke makes of the Lands  Tribunal. No judicial process is cheap, and very few are  quick. I understand his point, but I fear that the  amendment could lead to longer delays and further  proceedings by having the arbitration process first and all  kinds of judicial procedures thereafter.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Both the hon. Member for Garston and  the Minister have said quite sufficient for me not to wish  to force the issue at this time. I am prepared to concede  that perhaps the amendment did not fully cover the  judicial appeal aspect. On the other hand, I think that the  concern about the Lands Tribunal is valid. So I suggest  that we adjourn the debate on the amendment, and  reconsider the issues for debate at a later stage. Therefore,  I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  
<P>
Amendments made: 4, in page 3, line 38, leave out  `Minister' and insert `authority'."	  
<P>
5, in page 3, line 44, after `which' insert  
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand  part of the Bill.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> It is stating the obvious to say that if the  Bill were successfully to reach the statute book, clause 5  would be extremely important to the dozen or so mink  farming businesses because it deals with compensation. It  is therefore a matter of concern that clause 5 does not  throw adequate light on the nature of the compensation  scheme that the Government may be contemplating. I acknowledge what the hon. Member for Garston said:  she is setting up the procedure, and it is for the  Government to implement [Interruption.] Is the  Minister commenting from a sedentary position?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I apologise; I was muttering rather than  intervening. It is difficult to set out in the Bill a  compensation scheme to deal with each individual case.  It is better to give the general principles; the detailed  provision can then be resolved once the Bill becomes law.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall come to that in a moment and  argue that we do not know sufficient of the principles to  judge the issue. It is more than a matter of concern that  the details of such a vital part of the Bill remain shrouded  in mystery at this stage. It is an unsatisfactory state of  affairs.  
<P>
On the other hand, what we do know about the  compensation scheme from clause 5 gives rise to equal  concern. If I understand the Bill correctly no doubt  I shall be put right if I do not it seems that the schemes  will be discretionary. Clause 5 does not oblige the  Minister to introduce them. The amendments to the clause  tabled by the hon. Member for Garston suggest that it  would be possible for there to be separate and different  schemes or no schemes at all in different parts of  Great Britain.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> indicated assent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The Minister confirms that.  
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister suggested that  compensation was a matter of detail which could be addressed after the Bill had become law and, if  I understood him correctly, he made the same point  today. That possibility, combined with the fact that  compensation will be discretionary, is being received with  the utmost cynicism in some quarters. That is not  surprising. It is feared that all the talk about compensation  could be a gigantic confidence trick.  
<P>
There is another dimension. How can Parliament be  expected to form a proper judgment on the Bill before the  details are clearly known and available? We want to know  the mechanism whereby a very small number of people  will be compensated. How can those few hon. Members  with fur farms in their constituencies possibly support the  Bill until we have an unequivocal assurance that all mink  farmers will be compensated and the details of the  compensation scheme are known? The fact that mink  farmers are few in number is immaterial; the principle is  absolute and binding. Their livelihoods will be destroyed  and they must receive fair compensation.   
<P>
I hope that the Minister may be able to assure that  Committee that he will publish a detailed statement  regarding a draft compensation scheme well before  Report, so that the Bill can be properly judged. Several  hon. Members are under the impression that they should  already have received information from the Minister about  the compensation schemes, but I am told that that  information has not yet materialised.  
<P>
What advice has the Minster taken about the details of  the compensation scheme? Has he, for example,  considered the principles that apply to the compulsory  acquisition of land and businesses, some of which I have  just referred to? Unless mink farmers can see that they  will be treated fairly, there will be no incentive for them  to wind up their businesses on an early time scale, which  is presumably what the Bill's supporters want.  
<P>
I think that I have made the essential points. It is  extremely difficult to approve a Bill that does not contain  sufficient detail on which to judge the value and validity  of the compensation scheme. That is the dilemma that we  face. I hope that the Minister may be able to say more  on that.     
<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> The clause gives the appropriate  authority power by order to make a scheme for paying  compensation to persons who are affected and incur losses  as a result of the discontinuation of their businesses.  Subsection (3) provides for an appeals procedure,  whereby the Minister will be required to refer any dispute  over entitlement to payments under the scheme to the  Lands Tribunal and an appropriate judicial authority. Any  order made under the clause by statutory instrument will  be subject to the negative resolution procedure.  
<P>
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for  Basingstoke's advocacy for compensation. His view is  clearly that a precise, detailed scheme should be written  into the Bill, or, if not, that assurances in that regard  should be given in great detail before the Bill is passed.  I have some sympathy with him, but his view is not  shared by many of his right hon. and hon. Friends who  spoke on Second Reading. The right hon. and learned  Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) and  the hon. Members for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) and for  North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) all said that prohibition with  compensation was not the appropriate way in which to  deal with the relevant animal welfare issues. On Second  Reading, at column 1354, it was argued that animal  welfare standards should be increased to an acceptable  level although some of us doubt that that is possible. If  farmers were driven out of business as a result, the hon.  Member for Teignbridge said that that would be "Tough"	,  and the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and  North Hykeham said that it would be "Hard cheese."	     
<P>
Opposition Members who spoke against the Bill on  Second Reading were of the opinion that paying  compensation was not the appropriate way in which to deal  with the matter; their view was that we should simply  increase animal welfare standards, and that if farmers could  not meet those economic requirements, that would be  tough they should go out of business with no  compensation.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Hunter:</B> I think that the hon. Lady has missed a  central point. On Second Reading, the House accepted the  principles of the Bill. Compensation is allowed for in the  Bill. We are now debating the Bill in Committee, and I am  arguing for the best possible compensation deal. Regardless  of whether I initially preferred that option, the House has  decided. I am arguing that, having accepted the principles  of the Bill, we must now ensure that it is as good as it can be.  
<P>
<B>Maria Eagle:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that  last point. The Bill received an unopposed Second  Reading although many of the hon. Gentleman's right  hon. and hon. Friends spoke against its principles, they did  not press it to a Division. It is indeed important that the Bill  is as good as it can be.  
<P>
As I have said several times, my view on compensation  is that the scheme in the BiIl must be sufficiently flexible to  deal with the requirements and circumstances of remaining  fur farmers. We would not do the House any favours if we  were to pass a Bill with extremely detailed provisions that  proved too inflexible to deal with individual circumstances.  
<P>
Although it is true that under subsection (1) the  Minsiter's power now the authority's power to make a  compensation scheme by order is by definition  discretionary, I should be most surprised if anyone  seriously suggested that the Government would give  assurances about paying compensation and then, once the  Bill was enacted, say, "Oh, it was all a joke. Actually we  will not make any such provisions."	 Technically, the power  is discretionary, but no one should doubt that as fair a  scheme as possible will be proposed I leave my hon.  Friend the Minister to make any further comments that he  wants about that.     
<P>
Concerning compensation for capital equipment, the  hon. Member for Basingstoke suggested that there was no  other use for equipment used on mink farms. We know  of one farmer in Scotland who switched to strawberry  production when he left the mink industry. He found that  the waist-high benches in the mink sheds were ideal for  grow-bags. They were at a convenient height to grow  strawberries, which one could even pick without ending  up with backache. It is not absolutely true that there is no  other use for the equipment. Farmers need to apply a little  lateral thinking and imagination.  
<P>
I hope that clause 5 will stand part of the Bill, because  it is an essential part of it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): The hon. Member for  Basingstoke repeated the suggestion, which was no doubt  put to him by those in the industry who have concerns,  that the compensation scheme in clause 5 might not be  introduced. He described it no doubt using words that  were relayed to him as potentially a confidence trick.  That is a serious allegation and must be answered fully.  For my part, I believe in the Government's good faith in  this matter. I have no doubt that the Minister will  introduce a compensation scheme along the lines that are  set out in clause 5.  
<P>
As an allegation has been made, however, it would be  helpful if the Minsiter gave an undertaking that a  compensation scheme will be introduced. Of course, for  the reasons that have been given, it would be impossible   to give details now. It is, however, possible to give an  undertaking to introduce a compensation scheme. I see no  reason why the Government cannot do that, and I ask the  Minister to give such a guarantee this morning.     
<P>
This may be a standard parliamentary way of dealing  with matters, but why does the first line of subsection (1)  say "may"	 rather than "will"	? No doubt the Minister will  have a good answer. If he can clear up that point, we can  knock it on the head.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I am happy to put on record an assurance  that the Government have accepted the principle of  compensation. We also support the Bill, which includes  the relevant compensation clause. It follows, therefore,  that we will have to honour that commitment. We have  dealt with some of the details of compensation. I have  given the hon. Member for Basingstoke some  reassurances about what we regard as reasonable and what  we are prepared to consider. I will certainly be willing to  reflect on other points that the hon. Gentleman made on  how compensation will work.  
<P>
On the wording of the Bill, it is true that compensation  is discretionary. Compensation will not automatically be  paid as a result of this legislation: there is an element of  discretion. Legislation has sometimes had a detrimental  effect on businesses, but no compensation has followed.  There were several cases of that under the previous  Administration. It is, however, important to proceed with  the Bill. There is widespread support for it. We recognise  that there are implications for those involved in the fur  trade. We have, therefore, accepted the principle that there  should be reasonable compensation. That is the  Government's position.

<B>  Maria Eagle:</B> The clause simply defines the  appropriate authority in the Bill for the purposes of  authorising a person to exercise the power of entry and of  making compensation scheme. For England, that will be  the Minister; for Scotland and Wales, it will be the  Secretary of State in due course, for Wales, it will be  the Assembly. As regards introducing such a scheme in  Wales, there are at present no fur farms in Wales.

As the Bill takes away the livelihoods of a small  number of people, it is important for it to specify a date  on which it will come into force. The clause provides for  prohibition and powers of forfeiture and entry to take  effect on 1 January 2002. The purpose of the delay is to  give farmers still in the fur farming industry an  opportunity to adjust their affairs and to wind down their  businesses in advance, should they wish to do so. The  power to make a compensation scheme will come into  force two months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.  That provision enables the Minister and fur farmers to get  on with dealing with the compensation issue well in  advance of the date on which the Bill will take effect. I hope that the clause provides maximum flexibility for  farmers to move out of the industry as soon as they wish  and not to have to wait until the date on which fur farming  is formally banned.
