Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 442, in page 65, line 10, after "area", insert "either within or".--[Mr. Ottaway.]
<P>
<H5>4.30pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments: No. 443, in page 65, line 17, leave out from "been" to "Parliament" in line 18 and insert "approved by".
<P>
No. 445, in page 65, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4) No direction by the Secretary of State shall come into force if it is rejected by a resolution of the Assembly.".<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): The opportunity is rarely given to a Member of Parliament both to say farewell to one Chairman of the Committee and to welcome another back. I know that 1 speak on behalf of the Committee in welcoming your return, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
When Mr. Winterton closed the proceedings at lunch time, I was saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) had referred to the White Paper, and that he and the Minister had had a discussion about the photographs in it, which related to triumphs of Conservative achievement before the last election. There was some debate about where credit should lie. The Conservative party follows the ancient Chinese proverb that there is no limit to what one can achieve in the world, if one does not mind who takes the credit. The Government operate on the basis that any credit lying around should be picked up and grabbed as soon as possible, so I am not surprised that those photographs appear in the White Paper.
<P>
I am a little pessimistic as to whether the Government will accede to our request in amendment No. 445, because there is a long tradition in this country of the centre resisting the outlying areas. I can never remember how many Cornishmen wished, should Trelawny die, to know the reason why.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> Twenty thousand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I tried to remember-was it 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000? I am delighted to have it confirmed that it was 20,000. I can also reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, who has just come in, that I am still speaking, so he has returned to the Committee in time.
<P>
I am not optimistic that the Government will respond to the suggestion that the assembly should be able to veto the actions of the Secretary of State. I differed most from those on the Conservative Front Bench over their concern about the phrasing that prompted amendment No. 442. My view was that the phrasing of the Bill was a triumph for the opposition, and that we had convinced the Government that the Secretary of State should not constantly interfere in London matters. I thought that the Government were therefore taking the view, perhaps not wholly sensibly, that if the mayor's policies were detrimental to London, London should be left to stew in its own juice and that should not be a matter for anyone else.
<P>
My concern that the Secretary of state will have powers over transport strategy--for example, those referred to in subsection 1(a) of clause 124--has been prompted by London First. That body has drawn our attention to the fact that the Secretary of State does not, to the best of its knowledge, have such powers in other passenger transport authorities. Although it was the reference to "outside Greater London" that prompted my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to table amendment No. 442, I believe that it is sensible to ask the Minister what circumstances detrimental to areas outside Greater London would prompt the Secretary of State to act. It would be a matter of concern to Londoners if minor confusions, complications or conflicts outside London were to interrupt what was happening in London. That matter was raised by other members of the Committee before lunch, and I therefore trust that the Minister will respond to it.
<P>
I think that I have adequately brought the Committee back into the swing of the afternoon's proceedings and I will pause now after those few remarks.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I add my voice to welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. O'Hara. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) joined the hon. Member for Croydon, South in attempting to convince the Committee that the photographs that appeared in the White Paper on integrated transport were nothing more than a paean to the previous Administration's policies in that area. As always, the right hon. Gentleman introduced an oblique note into his contribution by touching on a Chinese proverb that dealt with credit being picked up--and I paraphrase--wherever it could be found and used by whoever had discovered it.
<P>
In this instance, the Government could be justifiably accused of attempting to pick up discredit. I looked through the White Paper during the luncheon break and I could see nothing in it that highlighted the so-called achievements of the previous Administration in respect of transport. There was the disaster of rail privatisation, the disaster of bus privatisation and the channel tunnel rail link that went belly up until this Government restructured the deal.
<P>
The hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) were concerned with what the Government mean by national policy. I thought that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood understood clearly the principle that if a strategy introduced by the mayor were against the national transport strategy and had an adverse effect outside of the boundary of the Greater London authority, the Secretary of State should, quite rightly, intervene. He seemed to agree with that point, but it was clear that the hon. Member for Croydon, South neither understood it nor agreed with it.
<P>
Certainly, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) supported amendment No. 443 and then proceeded to talk about the paramount rights of Londoners in decisions that affect them. He put forward the Liberal Democrats' usual argument that the assembly should have the powers not only to veto decisions made by Londoners via their direct election of the mayor, but to veto the Secretary of State's decisions in those matters.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) joined me in opposing the amendments and introduced to the Committee his heartfelt memories of the previous Administration's approach to the Greater London council and to improving public transport.
<P>
By far the greatest concern was expressed about amendment No. 443. Perhaps I can set the mind of the hon. Member for Croydon, South at rest. When we debated clause 33, we tabled an amendment to clarify what the Government meant by national policy. With his agreement, we will take away amendment No. 443, and table a similar amendment to clarify what is meant by a national transport policy. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the other amendments because the clause already gives the Secretary of State the power to require the mayor to amend the transport strategy in certain limited circumstances. The Secretary of State will be able to use the power, as I have said, only where the mayor's strategy would be inconsistent with national transport policy and would have an adverse effect outside greater London.
<P>
Amendment No. 442 would considerably increase the number of cases in which the Secretary of State could intervene by allowing him or her to consider the effects of the strategy in London. I am surprised--I am sorry that I am so continually surprised in this Committee--that the hon. Gentleman seeks to increase the powers of the Secretary of State in the matter, given his other contributions to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I may have missed a relevant point and if that is the case I shall, as usual, be the subject of collective mockery in the Committee; but who is to be the judge of adverse effects on areas that surround London but which are not part of London? The matter is susceptible to subjective treatment, whether it relates to Oxfordshire county council, Hertfordshire county council, or any other. Who will be umpire on a cry of foul from a neighbouring county that says "London's plans are bad for us"?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As I have said before, the Secretary of State will decide such matters. In essence, it is the power of Parliament that we are discussing.
<P>
The clause sets a deliberately high hurdle that must be crossed before the Secretary of State can act, which means that the mayor will be able to develop initiatives unique to London without any interference. However, there could be circumstances in which it would be sensible for the Secretary of State to have a say in the mayor's transport strategy. That point was made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster in a direct question to me about what strategy the mayor could propose that would impact against the national transport policy and have an adverse effect outside London.
<P>
We have made it clear that we wish, for example, to see more freight moved by river, waterway and short sea coastal shipping. It would be highly unlikely--but not beyond the bounds of reason--that any mayor with the duty set out in the Bill would turn his face away from utilising the River Thames for purposes that could make a vital contribution to London.
<P>
Such a measure would impact against national policy and would have adverse effects outside London. For example, not using the resource that is the River Thames in the movement of waste would replicate the decision made not long ago by Westminster council to move waste by road through contiguous boroughs rather than by river. Such decisions could have effects far outside the boundaries of the Greater London authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway (Croydon, South):</B> I invite the Minister to stop playing party political games and concentrate on the amendment, which relates to a sensible inquiry into inconsistencies within Greater London. How will the Secretary of State deal with inconsistencies within London? The situation outside London is clear, but what is the position inside it?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I will be prepared to stop playing any kind of games if the hon. Member for Croydon, South guarantees to cease being patronising. I have made it abundantly clear to him that we will take amendment No. 443 away--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendment No. 442.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My understanding is that it is amendment No. 443. We will take it away, consider it in detail, and return to it to clarify what we mean by a "national transport policy". We have made it clear that the Secretary of State will be able to intervene with regard to a mayoral strategy only if that strategy is inconsistent with a national transport policy and has an adverse effect outside Greater London.
<P>
I have already touched on the points raised by the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) as to who would mediate if, as in his example, Oxfordshire county council deemed that a policy was having an adverse effect on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> There is no problem with amendment No. 443, and I am pleased that the Minister will take it away and consider it. On amendment No. 442, how will the system operate if there is an inconsistency within London? Will she explain what the mechanism will be?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Within the Greater London authority boundary, the decisions will be for the mayor. They will be part of the mayoral strategy. The decision of the people of London with regard to a directly elected mayor will not be subject to veto.
<P>
I repeat that I find it odd that the hon. Member for Croydon, South argues for greater powers for the Secretary of State when he has argued strongly in our debate that the Secretary of State has too many powers. It is another example of a certain schizophrenia on his part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Give me a break.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks that we give him a break. I am prepared to do so if the hon. Gentleman will reciprocate by withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood):</B> As I understand it, the Secretary of State can intervene if, in his or her judgment, an inconsistency
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is detrimental to any area outside Greater London."
<P>
To take the example of Biggin Hill, the mayor could decide to go ahead with development of the airport. If that was detrimental to transport interests outside London--perhaps a mile away--it would be cause for intervention by the Secretary of State. The same would not be true for the residents of absolutely contiguous areas. They may suffer most from the inconsistency, so there is a non sequitur.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Regrettably, the hon. Gentleman has forgotten the exchange that we had during our deliberations this morning, when he was concerned specifically about Northolt. I told him about the mayor's spatial development plan, which will have to deal with the whole issue of planning. In that context, local authorities will also have powers with regard to planning. The mayor will have to take into consideration issues such as the environment and possible environmental pollution--not just pollution of our air, but noise pollution. The hon. Gentleman himself raised the issue of overcrowding. We have also made it abundantly clear with regard to airports that surface access is a primary consideration. The mayor would not, therefore, want to impinge in the areas that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That would impact grievously on many of the issues for which he will take direct responsibility in his strategy. Those include not only transport, but the environment and sustainable economic development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> I have just one question, which the Minister justifiably prompted and which concerns an inquiry. The Minister referred to last year's Westminster waste decision, which the people and representatives of Southwark thought entirely unsatisfactory because it unhelpfully resulted in traffic on the roads of Lambeth rather than on the river. I have not followed the arguments through, but could the mayor and the assembly trigger a power--perhaps at the prompting of Southwark--that would result in Westminster's decision being overruled by a Londonwide decision? The way in which waste is transported from Westminster to outer London is a Londonwide issue.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman must be aware that, as I have said, environmental strategies are part and parcel of the mayor's considerations. The way in which London disposes of its waste will be central to those. The hon. Gentleman referred to a borough strategy in a vitally important area impacting on surrounding boroughs and on areas far outside the GLA's boundaries. In that case, the mayor's decision will clearly be the decider.
<P>
We are, however, considering the somewhat schizophrenic approach of the hon. Member for Croydon, South. He argued for greater powers for the Secretary of State in amendment No. 442. Previously, he argued that the Secretary of State had too many powers in the Bill. We are also seeking to clarify when and under what circumstances the Secretary of State can intervene with regard to the mayor's strategy for transport.
<P>
I have made it clear that there will need to be two prongs before the Secretary of State can intervene. The mayoral strategy will have to be inconsistent with national transport policy and to have an adverse effect outside the GLA boundary. I have also assured the Committee that we will examine amendment No. 443 because we should give more detail about what we mean by a national transport strategy. We will then return to the Committee with the amendment for further consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I waited until the Minister had finished replying to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). I also want to make a plea. It is the normal practice in Committees for the Opposition to provoke the Government to make speeches. The Minister has now raised the subject of the Westminster waste disposal facility at Gatliffe Road on three or four occasions. I have behaved impeccably in not rising to the bait. If she can promise me that we will have a set-piece debate on the issue later, I will continue not to rise to the bait. My behaviour is an attempt to enable the Committee to make progress.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I must admit that I am not quite clear whether the right hon. Gentleman has offered me an agreement or a challenge. I am sure that he will afford me the opportunity to consider the issue and return to it. Now, for the third time, I ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South if he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister asked me to withdraw amendment No. 443 and said that the Government would look at the situation as it relates to clause 33 and come back to it on Report. We did not like the alternative proposal for clause 33, and, if I remember rightly, voted against the Government's alternative amendment. However, we shall wait and see what comes up on Report and vote against it then rather than now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he cannot withdraw amendment No. 443 because it has not been moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara. I note what the Minister  says. If amendment No. 443 were the lead amendment, we would not be asking for a Division.
<P>
On amendment No. 442, the Minister said several times that I seem to be schizophrenic in promoting and increasing the powers of the Secretary of State. That is a fair point, but a far more important one is that if the Secretary is to have powers, they should be clear and transparent. Despite the Minister's explanation, the operations clause is incomprehensible. As one should oppose something only when one understands it, there is not much point in opposing the amendment. We shall leave the incomprehension to others to worry and argue about in the years to come. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I beg to move amendment No. 773, in page 65, line 11, leave out "direct" and insert "request".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 775, in page 65, line 12 leave out "direction" and insert "request".
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendments seek to change the character of the clause. As it stands, the Secretary of State has the power to direct the mayor to amend his or her strategy in the light of national policy, but if the amendments were accepted, the Secretary of State could only request the mayor to amend the strategy. This is in line with the view that we have taken throughout the Committee's proceedings that clauses which give the Secretary of State further powers to direct the mayor and/or the assembly are against the best interests of Londoners, whose wishes should be properly taken into account and reflected by their democratically elected Greater London authority.
<P>
We shall seek to press the amendment to see whether the Government are willing to move a little on the power of the Secretary of State to direct. We hope to hear something encouraging, rather than discouraging.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> This is a classic Liberal Democrat amendment. I have been waiting for an amendment that encapsulated the total vacuity of some of their observations. Of course I understand the preference for politesse in this world. What about the old lady who always bowed her knee to the devil in church and explained that courtesy cost nothing and you never knew? That is a virtue to which all of us can respond. However, the second amendment proposes that if the Secretary of State makes the request, the mayor is duty bound to respond to it, and the thing becomes absolutely tautologous. The amendment would ensure that courtesy was exercised but in terms of substance, nothing would change.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> A vitriolic attack ill becomes such a right hon. Gentleman. I should have thought that he, of all people in the Committee--given pedigree, breeding, history, ancestry, culture and nature--would have understood that it is far better to make a request first and an attempt to reach an agreement without imposition, even though, given the structure of the Bill, we left the reserve power to oppose at the end of the day. I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman thinks that politesse will have so little place in the new Greater London authority.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I entirely concur with the contribution of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. Far from being vitriolic, I found it witty and pertinent.
<P>
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said--that this is a test not of the mayor's transport strategy, but of his politesse. That is not a subject in which the Secretary of State should have any interest. Do we draft laws simply to ensure that people are well bred? It seems a rather curious approach to legislation that will affect the lives of so many Londoners. What if the Secretary of State gave a categorical no to a request? How long would this exercise in politesse be allowed to run--a week, a month, a year or four years? The hon. Gentleman is merely arguing for decision taking to be deferred, which avoids, day after day, anyone ever having to make a choice. That is what Liberal Democrats invariably and inevitably do, in my experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Lady should be clear that any process under the timetable that the Government have set up has a fixed cycle.
<P>
I am surprised that she does not remember the many precedents in government--rate capping was one example, the current capping of council tax is another--by which, in effect, the Government put a proposition to local government, local government responds and an attempt to reach agreement is made. We want to allow that to happen, rather than simply giving the Secretary of State the draconian power to impose his wishes on the mayor. Consensus, where it can he arrived at, makes much more comfortable politics than imposition.
<P>
Perhaps in years to come the hon. Lady will regret that she and her colleagues did not give the Secretary of State the power to allow such an opportunity for agreement beforehand.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman's interpretation of draconian powers is interesting. I have been at pains to point out the strictures by which the Secretary of State must operate before he exercises the powers that are given to him by the Bill. However, I repeat that this is just another example of Liberal Democrat Members' desire for decisions never to be taken, either by individuals or, in some instances, by committees. I would ask the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In order to be polite--although we were sorely provoked--we will not push the amendment to a vote. However, we still take the view that the process by which the Secretary of State will be granted powers to direct should, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey rightly said, give the opportunity first for a period of consultation to enable a consensus to be achieved. Clearly, the Government are not prepared to accept that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It is incumbent on me to point out that there are requirements for the widest possible consultation before the mayor's strategy is implemented; indeed, we have already given guarantees, at the Committee's request, that we will even consider whom the mayor will be required to consult. There will be equally clear requirements to consult with the boroughs. The hon. Gentleman interprets the Bill to meet a rather narrow priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Perhaps the amendment is a means of making the same point of principle that we have pursued on similar clauses throughout the Bill's passage. We take a very different view from that of the Government in respect of granting the Secretary of State such powers. I am sure that we will return to the matter in the clause stand part debate. For now, having listened to the Minister, with some regret, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a straight forward amendment about the publicity that is to be given to a direction by the Secretary of State. The previous Conservative Government started publishing material on the internet. We suggest that the mayor adopts that practice, and we also suggest publication of a direction in two national newspapers. At the heart of the amendment is an inquiry into the nature of publication.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The amendments would require various transport documents to be publicised in specified ways. However, clause 35 requires the mayor to take steps to ensure that adequate publicity is given to each of the strategies. That includes ensuring that all strategies are available for public inspection, free of charge. Furthermore, the assembly will be able to conduct inquiries into the performance of Transport for London, with powers to summon the mayor, senior staff and board members, and has the power to request and publish papers. I have already touched on the consultative framework that the Bill establishes, by which the mayor and the boroughs must seek views on their proposals, and I have given assurances that that framework will be reviewed.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 448, 485, 486 and 491 would require the mayor to publish in at least two newspapers circulating in the entire area of Greater London, and on the internet, his or her notice of any direction given to the boroughs in respect of their local implementation plans and any directions that are given to TFL. The amendments go too far and are unnecessary. For most of the time such directions, which may be on detailed operational matters, will be of very little interest to the public. What would the public make of such announcements as, "The mayor requires borough LIPs to contain bus priority lanes maps at 1:25,000 scale" or, "Mayor requires TFL to undertake a three-year renewal cycle for yellow lines" in their evening newspaper? If the assembly considers that it is in the public interest to publish certain directions, it could request copies of the relevant documents and make them available. Furthermore, the Bill contains nothing to stop a borough or the mayor making public such a direction if they so wish.
<P>
Amendment No. 446 would enforce the same publishing requirements on the Secretary of State's interventions on the transport strategy. However, the mayor must already publish the transport strategy, including any revisions. It is not right for the Bill to specify the form in which documents should be made available. As a 21st century authority, the GLA may wish to make its documents available on the internet. It may wish to make certain key announcements in the press, or to give copies of the transport strategy free of charge. However, I do not think that we should legislate on such matters of detail, which will be best left to the mayor.
<P>
Clause 165 places a duty on the franchising director to notify the mayor about proposals to close surface railway stations or to discontinue services to them. New clause 29 would require the mayor to publish any notice that he receives from the franchising director. That is superfluous because the Failways Act 1993, which clause 165 amends, already requires the franchising director to publish closure proposals. He is also required to notify the rail regulator and the relevant rail users consultative committee, as well as the mayor, of the proposed closure and the reasons for it. Neither the regulator nor the RUCC are required to publish the notice, and there is no reason why the mayor should be required to do so. It the mayor believes it to be necessary, there is nothing in the Bill to stop him or her publishing the notice in more than one newspaper. We do not think, however, that it is necessary to require the mayor to do that. In addition to publishing a notice in a newspaper, the mayor will have to consult the list of persons in clause 158 on draft guidance, which will ensure that all those with an interest in the mayor's guidance will be well aware of its existence.
<P>
Once the guidance is published, it will be in the mayor's interest to ensure that everyone who needs access to it can have it. Publication of the guidance will be the logical conclusion of the consultation exercise.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of those remarks.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I thank the Minister for her lengthy response. At the danger of sounding patronising, I must say that I find her answer perfectly persuasive. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> When the Committee considered the first amendments selected under the clause, I said that the Opposition were not happy about the balance of the relationship between the mayor and the Secretary of State. I concede that we have withdrawn our amendments, but I am pretty sure that hon. Members will return to the clause on Report. We remain unpersuaded and dissatisfied by the concept of the clause and by the manner in which it is set out. We will therefore press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The clause, along with a number of others that litter the Bill, gives unnecessary powers to the Secretary of State. The Liberal Democrats do not want the Bill to include those powers, and we, too, will vote against the clause. We regret that the Committee has accepted none of the amendments, especially those that sought to redress the balance between the Secretary of State and the GLA. Our continuing view is that to establish a new and modern Greater London authority that is genuinely accountable to Londoners, we should remove some of the shackles that the Bill places on it--that is why we shall vote against.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I wish to set the record straight in the light of the contribution of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. I gave the assurance that the Government will examine amendment No. 443, which relates to the definition of the national transport policy, and return to the Committee with our conclusions.
<P>
The Committee has witnessed another clear demonstration of the Liberal Democrats' view of what constitutes the power of Londoners. They have consistently argued--and they did so under various amendments this afternoon--that the power of Londoners to agree to a directly elected mayor should be sidestepped. The mayor will have power to create not only integrated transport strategies but other strategies as well. They have suggested not only that that power should be sidestepped but that the Bill should be weakened and diluted by providing for an assembly that will not have the mandate from the people of London the mayor will have. They have argued many times in favour of vetoing not only the powers of the mayor but those of the House and of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South tabled some amendments that argued against the power of the Secretary of State to intervene in the mayor's actions and others that would have introduced greater powers to enable such intervention. I regret that the hon. Gentleman intends to divide the Committee. In our view, it would have been more constructive to have asked leave to withdraw the amendments and to have agreed to the clause standing part of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has pointed out in other sittings that it is the Opposition's job to probe and to examine, so I can well understand that on occasions he feels that it necessary to divide the Committee. However, I urge my colleagues to vote for the clause.
<P>

Clause 124 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 125</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duties of London borough councils etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 449, in page 65, line 31 at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"only insofar as is reasonably practicable, having regard to its functions other than transport and its policies relating to such functions".</ul></font>
<P>
The amendment relates to the duties of the London borough councils in respect of the transport strategy. When I served in the Royal Navy, there was a famous cartoon in which an admiral says to a junior admiral, "Do it.", the junior admiral turns round to a captain and says, "Do it." the captain turns round to a lieutenant commander and says, "Do it.", and it ripples all the way down to the end of the line, until the leading seaman turns to an able seaman and says, "Do it.", and the able seaman kicks the cat. Here the Secretary of State issues directions to the mayor, and the mayor issues directions down the line to the London borough councils. The whole thing ripples down, and the poor borough councils must carry the can and implement the strategy.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that boroughs had to have regard to the transport strategy
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"insofar as is reasonably practicable".</ul></font>
<P>
The subsection obliges councils to give priority to guidance issued by the mayor about the implementation of the transport strategy in exercising any of their functions--transport or otherwise. In effect, it therefore gives the mayor the right to impose detailed transport policies that interfere with other legitimate council policies, for which the council is democratically accountable to the electorate.
<P>
The integrity of the mayor's transport strategy is adequately protected by the obligation on councils to produce an implementation plan consistent with the transport strategy. How a council reconciles the needs of such a transport strategy with the many other needs and functions for which it is responsible should be a matter for the council, not the mayor.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> If the hon. Gentleman reads carefully what he is attempting to amend, he will realise that the amendment is unnecessary. In the context of the clause, "to have regard to" something has essentially the same meaning as the words that his amendment would add to the clause. Any body that is required "to have regard to" the strategy--in this case--is not absolutely bound by that strategy. In legal terms, the strategy becomes a material consideration where it is relevant. The transport strategy would be highly relevant to functions such as planning. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, but if he reads the clause carefully he will see that the amendment is unnecessary. I ask him to withdraw it.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The explanatory notes on the clause simply repeat the wording of the clause. They would be more helpful if they spelt out what the Minister has just said, which I entirely understand. The notes would have been clearer if what the Minister said had been vouchsafed to us in advance.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I thank the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for that contribution. The length of time for which he has been in the House means that sometimes he picks up and puts in writing things that other people may have not quite grasped. However, the amendment is still unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister's reply is especially helpful. Clause 124, on which we have just divided, states that the mayor "shall revise", and the distinction is now much clearer. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 125 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 126</center></H4>
<H4><center>Preparation of the plan</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) A local implementation plan shall consist of--
<P>
(a) a written statement formulating in such detail as the London borough council thinks appropriate its proposals for the implementation of the transport strategy in its area; and

<P>
(c) such diagrams, illustrations or other descriptive matter as the London borough council thinks appropriate to explain or illustrate the proposals.".<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment addresses the local implementation plans--indeed, so does the whole clause. Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, where one authority has a strategic role and another has an implementation role, local plans are required to adopt 585 586 
<P>
a format. The amendment is modelled on that aspect of the Act. I made that point earlier in a different context, and the Minister rejected it; no doubt he will reject it for the same reasons now, but it is an important point to make.
<P>
Amendment No. 452 would ensure that the public consultation undertaken with respect to the local implementation plan was no less than would otherwise have occurred if a transport plan had remained part of the unitary development plan.
<P>
The important point is made in new clause 26, which polishes off the group. It sets out, in exactly the same terms as are contained in planning legislation, the requirement for a public inquiry if objections to the plan are neither withdrawn nor accommodated. That procedure is tried and tested, and valued by the public. It acknowledges the fine balance that needs to be struck when state planning impinges on the rights of individuals. The new clause envisages that the regulations that currently apply to public inquiries into development orders should likewise apply to the transport implementation plans.
<P>
The rationale for that is that if transport is sufficiently important to warrant full community involvement, it should not be subject to the diktat and whim of the mayor, but should involve local consultation.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> The hon. Gentleman was quite open about the fact that he has mined the town and country planning legislation for precedents for the preparation of plans. In this case, he has done rather well. I hope that my response will help him.
<P>
I am afraid that I am not willing to accept the first amendment. It is highly prescriptive about the form of the local implementation plan. That would make it impossible for the mayor to set certain standards to ensure consistency between all the local plans.
<P>
There is an obvious case for such consistency. In the example of a cycle network, the information was provided in a way that ensured consistency throughout London. We believe that the mayor should have that discretion, which would not be possible If we were to accept amendment No. 451. I hope that it will be withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment No. 452 and new clause 26 seek to facilitate consultation arrangements for the preparation of local implementation plans. New clause 26 would allow a public local inquiry to be held, if that was felt to be appropriate. We have already given commitments to consider the framework for consultation. Those commitments cover those plans as well, so we are happy to take away those thoughts about consultation and will come back with further thoughts on Report, as we have undertaken to do. On that understanding, I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and appreciate his undertaking. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> At this morning's sitting I passed a note to Mr. Winterton saying that I no longer wanted to speak to several of those amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, the hon. Gentleman will not move them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Something has gone cock-eyed in my drafting. It could be interpreted from some of the amendments that I was attacking the London transport users committee, which I would not want to do--[Interruption
.] Before the Minister girds his loins, he can take it that I passed a note to Mr. Winterton this morning about the amendments relating to that Organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not know whether you will allow this, Mr. O'Hara, but it would be helpful if we knew which amendments my hon. Friend was not going to speak to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can help. The Clerk has everything at his fingertips. Those amendments are Nos. 537, 542, 579 and 597.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am much in your debt, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. O'Hara, for helping my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and me out.
<P>
The group of amendments would encourage the London boroughs to prepare their local implementation plans to consult several organisations. There are parallels yet again with what can be seen in the planning process. The Minister has generously said that he accepts that we are making a point about consultation, and that he will review it. I hope that he will be able to address the points that I raise in the amendments.
<P>
We believe that the local authorities should be consulting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"users and potential users of transport, motorists, pedestrians, cyclists and"
<P></ul></font>
--if I had thought of it when drafting amendment No. 454--equestrians, too.
<P></ul></font>
Amendment No. 455 is about business. We have had several debates about the need to consult business in the plans. Amendment No. 457 reflects and takes its words from a Labour party manifesto commitment, so I am sure that the Government will not have too much trouble with it. Amendment No. 458 concerns the impact of transport policy on neighbouring authorities. The Minister will know, for example, that in my constituency, the Government have generously agreed to build the Coulsdon A22 relief road. That is not far from the boundary of London with Surrey, so Surrey would be the first place that traffic travelling out of London would reach. Therefore something that affects the A22 will also impact on Surrey and the authority will be up and running by the time that the relief road is built.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt about roads that will be convenient for my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and I still struggle along the Western avenue to reach our constituencies. Surely we cannot be too complacent about the Government's track record on assisting motorists driving out of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend realises that, because the Minister has undertaken to build a bypass in my constituency that everyone wants, I am not going to antagonise him. However, I recognise my hon. Friend's point and suggest that he finds another colleague to pursue that argument.
<P>
Amendment No. 480, which is grouped with the lead amendment but relates to clause 128, deals with the scope of consultation and would oblige the mayor, not councils, to consult other groups as well as disabled people. Amendment No. 481 would require the mayor to consult businesses; amendment No. 482 makes the same point about transport policy that I made about local authorities; and amendment No. 483 is a reflection of the Labour party's manifesto commitment. The grouping then lists amendments to which I no longer wish to speak.
<P>
I am making a point about consultation. The Minister for London and Construction may repeat the point he made this morning by suggesting that the amendments propose a long list of people and groups to consult. How does he envisage that the mechanism for consultation with the various bodies that I have referred to in the amendments will work?

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support the general thrust of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. In particular, I will speak to amendments Nos. 384 and 410, which are briefer than those on the same subject that were tabled by my hon. Friend. I did not intend them to be in conflict with his; indeed, as I tabled mine first, the reverse might have been true.
<P>
I have the enormous benefit of the support of the Liberal Democrats for amendment No. 384. They withheld their support for amendment No. 410, which relates to clause 128. I am always minded of the moment in the story by Beatrix Potter when Pigling Bland is about to set out on his travels. His brother, Alexander, is behaving extremely badly and Beatrix Potter gives one of the great verdicts of English literature with the words "Alexander was hopelessly volatile." I have always felt that that condition encapsulates the Liberal Democrats. However, I am grateful to them for their support for amendment No. 384.
<P>
I have a suspicion that I know what the Minister will say. There is no doubt at all that, given the dialogue between the Government and the business sector in the creation of the White Paper and the Bill, there will be severe disappointment if consultation with business is not part of what finally emerges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> This is probably the largest group of amendments with which we shall deal today. There are 20 in total. I am pleased to say that four of them have already been dispatched, and I hope that I can satisfy the hon. Member for Croydon, South and ensure that we can deal with the largest number of amendments in the shortest period of time.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 453, 454, 455, 457, 458, 384, 480, 481, 410, 802, 482 and 483 all relate to consultation. They will be covered by our undertaking to revisit the issue of consultation. I hope, therefore, that they will not be pressed.
<P>
We do not intend to specify a long list of organisations that must be consulted, but we certainly intend to honour our commitment that there should be consultation with business and other interests, as part of the operation of the Greater London authority. We hope to find more felicitous wording for the duty to consult, and, as we have already undertaken to come back to that matter, I hope that the amendments will not be pressed.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South has already shot my fox by dissociating himself from amendments Nos. 537, 542, 579 and 597, which sought to do away with consultation with the London Transport Users Committee. I an delighted that he recognised in time what a retrograde step that would have been.
<P>
In amendments Nos. 538, 604, 580 and 598, the hon. Gentleman has suggested a list of other organisations to be consulted. That would not be appropriate. The Bill allows for the mayor to take a commonsense view of who else ought to be consulted. As a matter of good practice, Transport for London should consult any of the bodies mentioned in those amendments, if that body has an interest. The requirements in the amendments would make consideration of individual bus route changes and permit applications bureaucratic and time consuming. That would not be in anyone's interest, which is why we do not propose to accept the amendments.
<P>
I note the hon. Gentleman's comment about the felicitous wording of amendment. No 457, which was drawn from an impeccable source--the Labour party manifesto. However, I must point out to him that amendment No. 458--which is, I think, his handiwork--is less felicitously worded as it refers to either
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the May or the council preparing the local implementation plan".
<P></ul></font>
I do not know why the poor man has lost his "or", but we obviously cannot accept that amendment. I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman will accept our proposal to think further about consultation, and that he will withdraw amendments Nos. 538, 604, 580 and 598, as well as the four that he has already agreed not to move.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman needs only to withdraw amendment No. 453, and not to move the others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): I instinctively agree with the Minister's wish to resist lists. There is a well established argument in the House that one should always resist the temptation to put too much detail into a Bill. I have used that argument myself at times, and I still favour it.
<P>
However, a problem might arise, under the heading of our old friend the judicial review. I have in mind the circumstances in which a body or bodies might wish to challenge the failure of a mayor, some time in the future, to consult them. The mayor might then point to the statute-as it would then be-and say, "But there was no requirement laid upon me to consult you and therefore I have no need to do so."
<P>
I shall leave the question with the Minister, because I hope that when he returns to the matter, as he has kindly undertaken to do, he will endeavour to reassure the Committee that everything has been done properly to ensure that no future mayor could gratuitously fail or refuse to consult any reasonable body of opinion in London, on a matter that might affect them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. He knows that clause 34, which we have already considered, relates specifically to consultation. It is in that context that we have pledged to revisit it to ensure that it expresses clearly an obligation to consult appropriately, without imposing an unreasonable requirement to consult an inordinate list of people that can never be entirely accurate and may be bureaucratic. That is our wish, and I hope that it meets his requirement.
<P>
Clause 34 contains a clear obligation. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In preparing or revising any strategy ... the Mayor shall consult"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it is the definition of whom the mayor should consult that we have to refine. We aim to refine it in the way that I have already outlined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has given a perfectly reasonable explanation. We tabled the amendments long before we knew what line he was going to take, so I hope 591 592 <P>
that he does not feel that our approach has been a waste of time. We welcome his announcement that he will have another look at consultation, and in the circumstances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 456, in page 66 leave out lines 4 to 6.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 466, in clause 128, page 66, line 39, leave out "under section 131 below".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendments on their own look rather odd. I therefore intend to withdraw them, but I shall speak to them obliquely in the stand part debate on clause 131. For now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 459, in page 66, line 10, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) the date by which the plan will be reviewed".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 803, in clause 129, page 67, line 40, leave out "and".
<P>

No. 469, in page 67, line 42, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and
<P>
(c) shall implement the review with consultation by the prescribed date".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendments Nos. 459 and 469 are virtually self-explanatory. They would provide an important democratic control to ensure that the plan is subject to continuous review.
<P>
All sorts of timetables are set out for implementation, but we do not set out a timetable for review. That is our main beef, which is incorporated in the amendment. It ties in with subsection (3)(b), which requires a date for implementation. The amendment would add a requirement for a date for review, which seems a logical consequence of setting out a date for implementation.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As the hon. Member for Croydon, South eventually discovered, amendment No. 459 would require the boroughs to insert a review date into their local implementation plans, while amendments Nos. 803 and 469 would require the boroughs to consult and implement that review by the date included in the LIP. We have already given a firm commitment to reconsider consultation requirements and we intend to introduce amendments on the review of local implementation plans. I am therefore prepared to reflect on the hon. Gentleman's amendments. With that assurance, I trust that he will withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have now found my place. The Minister gave a perfectly satisfactory response, with which I am very pleased. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I wish to ask a question that I posed earlier in respect of the interrelationship between unitary development plans and sustainable transport plans, and their undoubted relationship to the preparation of implementation plans.
<P>
There are, for example, a number of stages in the production of a unitary development plan. First there is a draft, then there is a deposit stage and then, if necessary, an inquiry is held. Ultimately, the Secretary of State has an approval role. That lengthy procedure may focus on sections of a unitary development plan, one of which would be a transport strategy for the borough.
<P>
This is probably written down somewhere--I hope the Minister might be able to clarify the matter--but I am unclear as to how the unitary development plan process will operate alongside the implementation plans. For example, will there be a requirement for some parts of the implementation plan to be part of the UDP? Will the mayor's strategy, for instance, have to be taken into account by borough councils when drawing up their UDPs?
<P>
Similarly, in respect of the sustainable transport plans that boroughs are drawing up, there must be some linkage with the system for applying for transport supplementary grants. All these procedures have timetables that are set out. In planning for them, boroughs will have to be clear about the timetabling for implementation plans. The point is relevant to earlier amendments that related to setting times for reviews. The nature of unitary development plans and sustainable transport plans means that it will be necessary to review many of their aspects.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify how those factors fit together, both for the Committee's benefit and for that of people who will implement and act on the provisions?
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will know, the Committee will consider the planning clauses in more detail when it reaches them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a perfectly fair point about the need for a close correlation between planning and transportation. He will know that the definition of the mayor's strategies makes explicit provision for the mayor to take account of the need for consistency between different strategies. It will be necessary to take account of consistency between the special development strategy, which will provide the framework in which unitary development plans will operate, and the transport strategy, which will form the basis on which local implementation plans will proceed.
<P>
We expect local transport plans outside London to be consistent with development plans and their transport aspects, and vice versa. Those elements will need to converge over time. Inside London, the strategy behind the local implementation plans, which is determined by the mayor, will need to be consistent with the planning strategy. That is why we have provided for the mayor to ensure consistency between the strategies when developing them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will be aware that we have agreed to consider a specific new clause that relates to holding a public examination or inquiry on a local implementation plan. It is precisely because we are conscious of providing for an examination in public about the UDP that we are aware of the case for ensuring consistency with any public consultation that occurs during development of the local implementation plan. The hon. Gentleman made a fair point, and we are conscious of it. We are working to satisfy such concern in our proposed framework. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 126 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 127</center></H4>
<H4><center>Approval of plans by the Mayor</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 461, in page 66, leave out lines 21 and 22.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 462, in page 66, line 23, leave out "not".
<P>
No. 463, page 66, line 24, leave out "unless" and insert "if".
<P>
No. 464, in page 66, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 126 above".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 465. in page 66, line 32, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(d) the London borough council has undertaken proper consultation and given due consideration to those consulted.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The clause deals with approval of borough council plans, and gives the mayor the unfettered power to decide whether to approve a local information plan. It provides for an exception. He must not approve it if he does not consider it to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consistent with the transport strategy"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"adequate for the purposes of the implementation of the transport strategy",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or if he considers that the timetable is inadequate for implementing the transport strategy.
<P>
The amendments would reverse that position. I am sure, Mr. O'Hara, that you are familiar with the legal term "onus of proof". That is a good analogy--the amendments seek to switch the onus by ensuring that the mayor must approve a local implementation plan unless it falls foul of the criteria listed above, provided that the provisions in clause 126 on consultation and inclusion of a timetable and end date have been complied with.
<P>
The integrity of the mayor's transport strategy is protected by the obligation placed upon councils to produce an implementation plan that is consistent with the transport strategy. The mayor should not be able to withhold approval and then rewrite the plan at his or her discretion.
<P>
Councils have various policies and functions in which the mayor may have no role, and which they must integrate with the requirements of the transport strategy in a way that meets local needs across the board. The mayor should have no power, in our judgment, to intervene in this delicate balance unless the transport strategy as a whole is threatened by a local plan that the timetable for flouts the transport strategy for implementation.
<P>
5.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We have reached part of the Bill that deserves our very fullest attention. We are directly confronting the relationship that will exist between the borough councils and the authority, specifically in terms of the obligation laid on the authority to produce this plethora of strategies that, we have been assured, will transform London. There is the potential for quite serious conflict between elected, accountable borough councils--which will still have the full authority of their electorate through the electoral process and the Greater London authority.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South posed a very important question that encapsulates the difficulties that can, and probably will, arise and probably quite quickly--between an authority very keen to put its stamp on London and to justify its existence and activities, and the boroughs. I make no apology for saying that I believe that the potential for conflict is more likely to emerge between the perceived bias of the authority towards the central London authorities and the interests of the outer London authorities. I have always believed that that is likely to be the case--call it the Bromley syndrome. I am sure that members of the committee will also wish to lay claim to a similar unease, and I hope that they will join me in doing so. Tn any case, the clause forces us to confront and resolve these issues for the first time. How will the primacy of the authority--for that is the clear intention of the Government--play out against the interest and authority of each of the boroughs with their continuing electoral legitimatcy?
<P>
There is a very real threat of a three-way conflict. I believe that the next clause, to which I have modestly suggested a couple of amendments, will raise the spectre of the next level of conflict. The three-legged conflict that I envisage is between elected borough councils and their councillors, the authority and the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will inevitably and legitimately have a role to play, and is elected not only in his or her own right but as a key element of the Government of the day. We now have the explosive possibility of conflicts arising at three levels. There may be--indeed, it is almost inevitable--differences in perception, priorities, view and policies arising in a number of ways at those three levels.
<P>
The Committee will have to reach its own view, but that is why I strongly support my hon. Friend's amendment. He is demonstrating that where a benefit of the doubt needs to be given or an onus of proof produced--to use my hon. Friend's excellent 595 596 <P>
phrase--the onus should be on the mayor to demonstrate why he wishes to override the legitimate views and wishes of an elected borough council in preparing the strategy and the plan. That is a small but important step towards setting the scene for what I fear will be a conflict. We shall return to this issue in a different context in the next clause, and I shall say a few words on it then.
<P>
It is impossible to overstate the importance of such conflict.
<P>
If we are not careful, Ministers will lead us on in their usual silky and seductive way, assuring us all the way that conflicts will not happen. They will tell us that it will be all right on the night and that we should not worry too much. They will cover themselves by using grand words about strategy and about a better future for all Londoners. Underlying all that, however, will be the clear potential for conflicts.
<P>
Ministers should tell us more than they have heretofore about how potential conflicts can be resolved without a lot of pain on all sides. Possibly--perhaps inevitably--the parties involved will resort frequently and at great expense to the courts in the early stages. That may be where the drama is played out. Who will pay for that? You know as well as I do, Mr. O'Hara, that the council tax payers of London will pick up the bill for squabbles and conflicts between the authorities that they elected.
<P>
It is traditional in such circumstances to say that I hope that I am wrong, but I have my fears and doubts. I will listen carefully to Ministers and I hope that they say much to allay my fears.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My right hon. and hon. Friends have made it plain that the clause is of great significance because it encapsulates the attitude of Her Majesty's Government to the mayoralty. The Government believe that the mayor will have greater wisdom than borough councils. I object most strongly to the negative conditionality of clause 127(3). I wholeheartedly approve of amendment No. 462, in particular, which removes the negative element from that conditionality. The assumption must surely be that local borough councils know best how to implement the mayor's strategy to accord with local interests, their constituents' needs, the constraints of their resources and the priorities that they attach to different aspects of their policy.
<P>
How can it be assumed that the mayor's doubts should predominate? Under subsection (3)(c), if the mayor considers "the timetable for implementing" local authority proposals inappropriate, he can intervene and impose his own implementation plan. However, local authorities well understand the circumstances that lead them to believe that a certain time scale is realistic. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) cogently argued, why should local council tax payers pay the bill for the mayor's misjudgments? The borough councils will be mindful first of their electors' economic interests. The remote mayoralty, will have no such preoccupations. The mayor will be concerned with his grand strategy. He will want to brush aside, perhaps all too lightly, the apparently detailed, nit-picking and pettifogging arguments about implementation, that it is perfectly reasonable for local councils to advance when drafting implementation plans to give effect to the mayoralty's transport strategy.
<P>
Her Majesty's Government would do well to adopt an affirmative conditionality--the wording should he that the mayor "shall approve" plans. The presumption must be that borough councils will get implementation right. I hope that the Government will be magnanimous and demonstrate their trust in genuine local democracy at borough level in London.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The clause is about whether we see London boroughs as agents or partners in the delivery of the mayor's strategies. The way in which the clause is drafted tilts the balance towards agency status for London boroughs. It gives the mayor an unfortunate degree of power to direct, which the amendments seek to address. Liberal Democrat Members support them for that reason.
<P>
Over the past few years since the abolition of the GLC--leaving aside the question of whether we were in favour of that measure London boroughs have expanded and changed their role. They have developed a strategic vision; they have worked together. That role cannot be entirely undone as a result of the establishment of the Greater London authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Livingstone (Brent, East):</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the boroughs have expanded their role and work together. many--in fact, most--do work together. However, how would the hon. Gentleman cope with a situation in which a council such as Westminster ignores the strategies of surrounding boroughs in terms of bus lanes, cycle routes and the general approach to traffic? Someone has to have a strategy that works for the whole of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point. Earlier clauses effectively place a duty on the boroughs to have regard, in drawing up their implementation plans, to the mayor's strategy. That provides enough of a basis on which matters can progress. We are told that the GLA will be run on consensual lines--time will tell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> It will certainly be my intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is good news. I am sure that the London boroughs will be rejoicing this evening.
<P>
If the Bill is to signal that the boroughs are regarded as partners in the project of delivering a better transportation system for London and addressing the city's many and various transportation needs, it would be better to put that in the context that the amendments suggest. That would mean that the boroughs would have to take account of the mayor's strategy, but they would not ultimately be put in a position whereby the mayor could impose his or her will against the best interests--
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I return to the example of Westminster council. There has been a huge consensus across London over the past couple of years about the closure of certain parts of central London to pedestrian access. Westminster was not interested--it behaved like a neighbourhood association saying, "Not in my back 597 598 
<P>
yard." We can have as much consensus as we like, but one bloody-minded borough, if it is central enough, could wreck an entire transport strategy. At the end of the day, someone must be able to make the final decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I served for a number of years as chairman of an environment committee in my local authority. During that time, I shared the frustration that arose when the London lorry ban was flouted--it was not fully implemented across the city because a number of boroughs did not take part in it.
<P>
Nevertheless, Liberal Democrat Members believe that an issue of balance is involved, and we take a different view about where that balance should be struck. When we have a powerful, effective mayor with the status and clout that that office gives, and the statutory basis that the Bill will give to his or her strategies is established, there will be no need for the clause. The amendments would provide a better way forward in terms of strengthening arrangements for consultation with the boroughs.
<P>
Finally, I should like to comment on the use of the word "adequate" in subsections (3)(b) and (c). The clarity of the meaning of "adequate" will go to the heart of the matter. Other members of the Committee have already mentioned the extent to which clauses such as this will keep lawyers in good heart for years to come. The boroughs that, for one reason or another, feel least in accord with the mayor--Bromley is one that comes to mind, historically speaking--will undoubtedly seek to challenge the precise meaning of "adequate". That is why we support the amendments as the next best thing to leaving the clause out of the Bill altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My interventions in the Committee's affairs are seldom--that is appropriate for a member of the Committee who is not also a London Member of Parliament.
<P>
However, we have reached a point where I have some relevant experience and anecdotal evidence to share with Ministers by way of a cautionary tale. All the anecdotes so far, not least those of the hon. Member for Brent, East, have been about the London experience. When the GLC was abolished--I abstained on that vote--I was a member of West Midlands council. I was, in fact, its leader between 1977 and 1979. It was the second largest local authority in the country.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, East has referred to battles between the interests of Greater London and those of Westminster. I assure him that they can have been as nothing in comparison with the battles between West Midlands council and, in particular, the city of Birmingham. There were merely seven boroughs in the west midlands--Coventry, Solihull, Birmingham, Sandwell, Dudley, Wolverhampton and Walsall--but the county had a population of 3 million. That is not as large as Greater London, but the authority was, nevertheless, a significant body.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned the relationship between the Greater London authority and the boroughs--it looked to him as if the likeness of an agency was emerging. In the west midlands, in the days that I am recalling, the relationship between the metropolitan council and the metropolitan boroughs in relation to highways was formalised on an agency basis, and written agency contracts were entered into. This is a cautionary tale for Ministers, because those highways agencies proved to be the straw that broke the back of the provincial mets. When these debates were taking place, I saw a greater case for retaining the provincial mets than I did for retaining the GLC.
<P>
The ancient pattern in my part of the midlands was that every corporation--Birmingham, for example--ran a bus service to the city boundary and, having paused there, returned to the centre again. That was, of course, the travel pattern of almost nobody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> During those marvellous days, when alderman Foodbotham was chairman of the Bradford fine arts and tramways committee, the Bradford tramway went only as far as the city boundary. That was a great deprivation to the people of Dewsbury and Shipley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I thought that alderman Foodbotham was an Arnold Bennett character who operated in the Potteries, but perhaps he was in Bradford for part of his illustrious career.
<P>
The boroughs ran buses to the boundary, but people really wanted to travel, say, from Birmingham to Coventry. Why should the people of Birmingham not visit Coventry from time to time, particularly if Aston Villa is playing Coventry City? A far more rational public transport pattern therefore emerged, which matched people's real travel patterns.
<P>
The notorious case of the Shirley bypass occurred in my constituency. It was protected for years on the Solihull town plan, and it was intended that it should run round the very intense part of Shirley off the Stratford road and rejoin the Stratford road in Birmingham. The Birmingham planners then eliminated it from the Birmingham map, and we got a potential line of bypass, heavily protected, that ended in a field and went nowhere. We have never, to this day, been given the Shirley bypass, with harmful consequences.
<P>
This intervention is already longer than I intended, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman of the saying, "Great anecdotes have little anecdotes upon their backs to bite 'em, and little anecdotes have lesser anecdotes, and so ad infinitum."
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I think that I have just been bitten by some of them. It is all coming back to me.
<P>
The cautionary tale for Ministers is that they should watch out for the relationship between the mayor and the boroughs, because they could have a real Donnybrook on their hands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be brief, but the hon. Member for Brent, East knew perfectly well when he introduced Westminster city council to the debate that I was likely to rise to the bait. I do not intend to make either a long or an aggressive speech. In my constituency, and that of the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who is at present outside the Committee 599 600 <P>
Room and who shares with me the representation--[Interruption.] Such is the telepathy that exists within the City of Westminster that she has just re-entered the Room. I hasten to say as she moves to her seat that my remarks toward her were wholly complimentary.
<P>
There are genuine problems in being the authority for the centre of a great city. I have previously cited the fact that 22 per cent. of the working population of Greater London come to work daily in my constituency. My 73 parliamentary colleagues in Greater London, many of whom are on this Committee, are good enough to look after the other 78 per cent. One necessary consequence of that is that there are far more red routes and far more underground stations in my constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon) : Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that there are also many advantages to being in the centre of the city, not least the enormous income that Westminster city council generates from car parking charges and parking fines?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am entirely content to respond to the hon. Gentleman, who was a distinguished leader of the Labour group on Westminster city council in his day. Of course I acknowledge that on every balance sheet there are both assets and liabilities. All that I am saying is that if one is at the centre, there are considerations that govern how one behaves, and there will necessarily be disputes between oneself and others. That simply underlines the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made in his powerful speech on behalf of the suburbs. The Government need to take that into account.
<P>
I offer one piece of comfort to those who are unhappy about the way in which Westminster council behaves to some of its immediate neighbours. The royal parks are right in the middle of Westminster, and there are disagreements between the royal parks and Westminster on traffic matters. Because of their status in the land, the royal parks have interests superior to those of Westminster, and they also act in a way that does not naturally fit in with the surrounding terrain.

<P>

<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Amendments Nos. 461 to 463 would, as has been suggested, reduce the mayor's discretion about whether to approve local implementation plans. They would mean that, so long as the three conditions stated clearly in clause 127(3) were met, the mayor would have to approve the plan.
<P>
That would limit the mayor's ability to consider any other factors. Although the three criteria are widely drawn, it would be wrong to restrict the mayor's discretion to ensuring compliance with those conditions alone. For example, the plan from one council might be unsatisfactory compared with plans submitted by other councils. It would be illogical to prevent the mayor from acting on that.
<P>
It is important that the Committee realises that local implementation plans will be the key to successful implementation of the overall transport strategy as laid down by the mayor. The mayor must have the power to ensure that the plans contain all that is necessary. We cannot have 33 different borough transport strategies when we have an overall transport strategy for London. That goes to the heart of the whole reason for setting up the Greater London authority and the whole reason for us sitting for all these hours to pass a Bill to get a mayor and an assembly. We cannot allow the different boroughs to act separately.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood talked about the wisdom of the mayor--as opposed, presumably, to the wisdom of the boroughs. The mayor will have the mandate from the people of London. He or she will have been elected with a mandate to see the whole picture, and will look at the whole picture when considering the implementation plans submitted by the different boroughs. Clearly, the mayor must have that final overall responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I think that the Minister has inadvertently puther finger on part of the problem. I can envisage--perhaps the Minister can, too--circumstances in which the mayor is elected on a party basis. Let us say that one party clearly predominated among the central boroughs and a different party or parties were in the majority in the outer boroughs. The mayor's mandate, as the Minister described it, could thus be seen as being limited or skewed. There is a danger that the mayor could be seen as the mayor for the centre, acting against the interests of many of the outer boroughs.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I can see why the right hon. Gentleman wants to imply that, because it would be helpful in gathering support for his amendment. In reality, the mayor will be elected by the people of the whole of London. I am sure that whatever the mayor's political allegiance, he or she will have been elected by many people in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency and many in my constituency, because he or she will have been elected by the people of London as a whole. The right hon. Gentleman's argument should not convince hon. Members to vote for the amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 464 and 465 would ensure that the mayor checked that the borough councils had consulted properly in drawing up their local implementation plans, and given due consideration to those consulted. There is nothing in clause 127 to stop the mayor considering the adequacy of the consultation that the boroughs have made, but there is no need for the mayor to check whether the boroughs have given due consideration to those consulted; the very act of consulting gives the boroughs a duty to consider what consultees say.
<P>
I repeat: it is vital that the mayor has sufficient powers to ensure that this important transport strategy is properly implemented, as laid out in subsection (3) (b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> A moment ago the Minister used the word "adequacy" in relation to consultation. As I have not been wholly friendly to Liberal Democrat Members, I should say that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made a good point when he asked for a definition of what "adequate" or "adequacy" meant. The word adequate occurs in two paragraphs of the subsection (3), quite apart from its use by the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> As I see it--perhaps as we all see it--consultation is adequate if it is going to deliver to the people what is in the strategty; a process is adequate if it delivers what is required of it. That is my definition.
<P>
The mayor of London will have been elected by the people of London on the basis of a manifesto, so it must be right to give him or her the powers to deliver that manifesto. It is vital that those powers are sufficient to ensure that any strategy is properly implemented. We intend the mayor's strategy to cover high-level areas, so to speak, with the detail being left to the boroughs. There will be a lot of work for the boroughs to do, and it is crucial that they work closely with the mayor and the assembly.
<P>
It may be that the mayor will need to insist on some very specific measures in order that specific proposals will work. The mayor might, for example, with the benefit of seeing the whole picture, think it necessary for a certain road junction to work in a particular way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister said something that immediately aroused my interest, and probably that of other hon. Members. She said that the boroughs will have to work very closely with the assembly as well as the mayor, but I do not see any role for the assembly in this process. Were there to be such a material role--for example, were assembly men representing a particular part of London able to take up the point of view of a particular borough that was being taken to task by the mayoralty--I would be reassured, but I can detect no such mechanism in the Bill, certainly not in this clause.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I think that we are getting into semantics. The assembly will review everything that is happening in London. That is part of its role. The members of the assembly will be in touch with what is happening in their own areas and can make views known.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let me get back to the key point. I know that some people do not like the fact that we are going to have a mayor, but that is what the people of London voted for. We have to give the mayor the powers to do things, and those powers will be strictly limited in terms of policies and measures that have been set out in the transport strategy, on which the boroughs will have been fully consulted. This goes to the heart of the Bill, which is why it is even more important that we oppose the amendment and support the clause as it stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister is usually persuasive in her replies, but I am afraid that she has failed on this occasion. She says that she does not want to have 33 different strategies for transport in London. There is no question that accepting our proposals would result in 33 different strategies. The mayor sets out his strategy, and the authorities have to implement it. Under the Government's vision, the boroughs simply implement what the mayor tells them to do. Under our vision, the boroughs are allowed to interpret the mayor's ideas creatively. The mayor would then have to say where that sits wrongly with his vision. The question is whether the creativity comes down from one person, or up from 33 boroughs. In my judgment, it is greatly preferable for the people of London to maximise the vision of many people rather than just one person.
<P>
The Minister rightly says that it is important that the strategy is implemented. There is no question of the strategy not being implemented--it is a matter of how it will be implemented. I regret that the Minister has taken a rather firm line on the amendment, and we are not minded to withdraw it.

</FONT>Clause 127 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 128</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of the Mayor to prepare a plan</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 467, in page 66, line 39, after "Mayor", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"after ascertaining and assessing the reasons for delay".{**W4**}
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 475, in page 66, line 40, after "such", insert "reasonable".
<P>
No. 476, in page 66, line 44, leave out "within a reasonable time".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps we shall have more luck with these amendments.
<P>
The clause deals with the mayor's power to prepare a plan. When it appears to the mayor that the council has failed to implement a plan, he can issue a direction to the council under clause 131. The amendment would deal with delays in the plan. The Opposition believe that the mayor should not issue a direction until he has ascertained and assessed the reasons for a delay. Our argument is similar to that which we advanced under the previous clause, which we felt stifled the role of the boroughs, which is why we voted against it. The mayor should get more stuck into the boroughs to find out what is going on before issuing a direction. Amendment No. 475 suggests simply that that should be done within a reasonable time.
<P>
The clause provides for the mayor to issue a direction requiring a council that has failed to prepare or submit a local implementation plan to do so within such time as the mayor specifies. If the council does not comply within that time, the mayor may prepare the plan. If the council's obligation is to comply within a reasonable time, there is little point in the mayor specifying a particular period. If the council is to comply with the period specified by the mayor, that period must be reasonable. Amendment No. 475 provides for the mayor to specify a reasonable period and for the council to comply within that period.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I strongly support the amendment, because yet again the Government are placing total faith in the subjective judgment of the mayor. A direction may be issued when it appears to the mayor that a borough has failed to prepare or formulate the implementation plan required to give effect to the strategy. A council may fail to formulate a plan, but it could still be working on it--the preparation process can be long and complicated.
<P>
We have to understand that we are legislating for a political animal that has never existed before in British politics. The person who becomes mayor may not have the experience to enable him or her to understand the complexity of his or her strategy's requirements at a local level. The mayor may be from business, where plans can be driven through regardless of their social, environmental or political consequences. He may come from the media and have no comprehension of all that public works entail. He may be from one of many backgrounds that have no political dimension. Unless he takes on board the susceptibilities of local communities, we will, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made clear in our debate on the previous clause, have a recipe for systemic conflict.
<P>
The point is fundamental and cannot be sufficiently stressed. I am sorry to have to be repetitive, but I am extremely glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South moved the amendment and I hope that he will divide the Committee on it. That would emphasise the point that we made in the debate on the previous clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 467 is unnecessary because implicit provisions mean that the mayor has to satisfy himself that a local authority has failed to do what it should have done before he is in a position to issue a direction. General law would require the mayor in every case to give due consideration to whether it was appropriate to exercise the power of direction. He could not simply send out an automatic direction--for example, in a letter that was triggered by a computer. He would probably have discussions with the borough, the chairman of the transport committee and possibly other councillors before exercising the powers in the Bill. There is no need to include the unnecessary provision in amendment No.467.
<P>
Having said that, we can give the hon. Member for Croydon, South more joy on amendment No. 475, which would require the mayor to give a council a reasonable time in which to respond to a direction. We specify that the period that is allowed should be reasonable at several other points in the Bill. We are happy to take the matter away and consider whether the same should apply in the present case.
<P>
Amendment No. 476, however, takes the process of logic to extreme conclusions. I understand what the hon. Gentleman said, but we would send a curious message if we deleted the words "within a reasonable time,, from a clause in which we were trying to ensure that everyone acted reasonably and that there would be reasonable time for compliance. I have never heard the word "reasonable" used so often during a short debate. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow us to keep the second "reasonable" in the Bill because we recommend that it stays there. We will consider his case for applying the test of reasonableness to subsection (1).
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister's response was thoroughly timely and reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In view of the Minister's reasonable response, I will be reasonable in dealing with the amendments, which relate to the mayor's reasonableness. Under the circumstances, it would be churlish to push the amendment to a Division. The Minister gave a concession--his fourth such concession of the day--and said that he would take another look at the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman (Chipping Barnet):</B> Why does not my hon. Friend think, as I do, that the Minister should agree to the amendment instead of promising to consider it again? Surely, the Minister should be a little more expansive in his reasonableness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I do not want to be unreasonable. I suspect that the Minister's response has more to do with my drafting than anything else. I hope that my hon. 
605 606 
<P>
Friend accepts that I feel happy with the Minister's undertaking to examine the amendment. Under those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 66, line 43, leave out from "above" to end of line 45 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Council may appeal to the Secretary of State against the direction. The Secretary of State will have the power to determine whether the direction will have effect.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now have to confront the very real difficulties that will arise from the provisions in clause 128. We are in the territory of the mayor issuing directions to borough councils and fully confront the possibility of conflict. If, in the mayor's judgment, a borough council has failed to prepare and submit a plan, he will issue a direction. Under subsection (2), if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Mayor has issued a direction ... but the council has not complied",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the mayor can step in and usurp its proper role and authority and prepare a local implementation plan on its behalf.
<P>
6.30 pm
<P>
My point is simple but important. There must be a mechanism properly to resolve fundamental conflicts over the issues before us. We are talking about the mayor's judgment--the clause includes the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where it appears to the Mayor"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and about his judgment of a borough council's failure to do something. My contention is that we cannot leave matters at that.
<P>
Under the amendment, it would be open to a borough council to look to the Secretary of State to adjudicates. As we know, the Secretary of State is given an important role throughout the Bill, although some people feel happier about that than others. I acknowledge, however, that the Secretary of State should, have a role in the matters before us, and the amendment describes one role 
that I would like to give him. I want him to make a proper judgment where there is a conflict of views between the central authority, in the person of the mayor, and the elected local authority in the shape of the borough. There should be a way properly to resolve conflicts. I do not want matters to be left too long, drawn-out disputes, and even less do I want them to end up in the courts. The role that the Secretary of State will inevitably play--as we have seen in earlier parts of the Bill--should be honoured and brought into play in the way that my amendment suggests.
<P>
In that sense, the amendment deals with a serious and important concept. I will listen carefully to what Ministers say. if they cannot accept the amendment, I hope that they will be able to reassure me and those who share my reservations as to the mechanism that they think will resolve the conflicts that I envisage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support my right hon. Friend. I intervened in the speech of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department to ask for definitions of "adequacy" or "adequate". I mean no disparagement of her response, but it sounded slightly tautologous. She said that the Bill referred to adequacy and that it would be determined according to whether it met the mayor's views of what was adequate. I may have missed something, but that does not seem to be a wholly objective test. The problems that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst identified are, therefore, likely to arise.
<P>
At a minuscule and microcosmic level, I remember--as my right hon. Friend no doubt does, because we both served in the previous Administration as Education Ministers--an extraordinary business that had to be brought to Ministers. Pupils were going across local authority boundaries, and there was a dispute as to where the costs should fall. In the end, a Minister had to settle it. That was a small problem, but it had to come to the top.
