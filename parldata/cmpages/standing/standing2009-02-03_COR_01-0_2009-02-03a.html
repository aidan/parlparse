<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000366"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements to make. Members, if they wish, may remove their jackets
during Committee sittings, but will all Members please ensure that all
mobile phones and pagers are turned off or at least switched to silent
running? We do not want any
disturbance.</div><a name="09020343000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that there are money and ways and means
resolutions in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the
room. I should also like to remind Members that adequate notice should
be given of amendments if they are to be eligible for selection. For a
Tuesday sitting, amendments must be tabled by the rise of the House the
previous Thursday and, for a Thursday sitting, amendments must be
tabled by the previous Monday. As a general rule, I and my fellow
Chairman do not intend to call starred
amendments.</div><a name="09020343000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees, so it might help if I briefly explain how we will
proceed. It will not only be helpful to you, but it will also be very
helpful to me. The Committee will first be asked to consider the
programme motion on which debate will be limited to half an hour. We
will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence and then to a
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral evidence sessions. I hope that we can take both motions
formally.</div><a name="09020343000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming
that the second of the motions is agreed, the Committee will then move
into private session. Once the Committee has completed its
deliberations in private, witnesses and members of the public will be
invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will commence.
I hope that that will be at around 11
am.</div><a name="09020343000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Committee agrees to the programme motion, it will hear oral
evidence today and on Thursday. It will then revert to the more
familiar proceedings of clause-by-clause
scrutiny.</div><a name="09020343000011"></a>

proceedings shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a
conclusion at 4.00 pm on Thursday 5
March.</div><a name="09020343000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am delighted to be taking the Bill through under you, Mr.
Cook, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale. I know that you will
both conduct the proceedings of this Committee in a fair and impartial
way. This is an important Bill and it is important that it is subject
to full and proper
scrutiny.</div><a name="09020343000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
programme motion largely speaks for itself, so I intend to be brief. I
just want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to one point. On
Second Reading, the hon. Member for Cambridge suggested that our
putting the data-sharing provisions into part 8 was an attempt to
smuggle them through as though they were illicit contraband. Rather
than be accused of such smuggling, we have worked the order of
consideration so that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>amendments to the Data Protection Act 1998 in part 8 will be considered
immediately after the coroner and death certification proceedings in
part 1. I hope that that reordering will meet with the agreement of not
just the hon. Member for Cambridge but other members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09020343000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be two full days for oral evidence followed by five days of the
usual clause-by-clause consideration. There is always the
possibility&#151;we have the flexibility&#151;to sit a little later
on Tuesdays if necessary, but I shall obviously leave that in the very
capable hands of the Government
Whip.</div><a name="09020343000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might assist you, Mr. Cook, and hon. Members if I advise the
Committee that, in broad terms, I will be leading on parts 1, 5, 6, 8
and 9 and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Justice will
lead on parts 2, 4 and 7. In the case of part 3, she will
lead in the debates on witness anonymity and I will deal with the other
chapters in that part. I look forward to a constructive and searching
debate on the Bill and commend the motion to the
Committee.</div><a name="09020343000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020343000368"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I associate myself and
my hon. Friends with the Minister&#146;s remarks and welcome you,
Mr. Cook, to the Chair. We also look forward to the
chairmanship of Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="09020343000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the Minister, we hope that this will be a constructive Committee. The
last occasion that we sat under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook,
was when we considered the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill last
year and, rather like London buses, Home Office and justice Bills
follow each other in whizzing round the corner. My hon. Friends and I
will do our best to provide grit on the road so that these buses can
gain better purchase on the surface, but I have to say at the outset
that this Bill is another plum duff. I accused the Government of
producing a great, fat Bill last year&#151;most of it was duff; there
were a few plums&#151;and the same can be said of this Bill. I cannot
guarantee to be as generous to the two Ministers on this Committee as I
was to the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, the right hon.
Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), to whom I gave a Christmas
pudding rather than a plum duff at the end of our deliberations.
Unfortunately, the House of Commons shop does not sell plum duffs, so
he had to make do with a House of Commons Christmas pudding that looked
suitably like the kind of infernal device that one might throw at early
20th century Austrian
archdukes.</div><a name="09020343000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is another long Bill. It has 162 clauses and 21 schedules
and each of the schedules is divided up into several parts. My
complaint at this early stage is that this is too big a Bill and covers
too many discrete subjects. It should be divided up into separate
Bills. Of course, the Government are in a hurry&#151;time is running
out for them&#151;but we will do our best to try to make sense of
nonsense and to improve what is almost capable of being described as
sensible. We will applaud where appropriate those provisions that we
think will enhance the criminal or coronial
law.</div><a name="09020343000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we may take a different view as we make progress, at this stage we can
agree with the Minister&#146;s motion for the timetabling of the
Committee, but we reserve our right to come back to seek adjustments if
necessary. We look forward to constructive if sometimes controversial
debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="09020343000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09020343000369"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I am grateful to the Government
for acceding to my suggestion that we move up consideration of the
data-protection provisions in the Bill. Someone in opposition of a
suspicion mind might think that all that has happened is that we have
not spotted the contraband and that it is somewhere else in the Bill.
To that degree, I agree with the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough. This is a very long Bill that, at a conservative estimate,
contains 28 different topics for consideration. It amends 56 pieces of
previous legislation and, even in the time that the Committee has been
given, it will be difficult to consider all aspects of the Bill
properly. If at the end of our deliberations parts of the Bill have not
been considered or have not been considered at the length or with the
depth that they deserve, I hope that the Government will think
generously about offering more than one day for Report. That has just
happened with the Political Parties and Elections Bill, as the
Committee got nowhere near discussing all the important matters that it
raised. This Bill is even longer, even bigger and covers even more
subjects. Although I make that important request, I do not at this
stage intend to divide the Committee on the programme
motion.</div><a name="09020343000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Prentice:</b></i> Thank you, Mr. Cook. The Bill is
before us today because we want to try to deliver a more transparent,
responsive and effective justice and coroner service for victims,
witnesses, bereaved families and the wider public. The Bill is intended
to ensure that victims and witnesses are at the heart of the justice
system. The coroners part of the Bill aims to improve significantly the
service that bereaved families receive from a reformed coroner
system&#151;it has not been reformed for a very long time&#151;and
will introduce a related new death certification system, which I hope
will provide people with the necessary reassurance that there is
independent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>checking of the causes of death. The Bill will also give vulnerable and
intimidated witnesses, particularly in respect of gun and knife-related
violence, the best possible protection from the earliest stages of the
criminal justice process. The Bill will introduce a more consistent and
transparent sentencing framework, as well as providing stronger
inspection powers to improve public confidence in how data is held and
used, removing barriers to effective data sharing, which will improve
public services and the fight against crime and terrorism. In a
nutshell, that is what we are trying to achieve through the
Bill.</div><a name="09020343000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000371"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. Before calling the first question, I
remind all hon. Members that questions should be limited to matters
within the scope of the Bill. We must stick strictly to the timings in
the programme motion, which the Committee has agreed. I hope that those
questions are within the framework of what we agreed in private. I hope
that I do not have to interrupt mid-sentence, but I shall do so if I
need
to.</div><a name="09020343000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000372"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I direct this question at either of the
Ministers, and would be happy for either to answer. Why have you
thought it appropriate to design such a lengthy and diverse Bill? It is
162 clauses long, has 21 schedules, which are divided up
into several parts, and covers a huge number of discrete public policy
areas. Why do you design Bills like this?
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If you do not know, please say
so.</div><a name="09020343000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> There is a bit of me that does not know.
Parliamentary time plays a big part in putting together different
groups of issues, but as I explained in my opening remarks about
providing victims and witnesses with transparency and protection within
the justice system, there is a logic to putting those things
together.</div>
<a name="09020343000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000373"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Could you explain a bit more about the
logic?</div>
<a name="09020343000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> For example, bereaved families will be
given a much better service in the coroner section as a result of the
Bill, and they will receive a better service through the death
certification process. Equally, victims and witnesses in the justice
system might require better protection when they give evidence or when
they are approached for evidence in any investigation. This is about
protecting people and giving them confidence in the system. There is a
logic and thread that goes through that.</div>
<a name="09020343000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000374"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> It is not a logic that I quite understand, at
least not as currently presented. For example, how do provisions to do
with child pornography or indecent pseudo-photographs tie in with the
thread that you say runs through the Bill? How does the thread connect
to the reform of the coroners system?</div>
<a name="09020343000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> The most obvious response is that it is
another form of protection for children. My hon. Friend will go into
the details of that part of the Bill if you wish.</div>
<a name="09020343000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> There is an important but small provision in
respect of this, which has arisen as a result of trends and concerns
raised by the police and child protection agencies. There is a lacuna
in the criminal law about those kinds of images, which are not based on
real photographs but are increasingly being found. The Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>presents us with an opportunity to close that loophole with the aim of
improving child protection as a result. It is a small part of the Bill,
and I hope that members of the Committee will understand that we should
not wait for a piece of legislation that is solely about the protection
of children. The provision fits with the general theme of the Bill,
which is to provide extra protection for victims in the criminal
justice system. That is why it is there.</div>
<a name="09020343000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000375"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> When looking at the index of the Bill, a
reasonable person could, quite legitimately, comment that Ministers
have been running around the Department pulling things off shelves and
sticking them into the shopping trolley to create a long Bill. Why has
the legislative process not been managed in such a way that we have a
discrete coroners Bill? We were promised one a while ago. Would it not
be more sensible to run the reform of the coroner system through a
discrete Bill, rather than tagging matters relating to legal aid,
vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and other substantive criminal
justice issues on to this Bill?</div>
<a name="09020343000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> There is always a question about balancing the
legislative priorities arising out of urgent issues requiring the
attention of Parliament. These matters are in the Bill because we
believe that they will make a difference. They will assist victims and
witnesses in the criminal justice system, and all those who come into
contact with it, whether on the coronial or criminal law side of the
Bill. As a Minister, one has to balance the priorities of each discrete
provision that has an urgency and the appropriate legislative
vehicle.</div>
<a name="09020343000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that many hon. Members who get this thrown at them, and have to
scrutinise the Bill in Committee, might have a slightly different
perspective from Ministers who seek to make what we believe are
important, useful and essential changes to the law. Making those
changes is different from fulfilling the requirements and needs of
scrutiny, and there is always a balance to be struck. As to where that
balance should be, Ministers might feel slightly differently from
members of the Committee who have to scrutinise the Bill. None the
less, I hope that we all accept that the issues dealt with in the Bill
are important. When criminal justice Bills involve law reform, they
often have a Christmas tree-look about them because much is done in
primary legislation that, in other fields, might be done in secondary
legislation. There is always a danger of that. All I can say is that we
will do our utmost to make sure that the Committee has every
opportunity to scrutinise as much as possible all aspects of the
Bill.</div><a name="09020343000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000376"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Why did you not accept the recommendations of the
Law Commission on the reform of the law of homicide? You picked out
some bits, but left out others. That seems to have created a rather
difficult picture for you, does it not, when attempting to reform an
important part of the criminal law relating to the killing of other
people? You picked some plums out of the commission&#146;s report,
but left a lot of stuff behind, which could&#151;if you two Ministers
are right in your description of the shape and design of the
Bill&#151;perfectly properly have come into the Bill. It might have
made it longer, but we are used to
that.</div><a name="09020343000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> The Law Commission came up with a
comprehensive proposal for the reform of the entire law of homicide
which was elegant and which fitted together 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>very well, but which did not meet with the approval of all the
stakeholders. The Committee will recall that the commission suggested
that we should replace murder or manslaughter with murder I or murder
II or manslaughter. It was a significant and big change, and it did not
meet with total approval among stakeholders. The commission also
accepted that there is a significant issue with the partial defences
under the Bill and that that was appropriate. It might not have wished
the Bill to be formed in such a way, but it accepted that it was
possible to take a partial approach and to deal with the partial
defences before looking at the entire structure, which is what we have
decided to
do.</div><a name="09020343000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that there is enough of an issue about the partial defences to
justify reforming them before going on to a second stage to see whether
or not the entire restructuring that the Law Commission suggested is
the right way
forward.</div><a name="09020343000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000377"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> May I ask one further question? Clause 58 repeals
a provision that was introduced under the Criminal Justice and
Immigration Act 2008 on Report. That provision has not even come into
force, yet you are repealing it already. Your Government have a history
of passing lots of Bills that repeal other enactments that were
recently passed. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 is a classic example of
that. Huge chunks of it were repealed before they were due to come into
force, and parts that have come into force have also been repealed. Can
you guarantee that no parts of the Bill under discussion, as currently
drafted, will be repealed before your next Criminal Justice Bill comes
into effect, and that we can work forward at least on a moderately
planned basis in line with this particular Bill, or will new stuff be
brought in on
Report?</div><a name="09020343000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> It is a complicated question. We certainly do
not put things into legislation that we intend to repeal before
bringing them into force. I do not believe that any Minister has done
that&#151;from any party. The clause to which the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough referred was inserted into the previous
legislation by the House of Lords. It was not accepted by the Commons.
In fact, when it was returned to the Commons, it was rejected
decisively by 338 to 136. The so-called freedom of speech provision
relating to incitement of homophobic hatred was not something that the
Government ever accepted was necessary. Indeed, we believe that it
makes the substantive offence extremely confusing and, as well as being
insulting, it would make
it&#151;</div><a name="09020343000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000378"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Forgive me, I do not want to discuss the merits
or demerits of clause
58.</div><a name="09020343000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> I am trying to explain why the Government want
to remove a section that was passed under the previous legislation. It
was an amendment that the Government did not want. I said clearly on
the Floor of the House that we would return to it. We might therefore
see the matter as fulfilling the promise to return to it. We said that
we would do that, and we are doing it at the first
opportunity.</div>
<a name="09020343000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000379"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Do you not understand that that leads to cynicism
about the construction of
legislation?</div><a name="09020343000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> I do not accept that. There are strongly held
arguments on both sides of this issue by those who believe strongly in
their views. It is an argument that will be raised again in Committee,
when we get to that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>clause. It may come back to the Floor of the House on Report. However,
the Government&#146;s position has been clear on this. Clarity and
pursuing a policy that one believes in engenders exactly the opposite
of
cynicism.</div><a name="09020343000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000380"></a>David
Howarth:</b> On that point, as the person who called the final
vote on the last bit of ping-pong because I wanted to protest against
the Government giving in on that last round, I confirm what the
Minister has just said. The Government were plainly coerced by a
timetabling issue&#151;of their own making&#151;and I am not
surprised that they have returned to the
matter.</div><a name="09020343000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the law of murder, I am disturbed about this piecemeal
approach.</div>
<a name="09020343000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000381"></a>The
Chairman:</b> While you are doing that, David, could you speak
up a
little?</div><a name="09020343000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000382"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Sorry, I will sit nearer the microphone. The
piecemeal approach to the law of murder is unsatisfactory. The impact
assessment on the Bill says that the proposed changes in the partial
defences will increase the number of people convicted of murder as
opposed to manslaughter by between 100 and 200. I raised that on Second
Reading, but it was not the correct setting to do so, so I am asking
again: who are those people? What kind of defendant will, as a result
of the proposals, now be found guilty of murder rather than
manslaughter?</div><a name="09020343000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> We are seeking to make changes to the partial
defences. The concerns that the Law Commission reported on are accepted
more widely than the solutions that have been adopted. But there is a
widespread acceptance about the nature of the problems of the partial
defences&#151;particularly provocation. That particular defence may
be too easily accessible to those who kill in anger. The crime is often
characterised as jealous partners who kill in anger and the defence is
not sufficiently accessible to those who kill in fear of serious
violence.</div>
<a name="09020343000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been developments in the case law through the courts to try to
accommodate this, but there is no obvious place in the defence, as it
currently stands, for fear of serious violence. There are also concerns
that all evidence of provocation has to be put to a jury, even where it
is unmeritorious and not raised by anyone&#151;even the
defence&#151;which can cause concerns. What we therefore sought to do
in respect of the change to a provocation defence is to raise the
threshold generally, so that those who kill in anger can succeed in
having their conviction reduced to manslaughter only in exceptional
circumstances. So, we are raising the bar of the availability of that
defence and extending it to cover those who kill in fear of serious
violence as well as those who kill in anger. On that basis, I hope that
he can see the kind of person who might now be caught and convicted of
murder rather than manslaughter, if these provisions go through. In
respect of provocation, there is an increasing threshold and a slight
change in the way the remaining partial defence works. We do not
believe that the changes we are proposing to diminished responsibility
will change the numbers enormously; it is really just a clarification
of the way in which that defence
works.</div>
<a name="09020343000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000383"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am worried about the changes to diminished
responsibility. By making that defence more precise, and with reference
to recognised medical conditions, there is a danger of people who
perhaps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>come under the category of those with learning disabilities who might
not be said to have a recognised medical condition, being caught by the
law of murder rather than manslaughter. I am worried about
that.</div><a name="09020343000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the provocation defence&#151;the replacement of
provocation&#151;what is the evidence for the figure of
100 to 200? If you look at the standard legal databases to
see what is going on in the provocation defence, you will see that
convictions for manslaughter on the grounds of provocation where there
has been sexual infidelity are rare in recent years. Normally what
happens these days is that such cases either succeed or fail on
diminished responsibility, so provocation does not come into it. I do
not see the 100 cases. On the serious violence side, the numbers go the
other way. For the most part these days, in the battered wives cases,
the law goes in their favour. I do not see that moving in the way that
the Minister says
either.</div><a name="09020343000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that, if you look at the words in the Bill, they seem to
suggest a rather different sort of person being found guilty of murder.
For example, there are such people as those raised in the Doughty
decision of the 1980s. A stressed-out parent who loses his or her
temper and strikes a child, could be guilty of homicide, yes, but the
decision in that case was manslaughter not murder. Those defendants
would not qualify any more, because they do not have any justifiable
sense of being seriously
wrong.</div><a name="09020343000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> If I can reassure the hon. Gentleman in this
respect, I can see where he is coming from. I want to make it clear
that the calculation that he refers to is about the impact on prison
places, which is calculated on the basis of length of sentence as well
as number of convictions. What we expect is perhaps an
additional 10 to 20 convictions a year, but when planning for
prison places, we always have to take into account the likely length of
sentence resulting from such convictions. In the various magical ways
in which National Offender Management Service does that, the estimated
result, in a build-up over about eight years or so, is that we might
have to account for 100 to 200 extra prison places. We are not saying
that we expect 100 to 200 extra convictions for murder as opposed to
manslaughter, but that we expect a small number of 10 to 20 or so. I
hope that that reassures
him.</div><a name="09020343000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of the Doughty case, as far as we are concerned, it is not
intended that that kind of case&#151;unless it can fit into
diminished responsibility&#151;ought to count as provocation. We are
trying to put the bar higher and not to bring it
down.</div><a name="09020343000063"></a>

13</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000384"></a>David
Howarth:</b> May I ask about loss of control? That is the
standard problem in battered wives cases. They find it difficult to
come within the existing defence of provocation, because of the
requirement of loss of control. The obvious way to reform the law to
help battered wives is to get rid of the idea of loss of control. The
Government have kept that idea in the Bill, but how does that help?
Clause 41(2) talks about &#147;loss of control&#148; not being
&#147;sudden&#148;, but it is not the suddenness of the loss of
control that matters; it is having to prove some sort of loss of
control.</div><a name="09020343000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> I understand the point. After looking
carefully at the matter, we decided that there might be a small number
of cases at the top end where a loss of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>control occurs and that we would still want to be capable of reducing
what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter. That would be a much
smaller number of cases, which is why we have tried to capture the
small number of cases envisaged using the new
formulations.</div><a name="09020343000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful if I give an example of some instances of loss of
control, where we would all reasonably think that what had happened had
pushed the person beyond the very high threshold, such that it ought
still to count to reduce murder to manslaughter. For
example&#151;this is not a real case&#151;suppose a survivor of
genocide came across one of the perpetrators in the street, which is
not unknown and has happened. Suppose the victim recognised the
perpetrator, and after confronting them and being laughed at or
taunted, lost self-control and killed them. We would still want that
kind of case to be defended by the concept of a loss of self-control.
There are a small number of cases at the top end where that is still a
useable concept that adds something to the
law.</div><a name="09020343000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
these changes, we are trying to lift the bar, so that there are far
fewer cases, while extending the law to incorporate the fear of
violence that battered wives cases first raised as an issue. Those
cases tended to make critics think that the way the current law of
provocation works is not fair to those who kill out of fear, but it is
perhaps overly generous to those who kill out of anger. That is why we
still have that element of loss of self-control. If we did not believe
that there were such cases, we would seek to abolish the concept
completely in law. However, there are some instances where it might
still be justifiable which is why it is
there.</div><a name="09020343000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000385"></a>David
Howarth:</b> But the fear of serious violence requirement is
about not only the fear of serious violence, but cases where the
defendant&#146;s loss of self-control was attributable to serious
violence. There still needs to be that loss of self-control. That leads
to the central example in the battered wives case. Suppose a wife is
abused for a long time, and after a particularly bad incident of being
beaten up she waits for her husband to go to sleep and kills him. I do
not see the loss of control in that case, but I think that under the
Bill that person would be convicted of
murder.</div><a name="09020343000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria

of violence element.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000386"></a>David
Howarth:</b> But they had to lose control.</div>
<a name="09020343000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> The proposed changes mean that the loss of
control does not have to be sudden. Some of the battered wives cases
were at the stretch of the statutory wording but fitted into the
current law, because they were able to show battered-wife syndrome or
psychological effects proving that a loss of self-control had occurred,
albeit on a slower basis. It is the removal of the requirement for it
to be sudden that has allowed those cases to fit in. Without the
requirement in the reformed partial defence for some self-control, we
would open the door to cold-blooded killings fitting into the defence.
There has to be a loss of self-control.</div>

Michael:</b> It is easy to argue on either side about witness
anonymity, and to show examples where not knowing where evidence is
coming from makes it difficult for an innocent accused to provide a
defence. However, most MPs will have had experience of places where
intimidation of people within a community for an extended period means
that the protection of witnesses is the only way that can be tackled
and issues can be brought before the court. How will the drafting of
the clauses ensure no unintended consequences on either side of that
difficult
balance?</div><a name="09020343000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> The Bill re-enacts effectively with slight
modification the provisions of the Criminal Evidence (Witness
Anonymity) Act 2008. Many members of the Committee will remember that
as a swift and in many ways exemplary piece of parliamentary activity
to deal with a problem that had arisen suddenly, thanks to a House of
Lords judgment that had many practical implications for the confidence
of the public in the criminal justice system. As in any proceedings,
witness anonymity has implications for fairness to the defendant and
for the ancient rights of the defendant to confront their accuser,
which was what the whole issue was
about.</div><a name="09020343000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation came into force on 21 July and, from what we can see, it
appears to be working relatively well. Some members of the Committee
who practise in the criminal courts may have their own view about
whether it is working well, but it seems to us to be working well and
to strike a correct balance between protecting the rights of the
defendant and making sure that witnesses who come forward to give what
can be vital evidence to make sure that justice is done in some pretty
difficult and serious cases will be fully protected, when that is
appropriate, and have their anonymity
guaranteed.</div>

Eagle:</b></i> If, in the course of an intimidatory tactic,
someone threatened to burn down a person&#146;s house if that person
gave evidence, that might be damage to property, but that might well be
enough to stop a witness coming forward and be willing to give
evidence, just as much as the threat of physical violence might be.
Such matters are not for me, as a Minister, to decide on, but very much
for the judge in the case to bear in mind when the prosecution makes an
application to the court to protect a witness by the use of anonymity.
It is something that a judge in a particular case with the
circumstances that he is looking at will make a judgment
about.</div><a name="09020343000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful to the Committee if I gave some statistics about what
has happened since that legislation came into force, because they might
be illuminating. The Crown Prosecution Service told me that 135
anonymity applications had been made to the courts up to the end of
December following the passage of the legislation, of which 129 were
granted and six refused. Of the applications granted, 43 were
civilians; 35 were undercover officers; 49 were test purchase officers;
and two were other police officers. All six applications that were
refused were for civilian witnesses and, of those cases, three were in
the magistrates court, one was in the youth court and the rest were in
the higher court.</div>

non-civilian cases have come up. One of the queries was that clause

carrying on such activities, or
otherwise).&#148;</div><a name="09020343000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has been interpreted as being intended to protect undercover officers.
The Minister suggests that that protection is being afforded in a large
number of the cases when an application is made. Why is that clause
necessary? If it is to protect undercover officers, why does it not
actually say
so?</div><a name="09020343000285"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> That is what it is for. I made that clear
during the passage of the legislation. I suspect that it is like that
because the Bill had to be done very quickly. I made it clear that that
provision meant national security and undercover work of the police and
relevant agencies, and that the reason behind such anonymity was to
enable the re-use of undercover officers. That is specifically
mentioned in the Strasbourg jurisprudence as an acceptable reason as
well. It is always important in any application before a judge that the
judge can choose whether or not it is appropriate in the individual
circumstances of the case, and he or she would certainly be able to do
that.</div>

witnesses to extremely serious crimes, such as homicides either
involving the use of guns and knives or related to gang-based crime, by
bringing forward in this legislation the earlier order&#151;the
investigation anonymity order. That might reassure witnesses to such
serious crimes enough to make them come forward to give their evidence
in the first place, long before a case gets to court. In such
instances, if that evidence were to be given at a trial, it would be
for the court or the judge to decide whether to make a witness
anonymity
order.</div><a name="09020343000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
including provision for the investigation anonymity order, the

there cases where it was impossible to establish a threat to personal
safety, but where there might have been a real threat to
property&#151;something that would be brought in under the new
law&#151;as that would seem to be justification for what you are
proposing? Equally, although it is more difficult to get a handle on
this, were there cases where applications may not have been made or
were frustrated, because, although you could go as far as the threat to
property test, you could not actually demonstrate at the time that
there was a direct threat to the individual&#146;s personal safety? I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><a name="09020343000408"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): My first
question for Mrs. Prentice is about the new framework.
Obviously, broadly, we shall have national oversight&#151;a national
coroner and a national service&#151;but also, quite rightly, we shall
keep the best of the localism that is in place. One of the concerns
that local authorities or police authorities will have is funding and
resourcing. Expectations will be raised by the changes in the Bill, but
how are resources going to be made available to ensure that we have,
across the country, an effective and efficient
service?</div><a name="09020343000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> Mr. Bellingham makes an
important point about the national and localised parts of the new
coroner service. There has been a debate about whether it should all be
nationalised or localised. We think that having a national chief
coroner who can set standards and give guidance and direction will
raise standards across the board, because in the past there has been a
great differential in the different coronial areas. On the whole in the
consultations it was felt that keeping a localised service was still
what most people preferred. It will therefore be funded locally, as it
is now, by local authorities or police authorities. However&#151;I am
pleased that Mr. Bellingham has raised that
question&#151;money will be forthcoming from the Department in
setting up the service. There will be something in the region of
&#163;10 million in set-up costs and another &#163;6.5
million in annual running costs, so we shall be putting in a
substantial amount of money to ensure that the service makes the kind
of difference that we want it to make for bereaved
people.</div><a name="09020343000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000409"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> There are some detailed questions that we
shall come on to in Committee, but will you explain why you feel that
it has to be a lawyer&#151;a barrister or a solicitor&#151;who
fills those posts, rather than a suitably qualified medic? Some
coroners practising today are doctors, and they are doing a superb job.
I note that the Bill says that they will be able to continue, but that
there will be a phasing-out of the medics. My concern is that we may be
excluding a potential pool of good coroners in the future, if we do not
allow medics to fill such positions. I speak as a lawyer, so I have a
vested interest.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="09020343000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> If you wish to become a coroner,
Mr. Bellingham, I am sure that we can arrange suitable
training. I am sure that you would be an excellent
coroner.</div><a name="09020343000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a balance of judgment again. The chief coroner and deputy chief
coroner will be High Court judges, so it is probably appropriate that
coroners are judicially trained, if I may put it that
way&#151;legally trained. Yes, there have been some very good
coroners from a medical background but, alongside the coroner service,
medical advisers will be able to give that medical input and advice to
the coroners. In the consultation on this part of the Bill, of which
there was a lot, it was felt that it was appropriate that they should
be legally trained, because it would give them the understanding of the
justice system in a way that was perhaps not always available in the
past.</div><a name="09020343000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><a name="09020343000410"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): If, in the future, a local
authority were unreasonably to starve a coroner&#146;s service of
resources, would the Department back the local authority in undermining
the coroner service in that way? Do you accept that there are no
provisions in the Bill enabling you to do something about it, even if
you did not
agree?</div><a name="09020343000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> We certainly would not back a local
authority that starved the coroner service of funding. There is a
provision in the Bill that allows the chief coroner to investigate and
make recommendations, which will highlight where an authority is
under-resourcing the service. Through the whole panoply of Government
resources and communications with local authorities, we would make it
clear very quickly to a local authority that they could not continue to
behave in that way.</div>
<a name="09020343000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000411"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Should there be a power, eventually, for the
Ministry to step in if that is the case&#151;especially if the chief
coroner is saying that that is
unacceptable?</div><a name="09020343000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> That is something that we would have to
consider. We would have to discuss the matter with colleagues in the
Department for Communities and Local Government, if a local authority
were to behave that badly, which would be similar to the situation
with, as I believe that you are suggesting, schools and other
services.</div>
<a name="09020343000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000412"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> These things happen, Minister.</div>
<a name="09020343000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> They do. It is certainly something that we
would have to consider for the future. But I would hope that, as a
result of this, local authorities would take their coronial service
very seriously&#151;I believe that most of them
do.</div>
<a name="09020343000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000413"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I have a few more questions about resources. The
Secretary of State seemed quite sympathetic on Second Reading about the
limited access to representation currently at the inquest. He clearly
does not want to open the floodgates to every coroner&#146;s court
hearing, with lots of lawyers being unnecessarily present.</div>
<a name="09020343000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> Certainly not.</div>
<a name="09020343000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000414"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Would you be willing to consider an amendment that
widened the present discretion that the Legal Services Commission has
to grant legal aid to people with good reason for representation at an
inquest?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="09020343000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> The discussion on Second Reading was a good
one, and we want to look at it more closely. It is also important to
put on the record that legal aid is available at inquests at the
moment. Admittedly, it is in a limited fashion, but it is available,
including at military inquests. That is not always as well known as it
ought to be. We would certainly look at further representation.
However, we must remember that inquests are not adversarial&#151;they
are inquisitorial and involve findings of fact. I do not want to see
panoplies of lawyers at inquests, if we can possibly avoid that. It is
the job of the coroner to find the
fact.</div><a name="09020343000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000415"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> That is a helpful answer. My last point is about
resources. On Second Reading, I mentioned the rule 43 reports that
coroners can make now to draw attention to ways in which we might
prevent similar deaths in the future. That is continued in schedule 4,
but Liberty says that at the moment it is a weedy
proposition&#151;there is a report, but nothing seems to happen as a
result of it and no one takes any notice. Do you agree that there
should be some strengthening of the procedure to highlight the fact
that the coroners have made these recommendations and that someone,
somewhere should do something about
it?</div><a name="09020343000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I am certainly open to strengthening it, if
it were felt that that was necessary. But the chief coroner will lay a
report before Parliament, so it can then be highlighted through the
parliamentary procedure. However, I would be happy to consider
strengthening that part, if it were felt that it was not going to
achieve what we want to achieve, which is a better service as a result
of a rule 43 investigation.</div>
<a name="09020343000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000416"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Again, that is helpful, thank
you.</div><a name="09020343000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><a name="09020343000417"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): I want to return briefly
to the issue of resourcing and pick up on the issues that
Mr. Kidney just raised. There seems to be potential for a
problem between lack of local resourcing and the implementation of
national standards. Are there any proposals to do things such as lay
down more prescriptive minimums for local authorities, taking account
of the funding already available, when doling out the money that the
Minister has mentioned in respect of the central subsidy to run
services? Some areas have problems with a lack of resources. Higher
standards are obviously to be welcomed, but what can be done to
guarantee
that?</div><a name="09020343000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I think that one of the first things that
the chief coroner might do, although I do not want to pre-empt them, is
to look at resources across the country and see what is available and
what local authorities are providing. I know that there are examples of
coroners who do not have adequate offices or places to conduct an
inquest properly. There is a lot of work and discussion to be done to
ensure that we raise standards right across the board. I think that we
will probably find that some of that can be done without additional
finance. With a bit more imagination in the use of public buildings,
the quality of accommodation could be
improved.</div><a name="09020343000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing that the chief coroner will be able to do is to look at
exactly how a local authority spends its resource for coroners and give
advice on how best to do that. As I have said, with the report to
Parliament and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>the Department, we would have to have discussions with colleagues about
whether local authorities were funding the service
properly.</div><a name="09020343000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000418"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> How does that relate to the introduction of the
proposed medical examiner system? It seems to me that it has been
widely welcomed, but it will build in some of the problems in the
coroners system. It will be locally funded but centrally monitored. We
already have local authorities and police authorities providing support
and resourcing to coroners. The ME provision will be resourced by local
health boards in Wales and primary care trusts in England. There seems
to be quite a lot of potential for nobody to fund it properly, for
everybody to think that someone else will put in the resources and for
us to end up with a gap. What can be done to ensure that that does not
happen?</div><a name="09020343000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I feel as though I am burdening the chief
coroner with a great deal&#151;indeed, I probably am&#151;but part
of the reason why we are going to have one is to ensure that that
resourcing is available. You have mentioned the medical examiners,
which is an important point. The medical examiners will be able to look
at deaths and death certification in the process. As a result, there
will probably be a significant reduction in the number of cases that
have to go to the coroner. At the moment, there is a great deal of
confusion among some medical practitioners about whether they need to
report deaths to the coroner. With the medical examiner as the gateway,
fewer cases will go to the coroner, which will free up resources that
would otherwise be used on unnecessary
inquests.</div><a name="09020343000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000419"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> One thing that appears to have happened in the
past 10 years or so is that the number of inquests seems to have
increased by more than 40 per cent., so clearly reform is
needed.</div>
<a name="09020343000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that the answer to my next question is, &#147;It will be given to the
chief coroner.&#148; Improved standards and higher quality
expectations are laid out in the Bill. Will there be any way to ensure
that the standards will be met, if the number of inquests rises
further? Will there be regulations concerning the number of coroners,
or will additional resourcing be tied somehow to ensure that quality
continues rather than dropping, if the number of inquests
increases?</div><a name="09020343000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> Yes. On the point about increasing
inquests, in recent years there has been in some parts of the country
an over-cautious response to sending cases to the coroner. One big
factor will be proper training for coroners, which will be funded
centrally to ensure that standards are raised and maintained. I hope
that you are assured that we will ensure that that happens. Again, if
we need more coroners, we will have to recruit more
coroners.</div>
<a name="09020343000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000420"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> My final question is about the posts of chief
coroner and deputy chief coroner. Why does the Bill make it clear that
coroners will not be able to apply for those posts, and that they will
have to be filled by High Court judges? It suggests that there is a
question about the ability of coroners, but that is unfair. The
Coroners Society has flagged up a concern that the expertise coroners
build up would be lacking from the central oversight.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="09020343000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> We made the chief coroner and deputy chief
coroner posts open only to High Court judges after discussions with the
Lord Chief Justice, and it was felt that such people would have the
appropriate leadership skills and judicial experience. I understand the
Coroners Society&#146;s concern that there now seems to be a ceiling
on whether they can become the deputy chief coroner, so I should like
to explore that matter further. We want to have high-quality coroners
and there ought to be a career path for them. At the moment, however,
there are some practical difficulties with opening the positions up to
senior coroners, but I should like to have further discussions with the
judiciary about whether there is a way for coroners to get other
judicial experience. The way in which the Bill is currently set out and
the system will work means that they would have to become district
judges, for example, get their experience that way and return to the
coroners system. I would look to see if there was another way of
achieving that, however, because I understand that there are some
excellent senior coroners, and it would be a shame if that expertise
were not kept and used in the whole system.</div>
<a name="09020343000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000421"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Briefly, Minister, I have three quick questions.
First, in carrying out investigations, the chief coroner will
presumably have the right either to do so privately or to make
conclusions public. You talked about transparency earlier, but I
imagine that there might also be cases whereby a coroner&#146;s
competence to continue, whether because of medical illness or
otherwise, was raised. There might need to be discrete inquiries and a
retirement might take place. I presume that the default mode will be a
public investigation and a conclusion on the record both for you, as
Minister, and for us, as the general
public.</div><a name="09020343000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> Yes,
absolutely.</div><a name="09020343000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000422"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Secondly, on resourcing, you will be familiar
with the discussions about military inquests and the strain on the
coroners involved. That may not be the only case in which a particular
need arises, however. For example, there could be a rash of
industrial-induced deaths, from mesothelioma or whatever, and it might
concentrate in a cluster. Would it be for the chief coroner to make
public recommendations to you, and, ultimately, for you to resource
that spike in the workload in a coroner&#146;s
area?</div><a name="09020343000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i><b class="B"> </b>There was a problem with the
military inquests and we resourced that by putting extra money into the
two areas where they were being held. Under the new system, such
inquests will not necessarily be concentrated in Oxford or Wiltshire,
as there will be the opportunity for bodies to be repatriated closer to
their families. That is one change.</div>
<a name="09020343000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The example
that you gave&#151;or a terrorist attack, or something big that could
be termed a national emergency&#151;would put great strain on a
particular coroner. We are in discussions about how that could be
resourced and funded.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000423"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> That is really helpful and leads on to my final
question. Within the terms of the Bill, can you confirm whether what
might be termed the transfer of cases will be easier? That is in
relation partly&#151;and I hope primarily&#151;to the wishes and
convenience of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>next of kin. I presume that it will be part of the chief
coroner&#146;s remit to look at the distribution of resources. In a
hypothetical situation, if a coroner in an adjacent county was
relatively idle&#151;in Oxfordshire vis- -vis my own county of
Northamptonshire, for example, or Wiltshire&#151;could the case be
transferred? At the moment, my experience has been that coroners are,
perhaps justly, jealous and proud of their own jurisdictions. Perhaps
it will be easier in the future to move things
around.</div>
<a name="09020343000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> That is absolutely
right.</div>
<a name="09020343000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000424"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the chief coroner broker that, so that
representations can be made if the family or the local authority do not
want that?</div>
<a name="09020343000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> Exactly. It would be for the chief coroner
to make those directions.</div>
<a name="09020343000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000425"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Briefly, I want to ask the Minister about
clauses 11 and 12. This is the most controversial section of this part
of the Bill and we will debate it at length in Committee. Existing
powers are in place to prevent the disclosure of harmful material:
there are public interest immunity certificates, reporting restrictions
and so on, and we are talking about only very few inquests where this
will apply. Do Ministers&#151;Mrs. Prentice, in
particular&#151;feel that damage will be done to the credibility of
the coronial service if these clauses become sections in the new Act?
Does she feel that the damage done will be worth it for the benefits
that accrue? We are talking about so few inquests, and powers are there
already to prevent harmful material from being made
available.</div>
<a name="09020343000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> No, I do not agree. It is right to say that
this will affect only a tiny number of inquests, and not some of those
that have been mooted in the media&#151;it will not affect military
inquests, for example. At the moment, where sensitive material has to
go before an inquest, it can be redacted. However, in cases of
extremely sensitive material relating to the security services, it
might be that the coroner would need to see the evidence. The family
can be involved in all other parts of the inquest. This would apply
only when dealing with extraordinarily sensitive material. That is why
clause 11 is necessary.</div>
<a name="09020343000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000426"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr Howarth, as the last inquisitor on this
section, may I ask that once you have spent your rounds on this
particular target, you adjust your sights and concentrate on the
section on sentencing?</div>
<a name="09020343000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><a name="09020343000427"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab): I
will try to comply with that target-shooting analogy, Mr.
Cook. I have a brief point on the coroners provisions. I have read them
and the notes on clauses. On Second Reading, I highlighted the
difficulties that bereaved families experienced in the
Hillsborough inquest. It is not clear to me how the reforms will apply
in a case where, for example, instead of there being an inquest about
one particular death, there is a series of mini-inquests about deaths
that took place within a wider disaster. I suspect that asking the
Minister to speculate on how that will work would be asking rather too
much. She may not be able to do that. Will she consider preparing a
memorandum on how she sees the reforms working in that sort of
case?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="09020343000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I will happily do that. I will not
speculate too much, except to say that under the reformed system there
will be proper training for coroners in dealing with multiple deaths
and therefore with a wide variety of families and
kinships.</div><a name="09020343000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000428"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> If I may interrupt, I am not talking about the
conduct of coroners, but about the
process.</div><a name="09020343000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I will come back with a memorandum on how
we envisage the process taking
place.</div><a name="09020343000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000429"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> I am grateful. I will move on to sentencing as
you requested, Mr. Cook. I have three, hopefully, quick
points. I should declare an interest in that I sat on the Gage working
party, which considered the Carter report that led to some of these
provisions.</div><a name="09020343000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
there has been speculation about the role of the Lord Chief Justice in
the new enhanced sentencing commission. The Gage working party took the
view that it would be asking too much of him to chair the commission.
However, there must be a role for him. What does the Minister think
that role might
be?</div><a name="09020343000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
on the balancing of correctional resources with sentencing, on Second
Reading the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr.
Grieve) said effectively that to try to do that would be to undermine
the principles of our criminal justice system. I think that he
misunderstood slightly what is being proposed. Will the Minister say
how there can be judicial independence while forecasting what
correctional resources are necessary to deal with the totality of
sentencing over a given
period?</div><a name="09020343000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
will the Minister comment on any role that Parliament might have in
dealing with sentencing guidelines that come from the new enhanced
sentencing
commission?</div><a name="09020343000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> First, may I say how useful it will be for the
Committee to have you present, Mr. Howarth, when we get to
this part of the
Bill?</div><a name="09020343000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000430"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> Too
kind.</div><a name="09020343000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> You will certainly keep me on my
toes&#151;not that other Committee members will not. It will be
helpful to have the experience you bring from having sat on the Gage
working
group.</div><a name="09020343000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the role of the Lord Chief Justice, the new council will have a
judicial majority and a judicial chair. The Lord Chief Justice will
appoint those members in consultation with the Lord Chancellor.
Similarly, he will be consulted by the Lord Chancellor, who will
appoint the non-judicial members of the council. He will certainly have
an important role to play in the composition of the individuals who sit
on the council. As head of the judiciary, he has an important general
role. It is probably correct that he is too busy and has too many other
important things to do to take a day-to-day part in the
council&#146;s
activities.</div><a name="09020343000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of establishing the council is not to produce a fetter to
wrap around individual judicial office holders in doing their jobs,
whether they be magistrates or judges. The Gage working group made it
clear that it did not think that &#147;correctional
resources&#148;&#151;I hate to use that horrible
phrase&#151;should be tied to the work that was part of what the
council took into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>account when producing its guidelines. That is not the intention. The
Government agree with the recommendation from the Gage working group
that they should not be tied together. I can make it clear that there
will be no connection between individual sentencing decisions and
correctional resources. No obligation will be placed on a sentencer in
a case to take resourcing into account when making his or her judgment
and dispensing justice as judges and magistrates do.</div>
<a name="09020343000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
a big improvement in the system of data collection and analysis
provided by the council, which will be able to predict the impact of
its guidelines on correctional resources and will give policy makers
and those responsible for finding the money&#151;Ministers and
officials in the Department&#151;much better and clearer information
about the implications of sentencing practice. That is the intention. I
hope that I can provide substantial reassurance to Committee members
and those in the wider world who fear that the purpose of the
sentencing council is to tie sentencing decisions in individual cases
to the available resources for prison places. That is neither the
intention nor what the Bill will do, if enacted in its current
form.</div><a name="09020343000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the role of Parliament, the Justice Committee already has a role in
considering such matters. We hope to ensure a continuing role for the
Committee, and we will be happy to hear from its Chairman, who is not
with us today&#151;he is not on the Bill Committee&#151;about what
he believes is the best way to proceed. We do not anticipate Parliament
having the capacity by regulation to implement the sentencing
guidelines, but we expect it to take its usual interest in such
matters. We will consider ways in which to achieve
that.</div>
<a name="09020343000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000431"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I, too, must declare an interest. If this Bill
becomes an Act, as a sentencer, I shall have to comply with the
Sentencing Guidelines Council&#146;s directions. Can you give us an
example of how the point about correctional resources will affect a
particular sentence? Sitting as a sentencer, will the judge or
magistrate look at guidance and read, &#147;The guideline sentence
for such and such a crime is x number of years&#148;, with an
addition reading, &#147;but we are a bit short of prison places this
week&#148;? Can you explain it in practical
terms?</div><a name="09020343000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> No, there will be no such addition to the
guidelines for individual
sentences.</div><a name="09020343000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000432"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> What is the practical difference? Apart from the
duty to follow, which is new, what is the real difference between what
is currently in place and what is
proposed?</div><a name="09020343000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>There will be a duty to follow,
as you put it, subject to an interests of justice test. It will always
be for the sentencer to decide, on the basis of the facts, and the
aggravation and mitigation in front of him or her, what happens in an
individual case. Although there will be an enhanced duty to follow the
guidelines, there will be ranges and the capacity for the sentencer to
depart from the guidelines, in the interests of justice. It is for the
sentencer to decide what is in the interests of justice. There is no
fettering of discretion. The real difference is that there will be much
more information and monitoring of what is happening, and of the impact
of the guidelines and the sentences.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div><a name="09020343000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000433"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Will that information be for the use of Ministers
and public policy makers, or for the use of sentencers? What is the
point of collecting the information if it is not to influence
sentencers?</div><a name="09020343000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> It ought to be useful for all, but there will
not be an obligation on the individual sentencer in an individual case
to take into account available resources, such as the local prisons.
That is not what we seek to do. There will be more monitoring and
information about the impact of sentences on rehabilitation and
punishment, and there will be more information about the variation in
sentencing practice from area to area. There will be more and better
information, and more monitoring, which will be available for both
policy makers and sentencers. There will be no commensurate obligation
for a sentencer on an individual case to take into account available
resources, such as what prison places are like
locally.</div><a name="09020343000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000434"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Is not the more intellectually honest position to
take this: we&#151;the Ministry of Justice&#151;will collect this
information, and based on that information, we will advise judges to
alter their sentences according to the resources that are available in
any particular aspect of the correctional system?</div>
<a name="09020343000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> No, Ministers will not be doing
that.</div>
<a name="09020343000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000435"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Will you not be placing on the judiciary an
additional factor? Beyond the facts of the case, judges will also be
influenced by the information that is pouring down from the Ministry of
Justice, which will have been drawn up by the information-gathering
system that you have just been talking about, otherwise there is no
point in
it.</div><a name="09020343000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> With respect, I think that there is a point to
these changes because they will ensure that there is better monitoring
of what currently happens, and that better information is available
both to policy makers and sentencers, none of which will impact on the
individual sentencing discretion of either the magistrate or the judge
in a particular case to do justice. Judges will not be fettered in any
way by the provisions in the legislation.</div>
<a name="09020343000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000436"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> But clause 107(1)(a) says that every court must
&#147;follow any sentencing guidelines.&#148; Those sentencing
guidelines will be informed by the resource information that someone
has gathered.</div>
<a name="09020343000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000437"></a>The

and then express dissatisfaction with the
answers.</div><a name="09020343000171"></a>

Michael:</b><b class="B"> </b>I want to raise three points. Again, I am
conscious that our time is limited, so if you want to give a headline
and expand afterwards, I will be happy with that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div><a name="09020343000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, in the
information that you have given to the Committee on the assessment of
the impact of the Bill, I was rather concerned to see, in the reference
to the sentencing council, a lot of emphasis on closer adherence to
sentencing ranges. As a member of the Justice Committee&#151;you are
right to think that that Committee could be of great assistance to
Ministers and officials if that opportunity is taken&#151;I ask
whether it is not in the interests of effectiveness to reduce
reoffending? It is the effectiveness of sentencing that should be
emphasised rather than narrowing ranges. That seems to go against what
you have been saying to us.</div>
<a name="09020343000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> It is correct that the more information that
sentencers have about the efficacy of sentences that might be available
to them, the better positioned they are to make their judgments in
individual cases. That will not be tied into saying in this particular
instance that only a certain type of sentence will be available
according to available correctional
resources.</div><a name="09020343000176"></a>

Michael:</b> I would be a lot happier if that were visible in
what the Department is saying about the intentions. I support the idea
of the sentencing council. Clearly, the use of data to ensure that
sentencing is effective is the whole point. Again, we have a majority
of judges, to which we have already referred. I cannot say that that
reassured me. In fact, it had the opposite effect. We need people who
will be critically examining the evidence on what works within the
sentencing system. In a recent Justice Committee, we heard from the
previous Lord Chief Justice about the lack of confidence of judges in
community sentences. We have also heard about some recent research on
the lack of knowledge of community sentencing. That might explain why
we have a lot of ineffective
sentencing.</div><a name="09020343000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Maria
Eagle:</b></i> I hope that the extra availability of
information and monitoring will make the effectiveness of sentences
much clearer, more transparent and more open to sentencers to
see.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000446"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I want to refer to clause 19. I welcome the
attempts to improve the accuracy of death certification, particularly
with regard to after-use of death certificates. My hon. Friend will
know that epidemiologists are interested in death certificates, but my
greater interest is in the misuse of drugs and, indeed, in those that
cause death.</div>
<a name="09020343000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important
publication from St. George&#146;s hospital is produced by gathering
coroners&#146; information. It is on drug-related deaths as reported
by coroners in England and Wales. I have had discussions with Hamid
Ghodse, who is one of the compilers of that information, and he
sometimes makes the criticism that death certificates do not always
mention the drugs that people were using when they died. Therefore my
question to the Minister is whether any consideration has been given to
making sure that the medical examiner and even the death certificate
has proper and accurate information with respect to the drugs that the
person was on before
death?</div><a name="09020343000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> To be honest, we have not looked at that
issue in terms of the way in which the form would be set out. However,
we are obviously having discussions with both the coroner and medical
examiner fraternity as to whether they should specify what drugs have
been used. Certainly, on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Wyre
Forest (Dr. Taylor) made some telling remarks about some of the
information that is put on death certificates. At the moment, it would
clearly not be acceptable under the new
system.</div><a name="09020343000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000447"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> I think that I am flagging up a point of discussion
in Committee.</div>
<a name="09020343000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000448"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The question on data sharing is not whether it is
always a good or bad thing because obviously it is sometimes both; the
question is why the provisions of the Bill are drawn so broadly? Why
are they drawn up to allow any person to share any data on the basis of
any Government policy, regardless of what any enactment says, apart
from the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000? Why does the Bill
allow data sharing to include using data for purposes entirely
different from those for which the data was originally handed over?
That is not information sharing; it is something quite different. The
Bill allows the organisation that originally collected the data,
without any other organisation being involved, to be authorised to use
the information for another purpose. Surely that is all far too
broad.</div><a name="09020343000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I say gently to Mr. Howarth that
he is exaggerating the situation&#151;it is not quite as all-singing
and all-dancing as he has described. The inclusion of this part of the
Bill is entirely a result of the review by the Information Commissioner
and Mark Walport, who pointed out that there is currently a great deal
of confusion about the law concerning data sharing. For example, some
are overly cautious about sharing data 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>that they are legitimately able to share, while in other cases where it
would be good to share data, there are legal impediments to doing so.
That is why this part of the Bill has been drawn in the way that it
has. Also, we have always said that if we want to make requirements
about data sharing, they would have to be in primary legislation. That
is why the provision in the Bill is so
detailed.</div><a name="09020343000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000449"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Thomas and Walport report said that there
should be a fast-track process for allowing data sharing, but only in
specific circumstances. The trouble with the Bill is that it is not
specific at all; it is enormously broad. They also said that they did
not think that the fast track should be allowed to facilitate big
changes in Government policy, such as getting rid of the existing
safeguards on the data collected for the purposes of identity cards and
so on&#151;DNA or medical records. There is no such safeguard in the
Bill. It seems to me that the Thomas and Walport report has been taken
as a starting point, but the Bill goes way beyond that.</div>
<a name="09020343000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I am not sure whether it does, and I am not
sure whether the Information Commissioner would agree with you that it
does&#151;in fact, I think that he would take quite a different view.
The Bill does not actually allow for indiscriminate data sharing across
Whitehall or across public authorities. The order-making power permits
the Minister to bring forward specific proposals under specific
circumstances, so it is not as all-encompassing as you
describe.</div><a name="09020343000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000450"></a>David
Howarth:</b> But the circumstances&#151;the pursuance of any
Government policy&#151;are not specific. Obviously, the Government do
not have to tell anybody what their policies are; in fact they could
act in pursuance of some new policy that they have just made
up.</div><a name="09020343000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> One of the aspects of this Government is
that we are constantly telling people what our policies
are.</div><a name="09020343000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000451"></a>David
Howarth:</b> You do not have
to.</div><a name="09020343000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I dare say, but it is generally not good
government not to tell people what the policy
is.</div><a name="09020343000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
order must be specific, and say what information must be shared, why it
must be shared and with whom. That is fairly specific, and it needs to
be proportionate too. Of course, it would also have to receive scrutiny
under the privacy impact assessment. Having all those things in place
should reduce the concerns that you have about it being too
all-encompassing.</div><a name="09020343000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000452"></a>David
Howarth:</b> What about sharing information with private
sector organisations, which are not covered by human rights
legislation, for example? Surely that goes too far. If that is to be
done, it should be done by primary legislation or
nothing.</div><a name="09020343000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> That issue about private sector
organisations is important and the Minister, therefore, would have to
be very concerned about allowing information to be shared with the
private sector without a very good reason. That would have to be taken
into
account.</div><a name="09020343000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000453"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Briefly, there are some constructive suggestions
made by the Information Commissioner in a note to the Committee,
particularly in relation to linking the data-sharing code of practice
explicitly to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>the information-sharing orders. Given that simplicity and getting the
balance right is the challenge with all of this, will she take those
points on board and consider the other points in his
memorandum?</div>
<a name="09020343000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bridget
Prentice:</b></i> I certainly will. I met the Information
Commissioner to discuss the Bill and I am happy to consider those
issues further. The Information Commissioner has also said that he
would be more than happy to meet members of the Committee if we wish to
discuss some of these issues in
detail.</div>

<a name="09020343000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000458"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> In relation to what is to be found in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09020343000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether I could ask you, Professor Horder, to concentrate on part 2,
chapter 1, which deals with murder, infanticide and suicide&#151;it
is the part of the Bill with which you would be particularly concerned.
I mean this in both senses of the word&#151;concerned with and
concerned about.</div>
<a name="09020343000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
read into the record all that you have said in your memorandum but I
wonder if you could give us a brief outline of your worries about the
shape of the provisions in this section of the Bill. You have some
quite fundamental concerns, I think, about the way the Bill is
currently drafted.</div>
<a name="09020343000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> May I start by saying it is a great privilege
to be here? I am delighted to be invited to try to give you some
assistance on the Bill.</div>
<a name="09020343000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think you
have had my written evidence; I would like to make two main points
about the Bill. Clearly, a good deal of it is based on the Law
Commission&#146;s recommendations. Unusually, the Law Commission
looked at this twice within a short period of time&#151;once in 2004
and then again in 2006. As a result of that, the diminished
responsibility provisions, which are in this part, largely follow the
Law Commission&#146;s recommendations and those were based on wide
consultations, as I indicated. I am not worried about those
particularly, although it is possible that others may have some
concerns. I want to concentrate, if I may, on provocation; reflection
on at least some of the provisions would benefit the changes as a
whole.</div>
<a name="09020343000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I
could just raise this issue of loss of self-control, which I know is a
vexed one. I would just like to say a brief word by way of background.
Loss of self-control has never been defined as such, in law. It
conjures up an image of someone going berserk or something of that
kind, completely losing all ability to control themselves, but it has
never been as narrow as that. It appeared in the Victorian period, like
a lot of &#147;self&#148; words such as
&#147;self-restraint&#148;, &#147;self-denial&#148; and so on.
Before that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>time, the law just used phrases like &#147;heat of blood&#148;, and
so on. That is important because a lot of cases will involve instances
where someone did something&#151;they were affected by the heat of
the moment and they allowed it to affect their judgment in some
way.</div>
<a name="09020343000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Loss of
self-control will be a broad concept&#151;a lot of cases will pass
the threshold by being ones where there is evidence of a loss of
self-control in that broader sense. It is important to bear that in
mind, which brings me to my first point in relation to clause 41(5)
which
states:</div><a name="09020343000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
a charge of murder, if sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue
with respect to the
defence&#148;</div><a name="09020343000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
loss of self-control,</div>
<a name="09020343000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the jury must
assume that the defence is satisfied unless the prosecution proves
beyond reasonable doubt that it is
not.&#148;</div><a name="09020343000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a concern about whether that is necessary. The explanatory notes
say that it is to clarify the burden of proof, but I do not think there
was much ambiguity about the burden of proof and where it lay in
provocation cases. I have overplayed my hand a little in my written
submission, but the point remains that there is no restriction under
clause 41(5) on whose case it may be as to how this evidence is
adduced. It could even be the prosecution&#146;s evidence.</div>
<a name="09020343000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">One could
have a case where an armed officer is charged with murder, that officer
wishes to be acquitted on the grounds of self-defence and the
prosecution&#146;s case is that the officer lost his or her temper,
acted disproportionately and should for that reason be convicted of
murder. One of the curious features of the way this clause operates is
that, quite conceivably, the prosecution&#146;s case would amount to
sufficient evidence adduced to raise an issue and so on. That would
mean, according to this, that the jury must assume the defence is
satisfied, which means, as a result of subsection (7), that the
defendant stands to be found guilty of manslaughter, which is
inconsistent with their case as a whole because they want to say that
they are not guilty of anything&#151;they claim
self-defence.</div>
<a name="09020343000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
saying that you cannot get around that, but there is something curious
about the way it is set up, and I do not think that that subsection is
needed. If you delete it and then you put in subsection (6)&#151;I am
sorry if this is a bit detailed&#151; &#147;for the purposes of
subsection (1)&#148;, that is, for the purposes of
establishing the defence, &#147;sufficient evidence is adduced to
raise an issue and so on&#148;, that will pretty much get you where
you want to go, without using presumptions and so
on.</div><a name="09020343000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000459"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Is there another way of dealing with that? If you
look at amendment 2, you will see that it states:</div>
<a name="09020343000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
41, page 25, line 18 after
&#145;adduced&#146;&#148;.</div><a name="09020343000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
make no claims for originality&#151;and you must not accept the blame
for this&#151;but I drew that from your submission. Do you think that
that amendment would assist in making this Bill marginally
better?</div><a name="09020343000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> I think that it would. It might be even
simpler just to get rid of that subsection altogether. I am not sure
that it plays a useful function. I said in my evidence that I was a
little uneasy about linking the introduction of a defence solely or
mainly to evidence produced by the defence. That goes slightly against
the grain. One could do it in that way, but another way,
as  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>I have just indicated, is to get rid of clause 41(5) entirely. That is
something that might be considered, because I am slightly concerned
about how these cases are going to run when it is the
prosecution&#146;s case, oddly enough, that there was a loss of
self-control. Equally, your amendment might meet the
case.</div><a name="09020343000221"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000460"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I know that we are short of time and I do not
want to be unfaithful to your written submission, which we have.
Perhaps I can move you on to the slow-burn issue, where we deal with
the proximity point about whether the loss of self-control has been
aroused. I ask you to look at clause 42(3) which
says:</div><a name="09020343000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
subsection applies if D&#146;s loss of self-control was attributable
to D&#146;s fear of serious violence from V against D or another
identified
person.&#148;</div><a name="09020343000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
time scale is put there, and I wonder, considering amendment 3, whether
you think that that is a sensible way forward to limiting the
ambit?</div><a name="09020343000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> That is an interesting proposal, and I would
need to think about it more. It would draw the law a little closer to
the position that now obtains in Scotland, where there is a requirement
of suddenness, but understood more broadly than the way in which it was
understood here, when it related to loss of self-control. There is no
loss of self-control requirement, but there is a suddenness requirement
in Scottish law&#151;I think that that is the position.</div>
<a name="09020343000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether or
not that is so, the proposal would try to narrow the time frame, which
would be helpful. That is necessary because it is unclear under the
present law what the justice is of allowing someone to brood for days
or weeks and then, when they come across the ultimate victim, explode
with rage just from seeing them. There is no fresh provocation. Many
people would call that a revenge killing, despite the ultimate loss of
self-control. Under the old law there would have had to have been a
continuing heated blood episode during which the person was
killed&#151;you were not allowed to calm down and then boil up again.
That is the concern and that clause might well meet the
point.</div>
<a name="09020343000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
issue would be of over-complicating the law if we had too many of these
kinds of amendments. It is a difficult area. One can see how the law
ended up stating that there must be a sudden loss of self-control; it
is trying to meet the point that you are making here.</div>
<a name="09020343000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned, though, about what the courts will do when confronted by
cases where there is forearming&#151;where someone goes off to get a
weapon before coming back and then killing the victim. What we hoped in
the commission was that that would be dealt with by the objective
question of whether a reasonable person might have done as the
defendant did. While focusing on the loss of self-control, one must
bear in mind that that is always there as a safety net or long stop.
Juries will not take the view that reasonable people will go off and
forearm themselves heavily in order to be ready for a confrontation;
that is not a reasonable thing to do.</div>
<a name="09020343000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000461"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> You also have some concerns about the sexual
infidelity issue referred to in clause
42(6)(c).</div><a name="09020343000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> Yes. My concerns so far are about tweaking or
reshaping the law a little. I do not think that they are of as much
fundamental importance as this one. This has been controversial within
the legal community and beyond.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="09020343000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
various, perhaps rather disparaging, remarks about clause 42(6)(c).
Now, having reflected on it further, I wonder whether it is sensible to
put in primary legislation&#151;hard law&#151;the matters concerned
in clause 42(6). Would it not be better if those are set up as
guidelines for judges, as things to which they should refer before they
direct the jury, as is commonly the case anyway? Would it not be better
if they agree with counsel beforehand exactly how they will direct the
jury on provocation, and on what they will
say?</div>
<a name="09020343000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
risk that clause 42(6)(a), (b) and (c) are micro-management of the
judicial direction to the jury, and they might be better purely as
guidelines. There is a broader issue about clause 42(6), but clause
42(6)(c) is too categorical in its terms. In particular, the idea of
something that is said constituting sexual infidelity is a rather
curious one; I wonder whether that is, in fact, what is being aimed
at&#151;others may be able to speculate on that with a greater degree
of information than I
can.</div><a name="09020343000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000462"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> Where does intoxication fit in with loss
of control?</div>
<a name="09020343000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> The traditional view has always been that in
deciding whether clause 41(1)(c) is satisfied&#151;that a person of
the defendant&#146;s sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance
and self-restraint, might have reacted in the same way&#151;the judge
will automatically say to the jury that intoxication must be
disregarded, and you would not need to do anything to ensure that. For
a belt-and-braces approach, you could stick something in on that, but
it is second nature to judges to say that that should be disregarded.
That refers, of course, to voluntary intoxication, as it is a different
matter when it is involuntary, but we can leave that to one
side.</div>
<a name="09020343000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there has always been a question mark over whether intoxication is
relevant in deciding whether there was a loss of
self-control&#151;the old, co-called subjective condition&#151;and
whether in fact that was produced in part by intoxication. There is
some authority, although not very satisfactory, to the view from the
beginning of the 20th century that stated that you do take intoxication
into account when deciding whether someone in fact lost their
self-control. There is some authority to that effect, although it has
not been tested in the courts since, as far as I know, and it would be
interesting to see what they would say about that.</div>
<a name="09020343000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That might
sound worrying, but the point to grasp is that whether someone feared
serious violence or lost self-control are purely matters of empirical
fact, so anything that led or may have led to the loss of self-control
is relevant to the establishment of that fact, including intoxication.
I do not think that one need worry, because the defendant is in a real
dilemma here. If they say, &#147;The reason I lost self-control was
because I was intoxicated&#148;, they will get caught when the swing
comes around on the objectives point, because the judge will say,
&#147;Aha, a reasonable person would not have done as you
did.&#148; So we are probably alright on that
point.</div>
<a name="09020343000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000463"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I have two questions. My first is on loss of
self-control and the nature of it, which has never been defined. If
loss of self-control is quite an easy test to fulfil, how will the
clause as drafted lead to 10 to 20 more convictions for murder a year,
which is what the Government claim it will do? Where would those extra
convictions for murder, as opposed to manslaughter, come
from?</div>

Horder:</b></i> There is an element of speculation here. I
listened to what the Minister said about that issue and did not
disagree with anything she said. I think that the number of cases in
which the question will be whether self-control was or was not in fact
lost will be minuscule, or at least very small.</div>
<a name="09020343000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
wishing to sound like a Government spokesperson, I will say that the
Bill is designed to tighten up the law to get rid of the cases that are
an affront to the justice system. In such cases, the defence is getting
in front of the jury, where it should not be, and they are acceding to
it not because the jury lacked common sense, but because the way the
law is structured means that the judge might give it disproportionate
emphasis by mentioning it in the way the law requires him to explain
it, and the jury might understandably be misled into thinking that the
defence applies in some way, and that results in
injustices.</div><a name="09020343000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
general terms, I think that the Bill addresses those concerns. I do not
want to disagree in any way with what the Government said about the
numbers of convictions likely to be affected, but it is to a certain
extent a matter of speculation. We do not know whether those clauses
might result in the defence being more inclined to plead it than it has
hitherto been. I simply do not
know.</div><a name="09020343000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000464"></a>David
Howarth:</b> What you are saying would be achieved simply by
subsections (5) and (6) of clause 41, or subsection (6) as you would
redraft it, because that would take the ridiculous cases away from the
jury and there would be no need to do anything at all.</div>
<a name="09020343000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> If you mean that that is the only clause in
which we need to reform provocation, I am not sure that that is
right.</div><a name="09020343000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000465"></a>David
Howarth:</b> No, I am talking about the effect that you
mentioned.</div><a name="09020343000242"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> It would have the chilling effect in those
terms, but the Bill rightly addresses other issues on the kinds of
characteristics that can be relevant, which are mentioned in clause 41,
and of course the broadening of the defence to include fear of serious
violence cases. That is an important step forward, and it is just not
credible that the common law could take that step now. There was an
opportunity back in the &#146;50s, but that will not happen again in
common law, so in that sense justice needs to be done through
legislation.</div><a name="09020343000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000466"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That would reduce the number of murder
convictions rather than increase it.</div>
<a name="09020343000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> That may be right, but, ironically, it might
increase the number of manslaughter convictions, because there may be
cases in which the jury splits the difference. That raises some
concerns, but it is difficult to predict the exact result in the
courts. I do not think, however, that the impact will be
huge.</div>
<a name="09020343000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000467"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That was the first point. The second point is
about the meaning of clause 42(4)(b). It sets out the defence, whereby
the thing</div>
<a name="09020343000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;caused D to
have a justifiable sense of being seriously
wronged&#148;.</div><a name="09020343000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
do you think that will be interpreted&#151;especially
&#147;justifiable&#148; and &#147;seriously&#148;? Are they
questions for the jury, for the defendant&#151;that the defendant
thought it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>justified and serious&#151;or for the judge, whereby he could take the
case away from the jury on the point that he thought that the proposal
could not be justified or count as being serious?</div>
<a name="09020343000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> The straightforward answer is a mixture. It
is a question for the judge in the initial case of whether to leave the
issue to the jury, because he must decide whether a properly directed
jury could conclude that the defence applies&#151;meaning the entire
picture, including whether those words might be satisfied. In that
sense, as a threshold matter, it is a concern for the judge. But, once
it has passed the judge and is in the realm of the jury, they will have
to consider whether the words are satisfied.</div>
<a name="09020343000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">You asked,
what does that mean? It means that, rightly, there will be more of a
burden&#151;not legal but tactical&#151;on the defendant to explain
himself or herself, and to answer the question, &#147;Why did you
respond in this way to the words, conduct, whatever it might be? Give
an account that gives the court a sense of why there was a justifiable
sense of being seriously wronged in the way that you reacted or took
what was said or done.&#148; Currently, that burden does not really
exist at all. As soon as there is any evidence of provocation, the
judge leaves the matter to the jury and the defendant is not called on,
tactically or in any other way, to explain themselves.</div>
<a name="09020343000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">By that I do
not mean that there will be undue pressure to give evidence when there
would not otherwise be. I am talking not about inroads on the right to
silence, but about a general tactical matter. It is entirely
reasonable&#151;from the viewpoint not just of victims&#146;
families but of the jury and the court as a whole&#151;to expect the
defendant to give some account of why he or she responded lethally, and
the provision will do something to achieve
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09020343000468"></a>The

to assisted suicide.</div>
<a name="09020343000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000469"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> On clause 46, do you know the Government&#146;s
motives for rewriting the language? In the words of the explanatory
notes, it is to &#147;modernise the language&#148;, but do you
agree that the clause simply restates the existing law and does not
change it?</div>
<a name="09020343000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> If there is a change, it is not significant.
Modernisation always involves at least some change, otherwise what is
the point? I think, however, that the measure is consistent, and I
support it because its use of language is consistent with that which
the Law Commission has recommended across the board when someone
contributes to another person&#146;s crime or, in this case, act of
suicide. We, at the Law Commission, after extensive consultation
identified encouragement and assistance as the essence of what is going
on and got rid of the language of aid, abet, counsel and procure. As
you would expect, judges have bent those words into shape so that they
will work and just about pass muster, but from time to time, there will
inevitably be cases that put pressure on the meaning of those words.
One keeps having to go back to what was meant by them in the 1861
statute, and even before that, since that was only a consolidating
statute. There is still a debate about whether it was meant to just
restate the common law or do something new. We need to get past that
debate and use 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>this&#151;I believe&#151;more modern language. Although I accept
that there may be some changes that have not been foreseen, we have
spent enough time looking at the meaning and scope of this wording to
be confident that the changes that are made, if any, are
minimal.</div><a name="09020343000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000470"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> In your estimation, would that not lead to an
increase in
prosecutions?</div><a name="09020343000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> I am not sure that I am competent to answer
that question. If it is not intended to do that, and I do not believe
that it is, it would be rather a surprise if that was the effect that
it had. In any event, I am not sure that there is any extra scope or
range that a prosecutor could latch on to. It is always possible that
if you modernise wording people suddenly understand it and start to use
the law more. That is conceivable, but we all know that prosecuting in
these cases is, or may be, an extremely sensitive and difficult
matter.</div><a name="09020343000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give you an example of when I think that the wording has been
understood. We will all remember that incident reported in the
newspapers when a young man, I think, was standing on the side of a
building considering jumping off and the crowd below was shouting,
&#147;Go on! Jump! Do it!&#148; The police got very cross and said,
&#147;Although that is despicable and disgraceful, there is nothing
you can do to these people.&#148; That is completely wrong. Of course
you can prosecute them. You can prosecute them for aiding and abetting
suicide, but the language of aiding and abetting does not sound right
because it makes it sound as if they were up there giving him a shove
or something. So, if senior police officers can be misled by this
language into thinking that no prosecution can be undertaken in such a
case, we believe that the language of encouraging and assisting will
make it crystal clear that in, such cases, if you can arrest someone,
you can
prosecute.</div><a name="09020343000257"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000471"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> Young people&#151;teenagers in
particular&#151;often write poetry, song lyrics and other material
that has a feeling of death or helplessness about it, and post it on a
website. Other young people have access to those postings and might be
encouraged to attempt suicide. Would the poster of such information be
liable to prosecution under clause
46?</div><a name="09020343000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> I hope that that would not be the case. That
is not to say that I approve in any way of the publication or
dissemination of that sort of dark material, as one could call it. But,
one has to rely on proposed new subsection (1)(b) in clause 46, which
states that the act must be intended to encourage or assist a suicide
or an attempted suicide. I will not pretend to be at the cutting edge
of contemporary culture, but my understanding is that that sort of
posting of music, lyrics or whatever is not intended to produce that
effect. There may be extremely depressing songs&#151;there is a long
tradition of that&#151;but I do not believe that the material in any
of these instances, no matter how many people may have taken it as
their cue, was ever intended to have that
effect.</div><a name="09020343000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000472"></a>Dr.

opinion, protected under the
law.</div><a name="09020343000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> That sounds like an invitation to hang myself
out to dry, but yes, I believe that it is. It is protected by the need
to prove intention in that clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div><a name="09020343000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000473"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I take on board all that you say about proposed
new subsection (1)(b)&#151;the express requirement to prove intent to
encourage or assist&#151;but do you think that the use of
&#147;capable of encouraging or assisting&#148; in proposed new
subsection (1)(a) and elsewhere below is apt to assist? Is it not
adding a layer of froth or blancmange? Why do we not just say,
&#147;does an act that encourages or assists&#148;, rather than use
the words, &#147;capable of&#148;? The judge will make a decision
about whether the evidence is capable of proving the particular element
of the offence, and it will be for the jury to decide whether it does
so in fact, but we see &#147;capable of encouraging&#148; and
&#147;capable of encouraging or assisting&#148; throughout this set
of clauses on
suicide.</div><a name="09020343000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> The same phrase appears in the Serious Crime
Act 2007 and also in our recommendations for participating in crime
more generally. The issue is that these offences are committed, as you
know, in the inchoate mode, as we lawyers say. So you do not actually
have to have assisted or encouraged to commit the offence. In other
words, going back to the example I was talking about a moment ago,
where people in a crowd are shouting to the person up above, it would
be virtually impossible to do anything in a case like that if you had
to show that their voice carried all the way up there and was heard by
the person and they could say, &#147;Yes, it was his voice I
heard.&#148;</div><a name="09020343000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000474"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The problem relates to the city of Derby. The
superintendent of the Derbyshire police force said that Derby lost its
humanity on that day. Whether or not that is a sensible thing for him
to have said is neither here nor there. However, there could be an
issue, surely, in a case like that&#151;if you happened to light upon
one, two or three of the individuals in the crowd and brought them to
court and prosecuted them under this provision&#151;about whether
they actually intended something or whether they were just mouthing off
and about whether they had the requisite intent to encourage or
assist.</div><a name="09020343000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> That would certainly be an issue, but that is
the 46(2)(b) issue&#151;isn&#146;t it?&#151;rather than a
46(2)(a) issue. In other words, it is an issue about whether there was
an intent to encourage, not about whether they had done an act capable
of encouraging. If they are shouting, &#147;Jump!&#148;, that is
certainly an act capable of encouraging, I would have
thought.</div><a name="09020343000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000475"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Surely, the better question to ask in that
circumstance is, &#147;Did what they shouted encourage or
assist?&#148; Of course, one can only do that by inference, because
one does not know what is inside the dead person&#146;s
mind.</div><a name="09020343000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> That is the difficulty, really. I think that
we wanted to avoid a lot of cases that would be factually too difficult
to determine beyond reasonable doubt, or one way or another, about
whether there was encouragement or
assistance.</div><a name="09020343000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us take a silly example. If two people wish to assist someone to commit
suicide and both, unbeknown to each other, put a bottle of pills next
to the person&#146;s bed and the person takes one lot of pills but
not the other and it cannot now be determined whose pills they were, it
would be strange, in a way, if both of them were not in the same
position. They both did an act capable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>of assisting the suicide&#151;that is what they did wrong in terms of
the law&#151;and it should not really matter which one actually did
assist the suicide, because in a way  it is a matter of chance.
Who knows who it turned out to
be?</div><a name="09020343000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000476"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> It matters a lot to the two individuals who might
be prosecuted&#151;one without the intent and one with the
intent&#151;and, of course, the
prosecution&#151;</div><a name="09020343000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> I am assuming that they both have the intent.
Let us say that they both have the intent. They both put the pills on
the bedside table for exactly the same reason, but without realising
that the other bottle that happens to be there is there for the
self-same purpose. That is why I say it is a rather silly example. But
in a way there is an analogy with the Derby case, because lots
of people were
encouraging.</div><a name="09020343000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
irony is that, the more people there are encouraging, the harder it is
to say that any one of them did encourage. As a matter of proof, it is
difficult to say, then, is it not? That is why we think that, in terms
of the focus initially, it is clearer and simpler to say that there is
an inquiry in two parts here. First, was there an act capable of
encouraging? And if someone shouts &#147;Jump!&#148;, that
is certainly an act capable of encouraging. Secondly, under 46(2)(b),
you have to ask whether that act was intended to encourage. It may very
well be that, in that case, the person would say, &#147;Oh, I just
shouted the words because everyone else was shouting them. I am a bit
slow that way. I did not
realise.&#148;</div><a name="09020343000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000477"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Surely you are going through the same
intellectual hoops as you would under section 2 of the Suicide Act
1961, but just adding complications. Everyone who needs to know knows
what section 2 of that Act means and how it can be explained to the
jury, do they
not?</div><a name="09020343000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor

minutes.</div><a name="09020343000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> We would, broadly speaking, be in favour of
updating this language so that it is consistent with what we are
recommending across the board when person A becomes involved in the
perpetration of a crime or, in this case, a suicide by another person.
We think it makes sense to have the same language applying across the
board. We saw no reason, here, to say anything
different.</div><a name="09020343000275"></a>

80</b><b class="B"><a name="09020343000479"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Can I move you on to 2A, which deals with the
further rules on acts capable of encouraging or assisting? What is the
thinking behind 2A(2), which says
that</div><a name="09020343000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the facts are such that an act is not capable of encouraging suicide,
for the purposes of the act it is treated as encouraging suicide if the
facts had been as the defendant believed them to be at the time of the
act&#148;?</div><a name="09020343000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
that not going back to the days of impossible
attempts?</div><a name="09020343000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Professor
Horder:</b></i> It is, as you know, the law that you can
attempt the impossible. That is an important principle, because if I am
right about what is being said in that clause&#151;I have not had
cause to look at this for some considerable time&#151;it means, to
carry on with the example  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>of putting the pills on the table, that if it turns out that you put the
wrong pills out and they are just a placebo and would not do anything
to anybody, but you do not know that, you are caught by 2A. So as long
as you believe that they will be capable of assisting and
encouraging&#151;which you do, because you think they are whatever it
is you are putting on the table&#151;then that should be sufficient.
