<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning. I am confident that, with luck and good will, we may see the end of our proceedings today, although that is not in itself a good thing because I believe that everyone has enjoyed being here.

<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 346, in page 55, line 26, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) In section 351 (general duties in respect of the curriculum) after subsection (5) insert-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(6) Nothing in this section shall be taken to impose duties on a local education authority with regard to sex education.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 347 to 349.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Mr. Hancock, it is pleasing to see you again to help us at what might be our final sitting.

<P>
The purpose of the amendments is clear. They have one firm and central purpose: to protect children from inappropriate teaching and material in the delivery of sex education in schools. During the long debate that has taken place over the past few months, the Government have heard over and again that this is a central issue for everyone concerned with the provision of sex and relationship education in schools. The Government have listened to those concerns and have acted decisively on them. We are clear that teachers need positive and sensitive guidance on sex and relationship education, so we have consulted on new guidance which sets clear parameters for its delivery in schools. That guidance has been generally welcomed, but some concerns remain. That is why we are setting in statute some provisions relating to its delivery.

<P>
The overall effect of the amendments is to remove Baroness Young's amendment on Third Reading in the other place. At the end of that debate, Baroness Blackstone made it clear that the Government would seek to overturn the Young amendment in this House, and we are now doing that. In doing so, we have taken the opportunity to reconsider what is appropriate for primary legislation, what needs to be set out in legislation and what is appropriate for guidance. It will be helpful to explain the effect of the Government's amendments in turn.

<P>
Amendment No. 346 inserts a provision in section 351 of the Education Act 1996 to the effect that local education authorities have no power with regard to the provision of sex education in schools. The role of local education authorities has been a major concern for some people, and questions have arisen over the provision of sex education in schools. Scare stories have circulated about local authorities sending inappropriate material to schools. I believe that local authorities will act responsibly in this area, but we accept that there are concerns to be allayed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I want the Minister to make his case because this is a separate and freestanding amendment. He has moved in one easy step from the amendment, which refers to local education authorities, to the conduct of local authorities generally. It should be clear-perhaps he will confirm this-that we are discussing the conduct of LEAs. The amendment is not relevant to, although it is associated in some people's mind with, the conduct of local authorities generally, for example, under section 28.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, I am talking about local education authorities.

<P>
The amendment clarifies the position that has applied for a number of years. The duty to determine sex education policy in schools rests with individual schools, governing bodies and head teachers. It is best left to their professionalism. However, the myth remains that LEAs have powers to make schools provide sex and relationship education in a way that neither schools nor parents want. LEAs are not so empowered, and the amendment would make that clear beyond doubt.

<P>
Similarly, amendment No. 347 will remove the reference to ``local education authority'' from section 403, which deals with the manner of the provision of sex education. Again, that will make it clear that LEAs have no power to determine delivery of sex education in schools.

<P>
I am sure that the Committee will see the relevance and benefit of the amendments, but I should emphasise that their purpose is to clarify-they will not change existing relationships. Many LEAs provide helpful support to schools in the delivery of personal, social
and health education, and we expect that to continue. The amendments simply make it clear that the school, head teacher and governing body have the final say on sex education in schools.

<P>
Amendment No. 347 will also remove from clause 117 the reference to sexual health. The fact that sex education must pay due regard to the sexual health of young people is properly addressed in the guidance to which I have referred, and on which I shall expand in due course.

<P>
For completeness, I should add that amendment No. 349 confirms the effect of amendment No. 347 by amending schedule 10 repeals.

<P>
Amendment No. 348 lies at the heart of what we are trying to achieve. It will place a duty on the Secretary of State to issue guidance, so that pupils are protected from teaching and materials that are inappropriate to their age, and religious and cultural background. It will require governing bodies and head teachers to have regard to the guidance, which must include advice on any material produced by NHS bodies for the purpose of sex education in schools. NHS bodies are defined by reference to section 22 of the National Health Service Act 1977. The amendment also provides that the Secretary of State may revise the guidance at any time, and reaffirms parents' rights by requiring a school's statement of policy on sex education to recognise their right to withdraw their children from sex education.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): When looking at the guidance, will the Under-Secretary also consider use of the internet? Today's young people get an enormous amount of information from the internet, and the horse may have bolted before the stable door has been locked. For example, one need not be a sophisticated browser to log on to one of the many gay sex sites. I hasten to add that I am told about that: I do not frequently do such things myself.

<P>
This is a serious matter. We underestimate young people: they are sophisticated, and gather information from any available source. Before you tell me off for making a speech, Mr. Hancock, I ask the Under-Secretary to explain what steps the Secretary of State will take through the guidance to ensure proper use of the internet for sex education purposes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am happy to give way to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell).

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his understanding, which enables me to reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). The issue of internet use does not always relate to sex education, but many schools now have on-line access to the internet, and it is particularly important that, when on school premises, pupils are not allowed to access information to which they might otherwise not have access.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Both interventions were useful. If our purpose is to prevent inappropriate teaching or use of materials, we must be aware of new technologies and the dangers that the internet can pose, and I undertake to see whether the guidance can be strengthened in that regard. As we are anxious that every child should have access to a computer, for perfectly proper reasons, we must ensure that there are effective safeguards in our schools. However, as the intervention reminded us, when we draw up guidance we must not be naïve in thinking that that is the only way in which children-often young children-are introduced to sex and relationship matters. There are clear lessons involved for families, as well as for schools.

<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): Everyone accepts that there is a wealth of information on the internet to which young people ought not to gain access; certainly not during school time. However, most schools already control children's internet use-to stop time wasting, as much as to prevent them from getting hold of information. Similarly, most employers try to ensure that employees do not spend time surfing the internet for private pleasure when they are supposed to be doing their jobs. It would be over the top for the Bill to include additional guidance for schools, given that most schools probably have comparable rules already.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand the point that schools are wary about the matter, and issue their own rules and regulations. Last Friday, I visited a further education college and noticed, while at a learning centre, that proper supervision was taking place for the reasons that my hon. Friend mentioned. Without giving any absolute commitment, I have said that I will consider whether the guidance can usefully be strengthened. The interventions were helpful in that respect.

<P>
There has been much debate about what should be delivered through sex education in schools. Much of that debate has been ill informed and some of it has been extreme. We would do our teachers and the children in their care a disservice if we did not set out once and for all clear guidance for the provision in schools of education in this sensitive area, and back it up with effective legislation. One clear message has emerged: there is no place for inappropriate teaching or materials in the delivery of effective sex and relationship education. That is why we removed the Young amendment. Instead, we have concentrated on placing in primary legislation an amendment that gives statutory force to guidance that addresses this central issue.

<P>
Our new provision on guidance produced by NHS bodies is particularly significant, given the concerns that have been raised over recent months. We are now providing explicit reassurance that the Secretary of State's guidance must cover material that health authorities produce and send to schools. We also envisage that the Department of Health will issue guidance to health authorities to make it clear that such material must be in line with Department for Education and Employment guidance.

<P>
Members of the Committee will be aware that in March we issued draft guidance on sex and relationship education for consultation. The document was generally supported by those who responded, and we are now preparing a final version for publication to schools. The draft guidance covers a much wider range of issues than simply protection from inappropriate teaching materials. While its statutory force will focus specifically on protection from such materials, we expect that responsible governing bodies and head teachers will follow the guidance in full. In doing so, they will use materials in accordance with the personal, social and health education framework, which is based on tolerance and inclusion, and advocates that children should learn to respect difference.

<P>
Further assurances that schools and governing bodies will take a balanced, sensitive and inclusive approach are to be found: in the requirement for schools to publish their sex education policies and the right of parents to withdraw their children from sex education; in the activities of the Office for Standards in Education, which has a statutory responsibility to report on schools' teaching of spiritual, moral, social and cultural education; and through the implementation of the national healthy schools standard, to which we expect most schools to commit themselves in the next few years, and which has as one of its criteria that schools should teach according to the sex and relationship education guidelines.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The guidance will address the issues that the Government have brokered with the Churches and others. It will be firmly rooted in the personal, social and health education framework and the national curriculum, which was launched in September 1999. It will require that pupils be taught about the nature and importance of marriage for family life and the bringing up of children, and should learn the significance of marriage and stable relationships as key building blocks for community and society. The guidance will require that care is taken to ensure that there is no stigmatisation of children, based on their home circumstances, and provide for pupils to be given accurate information and help to develop skills to enable them to understand difference and to respect themselves and others, with the purpose of preventing and removing prejudice.

<P>
The guidance makes clear the unacceptability of bullying because of sexual orientation-it is part of our general concern to ensure that there is no bullying in any of our schools-and reinforces other guidance on pupil behaviour issued by the Department in a document called ``Social Inclusion: Pupil Support Circular 10/99''. Secondary level pupils will be taught to understand human sexuality and about the reasons for delaying sexual activity, the benefits to be gained from that delay and how to obtain appropriate advice on sexual health. Schools will be expected to set in place arrangements to protect pupils from inappropriate teaching and materials.

<P>
The safeguards provided by the amendment and the clarification given by the guidance will allow us to move from excited debate to sensible practice. Teachers will know what should be taught.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not seeking to inflame the debate in any way, but I would like the Under-Secretary to tell the Committee why he thinks it appropriate to include provisions relating to the prevention of harm in the Bill, while other important matters-on which useful guidance is being given-are dealt with in guidance. Why is there a hierarchy of issues, as the amendment suggests?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> This needs to be seen in the context of the debate that has already taken place-not in the Committee, but in another place. That has been an excited and controversial debate, and the Government's attempts to achieve consensus have not always been successful.

<P>
We are attempting, on the basis of clear criteria, to get the balance right. Although some of the concerns expressed are exaggerated, there are legitimate public concerns about inappropriate teaching and materials. The Government feel that it is appropriate to make it absolutely clear where we stand, so schools will be guided by statute. The subject of inappropriate teaching and materials is in the Bill, but the guidance, by necessity, must go into some detail, and we feel that it is not appropriate to have it in the Bill. I hope that that is useful clarification.

<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I certainly wish to be as brief and non-inflammatory as possible, given the demands on our time and the fact that the issue was exhaustively and passionately debated in another place. All hon. Members will be familiar with that. Nevertheless, it is important that we should consider the Government's amendments carefully and sensitively, and achieve the correct balance. I commend the Under-Secretary for expressing the wish that the issue should be discussed rationally, but I am sure that he would concede that people feel strongly about it.

<P>
Fundamentally, the amendments amount to the overturning of the requirement in the clause for statutory guidance on sex education, which were introduced in another place by my noble Friend Baroness Young. Having checked the record, I am satisfied that Ministers have done more or less what they said they would do-although they do not always do that. I refer to the remarks that Baroness Blackstone made in the aftermath of her defeat in another place amd to those that the Secretary of State made on Second Reading. He said-I do not think that there is any argument about this-that he would seek to overturn the Young amendment, as it is called, but he reserved his position regarding what he would replace it with. This morning, however, the Under-Secretary explained the clutch of amendments that contain the Government's approach.

<P>
I must say at the outset that to some extent the amendments reflect the concerns that were previously expressed, and for that small mercy we are grateful. Nevertheless, unless the Government have a last minute change of heart, we will resist the amendments because they will, in effect, wreck the clause by removing references to the nature of marriage as the key building block of society, to the significance of stability in family relationships and to respect for self and others. Later provisions in the clause are designed to protect people from harm-the Under-Secretary acknowledged that-and to emphasise some of the benefits that the right kind of sex education can bring to personal and moral development.

<P>
The Opposition-and, I think, most Committee members-believe that such values, including, for example, the view that marriage is a key building block of society, are important truths that should remain in the Bill. They should be general objectives of any statutory guidance that the Secretary of State may issue from time to time. They should therefore be independent of any changes of mind that may occur to the Secretary of State on a particular day about the details of the guidance.

<P>
The Under-Secretary helpfully explained the matter to the Committee and we have studied some of the draft guidance, which will appear under statutory provision. At one stage, Ministers appeared to think that no statutory handle was required. I do not suggest that such guidance is generally inappropriate-far from it: much of it is very sensible. However, the question is about balance and how much should be tied down in statute.

<P>
In order to avoid misconceptions, I shall touch on three matters to clarify what our position is not. We do not attack those who live in relationships other than that of conventional marriage under English law, which involves one man and one woman. Of course, other relationships may be of value, and children from such relationships deserve to be treated without stigmatisation, to use the Minister's phrase, and with respect. That is a human and an educational sine qua non. However, many people do not always meet the ideal to which they aspire-many of us find ourselves in the biblical position of the glasshouse and the man who can cast the first stone. That is relevant in this regard and in others. Even if we do not live up to the ideal-even if we sin-we are entitled, without necessarily being accused of hypocrisy, to say that we still acknowledge that there is an ideal to pursue. One of those ideals, in my view-it may not be shared by everyone, and I respect their dissent in this regard-is that marriage is a key building block of society.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): The hon. Gentleman is putting his case with great thoughtfulness and sensitivity. Does he acknowledge that, whatever people's private feelings on the matter, during the past 10 to 15 years, there has been a substantial change in public opinion and the public's acceptance of long-term stable relationships that do not involve marriage? Any guidance in this context should reflect that fact.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I know where the hon. Gentleman stands on some of these matters, and he makes his point very reasonably. Of course there has been a change, and I welcome it. We have moved away from censoriousness of the individual towards greater tolerance in relation, for example, to children of different kinds of relationships. Fewer people are inclined to wield a big stick and say, ``Please never darken our door again.'' I welcome that growth in tolerance. However, that does not detract from the main point that people, whatever their views, might still feel happier with an emphasis on marriage as the building block.

<P>
One might take as an example the many representatives of the gay community who put forward strong arguments for being able legally to enshrine their relationships in some kind of marriage. That is a separate debate, and you would not welcome it if we extended our discussions that far, Mr. Hancock. Nevertheless, many members of the gay community would like to be able to formalise their relationships.

<P>
That is, generally, where I stand on the matter, although I appreciate that it is a matter of conviction and judgment. Most people feel that marriage is an important building block of society, despite the fact that many do not reach that ideal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): I concur with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) about the way in which this argument is being presented. The provisions in the clause relate to teachers in schools. Is the hon. Gentleman really arguing that a teacher responsible for sex education, with a class in front of him or her containing several children whose parents are not married, would have to say to those children, ``We respect your family background but, in truth, it is less than ideal''? If that were what the law required of them, many teachers would find themselves in a very difficult position. That is why I strongly support the amendment that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has moved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I think that we must beg to differ on the interpretation. It would not be impossible for sensitive guidelines to be conceived that would meet our requirement to assert the importance of marriage as a key building block while not seeking to be judgmental, let alone stigmatic, towards the individual. I would not expect teachers, some of whom may not be in ideal or formal relationships, to have to produce a very narrow script. However, it is important, within the policy of the school, collectively to recognise the important truth which the majority of our citizens still embrace.

<P>
I shall proceed to my next point because I am trying to clear up misconceptions before I come to the substance of the argument. I am also conscious of the time. Whatever we say today is in no sense an attempt either to persecute or to condone the persecution of homosexuals. It is a fact-the only fact relevant to the clause and the amendments-that marriage in Britain is and has traditionally been confined to heterosexual relationships. Beyond that, there is no reference to gender of sexual preference in the provisions.

<P>
Today's considerations have nothing to do with the criminal law or with the homosexual or heterosexual age of consent. The Committee will recall that there was a free vote on that issue, and some diversity of views among my hon. Friends, as well as among other members of the Committee, emerged. It is not a matter on which we all think identically.

<P>
Equally-this is my third path-clearing comment, Mr. Hancock-the amendment does not bear on the general conduct of local authorities. The so-called section 28 issue is a separate, local government expenditure issue. Of course, in the real world there is some read across, and certainly some confusion in the minds of the public and the press about those matters. However, the issues relating to the Bill and the amendment moved by the Under-Secretary should be judged on their own merits.

<P>
Any Government proposals that may come forward to drop section 28, however distasteful they may be to me and my colleagues, should properly be debated in the context of the relevant local government legislation, not here. There will, however, be some read across in terms of conduct by local authorities or others, and I shall touch on that when I come to the amendments.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I suppose that it would be proper for me to declare an interest as a Christian. No doubt that colours one's personal approach, although others may have different views. I hope to demonstrate that I have the support of my colleagues on these important issues. I have been greatly helped by the representations made to me on this matter by the Christian Institute, whose co-patron is Baroness Young. I should make it clear to the Committee ab initio, that the institute welcomes certain aspects of the Government's amendments. For example, it welcomes the proposal to bring national health service trusts within the scope of the Secretary of State's guidance.

<P>
The institute also welcomes the provisions to ensure that sex education takes account of the religious and cultural background of pupils, and to remove specific duties as regards sex education from local authorities. Those two are less important amendments. They will firmly anchor the issues within the remit of the governors and the individual school policy. The institute also welcomes the amendment that will re-emphasise the parental right of withdrawal in a school's statement of its sex education policy.

<P>
Those Government amendments and the staff guidance that has been circulated seem welcome all round. We shall not need to have an argument about them. Indeed, the Christian Institute has written to me to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We believe they will be genuinely helpful.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That represents an advance and to that extent the Government have reflected some of the concerns expressed in another place.

<P>
Nevertheless, the Christian Institute also lists a number of matters that it describes as ``points of serious concern''. I shall list them precisely, in order that there should be no misconceptions. There are three main points. First:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amendments remove the robust safeguards inserted in the Lords which encouraged schools to promote marriage, set out the principles for determining inappropriate materials and established a governor's veto over materials.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secondly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nothing in the amendment actually bans a local education authority from publishing sex education materials.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thirdly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nothing in the amendment applies to the activities of local authorities outside education. This is a major loophole.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In relation to that third point, the institute goes on to express its concern about a case brought against Glasgow city council under section 28, which I understand is now sub judice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to the Christian Institute's statement that there was nothing in the amendment about the conduct of local authorities outside the area of education. I am baffled by that logic. How could there be-why should there be-such provisions in a Bill that deals specifically with guidance of this nature?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman on that point. The clause deals with sex education, and the statutory obligations to circulate guidance and for governors and schools to have regard to that guidance. There is common ground between us on that point.

<P>
I have already said, in the course of my path-clearing remarks, that I did not see this as a section 28 issue. If I may put a gloss on the observations of the Christian Institute, all that it is doing is flagging up its concern that certain materials, which it deems inappropriate, are currently being circulated by a local authority-albeit one that is outwith the jurisdiction of the Bill, geographically.

<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I am sorry to press the hon. Gentleman on this matter. I appreciate his acceptance of that situation, but do not his comments suggest that that argument is wholly irrelevant to our discussion of the amendment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That depends on you, Mr. Hancock, and I am anxious not to trespass on your patience or that of Committee members. I am happy to agree that such matters should be discussed in another context. For the moment, if we disregard discussions about how things should be and whether this is the appropriate forum, I simply record the fact that the Christian Institute has severe reservations, which I share to some extent, about some of the material that local authorities make available.

<P>
I sought to correct the Under-Secretary's opening remarks on the amendment because he moved from a subject that was directly germane-the way in which local education authorities are part of the education scene and have responsibilities under the Education Act 1996-to a discussion of wider issues involving local authorities. I shall return to one or two of those matters in my concluding remarks.

<P>
I add to the Christian Institute's concerns, one or two personal reservations about what happens in practical circumstances. I am sure that the great majority of teachers, whatever their marital status or sexual preference, want to handle these matters responsibly. Perhaps I should have added to my earlier remarks the fact that I do not want to attack teachers across the piece. However, the fact remains that I find it difficult to accept some material that gets into the hands of children, whether in school or elsewhere. Their lordships found some of the material particularly distressing. We should all form judgments on the matter and-this is a separate issue-on the best way to contain it.

<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): Is not it the case that school governors determine, and always have determined, the policy on sex education? It is not up to individual teachers to decide on the material to use or the policy to implement in the classroom.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is right, but the hon. Lady should bear with me for a moment, because I want to flag up two other areas of concern. The first relates to the Government amendments and the other raises a wider issue.

<P>
First, the Government amendments involve a welcome new duty to involve NHS bodies. I had a brief look at section 22 of the National Health Service Act 1977, which suggests that the relevant bodies are district health authorities and, presumably-perhaps the Under-Secretary will confirm this-NHS trusts. That rubric does not bear directly on material that is produced by the Health Education Authority, which is not covered by section 22 of the 1977 Act, or any other body that falls within the broad remit of the NHS, or on what I may call health material that is produced by other bodies. Before anyone misinterprets that remark, I stress that I appreciate that the Under-Secretary may say that the policy in this regard is set by school governors, who will have to have regard to any guidance that the Secretary of State issues. Nevertheless, the duty that relates to NHS material-there is wide concern about some of the material that NHS bodies make available-does not involve other health-related bodies, including, in particular, the Health Education Authority.

<P>
My second concern is that the guidance is targeted towards the delivery of sex education. That, as the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) said, is properly a matter for school governors. The guidance does not bear specifically on any material that is made available to pupils, or on the conduct of any instruction that is given to pupils in connection with other subjects that are taught in a school. The concern is that material that is not part of a sex education class may creep in. If someone has a personal agenda-I hope that no one does-to produce material for pupils, it might find its way to them by another route.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have tried to sit in silence, and I accept that the hon. Gentleman is sincere, but I wonder whether he can provide a single concrete example of what he is talking about.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> A number of examples has been given elsewhere. For example, such material was available though Avon health authority. There are a number of misconceptions and I have been anxious not to add to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> In essence, the hon. Gentleman said that teachers who were not involved in delivering the sex education curriculum might introduce material of a dubious nature, and I should like him to give a concrete example of that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, but he has added a construction to my words that they do not warrant. I said that the amendment will bear on the delivery of sex education, which is the subject of our discussion, but there are other aspects of education. Constraints on the conduct of sex education and the policies of governors in that regard-we have agreed that there should be such constraints, and governors should take such decisions-may be subverted if an individual pursues an agenda outside the sex education rubric. That is my concern. It is not a general duty on teachers or governors.

<P>
We acknowledge that the amendments contain some good features, but their purpose is to wreck the clause as drafted after considerable debate in another place, where deep concern was expressed. In the light of what I have heard so far and in the absence of further concessions, I advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The Liberal Democrats broadly welcome the amendments because, as I said during the sittings motion, we hoped that the Government would table an amendment to overturn the Lady Young amendment and legislate more sensibly.

<P>
There is no doubt that this has been a tortuous route, and we cannot disengage the abolition of section 28 from this debate. The two are inextricably linked. I want to concentrate my brief remarks on the way in which section 28 has impacted on the work of schools. It is important that we secure general agreement on the way forward, and I do not think that the hon. Member for Daventry, the Liberal Democrats and the Government are a million miles apart on this issue.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands said, the reality is that section 28 does not apply to schools. As far as I am aware, section 28 has not directly impinged on a school in a legal sense: I know of no court action that has affected a school. The hon. Lady is also right to say that it is schools, teachers and governors who decide on school policy. Of course, parents must agree to that policy, and they currently retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education lessons. Indeed, they may object to any activity in any part of the curriculum that they consider inappropriate, and I feel sure that they would do so if they felt so inclined.

<P>
We support the transfer of responsibilities from the LEA to schools, parents and governors. It was the Education Reform Act 1988 that transferred those responsibilities, and it was the party of the hon. Member for Daventry that was in government when it was enacted. The other important factor was that, in 1996, Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools was given responsibility for inspecting that element of the curriculum. We welcomed that. However, we did not welcome the chief inspector's injudicious remarks about the matter. It was disgraceful for him to claim that there was no evidence of homophobic bullying in schools, given that he had never inspected against that criteria, and the Secretary of State should have slapped him down for it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> The chief inspector appeared to be completely unaware of research carried out in schools that has demonstrated the prevalence of homophobic bullying.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making that point. There is a paucity of such research, and more is needed. Perhaps the most definitive example is the research that was carried out in 1997 by the Institute of Education. My accusation against the chief inspector does not concern his right to become involved in such debates, but the lack of evidence on which his remarks are often based. This is a classic example of that.

<P>
The view of the Liberal Democrats is clear. The law should not be used to legislate for morality, which is very much dependent on individual's perceptions. The law should protect people, but should not try to inculcate a view of morality, which will change over time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If the hon. Gentleman does not get excited, I shall let him intervene in a moment.

<P>
To return to my point, I could give as an example the Church of England. Someone once said that it was the Tory party at prayer. However, I hope that that is not so, given the remarks of Church leaders such as Cardinal Winning-[
Interruption.] I am sorry, he is a Roman Catholic. Cardinal Winning referred to homosexuals as perverts. I would hope that no Member of either House would wish to confirm that view, yet many peers in another place came very close to doing so. That is not about determining what is best for children in schools, but attempting to rekindle homophobia.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I note that several members of the Committee are becoming excited during the hon. Gentleman's remarks, which may be a new experience for him. I should like to make a brief defence of the chief inspector of schools. My understanding of his comments about the lack of conclusive evidence of homophobic bullying stemming from section 28 was that they were made in response to ill-informed, political comment suggesting that there was considerable evidence in that regard. The chief inspector merely entered the debate to point out that that was not so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Gentleman confirms my point. It is incomprehensible that a person of the chief inspector's repute and position should use one incorrect argument to try to counter another incorrect argument.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is right and proper for the debate to have proceeded as it has, but we have exhausted that particular line of argument. I ask Mr. Willis to turn his contribution more specifically to the subject at hand.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Of course I will, Mr. Hancock. The hon. Gentleman will have to curb his excitement.

<P>
The Committee's main concern should be how best we can serve our young people. One result of the 1988 section 28 legislation is that the teaching profession has been in limbo on how to deal with sexual orientation and homophobic bullying in schools. That is one of my principal concerns. It is not a major issue in the Teacher Training Agency's curriculum for the training of teachers, but it is a major issue in schools as a direct result of section 28, and it must be dealt with.

<P>
The research by the Institute of Education in 1997 into school policies on bullying found that only 6 per cent. of schools referred to homophobic bullying, which was a direct result of fear among the teaching profession. In 1994, the then Department for Education issued guidance, entitled, ``Don't suffer in silence'', on how to tackle bullying in schools, but it did not contain a single reference to homophobic bullying. That was confirmed to be a result of section 28.

<P>
I have had practical experience of the matter in my working life. I recall a young teacher coming to see me when I had decided with the staff that we wanted to change the way in which personal and social education was delivered. At one time it was a specialist area and specific teachers dealt with that within a careers and social education programme, but we wanted all our group tutors or personal tutors to develop that as youngsters went through the school. I remember a young colleague confiding in me that he was gay. He wanted me to know that at a time when many teachers did not want to admit openly that they were gay. There was a great fear among many teachers then, but I hope that that no longer applies. He said, ``Boss'',-[Laughter.] Everyone called me boss; it was just a term of endearment. He said, ``Boss, do you think that it is wise for me to work with young people?'' It was a dilemma and, to my shame, I could not just say to him, ``That is not a problem.'' We had to discuss it to decide a way forward and in the next academic year that teacher worked with the sixth form. I remember going into a lesson and hearing him talking to sixth formers about his homosexuality, his life as a student in a school, the bullying that went on and the difficulties of his life. It was a riveting session and no one would have accused that young man of trying to inculcate his views on young people. He was educating and sharing.

<P>
Section 28 did so much damage to the honest relationship that teachers should have with young people to enable them to explore all sorts of relevant matters. I have never believed that people can catch homosexuality, but there is a view that that is so and it is hinted at in some of the comments and demands in another place.

<P>
Another issue concerns how homophobic bullying is dealt with in the playground. I went to a hospital on one occasion to see one of my students who had taken a significant overdose. I knew that that young man was gay and he had reached the point at which he could no longer stand the taunting, bullying, constant name-calling and jibes in the playground. Again, I felt ashamed that I had been unable to deal with the matter. We must never again allow legislation to prevent teachers from being able to do their job of educating and informing young people. Section 28 did that.

<P>
We generally welcome the Secretary of State's proposed guidance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I should like to finish, because I am aware of the time.

<P>
We generally welcome the Secretary of State's proposed guidance and it is right that he should have a duty to issue guidance to schools. We do not support all the guidance, and the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing, Marie Stopes International, and Brook Advisory Centres are concerned about it, but that can be dealt with through the consultation process. The medical profession is worried that there is sometimes a confict of interest between what happens in schools and the advice that young people receive outside school. The Secretary of State will have the overriding power with regard to the health authorities and professionals and the guidance. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that in his response.

<P>
This amendment is a sensible way forward. We hope that the issue will not divide the Committee because it is important to send a clear message to the teaching profession that section 28 is going, that we shall have sensible guidance in schools and that we can again trust our teachers, heads and governors to work for the best interests of our young people instead of having to look over their shoulders.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I am extremely pleased to follow the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who spoke with good sense, feeling and personal experience of the issues. What he said about teachers' experience was sensible and germane to our debate, particularly his comments on the position in which teachers would be put if the amendment moved in another place were to be retained in the Bill.

<P>
I have never had a parent, governor or anyone else in my constitutency or from elsewhere complain to me of inappropriate teaching on the issue, and I should be interested to know whether any other Committee members have had that experience. The hon. Gentleman rightly emphasised that provision already exists for parents who are unhappy, concerned or, because of their moral or religious beliefs, do not want their children to participate in such presentation of sex education guidance to withdraw their children. The concerns that were whipped up in another place and by other organisations are wholly off the point. However, I accept that Governments, like any other fallible human institution, must legislate for people's legitimate concerns and take account of their prejudgments-I leave it to others to judge whether they are prejudices. To that extent, the Government are wholly right to introduce the amendment, and I am particularly pleased at the way in which my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Wicks) introduced it. He referred to the guidance having balance, sensitivity and inclusivity. It seems right, as my hon. Friends have confirmed again this morning, that the status quo that existed before the amendment was introduced in another place should be maintained. In other words, the decision should be made by school governors and teachers acting under their guidance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise only to correct my understanding. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that the position envisaged in the amendment would replicate exactly the position that existed before the House of Lords considered and amended the Government's proposals? They are not exactly the same.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I am happy to make it clear that I am not trying to do that. There are features of the amendment that take us forward from the status quo: that is why I support it. The essential argument that the decisions should be left to school governors is right.

<P>
We have spoken about how the issue was discussed by the noble Baroness in another place. That is a peculiarly appropriate phrase; the noble Baroness occupies not just another place, but her own unparalleled universe, which bears no relationship to the life and experience of children and parents at the turn of the millennium. It occurred to me, as we considered the arguments for the retention of the Lords amendment-which the Government amendment will delete-that Members of the other place inhabit a 1950s Jack and Jill fantasy land in relation to relationships, the experiences of schoolchildren and the responsibility of teachers and governors to explain the world to them as it is, not as some might like it to be.

<P>
The new amendment strikes a reasonable balance between reassuring people who are genuinely concerned about appropriate teaching and materials-even though, in my opinion, those fears are greatly exaggerated-and the need to provide a positive framework, under the guidance, for the protection and proper understanding of young people at a difficult and sensitive age.

<P>
It is important-I echo the words of Stonewall-that governors do not interpret the Department's guidance selectively. The personal and social health development guidance that was issued last year dealt with the importance of challenging stereotyping, prejudice and bullying. Those points are reiterated in the draft guidance, which will also deal with the need to provide appropriate advice and guidance to young lesbians and gay men and stress the importance for schools of taking initiatives to deal with homophobic bullying. I am happy that the Government amendment contains nothing that would frustrate or fetter that, and it is important-my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has touched on the point-that the amendment is not seen as an escape clause for dealing with those issues.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has said, there are legitimate concerns among people in the health professions, particularly those who are concerned with young people's health, that we get the balance right. Whatever we decide about the framework of the guidance and the legislation that underpins it, we must not create a situation in which teachers or governors feel that they are restrained from informing children about the risks of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly HIV and AIDS. The health and educational needs of children who are-or feel that they are-growing up lesbian or gay must not be excluded, consciously or unconsciously, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough so eloquently outlined in his discussion of his own experience in that regard.

<P>
It is important to leave such matters to the good sense of teachers and governors. Of course, there will be prejudiced teachers and governors-I use the word ``prejudiced'' to mean the pre-judging of such issues-on both sides of the argument. However, we are striking the right balance, and I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Daventry, who said that the guidance must be sensitive rather than judgmental. I hope that all members of the Committee share that view, even if not all agree that the amendment as drafted meets those concerns.

<P>
Inevitably, one's views are coloured or influenced by personal experience. I have referred somewhat disparagingly to the 1950s. When I was a child in the 1950s, I had a friend who was deeply concerned, confused and worried about his sexuality. I remind members of the Committee that the images of homosexuality witnessed by teenage children in the late 1960s and early 1970s were by no means as kaleidoscopic and broad as those that today's children might witness. In the north-west of England in the early 1970s, the culture that we now associate with Old Compton street and cappuccino did not exist; nor was Manchester's gay village then in existence.

<P>
My childhood friend asked for my opinion, but for reasons that were apparent, and to which I have already referred, I felt somewhat inhibited. I make no criticism of the school concerned, but I wish that my friend had had the benefit of the thoughtful, mature and constructive discussion in which the guidelines and the amendment attempt to engage. For that reason, and because there are thousands of young people who need such guidance, I am happy to support the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall be brief. Those who listen to, or read the account of, our proceedings may not realise how strongly members of the Committee disagree with one another on this subject. The debate has been intelligent and civilised, and I hope that my contribution will continue in that vein.

<P>
This important debate on an issue of enormous public concern largely arises from previous discussions on section 28, even though we are not discussing section 28 itself. It is true that both sides of the argument have employed myth, but I do not regard myself as prejudiced or homophobic. In the light of an earlier exchange, the Under-Secretary-and, indeed, some of my colleagues-might regard my views as verging on the Fabian. During these discussions, myth has been employed in equal measure by those who seek to promote a gay rights agenda, and those who perhaps want to promote an intolerant, anti-gay agenda.

<P>
I am not interested in either of those agendas-my concern is tolerance. Tolerance should be extended to those who have, or think that they might have, different sexual orientation, and those who have moments of confusion or difficulty in their young lives. However, there must also be tolerance of the views and concerns of others, especially parents. I commend the hon. Member for Blackpool, South on his recognition of that.

<P>
Similarly, it is important that we recognise that, in legislating on these difficult and sensitive matters, we are setting a broad framework that will have an impact on a relatively small part of the moral and social education of young people. Much of that education will, rightly, take place at home within the family. I speak as a parent when I say that I and other parents should not have to fear that the moral and social environment that our children encounter at school will differ markedly from the one that we would wish to engender at home. In all these difficult debates, we must try to ensure that that does not happen. The public have a right to expect that of Parliament.

<P>
We have heard mention of the chief inspector of schools, and I shall be brief in my comments on that matter, bearing in mind your earlier warnings, Mr. Hancock. This is a classic example of myth and counter-myth. According to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, the myth is that if Ministers or other politicians wish to employ a myth that section 28, or other legislation relating to similar issues, is responsible for the spread of homophobic bullying in schools-or prevents its control by teachers-it is not equally acceptable for Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools to comment that he has seen no evidence of that. That is as far as the chief inspector of schools went, quite rightly.

<P>
<B>Valerie Davey </B>(Bristol, West): I apologise for intervening on the hon. Gentleman. The chief inspector was asked in a different context, in a different Committee of the House, whether he had asked about this matter on any school visit, having made his comment. His answer was ``No''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I fully accept that. I know that the hon. Lady serves on the Select Committee on Education, and was present when that evidence was taken. I think that she would accept that many of us encounter a wide variety of circumstances as we go about our business. We are frequently happy to accept that, because people are not raising serious, pressing concerns, there is no evidence of there being serious, pressing concerns. I do not believe that it is necessary for the chief inspector of schools to go into every school asking an exhaustive list of questions. He deals constantly with people in the world of education, with teachers and head teachers. To say that he has no evidence of section 28 having caused homophobic bullying or having led to the curtailment of its prevention is a proper and legitimate comment.

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said that section 28 was standing in the way of teachers dealing with these matters properly and sensitively, yet we hear repeatedly that section 28 does not apply directly to schools. Either it applies directly to schools and can stand in the way of teachers taking decisions, or it does not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says in terms of the narrow interpretation of the law. Will he not accept the main thrust of the argument against section 28, which is that teachers have been grossly inhibited by the fear of incurring the wrath of section 28 by touching on those subjects?

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> It is important, in our debates and in those in the other place, that we seek to clarify the position so that such misunderstandings do not arise. However, it is not proper to produce legislation that has been driven by teachers' misconceptions about the potential effects of the law. The effect of the law is narrow in respect of section 28, and we are seeking, quite properly, to ensure that the Bill puts a little flesh on the bones. The Government amendments risk limiting the improvement to the Bill that was made in another place.

<P>
I hope that Ministers will take on board the genuine public concern about the direction of the Government's policy in this area. That concern is driven not by a great wave of intolerance, but by a reasonable concern that difficulties may arise further down the road. Ministers should give due credence to the views of parents and the public on this matter.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I rise to speak only briefly. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has spoken for the Opposition Front Bench, and I do not seek in any way to add to or subtract from what he said in his characteristically moderate, balanced and sensible speech.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred to the Church of England, my contribution will take as its text
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Judge not, that ye be not judged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I do not intend to get on a high horse to deliver a moral lecture. I speak as a parent of four children who have reached, or are approaching, the relevant age for such matters. As a parent, my main concern regarding the Government amendment to the House of Lords amendment is that it should contain nothing that will get in the way of the provision of objective, thorough, sensible and professional sex education to children.

<P>
I say that against a background of a rising incidence of sexually transmissible diseases among young people, far too high a level of teenage pregnancy and worrying examples of the spread of the HIV virus and AIDS, which is a terrible problem in some parts of the world. I was about to say that we have that problem under control in this country, but that would not be the right way to put it. Although our performance is better than that of some countries, there is no room for complacency and much needs to be done to prevent the spread of that terrible disease. The same applies to the other forms of sexually transmissible disease. I want my children to receive factual, impartial and objective information about those matters, and for nothing to get in the way of its delivery.

<P>
I take slight issue with the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who said that he had not seen any examples of health education information that went too far. In fact, it has sometimes gone beyond the boundaries of the provision of information to children, and has strayed on to other issues. When that happens, it rather lets the side down for health education. It is important for children to be given the information objectively and thoroughly, in a way that stresses its importance.

<P>
I shall not go into the wider issues that were covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady). My concern is that children should get the facts and that the facts should speak for themselves.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had an interesting debate. I shall reflect on some of its key themes in a few moments. First, I want to respond to some of the points that have been raised. One of the questions that I shall not attempt to answer is whether the Church of England is the Tory party at prayer. It was once suggested that it had become the Social Democratic party at prayer. In fairness to members of that Church, I suspect that any suggestion that it is the Tory party at prayer is an exaggeration, both ecclesiastically and psephologically-although it has recently become worried by declining attendance.

<P>
I was asked whether the amendment would cover the Health Education Authority-yes, it will. The HEA, which is now the Health Development Agency, is covered by our definition of an NHS body.

<P>
We had an interesting discussion about the uses and abuses of the internet, and my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) reminded me that many schools have perfectly proper procedures in place to deal with the problem-for example, there are several anti-search engines that schools can employ. I am advised that schools have been sent an information pack ``Superhighway Safety'', which outlines many ways in which schools can make access to the internet safe and prevent children from accessing unsuitable information. I am also advised that we are currently updating that pack. I shall ensure that those who are responsible, including the Minister with the relevant responsibilities, are made aware of our debate. I shall also ensure that there is proper cross-referencing in our guidance to the availability of that pack. I shall reflect on the redrafting of the guidance in light of our discussion.

<P>
We have had a sensible, even-tempered and thoughtful debate. I say that not by way of self-congratulation-Parliament is at its most pompous at such moments-but because this subject is crucial to our children. I shall return later to the crucial point that the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made in an intervention.

<P>
It is important that we had a sensible discussion-that is what our children, families. schools and teachers need. At times, the debate on this matter in other places has not been so sensible. Bigoted speeches have been made, which can excite some of the public's worst fears. I am bound to say that the debate can be excited on both sides. Bigotry was associated with some speeches-I stress it was some but not all-that were made in another place. I also deplore the fact that recently in Croydon-my home borough-a speech by Cardinal Winning was disrupted by extremists who are associated with a gay campaign. They clearly have no respect for free speech. We are ill served, in this and in other debates, by extremists on both sides.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry discussed marriage and stable relationships. We understand his comments. I repeat that in our general guidance about sex and relationships, we require pupils to be taught about the nature of marriage and its importance in family life and in bringing up children. Pupils should learn that marriage and stable relationships are a key building block of our community and society.

<P>
Before I entered the house in 1992, I served for 10 years as the director of the Family Policy Studies Centre, which is an all-party group-there are representatives from different parties on the governing council. I spent time with colleagues trying to explore the way in which family life in Britain, and in similar societies, was changing. Although we drew many conclusions, two struck me as being particularly important in the context of this debate. The first is that, with certain family arrangements, children can suffer and become the victims of certain family changes. Although hon. Members may think it another example of research proving common sense, children do best when family life is stable, and many children are frequently subjected to change.

<P>
The other conclusion to be drawn from any study of the family is that it is undergoing a period of great change. It was once estimated how many children this country would, by the beginning of this century-that is, now-be born into families where both parents were married and would spend their entire childhoods, to the age of 16, living with both the mother and father within that married couple relationship. It was estimated that probably only half all children would experience that.

<P>
It is not difficult to understand, without going into the arithmetic, how that finding was arrived at. About a third of children in Britain are born out of wedlock-some to parents who later get married-and around 40 per cent. of marriages, certainly new or recent marriages, will sadly end in divorce. Many children are growing up in one-parent families, or in families where the couple is cohabiting-sometimes in a very stable relationship-rather than married. A significant number of children are growing up in step families.

<P>
That means that when we approach the task of sex and relationship education, we must focus not only on stability as the building block for a decent childhood-for many of us, such stability is found in marriage-but on the fact that many children who are being taught about these matters live in other family circumstances.

<P>
The growing understanding in this country about human sexuality, and the increasingly liberal attitudes towards people who are homosexual rather than heterosexual, makes the debate more interesting, but also more difficult for those who seek to be wise about it.

<P>
Everyone in society-parliamentarians, parents, governors, teachers and children-is affected by social changes, such as the tendency for most couples to live together before marriage. We must be sensitive to that, not least in inner-city schools where often the great majority of children are not in the family environment that some people might wish all children to experience.

<P>
To re-emphasise the theme of the Government amendments, we believe that the Bill must include certain protections against inappropriate materials and teaching. In the guidance, we wish to set out our ambitions for sex and relationship education.

<P>
We heard a series of good speeches during the debate. I was especially struck by the contribution of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who, as a former head teacher, explained with great sensitivity the issues that can arise in schools. His comments were very useful to the Committee. I have always thought that, whatever our occasional differences on policy, it would have been fun to have been a pupil at the hon. Gentleman's school. Many of us would have been proud to have referred to him as the boss; I do not mean that facetiously.

<P>

<B>Charlotte Atkins:</B> May I suggest that it might have been fun to be a student, but not a teacher?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It would certainly have been challenging to have been a governor.

<P>
What matters, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere reminded us, is our children. These are challenging and complex times, and many children live in turbulent families. Moreover, many children are confronted with material about sex in the mass media, on television and in teenage magazines that is, at best, simplistic and, at worst, crude and vulgar. The challenges that face schools and families are particularly important.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The question is this: how do we enable children to receive appropriate education about sex and relationships, striking the right balance between protection against anything inappropriate and the need to combat ignorance? In the Bill and in the guidance, we have tried to strike a balance. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere implied, children in this country face many risks. The hon. Gentleman was right to emphasise the dangers of HIV and AIDS, but there is also a problem with teenage births. I do not want to exaggerate the situation, but too many schoolgirls are becoming pregnant: children are having children. That leads to an abortion rate that must be regarded as horrifically high, whatever side of the debate we support. Ignorance can lead to prejudice, fear and bullying: we need to strike the right balance.

<P>
Opposition Members may disagree with us about whether we are choosing the right route, but we feel that we have got it right, in terms of the contents of the Bill and the clear guidance that we are offering. We are convinced that the difficult job of striking the right balance and undertaking appropriate teaching is best left to the school-to the governing body, the teachers and the head teacher.

<P>

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I did not come back to the Under-Secretary earlier, partly because of time. We have had a good and civilised debate, which has exemplified the way in which parliamentarians of all parties and traditions can share a concern for the protection and development of young people, although they reach different conclusions.

<P>
For the avoidance of doubt, I would say that, as the Under-Secretary has succeeded in subverting the clause inserted by the House of Lords, we are unable to associate ourselves with the clause, as amended.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I reiterate the point that, whatever the differences between us are, there is much common ground. The debate has been thoughtful and useful.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendments Nos. 303, 384, 387 to 395, 320, 396, 321, 397 to 399 and 402 to 408.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Bills generally require consequential amendments to other legislation. Unfortunately, education Bills in particular tend to lead to extensive consequential amendments because of the way in which statutory duties and responsibilities have developed through successive legislation. I am afraid that this Bill is no exception, because it will dissolve existing bodies-the two Further Education Funding Councils-and replace them with new statutory bodies. Officials and legal advisers have undertaken a thorough search of the statute book to ensure that all current legislation on which the Bill will impact has been identified, and the result is the list of amendments before us.

<P>
The list is extensive and daunting, but I can assure hon. Members that each amendment is either purely consequential on the dissolution of the FEFCs and the creation of the Learning and Skills Council, the Council for Education and Training for Wales, and the adult learning inspectorate, or effects a minor technical change in the light of the Bill's substantive provisions. None carries policy significance; indeed, most maintain the status quo by substituting the LSC for the FEFC, and the CETW for the FEFCW.

<P>
I have extensive briefing on each amendment, and I should be happy to discuss them in turn, but that would sorely test the patience of the Committee members. I hope that they will accept my assurance that each and every amendment is little more than technical or consequential, and agree to them without the need for a detailed, blow-by-blow account.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was almost minded to rise to the Under-Secretary's challenge, but I am happy to respond to his assertions of good will, which, of course, I readily accept.

<P>
I have simply one point to make, although I should say that I have not examined the schedule to see whether a relevant example arises. During yesterday's discussion in Westminster Hall on special educational needs, the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) referred to the FEFC's participation in the school organisation committee. I do not expect a definitive answer, but I presume that, where such a provision exists in legislation, the intention is to roll it on into the LSC. With due respect to the technical proficiency of lawyers, such provisions are sometimes omitted from new legislation. If a specific amendment has failed to transfer a provision prescribed in statute for the FEFC, will the error be dealt with, or smoothed out, without the need for subsequent primary legislation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that we have done as thorough and complete a job as we can. I hope that our approach will not be found wanting.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following: Government amendments Nos. 370 to 374 and 376 to 379.

<P>
Government new clause 27-City academies.

<P>
Government new clause 29-City academies: land.

<P>
Government new clause 28-City colleges and academies: special educational needs.

<P>
New schedule 1-City academies: land.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> These important amendments to the Bill contain important new provisions about city academies. Before I explain the principles that underpin our approach, I should begin by apologising to Committee members for the late stage at which these amendments have been introduced.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that the Under-Secretary is making an apology so graciously, but I have to say that he is right to do so. However, we shall say more about that later. Do the amendments that are grouped with Government amendment No. 383 correspond to the group of amendments that are referred to as the first set of amendments in the letter from the Under-Secretary to Committee members, which we received yesterday?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are dealing with Government amendment No. 369, and the amendments, new clauses and new schedule that are grouped with it. We have already agreed to Government amendment No. 383.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Hancock. I am grateful to you for clarifying the situation. However, the same point applies. We are currently considering amendments about city academies. The Government amendments that were grouped with Government amendment No. 383 were consequential amendments, about which no one had much to say, but we have now reached an important group of amendments. Is that group the first set of amendments that is mentioned in the letter?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Yes, I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.

<P>
I gave way to the hon. Gentleman before I had completed my fulsome apology for the late stage at which the amendments, new clauses and new schedule were introduced. I fully recognise that that creates problems for Committee members, and I can only repeat my apology. I hope that Committee members understand why we have adopted that approach.

<P>
These important amendments, new clauses and new schedule contain important provisions. We felt that we had to take every advantage to correct a situation that was clearly not right. I hope that Committee members appreciate that when we saw an opportunity to make improvements, we felt that we had to seize it and offer all the apologies that we could muster for the late stage at which we have done so.

<P>
I am sure that all Committee members recognise that, regrettably, educational attainment in inner cities often falls far short of what we want. Tackling that problem has to be a high priority for any Government. The amendments contain an important new provision to do just that.

<P>
I shall go through the amendments, new clauses and new schedule in turn to explain why they are important, but I begin with new clause 27 because Government amendments Nos. 369 to 374 and 376 to 378, which appear earlier in the amendment paper are purely consequential on the new clauses and the new schedule. New clause 27 will place the proposed city academies on a legislative basis and allow for specialist subject areas to have a special focus in the curriculum.

<P>
On 15 March my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment gave a speech to the Social Market Foundation about his vision for transforming secondary education. He set out a raft of policies that are already in place, such as excellence in cities and fresh start opportunities, which the Government introduced to tackle the problem of under-performing schools.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
My right hon. Friend's speech recognised that in some of the most challenging areas we need a new, more radical approach, if we are to give the pupils in those areas all the life chances that they deserve. Our plans to set up city academies in partnership with LEAs and private sector sponsors are a response to that need. The academies will replace seriously failing schools in some of the most deprived areas of the country.

<P>
The background to this is the dramatic disparities in performance between schools, the variable pattern of rising standards and the differences in performance between schools with similar intakes. We recognise that, in overall terms, there is a clear association between levels of deprivation and pupils' performance in exams. However, that is not the whole story. The striking thing is that, even in areas of significant social deprivation, some schools nevertheless do very well.

<P>
Our prospectus for city academies, which was sent in pre-publication form to members of the Committee yesterday, gives examples of schools that are making headway or sustaining good performance in difficult circumstances. They are among many good schools showing what can be done. However, there is still room for improvement in far too many schools.

<P>
We are setting local education authorities a challenge: by 2004, at least one fifth of pupils in every secondary school should achieve five passes between grades A star to C at GCSE. By 2006, at least one quarter of pupils in every secondary school should reach that level of attainment. We want every LEA's education development plan to contain proposals for how it plans to meet those challenges.

<P>
Schools with low levels of achievement reinforce social and economic inequality, and disadvantage. We are committed to raising standards so that we can raise levels of attainment to deal with the problem. That is why we have announced the city academy programme. Over the next year, we want to launch pathfinder projects to establish the academies, the first of which we hope will be operational by September 2001.

<P>
City academies build on the specialist school programmes and on the city technology college experience. They will be independent schools catering for the full range of abilities, established in partnership with private sector sponsors and allowing for innovative curriculum plans to bring about improvements in education through a focus on one of a range of specialist subject areas.

<P>
In the prospectus for the academies, it can be seen that they will be given considerable freedom to manage their own affairs within a framework that will ensure that certain basic principles are observed. They will have admissions policies consistent with the codes of practice; they will use the national curriculum as the curriculum starting point; and they will employ only teachers with qualified teacher status. However, they will have substantial freedom of management and organisation, and will be expected to develop the curriculum in imaginative ways. They will all place a special emphasis on one area of the curriculum.

<P>
New clause 27(3) amends the Education Act 1996 by seting out additional areas of emphasis in the curriculum to be available to city academies. The new areas specified are modern foreign languages, visual arts, performing arts, media arts-or any combination of these arts-and sport. There is also provision for the Secretary of State to specify by order other subject areas.

<P>
The broader range of specialist subject areas builds on the experience of specialist schools, which began as a technology college programme but was expanded to include the other subject areas now specified. It will enable us to take account of the particular curriculum interests of the sponsor of an academy. We found in the specialist school programme that both the schools and the sponsors were attracted by the wider choice of specialist areas.

<P>
Some sponsors get involved because of an interest in a particular specialism. Examples are British Aerospace and technology colleges; British Airways and language colleges; Premier League football clubs and sports colleges; and the Music Sound Foundation and arts colleges. It may also be the case that sponsors with no special interest or subject to promote will consider that a particular area of emphasis is likely to be of the greatest benefit in the particular circumstances of their school.

<P>
New clause 27(4) makes provision for a school established, maintained and funded in accordance with the Education Act 1996, to be known as a city academy. We believe that it is right that the name of those new schools should appear in the Bill, in recognition of the important role that we are giving them in this crucial area.

<P>
New clause 27(7) excludes Wales from the city academy provisions. There are no city technology colleges or city colleges for the technology of the arts in Wales, and no plans to provide for city academies there.

<P>
The provision in new clause 28 is to clarify the law and ensure that LEAs can provide for the needs of statemented pupils at city academies. We want city academies to cater for children of the full range of abilities, including those with statements of special educational need. Inclusion is at the heart of our education policies. We must ensure that all children have the best possible chance of realising their full potential.

<P>
The 1996 Act has given rise to confusion in respect of provision by LEAs to city technology colleges for statemented pupils. Clause 28(1) amends the 1996 Act by providing a regulation-making power for the Secretary of State to govern the powers and duties of LEAs in respect of statemented pupils attending schools established under section 482 of the 1996 Act. That should clarify the existing legislation, which has caused uncertainty and would make it difficult for city academies to be treated on an equal basis with other publicly funded schools in relation to the education of statemented children.

<P>
New clause 29 and new schedule 1 deal with the provision of land for the purposes of setting up a city academy. We have already had positive discussions with a number of the LEAs about the possibilities for city academies in their areas. In most cases, the establishment of academies will be a matter of partnership between local and central Government and the sponsoring body. That is the spirit of the initiative, which is reflected in the prospectus.

<P>
One model of the circumstances in which a city academy would be suitable is that of two poorly performing schools, both with large numbers of surplus places, which are already under consideration within the LEA in respect of reorganisation proposals. One of the school sites might be chosen in discussions between an LEA and a sponsor for development as a city academy. The two schools would close at the appropriate time for the transfer of pupils to the city academy.

<P>
That is just one example; others would involve only one school. However, I hope that it helps to illustrate why we believe that many LEAs will see the great opportunities that are presented to their areas by introducing a city academy solution to at least part of the problem of under-performance. I have already referred to our positive discussions with a number of LEAs interested in what might be possible in their areas. They are viewing it as an education opportunity, not with the narrow focus of a body considering its own existing institutions. That is encouraging, because it recognises the great benefits that we expect to flow from the injection of new ideas, new capital, new enthusiasm and greater freedom of action than is currently available in maintained schools.

<P>
It follows that we expect city academies to emerge from discussions between willing partners in a new and exciting enterprise. We expect the new schools to be an integral part of the local school community, and of the community as a whole, and hope that all parties will share our optimism about the opportunities that that will provide.

<P>
We envisage that the land transfer powers provided by the clause and the schedule are likely to be used rarely, in order to facilitate the transfer of land on an agreed basis. It is possible to envisage a situation in which disagreement about the best way to provide the city academy could be resolved only by the use of these powers. We would consider doing so only as a last resort, to break a deadlock in the interests of the children.

<P>
New clause 29(1) introduces the schedule. Paragraph 1 of the new schedule empowers the Secretary of State to make a scheme that has the effect of transferring the land, rights and liabilities of a former community school from an LEA to a person for the purpose of running the city academy. That excludes the principal of, or interest on, a loan, as that would be difficult to identify separately from a local authority's liabilities in respect of other loans. That is reasonable, as a service to be provided by the city academy would otherwise still be required of the LEA. In practice, the scheme would come into force after the date of the last day of the final term of the school or schools to be closed, but before the opening of the city academy to pupils.

<P>
Paragraph 2 of the new schedule requires LEAs to seek the Secretary of State's consent to the disposal of land used for the purposes of a county or community school during the period of five years ending with the day that the Act comes into force. That would not apply when a contract has already been made or an option granted before the Act comes into force. Additionally, it does not apply to a transfer for the purposes of setting up an academy which is made for no consideration. We hope that most transfers will take that form.

<P>
We do not envisage a lengthy procedure, nor do we not envisage blocking the disposal of land when we have no good reason to think that the land concerned might be used for the purposes of a city academy. The programme is about children and school improvement; we do not want the prospects for city academies to get bogged down in negotiations on land costs, nor do we want the funds available for a city academy programme to be absorbed by land purchase.

<P>
Paragraph 3 provides the Secretary of State with remedies when a transaction is entered into by an LEA in contravention of the terms of paragraph 2. The Secretary of State may use those remedies only for the purposes of passing the interest in the land to a person concerned with running a city academy. The schedule does not place any burden upon private developers.

<P>
Paragraph 4 places a duty on LEAs to inform the Secretary of State about proposed changes in the use of land which would affect the prospects of using the land for the purposes of a city academy.

<P>
Paragraph 5 protects the position of an LEA that has transferred land for the purposes of a city academy when that school ceases to be a city academy. The paragraph provides for the Secretary of State to make a scheme for the transfer of the land back to the LEA that made the transfer to the city academy, whether or not the original transfer was subject to a scheme made by the Secretary of State.

<P>
Paragraph 6 disapplies various restrictions on LEAs disposing of land when the disposal is of nil value for the purposes of a city academy. That is because city academies will serve the same communities for the same educational purposes as the schools that precede them.

<P>
The principle behind the schedule is simple: it is to ensure that we will not miss opportunities to improve the education of some of our most disadvantaged children by virtue of an LEA's reluctance to buy land. The details are complex and paragraph 7 provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations for such incidental, consequential, transitional and supplementary provisions as are appropriate.

<P>
Paragraphs 8 and 9 give examples of areas that such regulations may cover, for example the provision of information required for a scheme and the procedure for seeking consent to a disposal. Paragraphs 10 and 11 are concerned with definition.

<P>
Amendment No. 379 allows for the provisions dealing with city academies and associated matters other than those dealing with special educational needs to be commenced on Royal Assent. It is a natural consequence of the provisions in respect of the transfer of land.

<P>
The new clauses and the new schedule are key building blocks in our programme for city academies. They will make an important contribution to our plans for improving standards in education, especially for those children most in need.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's lengthy opening remarks. It is always hard to take issue with someone who gives a fulsome, handsome and sensitive apology without a trace of the self-righteousness or arrogance that Ministers of every political party are apt to show from time to time. But however fulsome the Minister's apology, I must take issue with him, as it simply will not do, and everything that the Minister said after he had apologised showed why.

<P>
As the Minister said at the outset, the policy is important, not least from the Government's point of view. It is also fairly complicated, as was well illustrated by the Minister's lengthy opening remarks. It will not do either for the Minister to say that we are considering the issue now because it is an important policy.

<P>
We are now on the last lap. We have just finished with the consequential amendments. The Government have presumably known about the policy initiative for some time. The Minister told us that the Secretary of State announced Government policy in a speech to the Social Market Foundation on 15 March. Second Reading was on 30 March. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but we heard not a breath from the Secretary of State or the Minister on Second Reading about the city academies policy, yet at the tail end of our consideration a new policy is dropped into the Bill which was first revealed in a letter dated 23 May, which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry received yesterday. How can the Committee do justice to the technical matters contained in the amendments?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would not the best thing be for the Minister who has introduced the amendments to give us the chance to consider them by taking them away and bringing them back on Report? We do not intend to make trouble, but it would be far better to debate them after proper consideration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend, in his characteristically moderate way, suggests a sensible proposal. I am happy to give way to the Minister now if he wants to take the opportunity to relieve us of the problem. He should think seriously about doing so, because the way in which the debate is being conducted is not good for parliamentary consideration of Bills in general or for this new policy. The policy will have the worst possible start if it does not receive proper parliamentary consideration. People may say that it is the job of Members of Parliament to sit up all night and read documents, but it is difficult to get hold of documents and Acts and to read things across. More important than us not having the opportunity to research and reflect upon amendments, however, is the fact that outside organisations have been deprived of the opportunity to make representations.

<P>
The Minister mentioned special educational needs. A group of amendments on special educational needs has been tabled. Those outside the House who are interested in the subject will have had no opportunity to make representation to members of the Committee. That is not satisfactory. It seems that their views do not count when it comes to fashioning the legislation. That gets the Bill off to the worst possible start.

<P>
The Minister needs to reply to the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. If he is not prepared to do that, then in fairness to the Committee and those outside the House who are interested in the matter, he must say when the Government first knew that they would table the amendments that introduce city academies. If the Minister does not want to take up my hon. Friend's offer, he must come clean with the Committee and tell us when the Government first knew that they were going to take that course. We must be given a proper explanation.

<P>
Against that background, I put a few questions to the Minister that arise from our consideration so far. Many more questions may arise. The fact that I do not ask them now does not mean that subsequent questions will be less important; some important questions may arise-not least as a result of representations made to us.

<P>
I shall deal with the amendments as they are grouped in the Minister's letter of 23 May. The first amendment in that list will amend the city technology education provisions of the Education Act 1996 by including ``city academy''. Will the Minister say how city academies will differ from city technology colleges? I have the advantage of having seen a written parliamentary answer given to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who has an interest in these matters. From the answer that he received from the Minister for School Standards, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), it seems that there is not much difference. What is the difference between city academies and city technology colleges, or are the former a sub-species of the latter? Are they city technology colleges with a slightly wider range of specialisations, a new name and a lick of paint? My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe would be interested in this, as would other members of previous Conservative Governments. I do not think that the then Government received many bouquets when they introduced the city technology colleges, least of all from the Opposition at the time. If any bouquets are to be given, perhaps it should be now.

<P>
We should like to know more about the character, management and administration of the city technology colleges. The Minister remarked on the matter and we may have many more questions about it, but for now I want to ask about three important things. I do not think that the Minister dwelt at any length on admissions in his opening remarks, lengthy though they were. City academies will be able to admit up to 10 per cent. of pupils on the basis of aptitude for the school's specialism. Where does that leave the Government on the matter of no further selection? We have already debated selection and the remarks made at the 1995 Labour party conference. The most recent interpretation of those remarks seems to be that they mean no further selection, but how can that be squared with the prospectus for city technology colleges? Exactly how will banding by ability apply to the remaining 90 per cent. of pupils? We are told in the prospectus that banding will be for the range of abilities of those who apply, but how will that be known in the first instance, not least when the colleges are first set up?

<P>
We are told that schools will be given freedom of character, management and administration, and will be free to devise their own policies. I may have missed something, but I have found no mention of remuneration for heads and staff. Will the schools be able to determine those for themselves? Will they be able to formulate and implement their own policies on discipline? There is nothing in the prospectus about that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend seems to be putting forward the slightly disturbing possibility that the Government have adopted, or perhaps even stolen, not only our city technology college policy but perhaps even our free schools policy.
Mr. Clappison: We shall have to hear the answers to many questions about this in the fullness of time. My hon. Friend has mentioned Opposition policies, but where does what we are considering leave the Government's fresh start policy, about which we have heard recently, and with which there have been problems in some high profile cases? We know about problems in schools and the departure of heads. We all want to raise standards for children in inner-city areas and in challenging schools, but we want to know whether what is proposed is to replace or supplement the fresh start for schools. Does the Minister expect more fresh starts for schools in future alongside city academies?

<P>
What the Government have described as an important new policy is getting off to the worst possible start. We need the Minister to tell us when the Government knew that they would table the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn:</B> I have an interest in this matter because I represent an inner-city constituency where many schools face challenges. Like all members of the Committee I would welcome and support any means for helping schools to achieve more with their pupils.

<P>
I want to mention a school in my constituency in the context of the criteria that would be used to decide whether a school should be included in the policy. I refer in particular to the proportion of pupils achieving five grades A to C. The school last year took in a number of Kosovan refugees. It has expressed concern to the Department that the performance indicators, on which the school's performance will be judged, will include the examination results of those refugees. Even with the best will in the world and despite the progress that has been made, the refugees cannot reasonably be expected to have reached GCSE level. Will the DFEE consider, in those particular and special circumstances, whether the performance of refugees should be included in the calculations that determine whether a school is failing?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend. Is it not the case that the statements of the chief inspector and the relevant Minister in response, not least, to the Select Committee's report, place heavy emphasis on the importance of taking into account in the assessments pupil mobility, of which refugees are an example?

<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> I agree entirely.

<P>
<B>Dr. Starkey:</B> These situations are widespread. One school in my constituency, which is by no means part of an inner city, had a large influx of Hong Kong-Chinese people because there is a lot of good housing in Milton Keynes, which was marketed in Hong Kong. That population had a similar-albeit transitory-effect on the school's performance. The children are now improving the school's performance, but for the first couple of years they had problems adjusting and depressed its performance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Benn:</B> Indeed. Such schools are penalised for accepting a significant number of children in those circumstances.

<P>
I have three quick questions on the detail of the scheme. The brochure says that sponsors do not need to have direct education experience, which leads me to wonder why they would want to establish a city academy. However, will my hon. Friend clarify the financial arrangement with sponsors and whether their terms could include a management fee for operating the school? Does he envisage that the average expenditure per pupil at city academies will be the same as, or greater than, the average expenditure per pupil at schools that they might replace? I welcome what he said about the need to work in partnership, but what would happen if a sponsor proposes to establish a city academy by taking over an existing school without the support of the LEA and the school? How would the Department judge whether to grant the submission?

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not intend to repeat the excellent comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere or the pertinent questions posed by the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn).

<P>
If the previous Government had tried to pull a similar stunt at the last minute there would have been absolute outrage. There have been good debates throughout the Bill's consideration. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have tried to be as co-operative and supportive as possible, but a completely new peice of Government policy has been dropped on us at the last minute and we are suppoed to respond to it. It is a disgrace.

<P>
I spoke to the Local Government Association yesterday for a briefing on this issue, but it has not been properly consulted and has had no chance to speak to its constituent members. The LEAs were again bypassed by a Government who are so arrogant that they expect us to acquiesce to their demands. Quite frankly, we will not do that. If the Minister will not respond to the excellent compromise offered by the hon. Member for Daventry, we will retable every amendment on Report for full debate. That is how seriously we take this matter.

<P>
The Government's whole education policy is in tatters. People, schools and LEAs do not know what policy will be dropped on them next as a result of the Government's latest thinking. The city technology colleges, which were established by the previous Administration, hve been condemned and the grant-maintained schools-which we supported-have been ripped out, yet we have the farcical situation of the Government's policy reinstating them by default.

<P>
What is more, they are going further. This is a policy that has come straight from the United States; it is the charter school movement being dumped into Britain, except that here it can have the property, as well as Revenue financing. If the Government want to bypass LEAs, to privatise our education system by the back door and to see companies such as Eddison or Advantage Education coming in and delivering cheap programmes in our schools, they are achieving their aims. I know the constituency of the hon. Member for Leeds, Central well. I taught at one of his schools for a long time and I know about the huge problems that exist in Chapletown. I do not deny that the policy might be good, but to introduce it without proper consideration means that it gets off to the worst possible start and that we will ultimately lose the whole initiative.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I can only repeat my apologies. I understand hon. Members' frustration with having to consider the changes at this late stage. I wholly understand the position of the hon. Member for Hertsmere and the frustration expressed by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. I should say for the record, however, that I regret that his understandable frustration led him to excesses of rhetoric that do not bear any relation to the facts. The changes are not about privatisation and our education policy is not in tatters. I do not intend to spend more time dealing with the excesses of rhetoric to which the hon. Gentleman unfortunately descended, although I repeat that I am sorry that we are in the current position.

<P>
I received a full briefing on the policy only yesterday and it is a matter of urgency for us. It is a good policy that is designed to meet genuine problems whose existence we all accept. If we let it slip, I do not think that we will be forgiven by people who look back at a much bigger picture than we are able to see today. We are determined to drive standards up for all our pupils-an aim that all hon. Members share. We would have preferred to give the Committee much more time to consider the changes, and I can only apologise again.

<P>
Consideration of the Bill on Report will offer a full opportunity to discuss the policy, but it must be included in the Bill before it passes on to Report. If we miss this opportunity, we would be failing in our duty. I can only apologise, and I shall do my best to answer all of the points that have been made. We are also happy to address any other issues that may arise. I understand completely the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Under-Secretary has been generous in accepting the legitimate grievance that has been expressed, although he was unjustified in attacking the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for demonstrating a genuine passion and concern about the matter. He has not referred so far to the sensible and serious concerns expressed by three hon. Gentlemen in his party, which could have been ironed out if the amendments had been tabled earlier. Because of the way in which the Government have handled the changes, such sensible concerns have not been debated and considered. Surely that is a good reason why he should reconsider the proposals and bring them back on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Once I had finished my apology, which was necessarily fulsome, I was going to address the individual points that have been made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is nicer to be given an apology than the treatment that we sometimes receive in such circumstances. The Under-Secretary has just said that he received the briefing only yesterday, which seems rather late. When did the Government decide that they would amend the Bill to introduce the provisions establishing city academies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The answer is, last Friday. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the answer that he is looking for.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am happy to give way, but before doing so I want to make the point that we are discussing important issues that affect the education of children. I can continue to apologise for the process, but I hope that the Committee will, sooner or later, move on to the outcomes and the policies that affect children.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are getting close to the stage when a good flogging might be proposed. The Under-Secretary has apologised and we should now move on to other points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, Mr. Hancock. That is precisely the spirit in which I rise. I want to challenge an assertion made by the Under-Secretary a few moments ago. I am conscious that consultation is proceeding even as I speak, but I cannot understand, given the Bill's long title, which is very general, how the Government could take the provisions away and bring them back later. The Under-Secretary gave the impression that if we did not put them in now, he would have missed his slot and there would be no possibility of doing so later. Given the disorderly nature of our proceedings now that hon. Members have become excited and want to make substantive points, it would be better for the Government to admit that they did not do well by the Committee and that there is no point in rushing consideration of these provisions. They should go away, consider how best to deal with the matter and return to it on Report. I assure the Under-Secretary that he would have our good will in seeking to do that. There will some dispute on the detail, but I do not understand why that cannot be done.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I take careful note of what the hon. Gentleman says, as always, but I hope that we can now focus on some of the issues. Of course I understand the pressure of time, but there will be an opportunity to deal with these matters fully on Report. I want to deal with some pertinent and important questions that have been raised on both sides of the Committee. I hope to allay some of the concerns and to address the substance of this important proposal to deal with the problems. We must not forget that previous attempts to tackle them, over many years, have failed.

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred to his great experience, to which I defer, but he knows how acute the problems are and that it is imperative to do something about them urgently. We are proposing to do that and we are determined to do that. I hope that all Committee members can now get on and do something about them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall give way later, but I want to press on and answer some of the substantive questions that have been asked.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about the difference between city technology colleges and city academies. There are parallels and I give the bouquet to the excellent practice that I have observed in many technology colleges as I have travelled around the country. They are doing a very fine job.

<P>
City academies represent a new and radical approach to raising standards in some of the most deprived areas. They will be at the heart of the community in which partnership with other schools and the LEA will play a key role from the outset. They will be developed using the best experience of the technolgoy colleges, some of which is very good, and will include the involvement of sponsors and the provision of a high standard of information and communications technology equipment. However, they will not create surplus places in areas where there are already surplus places, which was a problem with some of the technology colleges, and they will not select pupils on the basis of motivation in the judgment of the head about which applicants are most likely to benefit from the education to be offered, which, again, has been a feature of and a problem with technology colleges.

<P>
I was asked how that squared with our policy on selection. Our proposals are absolutely consistent with no departure from existing practice on selection.

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): On a point of order, Mr. Hancock. The Government Whip is about to move that we adjourn until 
<P>
<H5>1.30 pm. </H5>
</P>
<P>
When we debated the sittings motion, I said that sitting at 1.30 pm instead of 2.30 pm could be dangerous and hazardous. I am supposed to be at a lunch with the Lord Mayor of Westminster to discuss the regeneration of Paddington, which is an important matter for the hon. Member for Regents Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) as well as for me. I shall be confronted with the dilemma of whether to be rude to the Lord Mayor or to return to the Committee. I do not understand why we did not sit after dinner on Tuesday.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee stands adjourned until 
<P>
<H5>1.30 pm.</H5>
</P>

<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following Government amendments: Nos. 370 to 374 and 376 to 379.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I shall be brief. We have carefully considered everything that was said before we adjourned. This is an importnt measure, but we recognise the importance of allowing all hon. Members more time than they have had so far to consider it. We therefore propose to resume discussion after the Whitsun recess.

<P>
I do not want hon. Members to be in any doubt about the importance that we attach to the measure and our determination to press ahead with it, because we believe that it is important to deal with the problems that I mentioned earlier. Equally, we recognise the importance of hon. Members to have that opportunity, so I do not propose to say any more this afternoon.

<P>
Debate adjourned.-[Mr. Betts.]
