                           <em>]</em> I am glad to hear great
enthusiasm for the European Union from Government Members. As we saw,
it is perfectly possible to deal with Royal Mail’s capital needs
and not fall foul of EU state aid rules. Perhaps the Minister will tell
us what recent inquiries he has made about Government lending to a
publicly owned Royal Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000010">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Between the
2008 Hooper report and the 2010 update, Hooper’s calls for a
partnership seemed to disappear. He tells us that there is no longer a
need for the managerial skills and expertise that could be brought in
through a strategic partnership. The fact that Royal Mail could give
access to capital under more or less the existing arrangements calls
into question the need to privatise. Even if we accept Hooper’s
assertion that there is a need for private sector discipline, in his
2008 report he seemed to think that selling a minority stake was
sufficient to instil it. It seems strange that in his 2010 report he is
insistent about selling off a rather larger stake, though not with a
great deal of explanation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We heard
about capital last week from Dave Ward, the deputy general secretary of
the CWU. He said:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000012">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“When
it comes to the question of the need for further access to capital, I
think we would accept that the company clearly needs to be able to
access capital. Our point is that there are other ways of achieving
that. If you are going to proceed with this type of Bill, the starting
point of that debate needs to be a bit clearer about how much and what
for. I do not think that those questions have been properly answered at
the moment. What we hear is the company saying that there is volume
decline. Let us be clear; yes, there is volume decline. Sometimes, we
disagree on the extent of it, but the fact of the matter is that the
modernisation programme takes it into account. It is built on an
agreement that will produce profit margins of something like 7%, where
currently it is 1% over turnover. That agreement delivers significant
new profits for Royal Mail over a period of three or four
years.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Postal

                        <p class="tabbed">The initial
clauses of the Bill repeal sections of the Postal Services Act 2000,
which allows for the raising of capital. Furthermore, it is possible to
set interest rates at a rate that is acceptable under EU state aid
rules. Added to this, the removal of the pension deficit should mean
that Royal Mail has more money available for investment, anyway, and
therefore the need for capital is more
moderate.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000013">&#160;</a>

wisely and sensibly, of course there will be capital input, because we

haven for private capital, yet it has a publicly owned postal service,
which has been very profitable because it has looked into different
types of activity, such as digital-age activity and the types that
Richard Hooper mentioned last week. There are openings that can be
explored. It all depends on what the organisation decides to do and

Mail in? We have heard lots of doom and gloom, but last week people

Hooper, Moya Greene and the trade union representatives. There
definitely seemed to be a significant

in almost 20 years. They remained so in 2009-10. In 2009-10, Royal Mail
Letters made £121 million operating profit. That was up
108% from £58 million in 2008-09 and compared with a

honest—is not the fault of the people currently running it.

I raised the point in an evidence session that the Business and
Enterprise Committee stated that if the pension deficit were removed it
would give the Royal Mail Group an additional £280 million a
year, and if access to pricing were set at a level that covered Royal
Mail’s overheads as well as its marginal costs, that would give
it another £100 million a year. Moya Greene mentioned the
ballpark figure of £2 billion to £3 billion,
but there was no clarification about what capital spending that would
be on. Richard Hooper was referring to the diversification of Royal
Mail beyond the services that it already
delivers.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000031">&#160;</a>

figures, but there is no doubt that things have improved in general. We
must also remember that it has been a particularly difficult time in
the economic sphere and it has been a time of continued falling volumes
of mail. If we consider foreign competitors, we will see that even
those wonderful privatised institutions that are so often held up as
great enterprises to which we should aspire—such as
TNT—have experienced significant difficulties. It is not the
case that every time something is privatised, it is automatically
profitable and every time something is public, it is automatically

On capital, however, it was clear that, with progress being made and
modernisation taking place and with the idea of taking away the pension
deficit being made clear, if there were some regulatory
changes—particularly to the access point payment—there
could be significant differences for Royal Mail. It would, in effect,
end up being some £400 million a year better off.

privatise Royal Mail is that it needs modernisation and that, somehow,
that can be achieved only by privatising it. Yet in our evidence
sessions last week, we heard how successful the modernisation programme
had been, from none other than the Royal Mail’s CEO, Moya
Greene. In contrast to what Hooper implied in his 2008 report, in which
he gave the impression that the Royal Mail was lagging behind other
countries in its modernisation programme, Moya Greene said that it was
well out in the lead in comparison with mail services overseas. She
painted a glowing picture of the transformation that had taken place in
the Royal

came over here and saw that things were that much further ahead. She is
effectively saying, “I came from an organisation I thought was

                        <p class="tabbed">Hooper
mentioned several times the idea that there has to be privatisation
because of political interference. Hon. Members know about that. The
vision is that every time anybody suggests a change in working
practices, every working person dashes along to their union rep and
every union rep dashes to their leader, and all the union leaders dash
to Westminster, where there is lobbying, letters, e-mails, phone calls,
meetings, including meetings with Ministers, and so forth. All of that,
apparently, stops one change being made in one little office somewhere
miles away in the north of Scotland. I do not think that all the
modernisation could possibly have taken place if that had been the
case. It means either that political influence is rather a myth, or
that MPs are not as effective as they like to think they are.
Nevertheless, the modernisation programme has gone ahead, and it seems,
if anything, to have improved the relationship between the union and
the management in the past few years. It is probably a chicken-and-egg
situation: the management’s and workers’ situations have
improved, and therefore people are more willing to look at change.
Change goes well, so people are more willing to respect each
other.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000051">&#160;</a>

such interference is more than just with the work force and

be made by Parliament, and which will need Parliament to ensure that it

to strengthen the role of Parliament and the powers of the regulator

the thing was completely cut loose, privatisation rampant would lead to
higher prices and less service being delivered, because only that which
is profitable would be desirable, whereas obviously, those of us who
believe firmly in the universal service obligation want to see

regulator, but the pressures in this case are particularly significant
because of the monopoly status that is part of the network and the
final mile. It is difficult, and we have seen with Postcomm the
difficulties that it got into trying to regulate. Obviously, we all
accept that Ofcom has a broader range of experience, and that not
having a one-to-one relationship will be an improved situation.
Nevertheless, there will be distinct pressures on the regulator, and I
think we see them now. We see a terrific pressure between what the
regulator would like to impose and what the industry is saying it would
accept. We can name a number of examples where it is not always easy to
see that the balance is where it should

that bit removed, effectively, in many ways, it is in a similar

                           </div>secretary of the Communication Workers Union, told us that Adam Crozier,
the previous chief executive of Royal Mail, estimated that there had
been some 60,000 job losses. That is an extremely large number, so we
are not talking about some minor changes, but a significant attempt to
move the organisation forward, cut costs and bring in modern
equipment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
has the modernisation achieved? Last week and this week, we all heard
of the groundbreaking business transformation agreement—an
agreement between the management and the CWU—which is
undoubtedly one of the most significant aspects of the modernisation.
It was designed to address the challenges of modernisation, as set out
in the Hooper report, and it completely changed the shape of the
company, enabling Royal Mail to respond to the digital revolution while
providing employees with improved job security and terms and
conditions. There has been a very significant programme of
modernisation, and it is a tremendous tribute to the work force and the
management that it has been achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Moving on
from that—accepting that it has moved forward despite the job
losses—it is difficult to match up that glowing report of
modernisation with the idea that political interference is preventing
change. In the 2010 update to his report, Hooper comments on the much
improved industrial relations since his first report. He told
us:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
final aspect of modernisation—culture change towards employee
engagement—has begun to make good progress in a growing number
of mail centres and delivery offices. This is as a result of the World
Class Mail (WCM) initiative which began in Gatwick Mail Centre in late
2008. Employees are encouraged actively to make proposals about new
working patterns that save money, increase efficiency and reduce
accidents. As a result it has been found that costs are down,
productivity is up, accidents are much reduced, employee engagement is
vastly increased and management/workforce/union engagement is much
better. The benefits of modernisation are clearly visible in the Royal
Mail locations where the World Class Mail initiative is being rolled
out. The modernisation agreement between the management and the CWU is
also a huge step forward in terms of the level of trust between the
two. There has been an increase in information sharing and discussion
on the strategic future of the company. This should be built upon so
that management and unions
can”<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000343">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is quite right to say that industrial
relations have improved. That is something that we welcome, and I pay
tribute to both sides involved. She has quoted Richard Hooper’s

that. He
says:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed. That was very much echoed by the

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
it is time that we moved on. I will not describe all the wonders of
modernisation, as described by Moya Greene, because she really did wax
lyrical about the number of centres that had been improved and the
terrific task that had been undertaken. We will move on and tell the
Committee about the worries that we have about the effect of
privatisation of the Royal Mail on the post office network. I promise
that I will not repeat all the joys of Felinfoel and Ponthenri, because
the Committee heard about those this morning. It is essential that we
put on the record the considerable concerns that we have about the
future of the post office network, if the Royal Mail is split off and
made into a privatised company.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The problem
is that, no matter how many fine words we hear—and we have heard
wonderful words from everybody; everybody loves their post office and
everybody speaks warmly of the sub-postmasters—we do not have
any concrete, specific proposals. We are being told that the current
inter-business agreement will last a little longer. We are told that
there will perhaps be some sort of agreement in the prospectus for the
sale, but the National Federation of SubPostmasters is clear that it
needs a 10-year guarantee as an absolute minimum. One can see why,
because there has to be some sort of security that the business will be
viable for the 97% of post offices that are owned by the
sub-postmaster, who has put in a lot of money and is hoping to realise
those capital assets, perhaps to help in his retirement.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">While we had
great razzamatazz last week on the announcement of the great strategy
for post offices, those sub-postmasters will be looking very carefully
through that document to see if they can find anything that guarantees
Government business to the post offices, when we have PayPoint
challenging for the Department for Work and Pensions contract. They
will be looking carefully to see whether there are any ways in which
more viable business channels can be channelled through the Post
Office, when they see that the opportunity to have PostBank has been
ignored. They will be even more worried about the third of their
business that comes from Royal Mail, and they will want a very specific
guarantee that, because of the money that they have already invested,
they will be able to sell on their assets as a viable going concern at
the end of their time. It is a problem for many of them. The real
problem will be attracting new entrants, but as I have said, we have
mentioned some examples of that this morning and it was wonderful to
hear the hon. Member for Witham describing the opening of a post
office. Let us hope that there will be many more of
those.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000074">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I

the foreseeable future, the loss of the mails contract, even on a
partial basis, would significantly undermine the integrity of the post

areas only, the ability of the network to cross-subsidise from its
profitable urban branches would be lost. The future of many post
offices, particularly the 6,515 post offices in rural areas, would
therefore be in doubt. This would not only threaten access to mails
services but also the range of services of economic and social interest
available through the PO
network.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000350">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
Bill proposes to cut those fingertips off altogether. They may be clad
in beautiful new gloves due to the investment money announced last
week, but the chopping off of the vital contract with Royal Mail,
without a guarantee that it could be renewed, is a major
blow.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are all aware of the postal system’s financial difficulties and
no one denies the challenges posed by the shrinking customer base.
Nobody in the world knows of a postal operator that does not face such
challenges. We are all affected by the digital revolution and people
are changing their habits. Everybody faces those challenges, so they
are not unique to us. Wholesale privatisation, as outlined in clause 1,
will have some significant and undesirable side effects in terms of
both the post office network and the universal service provision. We
have to be sensible. We cannot let short-term interests dictate the
fate of such a vital economic and cultural fixture of British
society.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have heard how technology has impacted upon the way in which people use
Royal Mail, but we also have to remember that a lot of people do not
necessarily have the same easy access as us to some technologies. As I
said during a Westminster Hall debate, many people in lower-income
groups, particularly women over the age of 65, do not have access to
electronic mail and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 191<a class="bkMark" name="Column191">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are therefore dependent on their local post office. Moreover, many of
them do not have bank accounts, so they collect their pensions from the
post office and complete their various transactions there, too. It is
easy for us to think that everybody can do all sorts of other things,
but for those people the post office is particularly important. The
problem is that privatisation will lead to a situation in which
coverage, service and prices will be entirely dictated by the
profitable. The Bill has the potential to deprive those who need it
most of access to postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are not, of course, the only country with a postal service. We know of
Switzerland, but the United States of America is also a great bastion
of private enterprise. However, although 80% of its public have their
electricity supplied by a private supplier, its mail service remains in
public ownership. In fact, it is enshrined in article
1(8)(7) of the constitution, which empowers Congress to<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000081">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
US has had its difficulties, too. It has had to make $9 billion-worth
of efficiency savings and cut job numbers, which has led to about
100,000 job losses. It is struggling and has the same sorts of
challenges and difficulties as us. Nevertheless, there is no suggestion
that it will be privatised.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think we
are well aware that private firms have felt the pinch very much in the
past couple of years. The same is true of TNT. TNT is always held up as
a wonderful saviour which will come along and do everything that Royal
Mail ever wanted. In fact, it too has struggled and had difficulties in
the past few years.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
challenges that have faced Royal Mail recently have not only been about
falling mail volumes. They have been a reflection of the weaker global
economy as a whole, rather than a specific problem related to Royal
Mail. Clearly, we have examples of private firms having difficulties
too. There is a commitment among the public in this country to a proper
universal service the length and breadth of the country at a uniform
price. We know that European legislation will protect a five-day
service. We know that it will protect what is called an affordable
price, although quite how that is defined is an interesting question.
The issue of a uniform price and the issue of a six-day
service—Consumer Focus would like to see a six-day service for
packets as well as for letters—are what we might call gold
plating: things that we, in this country, want to do over and above the
EU directive. They will not be easy to protect if the service is
privatised.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000084">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I say, there is considerable pressure on all
postal services throughout the world. Last week we heard suggestions of
alternate-day services. We know that some remote areas of Canada, for
example, would not expect to have a service every day, so of course
services are looking everywhere to try to cut corners, save money and
push down costs. In the United Kingdom, we have a very clear idea of
what we would like that universal service provision to be. We want to
make sure that we do our very best to keep it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The idea of
privatisation seems to have a sort of mythology about it, a quick
fix—just go for privatisation with a massive bond and everything
will be all right—but I am not so sure that things are anything
like as simple as that. We have to be careful not to be blinded by a
purely economic perspective in our debate. We have been presented with
all those pictures of how technology can take over and how it has
affected the viability of Royal Mail, but we still have to remember
those people who are dependent on a proper mail service six days a week
and who like to have a local post office that they can go to.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need a way
forward that combines the existing postal system’s experience
and commitment to public service, while still allowing it to absorb the
best ideas and practices from private enterprise. There is no reason
why one cannot learn from the other; it does not mean that that has to
be privatised.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As we have
explained, significant pressures will be put on the regulator and those
were very clearly outlined to us by one of the witnesses last week. We
invited representatives of rival organisations to Royal Mail. One of
the clearest indications of the future pressures on a privatised Royal
Mail was given in the evidence from Alan Halfacre of the Mail Users
Association. His organisation represents mailers whose postings, he
said, make up at least 80% of the volume that goes through Royal Mail
in any day. Of course, as he suggests, those big posters have an
important stake in seeing a successful Royal Mail, but their interests
are not identical to those of domestic customers or small or medium
enterprises.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
important to note that large posters have formed an important lobby on
the direction of Royal Mail and the postal industry generally. Indeed,
as has been noted by Postcomm, the benefits of post liberalisation have
been largely registered by the large posters. Small and medium
enterprises and domestic customers have received rather less
liberalisation up until now. In comparison, large posters have
experienced liberalisation primarily as a route to very substantial
price reductions as a result of Royal Mail’s competitors being
subsidised, in a way, through their access headroom regulations imposed
by
Postcomm.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would not be unfair to say that the large commercial posters have been
the most effective lobby in the regulation of the industry since
liberalisation, and since regulation was introduced following the
passage of the Postal Services Act 2000. No one can blame the lobby for
being effective or for looking after its own interests; that is what it
is there for. However, we must take on board how the lobby will
continue to exert pressure on a privatised Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
Alan Halfacre’s opinion, a reduction in universal service is
inevitable. Last week, he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
believe that if you were allowing Royal Mail to make some significant
change now, then its cost structures would change substantially, and
that would provide a better baseline for the provision of the universal
service. You are only delaying the inevitable, is really what I am
saying and I ask you to consider doing it now if you have the
courage.”<em> </em>

                        <p>That is
not true for the myriad of users, communities and small businesses that
depend on the post office network.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A privatised
Royal Mail would have a powerful commercial incentive to preoccupy
itself with a well-organised lobby of the big posters. It is difficult
to see how the Government propose to provide the necessary protection.
The real worry is that, if we privatise the Royal Mail, with all the
excellent work that is being done now, just at the time when the
taxpayer might be able to enjoy some of the benefits of the profits, it
will be sold off so that the taxpayer receives none of the profits and
the private enterprise hawks come down and busily strip away all those
wonderful goodies. And then what might happen if a service too big to
fail suddenly has to be rescued? Does the taxpayer have to go back in
when all those private, profit-making vultures have taken away the
lovely juicy bits? That is another huge question.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So we are
saying very clearly that we oppose the full privatisation of the Royal
Mail service because it is not the best way to protect the consumer,
the universal service obligation or the post office network. Nor is it
the best way to protect the taxpayer, who has put so much in and would
now like to get something out. For those reasons, we oppose the clause
and we have tabled new clause 2.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000100">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I should like to make a slightly briefer
contribution. I, too, oppose the clause, although I also oppose new
clause 2, and I will explain why later.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000101">&#160;</a>

fundamentally believe that Royal Mail should be in public ownership and
that any attempt to privatise, or even part-privatise, it would have a

                        </div>effect on services to my constituents. That is why I oppose the clause.
My opposition is not so much about a philosophical dispute or Royal
Mail’s capital position; I simply worry about what will be left
for constituents in areas such as mine if the proposals go
ahead.
In
earlier debates on the principle of the Bill, Ministers argued that its
provisions on regulators will protect services and particularly the
universal service, but I simply do not believe that. I do not question
Ministers’ sincerity in arguing their case, but experience of
how services operate, particularly in rural areas such as mine, leaves
me very pessimistic as to whether the current level of postal service
will survive with a fully privatised postal
provider.

                           </strong> The Minister should know that water has not been
privatised in Scotland. As for the telephone system, I will introduce
him to some of my rural constituents, who complain about the lack of
broadband services through the telephone system, which has not been
invested in. The Minister is on somewhat dodgy ground on those
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I represent
an area largely composed of small towns and a large rural area. It is
rural, but by no means remote. Over the past few years, however, there
has been a steady decline in the number of services in much of the
area. With the best will in the world, given the current financial
climate, it is highly unlikely that there will be much improvement. We
have seen the closure of rural service stations, shops and post
offices. The banks have retreated from many places, and that is likely
to continue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There have
also been major changes in postal services, with a reduction in mail
collections and ever later deliveries. I live in town, but I do not get
my mail until about 1 pm. In rural parts of my constituency, it can be
much later than that. To me, that is a minor inconvenience, but to many
businesses in my constituency, it is a crucial matter. The rise of
services such as DX and Legal Post is no coincidence; it has come about
because of businesses’ need to get mail first thing in the
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In his
evidence to the Committee, Richard Hooper quoted a point that I made to
him right at the onset of his investigation into Royal Mail back in
2008 about the crucial importance of the universal service obligation
to businesses in rural areas. I have been arguing that point ever
since, and it colours my attitude to the Bill. The universal service
obligation is crucial to my area, and to rural areas throughout the
United Kingdom. In his evidence, Richard Hooper also mentioned the
young lady with a mobile phone and laptop who wondered why on earth she
would need anyone’s physical address—perhaps she has now
moved on to a smartphone. I can empathise with that view, to some
extent. Young people in Angus are no different from young people
anywhere else; they communicate by e-mail and text. Indeed, in a world
where even the Queen has joined Facebook, the personal letter perhaps
really is dying out.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In his first
report, Mr Hooper made the startling point that only about 11% of mail
is made up of private letters, and the latest Postcomm research says
that it is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 195<a class="bkMark" name="Column195">&#160;</a>
                           </div>10%. Of that, about 8% is sent around Christmas. One would presume that
most of that is Christmas cards or round robins. That is a sobering
fact. It may be a small number of people who still use private letters,
but the post remains crucial for those who
do.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
business part, however, remains very important. In the research carried
out by Postcomm, more than half of businesses surveyed were of the
opinion that they will use the internet more in the future, but the
vast majority—93%—of businesses believe that they will
always need to send some things by post. Half of businesses expect more
customers to order products online in the future, indicating a belief
that the market will grow further. Interestingly, digging down into the
figures, it appears that of those who spend between £100 and
£500 a month on mail—basically, small
businesses—72% have either stayed at the same level or have
increased their usage of Royal Mail in the past
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
young lady with a phone and a laptop may never feel the need to write a
letter, but if she lives in a rural area she will certainly use the
internet to order her books, CDs or DVDs, because, to put it simply,
since the demise of Woolworths, it is unlikely that there will be any
stores in her town that sell those items. That is a growth industry,
coming one way, for people living in rural areas. But the process works
both ways: not only do people in rural areas use the post to have items
delivered, but, crucially, small and medium-sized businesses in such
communities also use Royal Mail. In many cases, such businesses do not
have an alternative, as most do not have access to alternative
providers and they cannot get the benefits of bulk discounts, as the
hon. Member for Llanelli rightly said, citing evidence from the
Business and Enterprise Committee of a year ago. The universal service
obligation is absolutely crucial to them, and to the hope of creating
and sustaining businesses in rural areas. In his 2008 report, Hooper
noted that 86% of letters are sent by businesses, but 70% are received
by consumers. So there is an important market for businesses,
particularly small
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that many Government Members would not disagree with much of
what I have said about rural businesses, but they would argue that the
provisions on regulation in the Bill are sufficient to enable the
maintenance of the USO. It seems to me that the pressures on a fully
privatised Royal Mail will inevitably lead to a reduction in universal
service. Despite Moya Greene’s evident enthusiasm for the USO,
we heard evidence that it was making a loss for the company, although
witnesses from Postcomm and the bulk mail users felt that the headroom
charge paid by other operators was initially set too
high.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
does wonder whether, even after modernisation, carrying mail to many
rural and remoter areas can ever be cost-effective. The Library note on
the Bill states that the delivery of a letter to the islands of
Scotland will cost about £10 in real terms, of which the cost of
the stamp will be only a small proportion. I recall that the previous
management of Royal Mail tried to introduce a zonal pricing system,
even within the current regime. That was eventually rejected, but even
they were thinking about how costs are greater in rural areas. The one
thing that the USO does is ensure that the same costs apply everywhere,
which is vital for the regeneration of our rural areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000111">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Postcomm,
however, has recently announced that it is minded to allow a higher
price, even within the current system, and has indicated that a
first-class stamp may rise by up to 5p next April, despite the fact
that, in his report, Hooper made the point that rising prices normally
mean falling volumes. It is difficult to see where the system is going
with that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000112">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
ultimate point is that if there is privatisation of Royal Mail, there
may well be greater competition in urban areas. I am sure that in
London, Birmingham, Newcastle, and perhaps even central Scotland there
will be increasing competition, because there is a larger market,
although, in passing, I wonder whether a sale to TNT or Deutsche Post
would lead to a reduction, because of the removal of one of the
existing competitors from the market. However, in rural areas it will
be different. As I have said, it is already much more expensive to
deliver and collect in rural and remoter areas, and any private company
that seeks to cut costs will inevitably look to cut services in those
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
seems to be nothing in the Bill to prevent, for example, a privatised
company from hiving off profitable pieces, leaving the universal
service with a shell company that could later go to the Government and
say, “We can’t do it any more; we can’t afford it.
We’re looking for a public subsidy or we’re going to
abandon it.” We are then thrown back on the regulator alone, and
the possibility of other providers having to chuck in some money to
keep things going. I do not think that that is
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister, intervening on the hon. Member for Llanelli, asked about
other regulators. I served for some years on the Business and
Enterprise Committee and on the Energy and Climate Change Committee,
and we spent many happy hours examining the regulation of the energy
industry and the role of Ofgem. In the energy industry there were the
big six providers, and there were serious concerns about whether the
regulator was effective in curbing some of their
activity—whether there was sufficient pressure for social
tariffs and for dealing with successive rises in energy prices. It was
a very frustrating experience, in many ways. The situation in the
postal market seems to me to be even worse, because Royal Mail, or
whoever takes it over—if it is TNT or Deutsche Post it could be
still worse—will be by far the largest provider. The rest are
minnows in comparison. I do not feel that regulation is a sufficient
means of protecting the USO. We shall debate later the clauses that
allow Ofcom to consider the terms of the USO. I have grave concerns
about some of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
a truly and fully competitive market, the Government will come under
intense pressure to relax the terms of the USO, and may find that
pressure difficult to resist. I repeat the point that I made on Second
Reading: Royal Mail should be seen as part of the national
infrastructure and should be kept in public ownership, and I ask the
Committee to reject the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 2
also gives me cause for concern. As I suggested earlier, my position is
simply that Royal Mail should remain in public ownership. I understand
that the Labour party—at least during the previous
Parliament—was in favour of part-privatisation. I opposed that
stance and continue to do so, as by agreeing to part-privatisation we
would be selling the pass and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 197<a class="bkMark" name="Column197">&#160;</a>
                           </div>leaving open the possibility of further privatisation. I seem to recall
that in the previous Parliament, Lord Mandelson was prepared to sell
49% of Royal Mail. Indeed, if I understood the hon. Member for Ochil
and South Perthshire this morning, when he was questioning the Minister
about Liberal Democrat policy, it is still the policy of the Labour
party to be prepared to sell up to 49% of the Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am old enough to remember the privatisations undertaken by the previous
Conservative Administration. Only on Second Reading, the hon. Member
for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh) was bemoaning the fact that he had not been
allowed to privatise Royal Mail then, as he had wished to do, and said
that if he had, we might not be in the present situation. I do not
agree with that point, but it is an interesting observation from
someone who was active at that time.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When the
previous Conservative Government engaged in privatisation, they
included certain attempts to ensure protection for the public interest.
In such cases, they kept golden shares in the companies that were being
privatised, the classic example being the energy companies to which I
referred. I appreciate that the golden share is not quite the same
concept as a minority shareholding, but what happened there is
indicative of how matters might play out with a partially privatised
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If we look at
what has happened since, all but two of the UK’s energy
companies are owned by foreign multinationals. For example, the
Government had a golden share in ScottishPower, but the company is now
wholly owned by the Spanish firm Iberdrola. The previous Labour
Government announced in 2000 that they were giving up their remaining
golden shares in privatised companies,<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000120">&#160;</a>

<em>The</em> 
                           <em>Independent </em>put it at the time; and much of that
transpired. I came across an article from BBC News from 2003, reporting
that the golden share in BAA had been ruled illegal by the European
Court of Justice, on the grounds that it restricted free movement of
capital in the single European market. Under the sub-heading
“Political considerations” it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“BAA
said it would not oppose the government giving up its golden share. But
analysts said the possibility of a takeover was
remote.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>BAA
is now owned by a Spanish company, and it is selling off several of its
airports under pressure from the Office of Fair Trading.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That seems to
me to indicate that once we go down the road of
privatisation—once we sell the pass, once we cross the Rubicon,
or whatever analogy one uses—it will inevitably lead to more and
more privatisation. The needs of small businesses in rural and remote
areas will fall victim to the greater needs of profit in urban areas,
which account for the bulk of the business. We cannot allow that to
happen to something as important as Royal Mail. The only way forward is
to stand firm, keep Royal Mail in public ownership and resist the siren
calls to go down that path. We should not agree to clause 1 or new
clause 2, but we must reiterate the principle that Royal Mail should
remain entirely in public ownership.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000123">&#160;</a>

removal of restrictions on ownership of Royal Mail holdings will
undermine the future of post office outlets. It will weaken the unique

                        <p class="tabbed">The plans
threaten to turn a public service into a private monopoly. Post offices
play a particular social role in communities up and down the country,
and their existence should not be driven simply by profit and loss. The
debate must focus on the type of postal service that the public and
business require. From the evidence that we have heard, we can
appreciate that small business needs a six-day delivery and collection
service, and that the general public want good access to post offices,
a strong universal service that delivers to their homes and businesses
six days a week, a service that dictates that one price goes anywhere,
and a network of post offices that fully serves our communities. A
situation that allows 90% of decision-making powers to a limited number
of private investors can only serve to damage
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000126">&#160;</a>

Is he aware that the Bill does not seek to privatise Post Office Ltd,

absolutely right. There is a minimum that is required to meet the

required to ensure that that continues. The post offices that closed
under the previous Government, in my view, were closed under the
modernisation programme, which we have heard evidence about. Everybody
agrees that it is working. It was difficult for trade unions and other

                        <p>There
must be no more post office closures. We know that 59% of small
businesses want to continue to receive mail deliveries six days a week
and that 94% want a UK-wide postal service. Billy Hayes, the general
secretary of the Communication Workers Union, argues that it is
modernisation, not privatisation, that is required, and that Royal Mail
can flourish with the majority stake held by the Government. Committee
members can be assured that I agree with Mr Hayes’s sentiment
and I agree that the Government’s obsession with privatisation
is worrying.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000138">&#160;</a>

believe that the desire to privatise Royal Mail is about ideology,
despite the Minister’s assertion that he is not ideological. He
is right to say that he seemingly agreed with me prior to the general
election, since he fought the election with his Lib Dem colleagues on
the promise that his party would seek to keep the majority stake of
Royal Mail in public hands. In that sense, he was ideological in his
views prior, of course, to his promotion to Government. It is worth
reminding Committee members of the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000139">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course, but my point is that this is another
example of a Lib Dem promise that has been broken. No surprises there,
but the Minister should at least have the decency to admit it. If his
long-held position has changed, he should just say it—admit it.
The reality is that the senior partners in the coalition have an
ideology with which he once did not agree, but clearly he does
now.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
his evidence, Mr Hooper said that the decision about whether to get the
majority of investment from the public or private sector was a
political one, and was not born of economic sense. I agree with that. I
must reiterate that a political decision is very much at the heart of
the coalition Government’s intention to privatise this vital
public service, which exposes 100% of a vital service to the
insecurities of the market. It is a political decision and it is not
simply about finding external investment. It is about the
Tories’ desire to roll back the state. The universal postal
service is a public service—a vital infrastructure that supports
the UK economy. While the postal market may be changing, it remains
central to business in the UK. The development of new technologies and
the growing dependence on the internet for commerce is underpinned by
postal
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
previous Government recognised the need to modernise Royal Mail and, as
the Hooper report recommended, sought a strategic partner that would
provide much-needed private investment. Trade unions accepted this and
the groundbreaking business transformation agreement is proving
positive, as we have heard from witnesses to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the chief executive of Royal Mail confirmed, modernisation is working
and progressing well, relations between trade unions and Royal Mail are
productive and the challenges identified by the Hooper report are being
dealt with. The modernisation programme is fully funded as part of
Royal Mail’s five-year business plan. Costs are falling, profits
have increased from 0% in 2007 to 4.3% in 2009 and the business is
projected to make healthy profits by
2012.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
will be no surprise to Committee members that I have serious misgivings
about the Bill, which is fatally flawed. To add to concerns, the
breakneck speed with which the Government are attempting to pass the
Bill has meant that important questions directly affecting the
reasoning behind privatising Royal Mail have gone unanswered. What has
changed, meaning that we have to go from partial privatisation to full
privatisation?<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
common-sense approach might be to wait for the modernisation to be
fully completed and for the pension deficit burden to be relieved and
then to assess the state of the Royal Mail Group. Undoubtedly, those
two factors would have an impact on Royal Mail profits. Privatisation
may even be unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000148">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am also
concerned that we are calling for further capital investment, but no
one is able to specify an amount. Moya Greene ventured an approximation
of £2 billion to £3 billion, but both she and Mr Hooper
were unable to accurately provide firm figures. the Under-Secretary of
State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport and the Under-Secretary of
State for Business, Innovation and Skills who are members of the
Committee seem uncertain about that as well. How can the Government say
that 90% privatisation is necessary when we cannot determine how much
investment would make the venture viable? Are no other Committee
members concerned that an assumption is being made that capital
investment is needed but no one has bothered to research and determine
exactly how much? Can Committee members really expect investors to buy
shares in a company that cannot determine the amount of capital that it
requires to make it competitive? Surely this is further evidence of a
narrow ideological interest driving forward an ill thought-out and
badly flawed
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
spoke recently to a constituent who is the proprietor of a small
business in Hull East. She is concerned that her business will struggle
in an encounter with another blow, and she regards the Bill as that
blow. The connection between Royal Mail Group and small business is
important. Over the past few decades they have built up mutual
dependency. Small businesses provide a loyal customer base for Royal
Mail Group and are reliant on the services that they receive. Research
undertaken by the Federation of Small Businesses bears that out. It
found that an overwhelming majority of small businesses use stamped
mail and that nine out of 10 make a trip to the post office to buy the
stamps and send the
mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Overexposure
to market conditions will hinder rather than help small business. As
Royal Mail becomes exposed to unrestrained competition, the universal
service obligation will be put under further pressure. I suggest that
that obligation, much like the Liberal Democrats’ election
pledges, will be worth little. Small businesses rely on the service
that they currently receive from Royal Mail and on access points to
increase footfall in the high street. Such businesses are the lifeblood
of our economy and important drivers of growth. We should not harm
them. We should encourage them to grow and innovate. In this time of
austerity, small business expects support from government, not the
withdrawal of services that they rely so heavily
upon.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
drafting the Bill it is clear that the Government have not thought
through the impact of the changes on all members of our communities. I
am deeply concerned that other avenues have not been explored, and I
urge the Minister to consider alternatives to the wholesale
privatisation plan before
us.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
haste of the Bill becomes even more baffling when one considers that
the Government have no real democratic mandate for this proposed
legislation. The Liberal Democrats, in their election manifesto, firmly
supported the Labour plan for part-privatisation. I
understand that the Conservative manifesto made no mention of wholesale
privatisation of the Post Office. However, it is interesting to note
that on page 75, the manifesto says something that I agree with,
unusually:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is clear to me that the electorate did not consider the 100%
privatisation of Royal Mail, which effectively is what this is, when
they cast their vote at the ballot box. I urge the Government to think
again and reconsider the situation. I would argue that if this goes
wrong, the Government will not easily be forgiven by the electorate.
Public opinion is clearly against the Bill. A YouGov poll dated 30
September and 1 October 2010 shows that 54% of people oppose the
privatisation of Royal Mail and only 23% support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
most important and fundamental element of evidence has been the general
consensus on the need for capital, namely private capital, access to be
acquired for Royal Mail, yet we do not know how much or what it is for.
Secondly, we have heard evidence on ownership in terms of the nation,
nationality and the base of any potential owner, whether public,
private or mutualised. We have heard and seen examples from across
Europe and North America of public models, private models, and public
models acquiring private capital. We have heard evidence on the current
boards of Royal Mail and the Post Office and those who hold positions
on them. We have heard evidence on potential asset transfers from Royal
Mail to the Post Office, and we have seen evidence on the present
economic viability of post offices across the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000159">&#160;</a>

have also seen the Government rule out a post office bank, although we
have been presented with oral evidence that demonstrates that such a
resource would support any future Post Office model and would address
access issues for marginalised demographics and communities in deprived
urban and rural areas, such as mine in Middlesbrough South and East
Cleveland. We have heard evidence from Mr Richard Hooper calling for
the practice of cherry-picking to be stopped, and we have heard about
the need for the USP, accountability

                        <p class="tabbed">Key
to Hooper’s recommendations is that Royal Mail should have
access to private capital. His update says that we

obviously advocates diversification. He also says that there should be
an injection

which<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hooper’s
2010 review also talked about the “spectre of political
intervention”, which can be ongoing while in public hands, or
very immediate and debilitating, as in a privatisation. Coming from the
north-east, I have personally seen at first hand the debilitating
effects of privatisations when applied, as the Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills said, in a Maoist fashion. However,
nationalisation can also be held on to too rigorously in certain
situations and in industries where that ideology does not fit,
particularly in the steel industry, and neither ideology has helped
that industry over the years.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My main point
is that in the Bill we have quite a fair look at the post office
network and an attempt to engage with mutualisation and co-operatives.
However, coming from a background without that knowledge, what I find
unnerving is that that approach is being tried for the post office
network but has not really been tried for Royal Mail, where there is an
opportunity. That is something that I will go into as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hooper’s
update also acknowledges that there is now less need for corporate
experience than at the time of the 2008 review. He
says:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
reduced need for corporate experience means that there are now greater
options for introducing private sector capital and disciplines. It does
not have to be a sale to a partner. The much needed equity capital
could, for example, be raised by means of an IPO…turning Royal
Mail into a publicly listed company. The company’s need for
cash, and the timing of that need, will influence the choice of
preferred
option.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000367">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Businesses
can raise capital in a number of ways. They can use debt finance, as
suggested, or sell ownership to equity finance. Debt finance can be
used to raise capital without a change in ownership. The level of
capital required and what it is used for are outlined and clear.
However, Mr Hooper could not tell us specifically how much capital was
needed, or what it was to be used for. Is the capital for Royal
Mail’s expansion, as Hooper alludes to, in terms of
diversification?<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In its

of industry privatisation in my own area—steel, for example. I

employment or quality of health. It certainly did not guarantee quality

believe that our side of the House can acknowledge that the public want
a publicly owned service—not a publicly owned
business—and that access to private capital will ensure that
that service functions adequately. The present chief executive officer
of Royal Mail, Moya Greene, has come from Canada and a publicly owned
mail logistics system that has access to private capital. Moya Greene
commented that Royal Mail’s modernisation is better than
Canada’s—better than a publicly owned mail system that
has access to private capital. Yet that option seems to be ignored by
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000188">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Turning to
employee shares, historically, if we consider examples of previous
privatisations in the UK—as mentioned in the evidence session
with the representatives from Mutuo and the other mutual
groups—all UK privatisations have involved companies with fewer
than 50,000 employees. No company has previously given shares of more
than 10% to its employees—for example, in 1988 British Steel
gave 6.2%; in 1987, British Airways gave 9.5%; and in 1984, British
Telecom gave 5%. In fact, Rolls-Royce in 1987 set the precedent with
the highest figure of 10% being given to employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must
remember that, at the time, all those firms had fewer than 50,000
employees. Royal Mail has 150,000 employees, which is more than three
times that figure. The Bill refers to 10% being the minimum. I would
like that element to be looked at much more closely in relation to the
current number of Royal Mail employees. There should be some
investigation or dialogue with the unions and employees directly before
we talk about any potential share sale to any private
owner.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Donald
Brydon stated that the company has argued for employee share ownership
for a long time. As it stands in the Bill, that aspect deserves further
exploration and investigation. It has not been clarified how shares
will be distributed, and the amount has not been mentioned. Whether
shares will be permanently held by employees has also not been
clarified. The value and amount of shares going to market surely can be
calculated only after talks with employees and once the amount and
value of those shares has been
clarified.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to talk about asset transfer post-privatisation. When Consumer
Focus gave evidence to the Committee, part 13.1 of its written
memorandum drew attention to the fact that the Bill allows for the
transfer of property or other assets between parts of Royal Mail, which
could be privately owned, and Post Office Ltd, which could be publicly
mutually owned. Those provisions allow property transfers to be made
directly by the Secretary of State or by the holding company, subject
to approval by the Secretary of State. That can occur
post-privatisation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Technically,
Royal Mail—a private company—could have access to and
potential ownership of publicly owned property. That was made all the
more worrying when Andy Burrows of Consumer Focus gave evidence in a
session and highlighted that nearly 8,000 post offices—mainly
those in rural and urban deprived areas such as mine in Middlesbrough
South and East Cleveland—are currently economically
unviable.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That throws
up potential problems for, first, meeting the universal reach and,
secondly, the retention of mutually publicly owned postal office
property, if post offices are closed because of non-viability. That is
all the more likely as new services for Post Office Ltd, as highlighted
by the Bill, are not described, referred to, given a “for
instance” or a “such and such,” apart from the
post office bank, which is completely ruled out.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I conclude by
stating my opposition to the Bill and saying that I offer the hand of
friendship to Government Members and invite them to consider whether
the elements I have described should be investigated further. I stand
in opposition to the Bill on the clause stand part and I support new
clause 2.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000195">&#160;</a>

view of the Bill, as indeed have my hon. Friends the Members for
Kingston upon Hull East and for Middlesbrough South and East

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Committee has heard our position on new clause 2 and the
Bill as it stands. That is, as we have heard from hon. Members, a
position on which the Minister was re-elected in May, but it is a
position that he no longer supports. We have to ask ourselves, the
Government and the country a question as we scrutinise the Bill. That
question is: what kind of postal service do we want in this country? Do
we want one that offers a strong universal service on a six-day week,
or one where that service is put at risk through
privatisation?<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Everyone on
the Committee will have heard from the evidence, the debate, and before
the Committee was even conceived, that the postal market is
challenging. It is changing with the increased use of e-mail and the
internet. While this market is changing, the postal service still has a
strong part to play. In fact, the witnesses who gave evidence made that
very point.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Take internet
companies, such as Amazon, which rely on a universal postal service. No
doubt, we were all amused by Richard Hooper’s “Beam me
up, Scotty” reference, but he was right. We have not mastered
the art of teleporting yet. As long as that is the case, physical,
non-digitisable products are a huge growth market. One of the reasons
why I am optimistic about Royal Mail is that there is a huge
opportunity for it to be a “major player”. Those are
Richard Hooper’s words, not mine.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, if
we are to use the argument of falling volume in the letter market as a
reason for the sale, we must remember, as has already been pointed out,
that Royal Mail has anticipated the current mail volume decline, that
its fully funded business plan takes account of the projected mail
volume decline and that it expects to complete its modernisation, as we
have heard from the Minister, by 2013. By that time, it will be making
healthy profits, despite the falling mail
volume.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000201">&#160;</a>

the Royal Mail Group has told him that it can predict with a degree of

into its calculations? During my discussions with its representatives,
they were surprised to see mail volumes fall by 7% last year. The range
of its forecasting for falling mail volumes for the next five years is
between 25% and 40%. Those are large numbers, but that is also a large
range.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000202">&#160;</a>

                           </div>anticipation going forward—it is called a business plan. That is
something that I questioned Ms Greene on. In particular, I questioned
her on whether she was in a position to pass the Committee a little
more information on her predictions for the future before the Committee
ends its deliberations, because it is of huge importance.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A private
company will not want to invest in a business burdened by a costly
universal service or by such a costly service that it restricts profit
growth in their business. Private shareholders will seek to unpick the
universal service, arguing that it is too costly and unsustainable.
That will undermine the universality of the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli said, in his most recent report
Richard Hooper recommended a review of the universal service alongside
the privatisation of capital for Royal Mail. He repeated that again in
Committee last week. It was interesting to hear evidence from Mr
Hammond of Consumer Focus about which day would be lost if there was a
reduction in the universal service obligation for letters from six days
to five. That was interesting because it brought yet another dimension
to the issue. The demands of businesses and individuals compete and the
aspirations of the public and business can really be reached and
satisfied only by the current six-day universal service
obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are seeking to separate the post office network from the
rest of Royal Mail. That is a Liberal Democrat manifesto proposal, but
it is not a coalition proposal. Perhaps the Government intend to do
that quickly, but we do not know. We deliberated this morning on sunset
clauses, when the Minister said that he did not think that we want to
sit around on this, or words to that effect. If the Bill is passed, we
do not know what will happen. Perhaps the Minister—again, I
offer him the opportunity to do so—will fill us in on the
plans that exist at present, as we have already asked him to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is felt that the sale will undermine Royal Mail’s ability to
provide the universal service obligation, with post offices being the
key point of access to mail services. That will threaten the post
office network. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston
upon Hull East has mentioned that. Post offices will become more
dependent on Government subsidy and, in these austere times, closures
will be inevitable. The USO is important not only to the individuals
and businesses that Royal Mail serves, but to the post office
network.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Alan
Cook, a previous managing director of Post Office Ltd, has said that
the USO can be operated with 4,000 branches. We have heard reference to
that in Committee today. That point was made loud and clear in evidence
by Mr Burrows from Consumer Focus. My hon. Friends and I are worried
about that—and that is before we get to worrying about the
inter-business agreement and the relationship between the privatised
Royal Mail and the state-owned or mutualised Post
Office.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000209">&#160;</a>

Mail can flourish in the public sector. Its position is already
improving, as has been made clear by my hon. Friend the
Member for Llanelli. Its modernisation

                           </div>programme is funded and it expects to be making normal profit levels in
the next few years. It will benefit from the Government’s
proposed action on pensions and from changes to regulation, which will
provide a more substantial buffer during the current difficult economic
climate. The company could benefit from access to additional capital to
grow and improve the business in the medium term, but that is possible
within the public sector, as my hon. Friend has
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend has mentioned that the Royal Mail can already borrow money
from the national loan fund. It would be interesting to hear the
Minister say why he thinks that it would not be possible to speed up
that process in the way that my hon. Friend has suggested. Perhaps that
has not been considered. That would allow Royal Mail to borrow at more
favourable rates than could be achieved independently and, as my hon.
Friend has said, it would allow the Government to generate some
revenue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000211">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> He may want to have a further look at the poll,
however, because it states that 63% of Lib Dem voters would be against
the content of the Bill, as would 69% of Labour voters, and—for
the benefit of members of the Conservative party—51% of
Conservative voters would be against a Bill that sells off Royal

is no public support or demand for the Bill. However, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Telford has said, I am sure that the Minister is not
paying too much attention to public opinion at present. His
party’s standing in the public’s eye would reduce a
lesser man to tears if he deliberated on it too long. That public
opinion is based on real and substantial fears—I mean public
opinion on the Post Office, not on the Lib Dems, although the public
might have substantial fears about them, too. If the representations
that I am receiving are anything to go by, they are putting quite a bit
of fear into people now. However, I refer to the public fear that the
profitable parts of Royal Mail will be hived off and that the Post
Office and the USO will be left to wither on the vine.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000215">&#160;</a>

favours Government majority ownership—the Lib Dem manifesto says
so, but, alas, the Lib Dems are the junior partners in the coalition.
What about the Conservative manifesto? It made no reference whatsoever
to privatising Royal Mail or to reform of the Post Office. It stated
that pubs and post offices were important to local communities; it
mentioned the post-bureaucratic age, post-conflict resolution, and even
first past the post; it mentioned nothing, however, about what we are
discussing today. Eighteen words in the coalition agreement have given
us the Bill, which will fundamentally define how the UK’s postal
service is delivered—excuse the pun—for the next
generation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000216">&#160;</a>

who stood for election on public majority ownership of Royal Mail, is
breaking yet another promise. The case for total privatisation has not
been made, and the figures that I read out from the YouGov poll in
August should sway the Minister to that thinking.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Richard
Hooper’s analysis of the postal market is seen by some as a
premise for privatisation. Royal Mail is modernising successfully in
the public sector. We have referred to its chief executive Moya Greene
many times and, I fear, will continue to do so in the coming sittings.
In evidence to the Committee last week, she said that the modernisation

                        <p class="tabbed">If
anyone were still in doubt about Royal Mail’s ability to
flourish in the public sector, I have some facts, which my hon. Friend
touched on in her contribution and which are worth repeating or
expanding on. In 2009-10, Royal Mail Group made £404 million in
operating profits, which was up 26% from £320 million in
2008-09. In 2008-09, all four main business units were in profit for
the first time in almost 20 years, and remained so in 2009-10. In
2009-10, Royal Mail letters made £121 million
operating profit, which was up 108.6% on £58 million in 2008-09,
compared with a £3 million loss in 2007-08. That rise in profits
came from increased efficiency with £206 million worth of cost
savings in 2009-2010 following significant savings in 2008-09. The
Committee will remember my reference to my lack of expertise in maths,
but I have always been quite good at arithmetic. Arithmetically, those
figures deliver a story that suggests that Royal Mail has turned the
corner and has a role to play within public
ownership.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to see the performance of Royal Mail in context. We should
put it in an international context, an issue that my hon. Friend the
Member for Llanelli touched on in her presentation. However, it is
worth remembering that those results were delivered in what can only be
described as challenging times, when there was a considerable shock to
our economy and falling mail volumes of 5.5% in 2008-09 and 7.3% in
2009-10. If my memory serves me right, Richard Hooper commented that
the decline in mail in the United Kingdom in 2009-10 was significantly
less than in other markets. That really says something about the
quality of the business that we are dealing
with.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Revenues
are lower and down by 3.9% over the two financial years, but let us
contrast that position with the private sector, which is where the
Government want to take us. In 2009, TNT’s profit margin fell by
3.7% and its profits were down 25.4%. Deutsche Post saw a reduction of
5% in its profit margin and a 36.5% decline in its profits. Both
companies experienced far smaller decreases in mail volumes and, in the
case of the Netherlands, a shorter and less severe recession than the
UK in its home
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
separation of the Post Office from Royal Mail fundamentally threatens
the future of the post office network. The survival of the Post Office,
in anything like its current state, is dependent on its relationship 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 211<a class="bkMark" name="Column211">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with Royal Mail. The mail products and consumer footfall that they
generate at post offices are the largest and most important revenue
stream. Inevitably, separation will weaken the relationship between the
two companies and will make future post office closures more
likely.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
heard the Minister say that he cannot guarantee that there will not be
more post office closures. I hate to bring the Committee back to
something that I have mentioned several times and might continue to
mention, but I cannot even get a post office in Bankfoot in my
constituency. The Committee will recall my taking up the issue with Ms
Vennells last week. The IBA is so important—it is too important
not to be covered by the Bill. I accept that we have heard comments
about the legality of enforcing an IBA period, but if an Act of
Parliament cannot enforce it, I am fairly sure that the sale prospectus
will not hold too many challenges for the legal team of whoever is the
successful
bidder.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
2009-10, the Post Office received £343 million in revenue
directly from Royal Mail businesses. As I have said, it has become
increasingly reliant on its mail business, which accounts for just less
than 37% of its revenue. It is therefore essential that the Post Office
retains Royal Mail business. In private ownership, Royal Mail would
look to reduce its costs, which would be to the detriment of the Post
Office. The Minister has been under some pressure from the National
Federation of SubPostmasters on the matter, and he has said that he
wants an agreement for as long as possible. I do not understand how an
agreement that matches the hon. Gentleman’s aspirations can be
enforceable, but a solution that stipulates here and now a certain
number of years is not enforceable. We all know that some sort of deal
will have to be done, which will prove that a deal is, in fact, doable.
We can all imagine the ways in which that could be achieved but, if the
Minister cannot support new clause 2, he must commit to a deal for a
number of years that provides a future for the Post Office. He should
not sell out for anything less than the 10 years argued for by the
National Federation of SubPostmasters, and he should, in my view,
consider an even longer period. Anything else would put the post office
network in
jeopardy.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000224">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli has made her points well, as have
my hon. Friends whom I mentioned earlier. My contribution is to support
her in her aspiration that the Government retain a majority
shareholding in Royal Mail Holdings plc and its relevant subsidiaries.
I believe that that is something that my other hon. Friends will wish
to make further comments and representations on throughout our
discussion of the Bill as we try to bend the Minister back to the
thinking that he expressed on this matter when he stood before the
electorate in
May.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000225">&#160;</a>

Friends have said. It seems to me—this has been touched on by my

through this issue is not wholly one of economic expediency, but one of
political dogma. In my view this has been ideologically driven, because
that is what Tories do—it says it on the tin. There is plenty of
evidence for that. One need only look at the privatisations of the
1980s to see that that is the case. What is surprising, though, is

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is correct. Many of my hon.
Friends referred to that earlier. Just to reiterate the point—I
apologise for repeating this simple fact—the Liberal Democrat
manifesto made a commitment to retaining the majority of Royal Mail in
public sector ownership and employee share ownership, with a minority
being
privatised.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government say that privatisation is needed to attract the necessary
capital investment. We all agree that Royal Mail needs capital
investment, but is it beyond the Government’s wit to obtain
private investment while retaining public control of Royal Mail? Of
course it is not. We have had many examples of how the Government could
achieve that objective. I need only cite past public-private
partnerships that achieved new schools and hospitals while the direct
provision of education in our schools and health provision in our
hospitals was kept in full public ownership and control.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">May I also
ask—my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire
made reference to it earlier—what consultation the Government
have undertaken? Have they asked the public what they think about the
privatisation of Royal Mail and its possible decoupling from the post
office network? As far as I am aware, there has been no consultation. I
am a great believer in asking people what they think about what we do
before we actually do it. My background is in local government—I
was a councillor for 23 years. We put our customers at the heart of the
process and asked our stakeholders what they thought we should be doing
before we implemented anything. That was a successful
model.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, as far as I am aware the Government have not properly
consulted the public, yet we are aware from independent opinion polling
that the majority of the public oppose the privatisation of Royal Mail
and wish to see it remain in public ownership. Of course, that figure
is much higher when the work force are polled.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000233">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Earlier, the

political interference is what the Government are doing to my postal
services, your postal services and the people’s postal services.
He also talked about flexibility. I support flexibility in the

office network and adapting to changing circumstances and market
conditions, which is something that may be lost if Royal Mail is
privatised, fragmented and left to the vagaries of the financial
institutions.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000234">&#160;</a>

clause stand part debate. It has been a long debate, because the clause
goes to the heart of the Bill. It is about the future ownership of
Royal Mail, and we have had a good opportunity to debate that and hear
the views of the Opposition. In my response, I want to deal with a
number of key themes that have emerged—capital and the capital
requirements, modernisation and how much progress has been made.
Various members of the Committee have talked about how privatisation
impacts on the Post Office. Although it is not fundamental to the
clause, I will respond to that. Several Committee members have raised
other issues, and I will try my best to cover all the individual
points—I apologise if I do not manage to cover every single
one.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000236">&#160;</a>

business, why I believed it before the election and why the Liberal
Democrat manifesto advocated it. I cannot for the life of me understand
why the Committee members who quoted from the Liberal Democrat
manifesto did not realise that it was in favour of privatisation.
Certainly, the CWU, which lobbied against it when we debated it in

the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East. I asked him whether he
realised that employee share ownership took place in the private
sector, and he agreed with me that it did.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000239">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When one is
going through massive structural change, there is uncertainty and risk,
and I have to tell the Labour party that industries and firms faced
with uncertainty and risk do not sit well in the public sector. The
need for flexibility, for quick access to capital and for quick
decision making is much more necessary when a company or industry is
going through such structural change, and, therefore, a private owner
makes much more sense for this
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
intervened on the hon. Member for Llanelli on this second point and
although she admitted it, I do not think that she necessarily saw the
power of the argument. This is an industry that is becoming less labour
intensive and more capital intensive. Clearly, there will always need
to be an awful lot of employees, because machines will not be
delivering letters to the door. I certainly accept that, and I welcome
the fact that there will still be high employment in this company and
this industry in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Anyone
who has looked at postal administrations around the world, and at how
they are working and preparing for the structural change and challenge
of the future, will know that significant amounts are being invested in
new machines that can do the sorting to much finer levels than has
historically been the case. A lot of the manual interventions in
sorting letters and parcels are being taken out and capital is
replacing that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a
critical structural change, and the Labour party has to understand
that. I cannot believe that its Members seriously think that the
taxpayer will be able to provide that level of capital investment. It
is not about a one-off modernisation; we are not talking about one-off
changes, but about dynamic changes over a period of
years.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000249">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will come to that issue, but first I will finish
my point about the core underlying economics that the Labour party does
not seem to address. I give credit to the hon. Lady. In her remarks,
she made it clear that under the previous Government, over 60,000 jobs
were lost in Royal Mail as it began to address issues of modernisation.
There has been some investment, but the process is far from complete.
When I come to the argument about modernisation, which the hon. Lady
went into in detail, I will look to the Hooper report to show that the
process is far from complete.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me touch
briefly on the experience of the German Post Office, Deutsche Post.
Since its first flotation in 2001, the equivalent of £11.9
billion has been invested. Part of that £11.9 billion has been
spent on the sorts of things that Royal Mail is beginning to invest in,
such as walk-sequencing machines and other sorting equipment that we
could no doubt discuss. Quite a lot of that money has been invested in
ensuring that Deutsche Post is able to deliver more effectively, and
sort, distribute and allocate parcels. It understands that because
there will be no “Beam me up, Scotty” technology in the
immediate future, as Richard Hooper told the Committee, much of the
future of such businesses will be in parcels.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Traditionally,
because the parcel sector has been more competitive, a lot of that
business has been won by private companies. For a universal service
provider such as Deutsche Post or Royal Mail to be competitive, there
must be serious investment in that area. That is why Deutsche Post has
gone in that direction, and that is my prediction for Royal Mail.
Critically, it is not about the one-off amount of capital that will be
needed; it will be a continual process, because that is what the
competition will be doing both domestically and internationally. That
is the sort of position structure that we need for Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000253">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister paints a glowing picture of
Deutsche Post, which I understand to be fairly accurate. Does he agree
that Deutsche Post is not fully privatised in the way that the Bill

length. It was at the heart of the remarks made by the hon. Member for
Llanelli and it goes to the heart of the debate. I was surprised by one
point that the hon. Lady raised, as it was not reflected in the
evidence that we heard from the witnesses. At one stage, she said that
she does not think that 18 months is a long time to wait for capital.
As we heard from the chairman, Mr Brydon, 18 months is a ridiculously
long time to wait for capital.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Companies
facing challenges such as those faced by Royal Mail need to know that
they can get access to capital when they need to. When the board
decides to make a strategic investment, it does not want to have a
public debate so that all its competitors can see that it needs money
to invest in a certain area. That is not a commercial approach; it is
giving one’s competitors 18 months’ notice of
the sorts of capital investment one is going to make. That is a
nonsensical way in which to run an industry. It is no wonder that we
heard from the chairman about the impatience and frustration that have
been
felt.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000257">&#160;</a>

characteristics. I do not want to try your patience, Mr Amess, but my
problem with rail privatisation was not that private capital would be
introduced into the industry; it was with the structure that was
proposed. Given that the current Leader of the House, who is now my

move swiftly

the new private owners had greater access to capital. The Minister has
spoken of getting additional private equity capital, and about putting
skin in the game—putting more at risk—to get private
equity to invest in the business. However, when steel was privatised,
the Redcar coke ovens on Teesside still had not had a penny piece of
capital invested in them since 1984, in the nationalised days. Just
because private companies can access capital does not mean that they
actually
will.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000260">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. It is not
absolutely essential, but historical comparisons between state-owned

not mention her party’s 1999 White Paper, “Post Office
Reform: A world class service for the 21st century”. In those
days, Royal Mail was known as the Post Office. I refer her to page
55:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000262">&#160;</a>

retained earnings to fund investment. On 31 March 2010, its retained

                           </strong> Yes. Let me go on, because this is quite a sorry
story. The 1999 White Paper also extolled the virtues of a rigorous
dividend regime for driving commercial disciplines in companies. It
committed the Government to inform Parliament of the expected dividend
from Royal Mail after the Government had agreed to the company’s
strategic plan. The Government would then inform Parliament at the end
of the financial year of the final dividend that had been
paid.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000274">&#160;</a>

that not once—not once—since Royal Mail was converted
into a plc by the last Government has Parliament had the pleasure of
hearing that the company was in a fit enough financial state to be able
to pay a dividend to the Government as a shareholder. Not one dividend
was paid as of 2001.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000275">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Llanelli made a specific point about Royal Mail. I
think I am quoting her correctly; she said that under her plans, Royal
Mail should be able to borrow with preferential rates. Perhaps she
misspoke, but let me set her straight by quoting from her
party’s 1999 White
Paper:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000278">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>In
other words, her Government rejected the idea that there should be
preferential rates for Royal Mail borrowing. I hope that she, from that
analysis of her Government’s 1999 White Paper, will see that
there has been both experience and attempts to look at other ways of
raising capital, and that they have clearly
failed.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000280">&#160;</a>

he will see that the reference there was to where European state aid
laws would come in, and if we were to give a preferential rate, they
would clamp down on it. The point was that loans could still be
provided at a sensible commercial rate. A commercial rate would be one
that was similar to that of competitors. What specific studies has the
Minister made of other options for capital since he has been in

                           </strong> I have certainly read the 1999 White Paper, as I
think the Committee can now see, and when I gave evidence to the
Committee I talked about the experience of the New Zealand post office,
with which I am familiar, and about how it had four long-term credit
lines with private sector banks. The hon. Lady will remember that in my
evidence I said that one might have considered that model, but the
problem is that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 219<a class="bkMark" name="Column219">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Royal Mail’s assets have effectively already been secured against
the borrowings that it has already made. Given that it has a negative
cash flow, the idea that a private bank would lend against future
revenue prospects is a limited one. Therefore, as I said in my
evidence, what we need is risk capital finance—equity finance.
It is simply not the case that there is some sort of debt-borrowing,
get-out-of-jail-free future for Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady stated that we engage in euro-scaremongering when we talk
about state aid. I hope that she realises that I would never engage in
euro-scaremongering; I suggest that we are not doing so and that she is
over-simplifying the situation. For example, the 2007 commercial
financing for Royal Mail had a package that the Commission took nearly
two years to approve. That was not because the Commission did not give
it due care and attention, but because it is difficult to benchmark
what is commercial when a Government lend or invest. In the private
sector that is easy to determine, as that sector either gets the money
from the banks or the markets, or it does not. In the public sector it
is more
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady has, I think, had a simplified view of what Royal
Mail’s competitors’ view might be of any financing from
the Government to Royal Mail. She will be aware that, under European
rules, if the Commission receives a complaint about state support given
to Royal Mail, it is obliged to open an investigation. Such an
investigation may take a minimum of six months, but in reality it can
take between 12 and 18 months, as the 2007 case proved. There is no
easy fast track that we can look at, as our own Government’s
experience has shown time and time again. The hon. Lady failed to
answer the fundamental question that I put to her. The Royal
Mail’s balance sheet cannot bear any further substantial debt.
It is basically maxed out on its security for loans, and it therefore
needs the equity capital for which I have been arguing. Someone has to
take that investment risk, particularly given the structural change and
the uncertainty that the industry
faces.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
lot has been made of political interference. A private investor would
be worried about political interference in key strategic decisions, for
example decisions on closing a mail sorting centre or opening one, or
on getting foreign capital in. There could be a lot of lobbying, and
the CWU, which has done a fantastic job in working with management for
the modernisation agreement, is a well respected lobbyist of MPs. Some
people would suggest that the reason why the 2009 Postal Services Bill
was not brought to the House of Commons, having been taken through the
House of Lords by Lord Mandelson, was not so much to do with market
conditions, which was what he said in his statement to the House, but
more to do with CWU lobbying of Labour Back Benchers. I would have
thought, therefore, that the Labour party would know all about
political interference in a publicly owned
company.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000285">&#160;</a>

2008-09—perhaps the most serious in 70 years—and most
people agree that its roots lay in an unfettered market. Apropos of the
Bill, the regulators of financial markets were constantly told by the
people operating in those markets not to interfere too much, because
the people operating in those markets knew best. There is an issue to
consider about regulatory capture, which is a major issue in the Bill,
and the consequence of privatisation where the Government do not have a

Gentleman comments. The idea of regulatory capture is interesting. That
is one reason why the Bill borrows from the 2009 Bill and changes the
regulator from Postcomm to Ofcom. I am not suggesting and do not think
that history suggests that Postcomm was captured in any way by the
Royal Mail, at least, but with a regulator such as Ofcom, which is
responsible for a much wider market, the dangers that the hon.
Gentleman is worrying about will not be
there.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
thrust of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Llanelli was
that modernisation was progressing well, everything was hunky-dory and
we did not need privatisation because everything was so fantastic. She
clearly has not read Richard Hooper’s update or original report.
Although she quoted a little bit from it, she did so rather
selectively. In Richard Hooper’s diagnosis of the current state
of Royal Mail from this September, he clearly states that there has
been good progress on modernisation and that there is a better
regulatory climate and better industrial relations, but he goes on to
state that four interconnected concerns identified in the 2008 report
have got worse—the decline in letter volumes, market share
losses, which are both worse than expected, the increased size of the
pension deficit, which is larger than expected, and the deteriorating
financial health of Royal Mail. Those significant negatives are
identified by Richard
Hooper.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Reading
part 2 of Richard Hooper’s update, some of the more optimistic
noises that the hon. Lady wanted to bring to the Committee’s
attention are not there. For example, on the financial health of Royal
Mail, as analysed by him, he makes it clear
that<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Royal
Mail’s financial health has deteriorated even further since
2008…Post-tax losses for the Royal Mail Group have grown from
£229m in the previous financial year to £320m in 2009-10.
Pre-tax losses for Royal Mail Letters have grown from £200m to
£333m.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000380">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>He
then talks about the worsening balance sheet and
says:<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

will not go through every section of Richard Hooper’s
argument—he gave evidence to the Committee—but let me
deal with modernisation head-on in terms of what progress is being made
in Royal Mail. Let me be clear. I welcome the progress that
has been made. On pages 23 to 25 of his report, Richard Hooper sets out
where modernisation is far from complete and where there are currently
serious risks, and he finds out whether that

towards customers, will be taken forward. He is concerned about a range
of things. The Opposition cannot rest on the argument that
modernisation is the answer and say that we do not need to take more
significant serious
action.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000294">&#160;</a>

provide an important point of access to the services of Royal Mail and

enabling the Post Office to fulfil its Universal Service

closely to what the Minister said about post office closures. Will he
confirm that between 1999 and 2004 the Labour Government put £2
billion in investment into the post office network and we still ended
up with the large-scale closure programme? I wonder whether that says
something about the difficulties that his Government are going to face
in delivering on the promise that there will be no programme of
closures.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000301">&#160;</a>

of that statement says that they are very worried about it happening
too soon. They are very worried that at the moment the Post Office is
not actually in a state to be able to cope with that loss of a third of
its business. Will the Minister explain to us how it is that in an
announcement last week—when quite a considerable amount of
taxpayers’ money is being put in—we have not seen
anything that will make post offices more viable, in terms of new
business, and we have not seen a guarantee that they will be getting
that DWP contract? Those are the things that could possibly enable them
not to need that Royal Mail business. I suspect that at the moment

and no doubt I will make it clear in future debates, but let me make it
clear again. The issue is one for Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. That
is who the contract is between. Under the previous Government,
Ministers did not negotiate that contract or have sight of the terms of
the contract. My understanding is that they would not have seen the
contract—I, certainly, have not seen it. I was heartened,
however, by what the chairman said about the issue. He wanted an
as-long-as-possible inter-business agreement, and that is what he would
work
for.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000309">&#160;</a>

individual points. The hon. Member for Angus was worried about the
universal service obligation

                           </div>in rural areas. He is absolutely right; it is critical to many rural
communities and therefore I hope he welcomes the extra safeguards in
the Bill which were not in the 2009 Bill or in the Postal Services Act
2000. Indeed, those safeguards have never been there before and include
strong terms about the need, if there was to be a change, for
Parliament to be involved in the process and for a proper review by
Ofcom. Indeed, any change would still require uniformity of price,
which is not required under the European postal directive. They are
strong safeguards for the universal service obligation, which have not
been there before and ought to be welcomed by the hon. Gentleman and
other hon. Members who represent rural
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000310">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Livingston was worried about consultation. We could, of
course, consult again on some other idea. We could consult again and
keep consulting. We could never take a decision. However, the issue has
been fully debated over many years. Richard Hooper, in 2008, under the
previous Government, had a substantial consultation and talked to many
people in the industry, from the employee, competitor, Royal Mail and
user sides—an extensive consultation on the back of which the
previous Government felt able to proceed with a Bill. We have come to
power but, given that our Bill is not dissimilar from the previous
Bill, we decided that we should rely heavily on the evidence from the
2008 Hooper review. We sought an update, which we got. It involved Mr
Hooper consulting further, and so we relied on the original review and
the update. That is consultation
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East at some stage got a little
confused between the post office network and the universal service
obligation of Royal Mail. He made a lot of points about whether there
should be majority ownership of Royal Mail. I hope that he now
appreciates that in order for a Royal Mail company to have easy access
to sufficient capital, there needs to be a majority shareholding in the
private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland talked about
capital—he wanted to know how much and what for. From, in
particular, my example of Deutsche Post and from my description of the
challenges facing the company and the industry, I hope he will
appreciate that the need is not for a one-off injection of capital.
Anyone involved in the sector will need continual investment, in
machines, automation, new processes, new plant and so on. For the
public sector to be in a position to provide that capital over the next
five or 10 years, given that it was not in the years of plenty, anyone
would realise that the answer would be
no.<a class="bkMark" name="10111640000313">&#160;</a>

we are doing in the Bill is by far the best way to get large amounts of

service, to which we and our constituents are committed, and restore

leaders in the delivery
