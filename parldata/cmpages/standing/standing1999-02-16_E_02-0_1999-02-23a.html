<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): On a point of order, Mr.
Atkinson. First, I welcome you to the Chair. I hope that our
debates will not be quite as protracted as when we last
considered employment matters.
<P>
I raise two small matters in connection with the Official
Report. In doing so, I wish to make it clear that all members of
the Committee have the greatest respect for Hansard. The problem
may have arisen either because I did not use an adjective or
perhaps because I mumbled away from the Chair&#151;and the
reporter&#151;which I should not do. May I ask for a correction
to be made to column 8. I was reported as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I do not want to be trapped into saying that that means
that all large businesses are nice to their
employees''.&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 16
February 1999; c.8.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My recollection&#151;certainly it was my intention&#151;is
that I said ``all small businesses''. There is no self-evident
link between size and the employment-friendliness of businesses.
<P>
The second correction that I seek is to column 35; there was
either a mishearing or a misunderstanding. I believe that I
referred to the Commission spokesman's reported remarks about the
working time directive. It is reported as being the ``Low Pay
Commission'', &#151;when it should have been the European
Commission.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is not matter
for the Chair. However, I am sure that the Hansard reporter has
heard what has been said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce (South Dorset):</B> On a point of order, Mr.
Atkinson. I wonder whether I might also ask for the record to be
amended. At column 19, when I quoted what I had said on Second
Reading, the Hansard reporter used the words that were printed
in that original report. However, that report contained a
mistake, and I have asked the Editor of the Official Report to
correct it. I said that I advised a company that owns an
employment business and an employment agency. The Minister knows
the difference between those two, but many people believe that
they are one and the same thing, and it has wrongly been reported
as being ``a business employment agency''.
<P>
Clauses 8, 9 and 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Leave for Family and Domestic Reasons</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 47, line
42, after first `be', insert `reasonably'.
<P>
I hope that it is noted that the Committee has passed three
clauses in less than a minute&#151;something that often takes
three weeks. Please do not fear that we are suffering from
narcolepsy, Mr. Atkinson. We thought it bettter to debate the
amendments and, if you see fit, for us to debate some of the
general issues in a schedule stand part debate.
<P>
My mind always thinks in numerical sequences of a fairly
simple nature; we have a series of triplets this
morning&#151;and I am not talking about maternity leave. Three
clauses pave the way for one schedule; we shall be debating three
separate matters&#151;maternity leave, paternity leave and what
might loosely be called domestic incidents; and there are three
degrees of acceptability. Subject to the views of my hon.
Friends, we would probably say that those matters are listed in
the Bill in a diminishing order of acceptability.
<P>
Maternity leave is not without difficulties, which we shall
come to in the amendments. Parental leave gives rise to further
difficulties, because it is a new concept. The concept of
domestic emergencies gives rise to considerable concern. However,
we thought it better to consider those matters in what, to borrow
a phrase, might be described as a series of short, sharp debates
on the various points raised by my amendments and those of the
hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). We do not do that in any
spirit of faction; we seek to improve or test the Bill in ways
that may be acceptable to both sides of industry.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 seeks to introduce the concept of
reasonableness into employees' actions. The Minister will tell
us&#151;having consulted others who also wish to tell
us&#151;that all the parties concerned wish to be reasonable in
the matter. I am sure that that is true, certainly at what used
to be called the macro level. If the Minister talked to the CBI
and the TUC about it, he would have a civilised discussion; they
do not wish to rock the boat and would seek to make the
provisions work. The Minister may have encountered in his
industrial experience cases of employers who occasionally did not
see reason or of employees who occasionally behaved in a foolish,
ill-considered or, to use a perhaps better term, inconsiderate
way. I stress that such incidences are the exception, not the
rule.
<P>
My amendment proposes that a female employee&#151;who can
hardly, even these days, time or predict her
pregnancy&#151;should nevertheless act reasonably in regard to
the interests of her employer and her fellow employees by trying,
as far as possible, to fit in her period of notice and her leave
with their requirements. There will be circumstances in which
that is difficult to do; indeed, if it is so difficult, the test
of reasonableness takes on a different implication. However, if
people co-operate with their employer in giving notice and in
working out their period of leave, in relation to other
employees' holiday plans, for example, that seems good industrial
practice. Dare I say that it is no different from how Ministers
are supposed, in conducting their legislative activities or
reaching decisions, to have over their shoulder that
judge&#151;, to whom I have referred in regard to judicial
review&#151;who would expect the Minister to behave reasonably,
in accordance with the Wednesbury rules, in any action?
Similarly, all that the amendment seeks&#151;although not with
the degree of sophistication or, one hopes, the degree of
judicial proof&#151;is to ensure that employees behave
reasonably to their employers. Even if the Minister is
disinclined to accept the wording of the amendment, it none the
less sets out an important principle.
<P>
If we have substantive concerns about the maternity
provisions, they arise out of the interaction of maternity leave,
ordinary leave and the additional leave that is claimed. It is
not so much the duration of that leave that is of concern as
situations in which an employer is, or believes himself to be,
strung along by not knowing whether the employee will choose to
return to work. That can last for almost a year or, in the case
of consecutive pregnancies, almost indefinitely.
<P>
We must always remember the interests of small business. The
Minister and the Secretary of State now seek through the numerous
briefings that appear in the press, to make it clear that they
do. That is a separate issue and we shall come to it later.
However, in practical terms&#151;I re-examined the regulatory
impact assessment before our sitting this morning&#151;if a
company has 100 employees and there is an anticipated pregnancy
rate of 1.6 per cent., it would not be too difficult for a
properly organised human resources department to organise those
pregnancies.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</b> In the hon. Gentleman's example, are all the
employees female, and therefore biologically capable of
pregnancy? Is he referring to the employment relations
department's fixing the pregnancy in any sense other than dealing
with the arrangements for the time of leave?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is precisely right on both those
matters. Long may his interventions continue in that vein. If I
recall the regulatory impact assessment correctly, without
checking, it boils down to a net pregnancy rate, if I may use
that rather loose phrase, of 0.3 per cent. It is a very small
amount. In a company with 100 employees, it is spread over a
manageable number of employees. That is one reason why we are not
arguing the toss so much about what is intended. The changes have
the welcome effect of tidying up the matter, and the cost is
indeed small.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow (Buckingham):</B> I am pleased to support the
amendment. It is not incumbent on the Minister to ensure that the
conditions that may be prescribed for the purposes of the
schedule are reasonable, rather than incumbent on the employee
to ensure that her behaviour is reasonable?
<P>
<b>Mr. Boswell:</b> Both will have to apply. Legislation does not absolve an
employer, or an employee, from behaving sensibly. Behind some of
our doubts about the Bill is our worry that the matter will
inadvertently be encouraged into the hands of the barrack room
lawyer. We want such matters to be resolved readily.
<P>
A largish employer, with a sophisticated human resources
department and a good spread of employees, will probably emerge
without too much difficulty. However, for the employer of one or
two persons&#151;for the avoidance of doubt, for the first time
in Committee, I declare my interest, having one employee,
although not a female employee&#151;it is a much greater burden
if that person becomes pregnant. We need to ensure that the
arrangements are as practical for such a small business as for
a larger one. On a loose definition, small businesses may employ
half the employees in the country. They are the dynamic part of
the economy in terms of creating employment. We therefore do not
want inadvertently to damage what they do. We want reasonable
legal provision, and would in turn encourage both sides of
industry to act reasonably.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) reminds
me of one little bit of the triplet that, in my haste and
excitement at having passed three clauses so quickly, I almost
omitted. I remind the committee that we are going through a
three-stage process of legislating. Three clauses say nothing,
but pave the way for a schedule that says rather a lot in the
small print. Those are the first two stages. The third stage is
the regulations that arise from the Bill and apply in several
places, which we have not seen.
<P>
The purpose of exchanges in Committee is to try to inform the
Minister's thinking on what will be included in the regulations.
It is not easy to retrieve the situation once they appear in
draft form, when Ministers are committed to them and
consultations have taken place. Problems can still arise in
practice, especially for the smaller business. We must kick
around some of the issues sensibly to discover what the Minister
is thinking about and, perhaps, angles that neither he nor I have
anticipated, and whether we can improve the Bill.
<P>
One of the points that arises from the amendment is the duty
on employers and their employees to act reasonably, whatever the
Bill says. Exchanges may be necessary about provisions in the
draft legislation that might make it more difficult for them so
to act. However, we shall reach those in due course, after
consideration of the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): The hon. Member for
Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has doubtless moved the amendment in good
faith, but the insertion of the word ``reasonably'' would prove
redundant, dangerous or meaningless. All legislation should
prescribe for reasonable behaviour, and the word could be
scattered accordingly throughout various forms of legislation.
However, its use could undermine employees' rights to maternity
leave by enabling employers to put unreasonable pressure on them.
That would be dangerous.
<P>
The issue is one of rights versus practicality. We all want
the provision to benefit individuals and encourage business
success. However, who is to say what constitutes unreasonable
behaviour on the part of a pregnant woman? Such things are
difficult to define. The amendment would give leverage to
potentially bad employers who want to pressurise pregnant
employees.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned the danger of pregnant
employees stringing along employers with regard to their
intention to return to work. Many pregnant women intend to return
to work, but take the difficult decision after the child is born
to forgo temporarily the financial rewards of work by extending
the period of maternity leave in the interests of the child. Such
behaviour does not constitute stringing employers along.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, I should make it
clear that I agree with the hon. Gentleman that such behaviour
would be perfectly reasonable. Nevertheless, some employers will
not know where they stand and will be anxious about their
employee's decision. The balance is a delicate one for the
Committee to find.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We have in mind the interests of small businesses
and employers, as well as those of pregnant employees. However,
although the amendment is apparently simple and straightforward,
it would give leverage to the employer and put the onus on the
employee.
<P>
The Bill is not simply about employment rights: it will also
generate business success by providing flexibility and
partnership in the labour market. The amendment would not work
in the interests of those aims.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): Good morning, Mr. Atkinson.
I welcome you to the Committee and I look forward to your
guidance during the weeks&#151;hopefully, not too many
weeks&#151;ahead.
<P>
Although the word, ``unreasonably'' is, in this context,
perhaps less than precise, it is central to our forthcoming
debates. We are trying to ensure that the Bill will embody the
concept of reasonableness between all participating parties,
including the employee and the employer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry pointed out various
problematical aspects of the Bill, which ought to provide a
safety net for employees. The Bill tends to refer to the average
circumstance, but the task that we face is not dealing with the
average circumstance, but balancing the norm with the extreme.
<P>
The amendment deals with the issue of reasonableness, but it
is difficult to legislate against the extreme circumstances that
can prove so damaging to employee and employer. In terms of
family-friendly policies, we are trying to establish that the
onus of reasonableness rests with both the employer and the
employee.
<P>
As with maternity leave, the proposal will affect only a very
small percentage of the work force, if the average given in the
explanatory notes and the impact assessment is used. Although
that means that the proposal is not a problem for large firms,
it might be an immense problem for small firms. I certainly do
not suggest that women who decide to have a family would
automatically string their employer along, but, at the extremes,
such situations exist and can be traumatic not only for
employers, but for the other employees who carry the burden.
<P>
When we decide the second part of the tripartite
measures&#151;the triplets, as it was put so eloquently&#151;on
the definition of parental leave, we shall discuss parental
responsibility and how the provision should apply to cases
involving one child or several children, and ``reasonableness''
will be very important to our deliberations. We must put much
energy into ensuring clarity in the meaning and application of
the legislation and in the guidance to employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the conduct
of the people involved should be clearly flagged up for the
chairman of an employment tribunal to consider in any
proceedings? I think that that is provided for in statute, but
it is extremely important and should be taken as an essential
element in any decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention; he makes an important point about
``reasonableness''. What is reasonable in the mind of one person
is not reasonable in the mind of another. While maintaining the
flexibility to deal with all the extremes, we must ensure that
the meaning of the regulations is clear. The last thing that I
want is that this should be merely an enabling Bill, in which
definitions are left to the courts. That will do no good to
employment relations; it will provide an extensive source of
income for lawyers and will delay the achievement of the
Committee's objectives, which I am sure we all share.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. Given
the need to protect the interests of small firms, does he agree
that it would be helpful if the Minister for Small Firms, Trade
and Industry told us before the conclusion of the Committee's
proceedings how he envisages the consultation period, how long
it is expected to last and what sort of notice small firms will
be given of the need to implement the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point,
and I am sure that the Ministers will be happy to respond to it
in due course. However, we are straying from the reasonableness
of the amendment.
<P>
I am sure that we all agree that a safety net of employment
regulations is necessary. Most firms already work within such a
framework. We must not burden business in an attempt to be
reasonable. That will not help employees and it may put jobs at
risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Like the hon. Member for Daventry, I hope
that our debates on the Bill will be somewhat more sedate than
those on the National Minimum Wage Bill. Perhaps ``sedate'' is
the wrong word, especially as the hon. Member for Buckingham is
here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Timeous.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman suggests the word
``timeous''. I hope that I get home at a reasonable hour on
occasions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry moved the amendment in a
reasonable manner. I shall deal with two issues. The first issue
is ``reasonableness'' and how the Secretary of State's powers
will work. I want to give the Committee notice of an amendment,
which hon. Members will welcome. The House will have the capacity
to deal with proposals effectively as they come through from
consultation. My intention is that what is said in our debates
in Committee, whether on these clauses and schedules or others,
will be fed into the consultation process in the same way as hon.
Members' submissions. Secondly, all Committee members will
receive copies of the consultation document inviting their
further comments. As we cannot fill in the gaps in Committee as
the hon. Member for Daventry would wish, the deliberations of
hon. Members, along with those of interested parties, will be at
the core of the determination of draft regulations.
<P>
I understand and accept the concern that has been expressed
about regulatory regimes, and how they affect the balance between
primary and secondary legislation. It is necessary to ensure that
hon. Members and those who apply the regulations are consulted
in relation to the outcome of the secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister's comments are helpful. Further to
those comments, will he say whether he intends, after the
consultation hearing but before the regulations take effect, to
hold a debate on the regulations on the Floor of the House?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I intend to move an amendment that may address
the hon. Gentleman's concern, or at least 99.9 per cent. of it.
As to what happens on the Floor of the House, the hon. Gentleman
will know that that is not a matter for me but for those in more
elevated positions. I must say that because my hon. Friend the
Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) is present in the Committee&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Everyone is more elevated than the Minister and
me.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a sizeist remark,
which I shall ignore for the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am not so sure, but it is a fair enough
request.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister will be pleased to know that I was
working until midnight on an article on some of the Bill's
clauses. It is sometimes difficult to understand the draftsmen's
meaning.
<P>
The schedule refers to an employee satisfying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any conditions which may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister tell us who prescribes in that context? Is
the regulatory regime responsible or the employer? The schedule
also states that an employee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may . . . be absent from work at any time during an
ordinary maternity leave period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As one would expect an employee on an ordinary maternity
leave of 18 weeks' maternity pay to be absent, what is the
purpose of that provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> First, the word ``prescribed'' refers to the
regulations. The schedule replaces complex and cumbersome
arrangements with a scheme that is simpler for employers and
employees to understand and operate. It brings together current
legislation and a range of measures in directives and regulations
under other primary legislation. Our aim is to produce a single
piece of legislation that sets out rights of employment, the
responsibilities of the employer, the role of the employee, the
relationship between employer and employee, how to seek such
rights and how to be protected when seeking such rights. We want
to address the complexities that have developed in this area over
a number of years. That has been welcomed by 90 per cent. of
employers who responded to the proposals.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I see that a note has arrived, which may assist
the Minister. I am grateful for what he has said in clarifying
who will prescribe. The Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An employee . . . may be absent from work at any time
during an ordinary maternity leave period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Anybody who reads that will say, ``If an employee is on
maternity leave, surely she must be absent''. Is that not a
tautology? Does it not confuse the reader about what the clause
is trying to say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Women qualify for maternity pay only if
they are absent from the workplace. That is why, under the
current arrangements, the situation is somewhat complex: some
cannot currently claim 18 weeks' pay, because they have to return
to work after 14 weeks. That has arisen from the way in which the
previous Government interpreted legislation and from their
intention to implement the European directive. That is why we
currently have 18 weeks and 14 weeks, which, as a result of the
Bill, will become 18 weeks' pay with 18 weeks' leave. I think
that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Now I am even more confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I cannot help that. I have been in this place
with the hon. Gentleman for 12 years, and he is confused after
every answer that I have given him on any matter. It is something
that he and his constituents must bear.
<P>
All the details of the main statutory family-friendly rights
will be in a single document, a proposal that was welcomed on
Second Reading by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. Hon. Members
will have the usual opportunity to scrutinise the result. Despite
what they sometimes believe, it cannot be sneaked past them,
because we shall have an opportunity to discuss it when the
orders are laid before the House. I shall come to that in more
detail in a moment.
<P>
The provisions will be better than they would have been,
because we shall have the benefit of thorough consultation on the
details of how the provisions will work. That will not detract
from hon. Members' views on the principles and objectives of the
Bill, but it is important that, at a micro or macro level, in
discussions with social partners and employers' organisations,
they can consider in a practical way the effects of implementing
the proposals.
<P>
We aim to put the draft regulations out to public
consultation in the first half of this year. We have already had
extensive discussions with interested parties, which will
continue and will contribute to the draft regulations. We shall
allow two to three months for consultation. That will enable the
final regulations to be laid before Parliament in the autumn and
to come into force in December, as is required by the parental
leave directive.
<P>
We are well aware that employers are keen to know the details
in good time, so that they can make their own arrangements. We
shall make sure that that happens.
<P>
The Bill currently provides for the regulations to be made
under the negative resolution procedure. I have considered the
matter and believe it is right that hon. Members should debate
the regulations. I intend to table an amendment at a later stage
to ensure that the regulations are made under the affirmative
resolution procedure. I hope that that meets the concerns of all
members of the Committee. As I said when we discussed the
sittings motion, I shall be as helpful as possible to maximise
hon. Member's involvement in consideration of the regulatory
regime, given the relationship between that and the primary
legislation set out in clauses 8 to 10.
<P>
I applaud the hon. Member for Daventry for wishing to ensure
reasonable conditions for maternity leave, but the amendment is
unnecessary. Administrative law is clear that the Secretary of
State cannot in an unreasonable way use the powers that
Parliament has given. My right hon. Friend would not want to do
so, but the Bill is not just about the present; it is about the
future. Therefore, it is important that Secretaries of State do
not have powers that help them to act in an unreasonable way.
Irrespective of political differences, we accuse one another from
time to time of acting in an unreasonable way. Usually Government
Members are right about Opposition Members. There are occasions
when Opposition Members may feel that I have been unreasonable
with them.
<P>
The explanatory notes make it clear that all pregnant
employees are entitled to ordinary maternity leave. The
conditions that will apply for entitlement to ordinary maternity
leave are, first, the eminently reasonable requirement that the
employee be pregnant and, secondly, as now, that she provide her
employer with information in relation to, for example, the
expected date of birth and when she intends to begin her
maternity leave. The details will be set out in the regulations.
<P>
There are some cases where a woman chooses not to return to
work after having a baby, despite her job being held open. There
is usually a genuine reason and no malicious intent to mislead
the employer. Such occurrences are infrequent in terms of the
overall benefits of the proposals. I believe that, despite the
complexities, relationships are overwhelmingly reasonable and
people act reasonably towards each other. The proposals and the
way in which we handle them will assist in simplifying the
process for employers and employees. The regulations will specify
conditions such as required notifications, and will take account
of the needs of business in that respect.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts my explanation and
will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment concerns reasonableness and the
Minister is certainly in one of his more reasonable moods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Before my hon. Friend withdraws the amendment,
will the Minister, in a spirit of helpfulness, consider whether
the word ``during'' should be ``to take''. That would solve the
problem that I was trying to highlight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was about to
say that one feels rather like the army outside the walls of
Jericho. We hardly sounded the trumpets when, on this occasion,
the walls fell down flat. The Minister has granted a substantial
point in relation to the regulations, and it is better that they
should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I hope
that the Minister and the Whips' Office will take note of our
wish in advance to debate such matters in advance. It is
important for all of us to get them right. Having said that and
having started on a good note, I intend to withdraw the
amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Before my hon. Friend withdraws the amendment,
does he agree that following the Minister's constructive
response, we might usefully press him a shade further to give a
commitment that the consultation period might be three months
instead of two? We do not want to prey upon his generosity, but,
following the reasonableness of spirit that he has demonstrated
thus far, might that not be helpful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I notice the Minister wrinkling his nose, which
in my experience from fairly close quarters has always been a
hopeful sign. He has noted what my hon. Friend said. I think he
is beginning to get the point that not everything from the
Opposition Benches is an elaborate, political aunt Sally, that
we too want the Bill to work properly and that it is important
to consult for as long as possible. He has in effect joined us
in the consultation process and if that is operation Hoover, I
do not mind being joined in to that extent. However, that does
not mean that we shall not be uncritical of other matters later.
It is important that we proceed with reasonableness in all these
matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I tell the Committee, before we move on to
the next amendment, that I have been tolerant in allowing a very
wide-ranging debate on a narrow amendment. I thought that that
debate was helpful to the Committee, but I shall not be as
tolerant in future and I ask the Committee to keep to the narrow
point of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I wondered
whether an error had excluded amendment No. 31 from the amendment
paper. Am I to deduce that there is a foxy motive behind its
exclusion?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 31 was not selected and it is
normal practice not to give reasons for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 48, line
27, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or, if the terms and conditions of service of similar
employees have been altered during the period of her absence on
leave, on terms and conditions no less favourable than those
applicable to such similar employees.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the spirit of your entirely reasonable comment, Mr.
Atkinson, I shall move hastily to amendment No. 32, but perhaps
I could tell my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham that
although I was the author of amendment No. 31, which he signed,
and I was distressed that it was not selected for consideration,
I have the impression that the message has been received in other
quarters, so I shall lose no sleep about it.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 32 is to reflect an aspect of
industrial life that we cannot overlook, which is that industrial
circumstances may change during a period of maternal leave. One
has only to read the financial pages of the newspapers to see
that rapid changes are taking place&#151;companies taking one
another over or merging and having to produce a single system of
remuneration with one set of terms and conditions of employment.
That means a measure of rationalisation; it may be
rationalisation up or down, or it may simply reproduce the broad
intentions of one structure in another. It is not for us to
determine how companies should set about that. As the Minister
eloquently conceded, the most important thing about employment
rights is having a job to which such rights attach. Clearly, the
existence of employment rights should not become a
stumbling-block to continued employment.
<P>
On return from leave, we seek to make the point only that
things are not always exactly as they were. Although I understand
the intention to try to put an employee back into the same
position&#151;that is an important safeguard, and I understand
why it is there&#151;it may nevertheless not be practical or
possible. The amendment would add to the proposed new section
71(7), which states the clear intention to underwrite
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``seniority, pension rights and similar rights''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I am not sure how closely they can be defined. It
is rather like a pension being suspended for a time and
subsequently being reactivated.
<P>
There is another important consideration on current
employment rights and terms and conditions of employment. The
colleagues of someone on leave may have their terms and
conditions of employment changed, and it would be invidious if
the vested rights of the person on leave were simply reproduced
thereafter. It could be unfair to employees on leave because they
would merely be given the rights that they had when they left,
while the others got a better deal. Conversely, if, perhaps
because of a takeover or an industrial change. the other
employees in the department were made an offer that they thought
wise to accept as an alternative to redundancy, the person with
the vested rights could return with a higher rate of
remuneration.
<P>
There is a third question. I am not sure whether I can answer
it, because it is not always possible, once change has occurred,
to produce a clear, legally watertight definition. For employees
simply to say that they want the same may give rise to disputes
about what the same is if it no longer exists. There may be
futher disputes on the contract and terms thereafter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Does my hon.
Friend agree that provisions elsewhere in the Bill may give rise
to the sort of circumstances to which he refers? I have in mind
the possibility of a ballot on trade union recognition leading
to recognition, and the adoption of a collective agreement that
may in itself change the terms and conditions of all employees
during such a period of absence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is an interesting point, although it is
worth considering whether the suspended package of rights of an
employee on maternity leave would include the right to be
balloted on whether or not to accept union recognition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> A woman's job in a small company may be
uniquely defined. While that woman is on maternity leave, the
employer may choose to create another job on half the pay and
claim that it is a reconfiguration of her job, saying that she
could come back to it at half the pay, when it is in fact a
strategy for constructive dismissal because she had become
pregnant. Would the amendment not open the door to such abuse?
<P>
<b>Mr. Boswell:</b> That is exactly the kind of matter on which we
need the Minister to respond, with the advice of his officials.
We do not want that to happen, although I understand the danger
of it doing so. Perhaps we are feeling for a concept of
equivalence, rather than precise replacement or vesting of
rights.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman mean that if the
Minister believed that the amendment offered a window of
opportunity for bad practice, he would withdraw his amendment?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With respect to the hon. Lady, we need the
Minister's response. To use the classic term, the amendment is
a probing one. The Opposition seek to highlight the fact that an
employee returning to work after a period of leave, whether for
40 weeks or whatever period, may find that the job is not exactly
the same as the job that she left. The hon. Members for Croydon,
Central (Mr. Davies) and for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) rightly
expose the potential danger that an unscrupulous&#151;I use the
term deliberately&#151;employer may seek to redefine a job out
of existence or transform it into a mental or inadequate post.
Equivalence should be preserved.
<P>
We have no dispute with the Government over the principle of
people being put back into the post that they left, and the
amendment does not seek to disrupt that practice. However, if an
identical post&#151;in certain cases a post seems identical but
in fact is not&#151;cannot be maintained, we want to do all we
can to be fair to that employee and, in cases where more than one
employee is in a similar category, to others who have not taken
leave. I recognise that that is difficult to achieve, but it
should be thought about. I look forward to the Minister's
response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> My reading of proposed new paragraph (7) (b)
is that statutory holiday pay, to which employees are entitled,
and holiday pay that accrues under their contract would continue
to accrue while employees were absent on maternity pay. I am
sorry that the Minister is not listening as I would like him to
respond; I shall pause briefly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The point I have just made is an important one
because someone who is absent from work is effectively on
holiday. Does someone receiving maternity pay simultaneously earn
holiday pay? That becomes important if the period of maternity
leave is increased from 14 to 18 weeks, with another 13 weeks
added on, making a total of 31 weeks. Would such an individual,
even before coming back to work, be able to say to her employer,
``Well, I have just earned another 31 weeks of holiday pay, so
I'll take that'', before announcing whether she will come back
to work?
<P>
The Minister will be pleased to know that anyone running an
employment agency will be delighted with the maternity pay
provisions, because employers will have to keep open a job for
that 31 weeks and possibly, if the holiday pay entitlement had
racked up during that maternity leave period, also pay holiday
pay.
<P>
The Minister missed the point when he spoke about an employee
maliciously telling her employer that she would return after
maternity leave when she had no intention of doing so. A sensible
woman taking maternity leave has in mind the very remote
possibility that the child might be stillborn. Such a woman would
therefore say that she will return after maternity leave.
Moreover, a woman giving birth for the first time, when it is a
completely new experience, does not know how she will feel or
whether she will want to return to work after having experienced
being at home with the child. Anyone would sensibly advise such
a woman that the Government have given her the right to hold her
job open. A sensible woman, without being malicious, would,
therefore, exercise that right and tell her employer accordingly.
<P>
Employees have told me statutorily to keep their jobs open,
but tell me privately that it is unlikely that they will return.
That frequently happens. The employer must provide for that job
to be held open for 31 weeks. Someone will either be placed on
a temporary contract and employed directly by the employer, or,
if supplied by an employment agency, will be employed under a
contract for 31 weeks, rather than for 14, as now&#151;a bonanza
for an employment agency. The additional bonanza is that, after
31 weeks of someone working in a company, the employer will
almost certainly want to give that person a permanent job,
because he or she will have so much job knowledge.
<P>
I may have stretched the amendment moved by my hon. Friend
the Member for Daventry, but it is right, and the Minister should
respond to those important issues. The Minister might also help
young ladies outside who are currently pregnant, by telling us
when the regulations will be introduced, whether a woman who is
already on maternity leave for 14 weeks will have that leave
extended to 18 weeks, and whether the other rights will come into
effect even when such women are on maternity leave.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> In moving amendment No. 32, the hon. Member
for Daventry seemed to present a reasonable argument about
changing circumstances. However, my constituency case load leads
me to fear that the amendment could become a back-door charter
for bad practice. As a result of the inevitable pressures of
running a small business and of changes in a competitive market,
employers are sometimes under great pressure to do things
quickly.
<P>
When a woman is at her most vulnerable, having given birth,
perhaps for the first time, as the hon. Member for South Dorset
explained, she is not in the workplace politic to represent
herself, jockeying for position. She is under-represented and at
her most vulnerable, and it would be easy for an employer, if so
minded, not to represent, or to shuffle aside or out of
existence, the job of a woman on maternity leave.
<P>
I am sure that good business practice would not condone that,
but it happens. I am sure that we have all heard about such
cases, and that many hon. Members have similar case-loads to
mine. I realise that the majority of businesses are not like
that, but the schedule provides a back door to such bad practice,
and I am therefore worried.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> As I said at the outset, I cannot accept the
amendment. However, it was tabled to generate discussion, some
of which was rather wide-ranging and raised some issues that will
be covered in debates on other amendments. However, the hon.
Member for South Dorset made some points to which I shall return
in a moment.
<P>
The provisions as drafted ensure that the current provisions
can continue. Current law ensures that after ordinary maternity
leave women have the right to return to their old job on the same
terms and conditions as would have applied had they not been on
leave. That is in line with the requirements of the pregnant
workers directive, which was complied with under the previous
Administration. Employers have not complained that that is an
especially difficult requirement and, in the circumstances, it
is plainly right.
<P>
Opposition Members have argued that if employment terms in
a workplace have changed during a woman's absence on maternity
leave, she should be obliged to accept those changed conditions
on her return. Let us not beat about the bush. That would mean
that if employment conditions for others have been worsened, the
employer can unilaterally vary the woman's contract of employment
and give her worse conditions as well. That cannot be right. We
cannot condone such breaches of contract. If the employer is able
to negotiate new terms with her, that is fine; it is the proper
way to proceed. The employer should not impose a change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister of State for that
clarification. Will he please explain what will happen if a
member of staff who has been pregnant returns to work and her
employer has favourably changed her former colleagues' employment
conditions? Under the schedule, her rights must not be less
favourable than those which previously applied to her, but the
employer will be under no legal obligation to upgrade her to the
new terms and conditions of her colleagues.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall deal with that point in a moment,
because it relates to what the hon. Member for Altrincham and
Sale, West (Mr. Brady) said about collective agreements.
<P>
If the woman was in the workplace when changes were proposed
to individual contracts or to collective or workplace agreements,
she would have been consulted. If changes take place that relate
to her conditions on return, she should be consulted as if she
were in the workplace. It is crucial that if a
change&#151;favourable or otherwise&#151;to a woman's
conditions is proposed, the employer should be required, as a
matter of principle, to consult her about it.
<P>
If new terms are automatically incorporated into the woman's
contract of employment because&#151;I think that this is the
example used by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale,
West&#151;they were negotiated in a collective agreement which
provided for that, the Bill provides for those changed terms to
apply on her return. That relates to what I told the hon. Member
for Daventry a few moments ago about ensuring that the woman is
treated as if she were in work and consulted about the changes.
That clarification will assist employers and employees about
potential changes to contracts during a period of absence.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister of State&#151;the
clarification he has provided is helpful. However, I ask him to
ponder another relatively rare, but by no means impossible,
scenario. If a pregnant woman chooses to leave a company or other
establishment, subsequently decides that she would like to return
to it and the company takes her on for a second time, would she
be automatically entitled under the Bill to the enhanced terms
and conditions applicable to other members of staff?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is not continuity of employment. That
person has, of their own volition and by agreement, left
employment and returned thereafter. If the employment had been
continuous and the arrangements had been agreed, it would be a
different matter. However, the hon. Gentleman uses an example in
which, for whatever reason, there is no continuity of employment,
so that individual will return, after whatever period, to the
workplace on the basis of an agreed contract that might or might
not be different to the previous one.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West made the
important point that there should be an opportunity for the
employee to object, or otherwise, to any change that is being
made. I give an assurance that that is precisely what we intend
to happen. That will give clarification to individuals and
employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): In the circumstances that my hon.
Friend describes of someone being re-engaged and offered a new
contract, does he accept that it is quite legitimate for the
employer and the employee to write into the contract continuity
from the previous employment, including for the purposes of
maternity leave?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The employer and employee can agree whatever
they like in a contract; it is not a matter for the state, except
that employers cannot remove people's primary rights, on the
return of the employee, the employer and employee can write
whatever they like into the contract.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving
way. I am actually being helpful. Does he not accept that
paragraph 140 on page 35 of the explanatory notes on new section
81 reinforces what he is saying?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Member for Buckingham is trying to
engage us on a subject that needs no debate. I made it clear
that, on the employee's return to work, an employer and an
employee can agree any conditions that they wish. Continuity of
employment is one thing; but if there is no continuity of
employment, the basis of the contract of employment is between
the individuals concerned.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset raised a number of
questions. I shall try to answer them. During ordinary maternity
leave, contractual holiday arrangements accrue. A period of
ordinary maternity leave counts towards the qualifying period for
statutory holidays under the working time regulations; but that
is only part of the story. Statutory minimum holiday time accrues
during leave, but the working time regulations do not provide for
holidays that cannot be taken during the relevant period. The
scenario painted by the hon. Gentleman cannot happen; he is
saying that once holiday is accrued, employees can add further
leave for payment. That is not the case, and it is not allowed
under the working time regulations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about the wording of the
regulations dealing with absence from work during ordinary
maternity leave. I am not sure, Mr. Atkinson, whether the hon.
Gentleman made that comment during his speech on this or a
previous amendment; I apologise if it was the latter. He
complained of obscure drafting, but that drafting was introduced
by the previous Government in the Trade Union Reform and
Employment Rights Act 1993, and, according to our officials, it
seems to have caused no practical difficulties. We are simply
re-enacting a provision first used by the previous
Administration.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset raised the question of a
child being stillborn. Women are entitled to maternity benefit
in respect of the birth of a child. The Employment Rights Act
1996 provides that the live birth of a child, or a still birth
after a pregnancy of at least 24 weeks, counts for the purposes
of leave.
<P>
A number of questions were asked of a more general nature.
It all comes down to a simple factor&#151;the absolute
requirement and necessity that if a change is made, or
potentially made, to a contract of employment, the woman
concerned should be treated as if she had been at work. She
should be consulted about such changes, have the opportunity to
comment on them and be able to object if necessary. I hope that
my clarification will result in the amendment being withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has carried on in a helpful vein.
I wish to raise only two points before I seek to withdraw the
amendment.
<P>
First, I emphasise the importance of an information package
for employers and employees, not only on maternity leave but on
parental leave, that will read across into continuing
consultation between them. It needs to be clearly understood
that, whatever the legal status of the continuing contract, which
we shall debate later, employees on leave are to be treated as
if they were employees in relation to any discussions on possible
changes to their conditions of employment. It may be necessary,
in due course, to flag up that point for the consideration of the
chairperson of the employment tribunal in due course.
<P>
My second point, which the Minister did not deal with in
detail&#151;I wanted him only to reflect on the
matter&#151;arose directly from my first point and concerned
ballots under part 1, to which we shall come later. The logic of
the Minister's argument seems to be that if an employee is to be
treated as an employee for the purpose of consultation, albeit
an employee who is off the premises because he or she has taken
leave, he or she should also be included in the category of
people considered eligible to vote in a ballot.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman; if
I am wrong, someone outside the Committee might hit me over the
head with a brick. The issues are contained in the guidance for
industrial action ballots, which includes the right of pregnant
women to participate in a ballot; the union concerned has to take
steps to ensure that that occurs. We shall deal with industrial
action ballots and consequential matters when we get to the
relevant clause, but for the moment I can say that pregnant women
are not excluded from exercising their democratic right in a
ballot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am reassured by that and I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 48,
leave out lines 28 to 43.
<P>
The amendment would omit some requirements in regard to the
period of compulsory maternity leave. I think that all members
of the Committee have accepted our good faith on the issue and
I say at the outset that we do not want to create conditions in
which women at or immediately after confinement are dragooned
into working in possibly manual occupations, irrespective of
their condition or inclinations. However, I have two concerns.
First, will the Minister clarify whether it is strictly
necessary, under the terms of the pregnant workers directive, to
introduce the provision that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An employer shall not permit an employee who satisfies
prescribed conditions to work''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and to prescribe a series of penalties up to &#163;500 for
any contravention of that? That creates an obligation for the
employer, almost irrespective of the wishes of the employee or
the employer and in conditions where the employer may not be in
a position to fulfil it, almost to issue a formal notice to the
employee saying, ``I forbid you to do any work for me during this
period of compulsory maternity leave.''
<P>
My second point, which is the substance of my concern, is on
the wider issue, which surfaced in regard to the working time
directive, of the definition of work. I said earlier that we were
not in the business of trying to force people to go back to work,
as sweated labour, immediately after having a baby. However, work
can mean many things: it can be work at home, telework, answering
the phone or doing a basic task. It is not so easy to define work
and therefore not so easy to decide when an employer has allowed
work and thereby committed an offence.
<P>
To take Nicola Horlick as an example, someone who is
occasionally in the news because she has successfuly combined a
vigorous career as a gee-whizz investment manager with a large
family&#151;I have no interest in her company or, as far as I
know, her investments, but she is a lively person and a big
figure on the investment scene&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> And at home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> And at home. She has also had terrific family
problems and one should pay credit to the way in which she has
handled them.
<P>
If, in my hypothesis, Nicola Horlick were employed somewhere
and her employer rang up to ask, ``Shall we sell Chilean
gold-field shares or shall we go big in Russian oil shares?'' and
she answers the phone, that would be work. It would certainly be
a remunerative activity within her contract of employment, if she
were actually working. The Minister is seeking to suspend those
contracts of employment. If she does anything about it, she has
involved her employer in an offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Before my hon. Friend departs from his interesting
example, I should tell him that my reading of the Bill would take
it a stage further. If such a person, lying in bed immediately
after her confinement, thought, ``The thing that has been on my
mind over the past week, apart from the baby, is the fact that
Chilean oil shares will bomb'', and she picked up the telephone
to talk to her employer, it would be an offence for the employer
to accept her call, because, by doing so, he would be permitting
her to work. Therefore, even if she initiated a certain activity,
the Bill would forbid it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is probably right. I defer to the expertise
available to the Minister as to exactly what would happen,
because I am not a lawyer. However, it does not seem a
constructive way of conducting employment relations if the
employer had to take precautions by issuing a formal notice in
advance precluding the employee from ringing up on any matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I want to bring the point home, because we
have a the good fortune to have a number of lady Members of
Parliament. Is there not a danger, with this regulation, that if
the Whips called in a Member of Parliament for a crucial
vote&#151;we know that in the last Parliament people were
brought in who were virtually on their death beds&#151;they
would be breaking the law. The Government Whip, the hon. Member
for Hyndburn, is not in the Room at the moment, but I care about
him deeply, I know that the Conservative Whip would be much too
kind to do such a thing, but Government Whips are different.
Dragging somebody in could cause the same problem, but my hon.
Friend is making a good point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I hesitate again to give a definitive ruling on
the matter, but, although it may not always seem to be the case,
Members of Parliament are self-employed and not in an employment
relationship with their Whip. I would not advise Government Back
Benchers to take that too far, but I set out a formal
understanding of the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps I may develop a few points first, and
other hon. Members may wish to contribute. I do not think that
any of the Back Benchers on the Committee have had a baby during
their time in Parliament&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's correction. I
meant female members of the Committee. Nevertheless, it would be
worth him asking his female colleagues whether any of them did
anything for their constituents during the period immediately
around their confinement, because I think that any hon.
Member&#151;I was about to say ``any hon. Member worth his
salt''&#151;would try to be helpful, even at that time.
<P>
I have used a high-profile example, but that leads me to some
more mundane examples. A company could have a couple of
signatories on the cheque book, one of whom might be pregnant and
away. That would not be a problem during the lead-up to the
confinement, or even if maternal leave was taken thereafter: it
would be managed. However, to say that, for two weeks, no cheque
should be signed, or that an alternative signatory should be
found, might be difficult in a small business.
<P>
To get down to the most basic level, what about a phone call
to the employee at home who has just had a baby saying, ``We've
lost the key to the store cupboard. Would you tell us where it
is?'' The problem could arise at the simplest clerical level, as
well as at the exalted level of giving investment advice.
<P>
We are worried that we are rather fiercely creating a
criminal offence that the employer may or may not be able to take
precautions to avoid that deals not with women who are told to
be in from 9 to 5 three days after having a baby, but with women
who may need to consult and do a bit of work from home or even
write something that they had thought about beforehand.
<P>
I suspect that the underlying problem is one that we often
encounter in European legislation. That is not a loaded remark.
The European mind thinks intentionally and decides that people
should not be allowed to work round their confinement. We can all
agree with that principle. The British way is to enact such
measures precisely with regard to legal obligations, regulations
and penalties. As it happens, those obligations will fall on the
employer, but it would be interesting to discover cases where
employees had condoned or been party to such illegal situations.
By way of contrast, the continental mind tends to think, ``This
is the objective, forget the small print. If it is a small
matter, we will absolve you. However, broadly speaking, we expect
you not to force in your employees''.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As far as the British law is concerned, it would surely be
better to say that an employer shall not ``require'' an employee
to work. With regard to the continental approach, we need to find
a term of art that will exempt the consultation role that I have
adumbrated, which is fairly casual, not physical and undemanding
in terms of time.
<P>
I do not have the answer to the problem, but I worry that the
Bill will turn something that is perfectly reasonable into an
offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving
way&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not intervening,
he is making a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
I should like briefly to reinforce my hon. Friend's argument.
He is right to draw attention to the differing mind sets of
British and European Union legislators, but the argument can be
taken a stage further. In the context of the Bill, the
distinction is not simply between British and European approaches
but between a permissive approach, which the Conservative and
Unionist party favours, and the prescriptive approach of the
Labour party.
<P>
In the ideology-free days of late twentieth-century politics,
this is a rare case where a clear choice can be made between
libertarian and authoritarian approaches. We do not want people
in such circumstances to be obliged to work, but they should be
able to choose freely to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman complaining about
the fact that the previous Government signed up to the pregnant
workers directive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman ought to know me better than
to suppose that I show fealty to every single dot and comma of
the performance of the previous Government, even though they were
an outstanding Administration in many respects. I do not hesitate
to respond candidly. It would take more time than our sittings
would allow for me to identify all the directives and regulations
to which previous Governments, whether Labour or Conservative,
were foolish enough to sign up. The directive that he identified
is a case in point.
<P>
We have a choice. Do we want a libertarian, facilitating
approach, or a prescriptive, nannying one? I am not accusing the
Government of dishonour; in terms of the Bill, their approach is
perfectly honourable. However, it is philosophically undesirable
and hazardous at a practical level. With great skill, but in his
characteristically emollient fashion, my hon. Friend the Member
for Daventry drew attention to the practical hazards that the
Bill may present to businesses. I agree with his remarks, but I
wanted to highlight the fundamental philosophical difference
between the Government and the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am filled with admiration for the facility with
which my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham managed to turn
an intervention into such splendid eloquence. I wish to make a
short speech, which I shall try to ensure resembles an
intervention in its brevity.
<P>
Important issues have been touched on by my hon. Friend the
Member for Daventry concerning employees who may be covered by
the legislation in circumstances in which neither the directive
nor the Government intended anyone to be in breach of the
provisions. I do not intend to go through yet more possible
circumstances in which that could happen, but I hope that the
Minister took on board the fact that there are many
circumstances, particularly in professional occupations, in which
people may be engaged in work without necessarily endangering
their health or spending long periods away from their new
children.
<P>
I have a specific point, which I make with some hesitation.
My wife, like the wife of the hon. Member for Croydon, Central,
had a baby during the past year while I was a Member of
Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Congratulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the Minister for his congratulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Do you change nappies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I do indeed change nappies. It is important that
hon. Members on both sides of the House do so, regardless of
their sex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am happy to contemplate undertaking the
activity to which my hon. Friend referred, but I hope that he is
not, in the collegiate spirit of the Committee, suggesting that
I should undertake such duties in relation to his child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman ought
not to reply to that intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr Brady:</B> Thank you for your wise guidance, Mr. Atkinson. A
more serious issue&#151;I am profoundly happy that it did not
happen in my case&#151;is stillbirth or loss of a baby shortly
after birth. My baby was very ill early in life, but is now very
well. I am acutely aware of the circumstances of parents who lose
a child very early in its life and I have friends who have had
to face such circumstances. People respond in different ways:
some may want to take a long holiday and get away from
everything; others may want to immerse themselves in their work
to try to take their minds off their problems and circumstances.
If a new mother loses a baby or gives birth to a stillborn child
and wishes to return to work and to cope in her own way with the
circumstances facing her, she may be prohibited by the Bill from
so doing. It is an important issue, which may not have occcurred
to Ministers when the Bill was drafted. I shall be interested to
hear the Minister's comments and any assurances that he may be
able to give that someone in such circumstances will not be
covered by the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I rise to speak briefly on the point on which
my hon. Friends have spoken. I hope that all Members of
Parliament believe that when correspondence in our postbags does
not demand action on an issue, it is a good idea not to take
action. So much correspondence in our postbags asks for action,
that it seems extraordinary that the Bill is making it a criminal
offence to allow a woman to do any work during her maternity
leave. The provision is absolute; it does not allow a reasonable
amount of work or the answering of a telephone call. The schedule
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An employer shall not permit an employee who satisfies
prescribed conditions to work during a compulsory maternity leave
period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That takes away a right from a pregnant woman or nursing
mother. Surely it is her human right to decide what she wants to
do. She has the right not to work, to absent herself and be paid
during maternity leave&#151;

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the implications,
under the European convention on human rights, of depriving
people of the right to work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point&#151;an
absolute right to work exists under the convention. The Bill
states that it does not create any compatibility problems with
the convention, but in this respect it is wholly incompatible.
The Opposition are suggesting not that a woman should be forced
to work during those two weeks&#151;or whatever period is
decided&#151;but that women are losing a right. The Bill would
create a criminal offence, even though no problem exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> In that case, why does the amendment not
simply delete the word ``permit'' and insert the word
``require''? Instead, the amendment deletes lines 28 to 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. The
Minister may wish to propose a different form of words to avoid
a woman being required to work the full two weeks or her normal
40 hours. The schedule, however, would create a criminal offence
of an employer answering the phone to a female employee who has
recently given birth and has realised that some work-related
matter needs urgent attention. Such an occurrence must be
extremely common; I would be pleased to hear from any woman who
has had a child who has not been in such a position.
<P>
<B>Ms Sandra Osborne </B>(Ayr): The hon. Gentleman's point is
trivial and undermines the principle that is at issue. Does he
agree that many women may feel that they are under moral pressure
to return to work within two weeks of giving birth?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Lady does not understand
the nature of employment or employer-employee relationships. I
cannot imagine an employer who has given 18 weeks of maternity
leave exerting moral pressure on the woman to return to work for
two weeks. We cannot allow picking up a phone to be turned into
a crime. It is not a trivial matter. The easiest option is to
abolish the whole of the schedule. If the hon. Lady has a better
amendment, however, we would be pleased to hear it. I am sure
that the Minister would be happy to take her advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I think that this is the point at which
our discussion of the Bill heats up. I am astonished at the way
in which hon. Members are attempting to turn the clock back to
1899 rather than bringing it forward to 1999. They are
repudiating the steps taken by&#151;to be fair&#151;the
previous Government in 1994 to regulate the relationship between
a woman and her employer in the most vulnerable period after the
birth, and to give the woman and the employer certainty about
what can and cannot happen in respect of her health and safety
following the birth. This amendment, does not deal with a
difficulty in principle, but probes a well trodden, agreed
position between employers in Britain, the European Community and
the previous Government, who had all-party support in the House
for health and safety provisions for women immediately after
birth. What we have heard does not merit even the term
smokescreen but merely constitutes excuses for wanting an
employer to be able to bring a woman back to work immediately
after birth. The hon. Member for South Dorset, to whom I always
listen carefully, gave the impression that a woman has the right
immediately following birth, whether after a home confinement or
a hospital confinement, to send a taxi round so that she can do
the night shift. That shows how absolutely ludicrous that
position is. He knows that we are dealing with a health and
safety issue.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall give way in a moment, do not worry.
I am not in the business of having a contretemps with the hon.
Gentleman and not giving him the opportunity to explain himself
further. Opposition Members made it absolutely clear that they
were opposed to the concept of a health and safety provision,
which is what the schedule is. Without a shadow of doubt, he said
that it was a human right to be forced to go to work immediately
after the birth of a child. I believe that the human right is to
be protected in law from potential exploitation of health and
safety.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am most grateful, because we are having a good
debate. However, the Minister misunderstands and misinterprets
all Opposition speeches. A woman who has just given birth often
telephones her employer and workmates to tell them that she has
just had a baby, and such things as the weight. The circumstances
of such a telephone call are fine&#151;until the woman says that
she is worried about a work matter, about which she and the
employer have a discussion. They will then have committed the
crime of talking about, and doing, work, which the schedule will
ban.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman digs himself into a deeper
hole. I do not know whether he has ever been present at the birth
of a child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Four times.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I realise that the hon. Gentleman's wife must
be extraordinary to live with him, but I am nevertheless quite
sure that her first act was not to dive for the telephone to call
her employer. He is being absolutely ludicrous. I shall say no
more, and save him from embarrassment.
<P>
The hon. Members for Buckingham and for Altrincham and Sale,
West, raised several issues, including whether the hon. Member
for Altrincham and Sale, West, should encourage, or, rather, take
the chance of, the hon. Member Buckingham acting as a babysitter
for him. I make no comment about his qualities as a babysitter.
He has attempted on occasion to babysit me, but I have resisted
the temptation.
<P>
In the psychologically traumatic circumstances of stillbirth
or early loss of life, when a child is lost to a woman who has
carried a pregnancy to full term&#151;for all practical purposes
a pregnancy is carried to full term once the baby is born,
irrespective of whether it was in fact carried to full
term&#151;I do not believe that as a consequence of the death
that woman would give up the grieving process to return to work.
Even if the birth takes place but, whether through illness, birth
defects, disability or other, unrelated circumstances, the child
subsequently dies and is therefore lost to the family, I do not
believe for a moment that the woman's reaction would be to
abandon the grieving process and all that it entails to telephone
the employer and insist that he or she commit a criminal act and
allow the women to return to work.
<P>
I do not mind hon. Members tabling probing amendments, but
to take matters to such ludicrous ends and propose the removal
of an essential health and safety requirement does the hon.
Member for Altrincham and Sale, West and the Conservative party
no credit. Despite having moved to the right, the Conservatives
want to move even further in that direction by repudiating the
previous Government's policy&#151;indeed, it was an all-party
position&#151;that the period must be sacrosanct because it
provides certainty for employers and employees alike.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I strongly resent the Minister's suggestion that
I was making a ludicrous or vexatious point, or making a point
for sake of it. I have raised an important issue that the
Minister should take into account, and I hope that I have done
so seriously. I have certainly been brief and to the point. I had
hoped that he would give what I said serious consideration and
at least offer to think about it and possibly bring forward some
thoughts of his own.
<P>
It does him no credit that he chooses to treat a serious
issue as a matter for party political banter. There can be few
more serious issues to the family involved. Neither the Minister
nor I is necessarily in a position to judge the psychology of a
woman in those unfortunate circumstances. She is better suited
to make that judgment than he or the law is.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> With all due respect, it is I who protect
those women's rights. Opposition Members have gone to ludicrous
lengths to make an unfortunate point. Until now, I had believed
that the principle of protecting women during that vulnerable
period had all-party support. There is now doubt, and I will
strongly resist any attempt to undermine the position. I am sure
that that was not the hon. Gentleman's intention in putting his
case, but he must think before he speaks in Committee.
<P>
Given that the hon. Gentleman spoke without thinking, it is
reasonable for me to point out the reality of what he says.
Without going into detail, some hon. Members know what it is like
to lose a child in such circumstances. Believe me, the instant
reaction of the woman, the partner or the family involved is not
to reach for the phone and try to return to work.
<P>
In his usual way, the hon. Member for Daventry raised what
he thought were practical issues. The offence is not one of
strict liability. The words, ``not permit'' are used in the
schedule. Again, I am not a lawyer, but I understand that there
must be an intent to break the law. The provision will assist the
employer; it could not be made more clear. There can be no doubt
that no work&#151;either induced or otherwise&#151;can be done
during that period.
<P>
The provision is best left unchanged. On the whole, employers
support it. There is no evidence that they have had difficulties
with it since 1994, or that they want to change it. I have no
evidence that there is any pressure, either from employers or
from women in such circumstances, to change the law. Therefore,
the amendment should be withdrawn. If it is not, we shall resist
it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It has taken nearly five hours for it to happen,
but the Minister's mask has cracked at last. He started by being
reasonable; he has now launched an unmerited attack on my hon.
Friends who have quite properly fulfilled their function of
probing the Government's intentions. I say firmly to all members
of the Committee that it is important to do that, especially
where criminal offences are involved. The case is not a normal
one concerning people's intentions, but an abnormal one in which
disaffection has crept in and an employer who acted
reasonably&#151;to use a word that we have all bandied about
this morning&#151;may find himself in court on a charge.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> One reads such schedules in a particular way
but the entire schedule is badly drafted. For example, paragraph
72(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An employer shall not permit an employee who satisfies
prescribed conditions to work during a compulsory maternity leave
period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean that an employer must prevent a mother from
changing her baby's nappies or from doing the dishes? That is
what the paragraph states. It does not state that the employee
shall not be permitted to ``return to work'' or to ``go back to
the workplace'', which are phrases that might be used instead.
As it stands, paragraph 72(1) cannot be complied with by those
to whom it is directed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend may be onto a false point with
regard to the examples he has given, because the context is
clearly the employee's working relationship with the employer.
However, he makes a reasonable additional point. If, for whatever
reason, an employee were to decide to work for a second employer
during the period of compulsory maternity leave, the Bill will
place the onus on the first employer to prevent the employee from
doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend will know that the correct use of
language is not the Government's strong point. Does he agree that
my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset has made a significant
point? A more appropriate wording of paragraph 72(1) would be:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An employer shall not permit to work an employee who
satisfies prescribed conditions during a compulsory maternity
leave period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a better formulation than the current one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is certainly an interesting suggestion,
which I hope the Minister of State will consider. However, the
substance of our points is not health and safety. We are not
arguing for employees to be required to return to work; nor are
we making excuses for bad employers who want to require employees
to return to work. Instead, we are dealing with the practical
implications of the terms.
<P>
The Minister said that he had heard of no adverse experience
since the 1994 legislation. I am pleased about that. However,
given that we are in the process of legislating and then, in
effect, handing the matter over to lawyers, I am less certain
whether any such experience will arise in the future. With
respect, the Minister has not dealt with what I shall call the
Nicola Horlick case, nor with the more practical case of the lost
storeroom key that an employee may have taken home with her. If
that storeroom, which no one would be able to enter, contained
potentially toxic materials, there could be a countervailing
health and safety requirement. [Laughter.] Reasonably enough,
Labour Members giggle at the scenario, but that is a prescription
that we are putting into legislation.
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett:</B> The employer could call a locksmith.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If that were the only solution, the employer
could indeed call a locksmith. Clearly, that is the hon. Lady's
prescription for such a circumstance.
<P>
We are not saying that employers should normally require an
employee to work; nor should they, according to paragraph 72(1),
normally allow an employee to work. However, cases may arise
where it is perfectly reasonable to continue some form of working
realtionship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I put it to the hon. Gentleman that his
two examples are unsustainable. First, it is patently ridiculous
to define asking where to find a key as work, and it would not
be sustainable as a legal position in the context of the
legislation. Secondly, a person who is buying and selling shares
from her home and not acting on behalf of a major employer is
essentially self-employed. His examples do not carry his
argument.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> First, an employed person could be in such a
position&#151;it need not be a self-employed person or one
employed by an agency. Secondly, in relation to this being too
trivial to contemplate, I shall suggest a scenario to illustrate
why that is not so. If an employer were to ring up an employee
because none of his other staff could find the store room key,
that employee might offer to look for it and in doing so bend
over in a cupboard and have a haemorrhage. That is an extreme
health and safety case, which might happen but is unlikely. It
is difficult to imagine a situation in which that would not
result in litigation, even if the employer were innocent and the
employee had no reason to think that the situation would have
arisen.
<P>
Hard cases lead to prescription in law and prescription of
criminal offences. Why cannot the intention of the clause be
served by the words ``shall not require an employee''? We could
return with a differently drafted amendment later. The creation
of such a criminal offence will invite, in unusual and
unpredictable circumstances, a series of consequences that will
be damaging to business and to the employees involved. Perhaps
the Minister's bland view will stand the test of
time&#151;perhaps there will be no further hard cases. That
would be good thing, but I am not as confident of such an outcome
as he is. I shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.

<P>

minimum qualifying period of two years.'.<P>

amendment No. 35, in page 48, line 49, after `restrictions',

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and after consultation with her employer.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After that excitement, Mr. Atkinson, it is time
to probe other areas of the Bill. The amendments concern the
relationship between the employee on maternity leave and the
employer. Amendment No. 34 requires the employee to have
completed a minimum period of employment with her employer before
she has rights to additional maternity leave. Amendment No. 35
requires the employee to consult her employer about the timing
of her leave.
<P>
I have no definite view about the precise date or period. We
can discuss that. I have a feeling that we shall discuss it in
a number of contexts during our consideration of the Bill. There
is an argument for a period of two years by analogy with some
other periods for employment rights. Government Members will be
aware that a lively debate is taking place, which we shall no
doubt have again, about reducing the qualifying period for
employment rights to one year. Some of them say that the matter
centres on the issue of alleged discrimination between the sexes,
because female employees are employed for shorter periods and do
not build up such long employment records as male employees.
Those are matters that we may rightly wish to discuss.
<P>
However, we believe that people should not have automatic and
unbridled rights to additional maternity leave and should be
under an obligation to consult their employers as to how that
leave should be taken. That reflects the concern expressed by
some of my hon. Friends from their practical experience that the
additional part of maternity leave&#151;not pre-confinement or
immediately post-confinement, but thereafter&#151;can cause
destabilisation and disruption, particularly for the smaller
business. Such a business does not know where it is, it may have
to employ expensive cover from an agency or elsewhere and it will
not be able to plan effectively.
<P>
Therefore, the amendments confine the right to additional
leave, which will not be paid but must still be discharged before
the employer knows the position, to those who already have a
settled employment relationship. Secondly they require adequate
consultation with the employer about the timing and impact of the
decision to take the leave. We are not saying that leave should
never be available or that we want to wreck the concept of
maternity leave or additional maternity leave. We are simply
saying that we must be conscious of the impact on business and
try to concentrate leave in areas where there is a settled
employment relationship and proper consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): If this is an
appropriate time, may I take this opportunity, Mr. Atkinson, to
declare an interest in the Bill. I am managing director of a
small manufacturing company. Currently, we have 22 employees. We
could end up with 20 employees, for whatever reason. Therefore,
I find myself in an interesting situation on the Committee.
Having declared my interest, I shall address the Bill in general
terms, as any other member of the Committee would.
<P>
I do not wish to speak to amendment No. 34, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Eastleigh and I accept the time in the Bill of one
year. However, amendment No. 35 raises a difficult issue for a
small company when a key employee goes on maternity leave. The
length of time that she will be away and the uncertainty about
whether she will return to the job can be difficult for a small
company. In my office there are three members of staff, so it is
clearly difficult when one goes on maternity leave. I simply want
to highlight to the Minister of State the problems that can
occur, so that he can bear them in mind when it comes to future
regulations.
<P>
Recently a member of staff became pregnant after she had
started on a marketing project for me and had acquired a certain
amount of expertise. We are trying to do something that is
difficult for a small company. We are trying to persuade a whole
industry&#151;indeed, a whole country&#151;to change its
approach on a product and to adopt a product to do with safety,
which is quite difficult for a small company to do if there are
no regulations to enable the producers of the product say, ``You
have to use this safe product.''
<P>
I simply want to highlight for the Minister the difficulty
that arises if an employer is not sure when the employee will
return and does not know whether to find a permanent or temporary
replacement. It may be difficult with a temporary person to get
the right consistency and push that is needed for the job. I
thought that that example might be helpful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The approach of the hon. Member for
Daventry is different from ours. I think that our approach is
better, although amendment No. 35 at least shows an understanding
of what we need to do in terms of best practice.
<P>
I take amendment No. 34 as a probing amendment. The drafting
might not meet the practical aspects, if it were accepted, so I
shall resist both it and amendment No. 35. I shall explain why.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 shows that the hon. Member for Daventry and
his hon. Friends are not pressing for simplicity in the Bill.
They do not want to see the qualifying period for additional
maternity leave aligned with that for parental leave. However,
such alignment is necessary for simplicity. Conservative Members
are alone in their view. When consultation took place on the
White Paper leading to the Bill, 86 per cent. of those consulted
were in favour of the proposals, including the CBI and 40 other
employers or employers' organisations. There were only 18
submissions against the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Simply for the record, the Minister of State is
suggesting that we are not harmonising our proposals with those
in the parental leave requirement, but the latter have yet to be
considered by the Committee, let alone enacted. In a sense he is
inviting us to harmonise on a higher standard, which he will
propose at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It shows a nice side to the hon. Gentleman
that he suggests that the Opposition will table amendments as a
consequence of amendments to an earlier part of the Bill. If the
hon. Gentleman were concerned about the principle of
harmonisation, he would not have tabled the amendment.
<P>
There are 1.4 million working women who have between one and
two years' service with their employer. About 50,000 of them
might have a baby in any one year. We estimate that about 23,000
women stand to benefit directly each year from this provision.
In addition, employers who welcome the alignment of qualifying
periods will benefit, as will advisers, who will no longer have
to keep differing and confusing requirements in mind. There is
general support for this harmonisation of the requirements. Given
the support expressed in the consultation, it would be wrong to
deny employers the benefit of the proposals.
<P>
As regards amendment No. 35, I commend the hon. Member for
Daventry for wishing to encourage partnership at the workplace
and for his enthusiasm in ensuring that our discussions are
effective. None the less, we cannot accept the amendment, because
it would entrench in primary legislation a statutory consultation
requirement on the worker. I understood that Opposition Members
were opposed to statutory consultation provisions, but apparently
not in this case. The amendment would place an obligation on a
woman to consult her employer before notifying her intention to
return to work following additional maternity leave. That
reflects good practice, which we want to encourage, but the
amendment would have other practical effects that I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman does not intend and that the Government do not
intend. There are instances in which the discussion would not
happen. The employer could be unco-operative, or even openly
hostile, about the employee taking leave. He may refuse to
discuss the matter with her, perhaps to thwart her efforts to
comply with the requirements. He may simply be unavailable, or
forgetful, or may not mind when she returns to work.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to reflect good practice,
which we all want to encourage, but it could have the unintended
consequence of a woman unfairly losing the opportunity to return
to work. That would be too harsh if circumstances arose in which
practice failed to reach appropriate standards.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Department was not made aware of any practical problems
relating to the provision during consultation. We have found
nothing to suggest a problem and the response from employers and
the level of their support suggests acceptance of the way in
which we are proceeding. I hope, therefore, that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments. I
agree that whatever period is selected may not be perfect and I
understand his wish for harmonisation. Had we had a clause stand
part debate, I might have said that I am conscious of the fact,
as are some employers and their organisations, that employees may
sometimes lose their rights because of complexity. Anything that
can be done to avoid that is a furtherance.
<P>
The Minister also referred to not underwriting consultation
by statute, which is a seductive point for me. I am inclined to
advise my hon. Friends not to divide the Committee, on the clear
understanding that there is good practice, that the provision
should operate on a consultative basis and that that should be
made a clear moral obligation on both parties. We shall see how
the matter progresses and we shall debate at a later stage the
impact on business. We may then wish to press the Minister
further.
<P>
The debate has been a useful first exchange on the way in
which employers and employees should approach such matters on a
personal and individual basis. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 48, line
47, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) The Secretary of State may make regulations concerning
rights to additional maternity leave in the event of an employee
becoming pregnant during a maternity leave period.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers to a problem that is not covered in the
Bill. We heard earlier that there is a presumption that such
events are rare, and that may be so, but we should try to ensure
that regulations and legislation cover all eventualities. If an
employee becomes pregnant, she is entitled to take her full
allocation of maternity leave&#151;40 weeks&#151;all together.
While a mother is on maternity leave following the birth of her
child, she could become pregnant again and that would start
another period of 40 weeks' maternity leave. She could then delay
making a decision on whether she wishes to return to work for
some 80 weeks. That may sound extreme, but there is such a case
in my constituency. An employee of a local radio station has
decided to do just that and has every right to do so. The staff
of that radio station were awarded an annual bonus of
&#163;10,000 at the end of the financial year, but the employee
in question who is on maternity leave had not worked for the
whole of that financial year. That has created some resentment
among the remaining staff who had worked very hard to earn the
bonus. The situation has arisen and it is not clear in the Bill
what is intended.
<P>
A female employee may decide to raise a family quickly, as
many people do. She may decide that she wishes to have two, three
of four children within a short space of time&#151;perhaps three
or four years&#151;so that her children grow up together. That
did not quite happen to me, but I can understand that it may be
the wish of some people. Is it the intention in the Bill that
maternity leave entitlement should be defined only by the
incidence of individual births? Is any consideration given to
what should happen when consecutive births occur in a short space
of time? At the moment, employees may be entitled to take
unbroken and unpaid maternity leave for as long as three years,
with the job held open at the end of that period if the mother
has not made a decision to inform the employer that she wishes
not to return to work.
<P>
Other problems may arise. It is a requirement of the Bill
that, while on maternity leave, seniority and pension rights are
maintained, which is reasonable. However, if an employer
contributes to a pension scheme, there could be resentment if
pension scheme contributions continued for three years and the
employee then decided not to return to work. That illustrates one
of the problems arising when the explanatory notes and the impact
assessment rely heavily on calculating the costs of the average
case. The typicality that is stressed in that assessment does not
take into consideration the cases on the edge which, for the
people concerned, are the most important. They are not merely
statistics, they are reality. In the case of my local radio
station, the director tells me that she&#151;note, she&#151;is
at a loss to know what to do. She does not know how to manage the
staffing and she does not yet know how to respond to the
complaints that are building up from the remaining staff who have
been carrying the load.
<P>
The amendment would provide some clarity in such a situation
and strike a balance between reasonableness and unreasonableness.
It recognises that without that some firms, especially small
firms, will become increasingly worried about the potential
impact of the legislation. We now have evidence of a trend among
firms to discriminate against employing women because of the risk
of an additional burden of maternity leave obligations. That is
a retrograde step and I decry it. I seek the Minister's guidance
because it is one of the issues that employers bring to my
attention&#151;
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins:</B> Was it not an argument against the equal
pay legislation that employers would no longer be willing to
employ women?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady is saying, but
I am not trying to make that comparison. I am not suggesting that
we should weaken the legislation to encourage women back to work.
My point is that we should provide clarity in the Bill so that
employers understand exactly what their obligations are. The
amendment is intended not to restrict women's rights but to
establish exactly what the Bill means. My intention is not to
reduce the rights of pregnant women or the protection that is
available to them but to clarify what those rights are. I look
forward to the Minister's explanation of the Bill's provisions
in this context.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Eastleigh about
the need for the amendment and with the arguments that he
adduced. He has learnt the hard way&#151;as have other
Opposition Members&#151;that hard cases can make bad law.
<P>
Neither Committee members nor lawyers could advise people in
perfectly reasonable circumstances&#151;rather than in cases of
abuse&#151;to use their legal rights in order to create
difficulties, especially for small empoyers. Small employers
might think long and hard about employing such people, and may
not do so. If the hon. Gentleman presses the amendment to a
Division, I shall advise my hon. Friends to support it.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will clarify a couple of matters,
the first of which relates to multiple pregnancies. My
understanding is that current practice, which will be continued
under the Bill, is to consider pregnancy as a single event,
irrespective of the number of babies. Is that correct?
<P>
Earlier I raised in a jocular way the question of triplets.
One does not get three entitlements to maternity leave if one has
triplets, despite the substantial additional burden on the
parents. However, the situation is more complex than that example
suggests. The Minister will be aware of the cases that
occasionally appear in the press about extraordinary pregnancies.
For example, a child might be born 12 months before its twin,
perhaps as a result of artificial implantation. I do not want to
hang on that example&#151;again, we are reminded that hard cases
make bad law. Intervention in these extremely sensitive areas is
increasing, perhaps as a result of concerns about infertility.
Other examples may arise or irregular pregnancies that are not
part of the conventional pattern and in which the births occur
over a period, although we may not have thought of all the
possible circumstances.
<P>
I hope that the regulations will be sufficiently flexible to
accommodate such cases in a manner that both sides regard as fair
and sensible. My example is not meant to detract from the remarks
made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh about the straightforward
consequences of consecutive pregnancies, to which the Minister
must respond. I look forward with interest to his reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Members for Eastleigh and
for Daventry for their contributions. On multiple births, which
were mentioned by the hon. Member for Daventry, the Bill will not
amend the current position. Indeed, it will replace the current
hotch-potch of measures with a family of measures.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh discussed the employment
relationship in a case in his constituency. I am not going to cop
out, but the full details and circumstances of that relationship
have not been published, althouth I do not blame the hon.
Gentleman for that. Although I cannot comment on an individual
employment relationship, the principles that that case raises
should be discussed in relation to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I wish to be helpful. My reading of the Bill is
that such an employee will not be entitled to share in the bonus
because remuneration is excluded, but that situation currently
exists.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr Ian McCartney:</B> the bonus goes back to a previous debate
and depends on what is in the individual contract of employment.
It bears no relation to this proposal. As I said at the outset,
any proposed changes are a matter for interpretation between the
parties to the contractual relationship.
<P>
It is not the aim of employment law to interfere in a
couple's choice on the spacing of their children. I do not think
that the hon. Member for Eastleigh suggested that, but it is in
my speech, so I must say it.&#151;[Laughter.] I knew that would
get them going.
<P>
It is important to emphasise that it is unjustifiable to
deprive a woman of her rights under normal employment law because
of her choices about when to have children. That is critically
important, and we would resist any amendment to that effect,
probing or otherwise. Nor is there a range of evidence to suggest
that that is a problem. I do not use this as a defence for not
dealing adequately with the remarks of the hon. Member for
Eastleigh because there are always examples of cases at the
margins. Nor am I saying that there are not cases in which some
women choose to take their confinements early, over a short or
longer time, but it cannot be justifiable to withdraw from such
a person her rights under employment law. Nor do I believe that
women are being mischievous or want to cause havoc in the
workplace. A woman's decision is taken in the context of her
relationship within the family.
<P>
However, there is another issue here. If the woman has a
long-term relationship with her employer, she may assist her
employer at a later stage. This is not an argument against what
the hon. Gentleman said; I am speaking about the concepts and
principles involved. If a woman completes her family early in her
employment cycle, she will be more readily available at a later
date to continue her employment and her relationship with her
employer. In that situation, the picture is slightly different
and, over time, the costs and obligations are balanced out. Some
women have children early in their life and are then available
for employment for the remainder of their working lives.
<P>
Even in the circumstances mentioned by the hon. Member for
Eastleigh, if a woman were to take her full entitlement to 29
weeks' additional maternity leave and three months' parental
leave, she would have to become pregnant again almost immediately
after the birth to avoid returning to work before her second
period of maternity leave. She would have to become pregnant
within three months of the birth of her child.
<P>
Under current provisions, it is possible for a woman to lose
her right to a job. That can happen only if she is on maternity
absence and has no contract of employment during that absence,
and is unable to return to work by the 29th week after the birth.
If she becomes pregnant again almost immediately after giving
birth, that can prevent her return, although only if she is sick
or her second baby is premature. Under our proposals, the woman's
position will be protected. I hope that that assists the hon.
Member for Eastleigh. However, he may write to me if the
circumstances that I have outlined do not fit exactly with what
is happening in the company that he mentioned.
<P>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the relationship
between the employer and the woman when arriving at appropriate
and sensible arrangements. We discussed that in relation to the
previous amendment and we shall deal with similar issues when we
consider later amendments.
<P>
Case law is clear. To sack a woman who might otherwise have
been retained when the first woman returned from leave is
unlawful sex discrimination, because it raises the issue of the
right of an agency worker or somebody else who comes in. The hon.
Member for Eastleigh said that a quandary arose. I was not sure
whether the quandary arose from continuing to employ the woman
or from the employment of the woman preventing the other woman
from returning to work.
<P>
If a replacement is told from the start that the job ends
when the employee returns from maternity leave, section 106 of
the Employment Rights Act 1996 makes special provision to ensure
that it is not an unfair reason for dismissal. The Bill does not
change that provision, which does not apply where the replacement
is dismissed before the return of the woman for whom he or she
is covering. That employee is just as entitled to protection as
others. As in a fixed-term contract, unfair dismissal is unfair
dismissal. The issue there is that if they have not worked for
the period of unfair dismissal&#151;the two-year period, now
reduced to one year&#151;they cannot make a claim for unfair
dismissal. They have to work for that qualifying period.
<P>
Women are entitled to the minimum period of maternity leave
from the first day they start work. It would be wrong to attempt
to deprive them of that right, as the amendment unintentionally
does. Therefore, the amendment is unacceptable.
<P>
I hope that, when the hon. Member for Eastleigh reads what
I have said, he will find that it has covered the points that he
made. If it has not, perhaps he will send me a note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I thank the Minister for a helpful and detailed
reply. The amendment clearly opened up a can of worms, as I
suspected it might. However, I am grateful to the Minister for
taking time to look at it in detail. When I have had a chance to
study his response in Hansard, I shall, if necessary, take up his
offer to write to him for further clarification. In that spirit,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page
49, line 25, leave out ``this section'' and insert ``subsection
(1) or (2)''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No.
71.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The amendments ensure that existing provisions
that provide valued flexibility for microbusinesses can continue.
Those provisions recognise that in some cases it may not be
practicable for a woman to return to her old job after additional
maternity leave. In those cases, employers can offer her a
different job, provided that it is suitable for her and does not
leave her significantly worse off.
<P>
Very small firms may not be able to take advantage of such
flexibility. They may not have suitable alternative jobs to
offer; they may have no jobs to offer. suitable or not. In those
limited circumstances, micor-firms with five or fewer employees
who cannot reasonably take the woman back are relieved of the
duty to do so.
<P>
We believe that the provision represents a much-valued
reduction in the burden that the Bill would otherwise place on
such firms. We intend to continue the provision under the new
regime. Indeed, it has never been suggested otherwise. I am sure
that Opposition Members will concur with that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I follow the logic of what the Minister is saying
to the Committee and I do not wish to quibble. However, my
understanding is that, ordinarily, a microfirm is regarded as a
firm with nine employees or fewer. That is why I am slightly
uncertain about his definition of such a firm as one with five
employees or fewer.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was using the word ``micro'' in the generic
sense of small and medium-sized businesses. If I said ``small and
medium-sized businesses'', the hon. Gentleman would jump up and
ask how many employees such enterprises had. I was trying to
assist the Committee in narrowing it down. We are not intending
that all small and medium-sized employers should be outside the
terms; I would not even suggest that. I was simply using
``micro'' as a generic term to isolate a certain group of
small-business employers from the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
We made it clear in the White Paper ``Fairness at Work'' that
we would give consideration to special circumstances in small
companies, which we have done. However, we have been advised that
the Bill does not contain sufficient power to carry out that
commitment. That is the reason for the amendments, and I
therefore commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Of course we do not wish to dissuade the
Minister from pursuing the necessary flexibility, particularly
in relation to such an important sector. Indeed, in anticipating
the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, we
noticed that, in order to overcome his reticence at extending the
welcome and healthy provisions to the whole of the microbusiness
sector, the Minister had to reinvent a definition of business
with under five employees, which presumably ought to be called
the nanobusiness sector. I suspect that my hon. Friends would be
happy if it extended that far, for the reasons already given.
<P>
Conversely, the objective still applies of getting people
back into work if they want it. I am sure that under the fair
deal and the complex of other Government measures, it would be
helpful if employers and those who advise them, such as the
Employment Service, had to bear in mind the desirability at least
of placement of women returning from pregnancy or confinement in
another employer's business. As the Minister said, and as we
readily acknowledge, it may be impossible for them to return to
the same business, because there may be no job for them, but it
may be possible to find them a place in a comparable business in
the same town. That it something that we should aspire to do,
even though it may not be carried out and certainly should not
be a legal requirement on the microbusiness sector.
