<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 2, line 35, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(9) Subsection (1) does not prohibit agreements between companies with revenues below &#163;10 million per annum, or such greater figure as may be from time to time prescribed by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 80, in page 2, line 35, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(9) Unless the Director determines otherwise, a small agreement as defined in the European Commission's Notice on Agreements of Minor Importance which do not fall under Article 85(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community is not subject to the Chapter I prohibition.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, to the Chair, and to an interesting group of amendments. The amendments concern small businesses. Having run a small business, I can declare to the Committee an interest that I perhaps should have declared earlier, but its turnover never reached anywhere near the ball park figure of &#163;10 million per annum. Indeed, it continues with a turnover smaller by about two orders of magnitude. [Interruption.] The Under-Secretary invites me to expand on that, but he knows that the business is in agriculture and, in the context of the common agricultural policy, he may have second thoughts about that. I hastily return to the substance of our debate.
<P>
One of our worries has already been well articulated--I shall not dilate on that now. For the ordinary business--a not particularly complimentary term--a run-of-the-mill business, that is not large or sophisticated and which has the good or ill fortune to employ a significant number of competition lawyers, there may be some difficulties in the Bill. The Under-Secretary, with characteristic modesty, may concede that clause 2 does not leap lightly off the page.
<P>
Our first concern is that a large number of ordinary businesses, ranging in turnover from &#163;50,000 a year to the median of between &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million a year, may stumble into circumstances in which their agreements are voided or they are made subject to penalty. It is important to bear in mind that there are two elements of sanction--the penalty and the voiding of agreements. As some of my hon. Friends suggested this morning, and it is certainly my view, the voiding of agreements, particularly at that level, may be even more worrying than the penalty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I would not dream of interrupting my hon. Friend when he is just getting into his stride, but may I add to his list the threat of third-party actions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right.
<P>
The first element of our concern is the potential for what might loosely be called trouble for ``ordinary'' businesses going about what they would see as ``normal'' business. Our second worry is that if those businesses are responsible, if they read our deliberations and ministerial assurances and listen to the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading, or if they are well advised by in-house lawyers or have purchased their own legal services, they may decide that they need to do something about the problem, or at least to go through the process of deciding whether to do something about it. All that will impose costs on such businesses.
<P>
Our two elements of concern for businesses are, first, the element of sanction, whether by penalty, third-party action or voiding agreements, and, secondly, the cost of compliance. Although only time will show whether I am right, I have a certain scepticism about the Under-Secretary's figure on compliance costs. I emphasise that we are covering new territory. We understand fully that the present and previous Governments, with the Director General of Fair Trading, have considered ways in which those compliance costs can be relieved.
<P>
The guidance notes issued by the Office of Fair Trading state that the primary test is whether anti-competitiveness arises from the clause. If it does not, there is no need to register. That is fair enough if it is clear in advance to the business that no anti-competitive action could have taken place or could be alleged subsequently to have taken place. There will be much covering of one's back involved in compliance with that.
<P>
The second test will be the market share test, however it will be applied. It is designed to sift out or filter, both in European procedure and, ultimately, in ours, a proportion that will be taken off by the test. I refer to this morning's interesting debate on the consequences of local commercial action. Without malice on their part, individuals with a comparatively small global market share, with no definite view of whether their actions are anti-competitive, may find themselves caught by the provisions.
<P>
It is fair to say that the amendment tabled by the hon. Members for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) and for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) has the same broad intention as our amendment, which is to cut through the tests that are difficult and are transmitted to the business through lawyers and advice. It would produce an additional test that would strike out the smaller businesses.
<P>
Amendment No. 54 contains a provision for a turnover of below &#163;10 million a year--``revenues'' is the word used. I do not hold a brief for the wording of the amendment nor do I have a precise commitment to the figure, but the amendment would cover the turnover of the majority of businesses. It would confine the way in which the Bill bites to a limited number of cases which, in their nature and because of their scale, are likely to be most appropriate for action on the anti-competitiveness front.
<P>
We also debated earlier whether parts of the United Kingdom should be sub-divided. It may be difficult to capture a small, local situation through the anti-competitive mechanism, in general. There would always be the possibility of clawback if a particular situation arose that we had not thought about. However, a basic presumption of a minimum turnover level for businesses designed to exclude the great majority numerically of businesses and to concentrate the Bill on the bigger players for which it is intended, and which are better equipped to deal with it given their resources and the advice that they receive, would be sensible.
<P>
Such a proposal would reduce considerably the compliance costs to smaller businesses. The Government certainly pay lip service to the need to do that. Occasionally, they claim that they have been able to better the work of their predecessors. If they do that, on one will be more pleased than me; it is an area that we all need to work on to give small business a chance.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Would it not be a supreme irony if the Government failed to accept our amendment, as a result of which many small businesses were damaged--even if only inadvertently as the Government would believe--and, consequently, competition in the market, far from being enhanced, decreased?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a fair consideration. We do not want people to be unable to enter the market--the chilling effect--or to be driven out of the market because they are terrified of being caught in the coils of the Bill, although their broad intentions and commercial actions are, and have always been, designed to be reasonable, to borrow a phrase.
<P>
We are therefore faced with the impact on small businesses, compliance costs, and the danger that people may be inadvertently caught or may be driven out of the market so that they are not inadvertently caught. We also face the problem of the ability of the Government, the Office of Fair Trading and the director general to resource the process.
<P>
As an inevitable result of our activity as Members of Parliament, we are all familiar with the concept of what I call ``snow''--when the number of incoming messages destroys the ability of the poor mortals that we are to handle them. We all struggle quite hard. I suspect that some new Members may have been surprised by the amount that they have received.
<P>
If the director general and the OFT are beset with huge quantities of bumph from people who think that, despite their attempts to get it right, and because they have over-fussy lawyers who are determined to have everything in black and white, they need to apply for guidance and clearance on their activities, the OFT will ultimately not be able to concentrate on its main job, which is to pursue genuine actions of anti-competitiveness. It will be too busy ensuring that the burden of paperwork is clear, without discharging the objective of that paperwork. That is an equal anxiety.
<P>
The amendment contains those two parallel objectives, which are entirely reasonable. I hope that the Minister will reflect on them sympathetically. It is an attempt, first, to relieve the burden on smaller business of potential problems, which are not likely to involve the major objectives of competition legislation. Secondly, it is designed to clear some of the paperwork for the director general and the OFT, to enable them better to apply themselves to their duties on major cases.
<P>
In due course, I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will want to catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson, to speak to his amendment. His will be a differently expressed but broadly similar approach. I advise the Committee of another anxiety that is not embodied in an amendment, but appeared at the last moment from an august source--the joint working party of the Bar Council and the Law Society on competition law. Its members do not come cheap, and should know what they are talking about. It suggests that clause 2(4) should.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not apply to a small agreement until such time as immunity is withdrawn by the Director under subsection (4).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That question strictly arises on clause 40, but I raise it now because although, under clause 37(1), small agreements might be immune from the imposition of a penalty fine, they might remain open to actions by third parties. As I have already suggested, the danger is that parties to small agreements are likely to be less worried about penalty fines, especially if they have acted reasonably, and much more worried about their agreements being deemed void, because that is the major sanction on them. If we believe in a de minimis provision along the lines suggested in the Bill, we should allow minor agreements that fall within the scope of chapter I to operate without fear of sanctions. That is a sensible principle.
<P>
Concern is shared widely among members of the Committee that we should do our best to clear the decks of small businesses, which are unlikely to have a major impact on the objectives of the Bill, in both their interests and those of smooth administration for everyone.
<P>
We have no hang-ups about precisely how that should be achieved. It could be achieved by a turnover limit, by a better articulation of the immunity rules or by some importation from the European analogy. The Government need to address that issue a little more thoroughly in the interests of small business, which we all favour, and in the interests of making the Bill more effective. I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I should like to speak briefly to amendment No. 80, tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friends. The thrust of our amendment is similar in its objective to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). The difference between them is that our amendment is not specific about revenues, although I take note of the hon. Gentleman's lack of rigidity about the figure. Our amendment has value in its own right, because it would write into the Bill a provision that would be workable under all the relevant circumstances.
<P>
It is worth spending a few moments giving examples of the types of small agreement that would be helped by the amendment. Small businesses have many small agreementss that do not necessarily operate within a small focus. I am thinking particularly of the music industry, which, as I know that the Under-Secretary will be aware, has raised concerns about how its agreements will be affected by the Bill if it is not amended to give the industry comfort.
<P>
British music rights organisations and the British phonographic industry have a long tradition of licensing music rights in a global business environment. They work with the creators and publishers of music and the collecting societies, and have taken account of aritcles 85 and 86 under European law since their inception. There is great support within that industry for provisions to prevent anti-competitive agreements and behaviour, but we must ensure that the proposed new competition regime in the United Kingdom does not hamper effective licensing of intellectual property rights. That is a difficult area with many wider connotations, but if we concentrate on the elements affected by the Bill, we will recognise that without protection and clarity, we could well create a great deal of uncertainty in that industry, and potentially impose large financial burdens on it.
<P>
The creators of works are the copyright owners of those works. Earlier, we had an interesting debate comparing manufactured products to works of art or other works created by individuals. We need to address that issue in this context. Creators of works have the exclusive rights to authorise or prohibit the use of their works. Within the EU, exclusive licensing of copyright is recognised by legal precedent and general endorsement. It is extremely difficult for individual creators in the United Kingdom to license, control or monitor the use of their works. That is why it has become customary for copyright owners to appoint collecting societies to manage their copyright works collectively on their behalf--hence the small agreements into which they enter.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I am following the hon. Gentleman's remarks with great interest; he is making a most constructive contribution. I want to deflect him slightly from what he is saying about the defence of intellectual property internationally. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how he thinks the internet will affect that? How can intellectual property be protected across frontiers and in different jurisdictions? I should like to think that that was easy but I am sure that it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. It is a huge problem that we must face in the years ahead. I do not pretend to have all the answers, but in a few years' time, as Governments move on and new parties come into power, we may find the answer.
<P>
As I am talking about the music industry, it is relevant to mention the bootlegging of compact discs. The work produced on a particular CD may be the only successful composition of an artist who is dependent on the income from it for the whole of his career. The prices charged in the markets in Europe reflect that position. It is difficult for people to maintain integrity in their work when a direct copy of the CD can be bought in Bulgaria for &#163;1.
<P>
Although collective societies are de facto monopolies, they operate in the interests of copyright owners and users. They provide a simple, more efficient, centralised form of licensing and administering copyright. European case law and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission have readily endorsed the principle of the collective management of rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a constructive speech. Does he agree that the existence of a large number of copyright holders who exercise their right through a collective society is, in turn, a form of competition? The fact that there is an incentive to secure benefits from intellectual property--indeed, encourages the creation of that intellectual property--is very much pro rather than anti-competitive.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman responds to that intervention, I should say that I am having difficulty following the argument as it relates to amendment No. 80. It seems that we are talking about copyright and amendent No. 52, which we have not yet reached. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not anticipate a future debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I would not dream of doing so, Mr. Atkinson--certainly not under your eagle eye.
<P>
I was laying the background to the main thrust of any argument for amendment No. 80. I shall now discuss the minor agreements that amendment No. 80 is designed to cover. A vast number of the companies involved in the music business are small and medium enterprises. About 60 per cent. of the members of the Music Publishers Association have a turnover of less than &#163;50,000 a year--never mind &#163;10 million. The only concession granted to businesses of that size is referred to in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Immunity from penalties is given to `small agreements' and `conduct of minor significance'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is out of line with the model that has been developed by the Commission. Amendment No. 80 would add to the Bill and make the position clearer.
<P>
The new notice on agreements of minor importance explicitly recognises that agreements that do not have an appreciable effect on trade or competition fall outside the scope of article 85. The danger is that without a clearly defined exclusion for de minimis agreements, new legislation could impose heavy, unjustifiable bnurdens on parties to agreements and the OFT, as was illustrated by the hon. Member or Daventry a few moments ago.
<P>
I want to give thrust to the amendments, to which I hope the Under-Secretary will respond positively. In particular, many of the agreements that have only a negligible affect on competition and many with a favourable impact will still have to be notified to ensure their legal certainty.
<P>
The current proposals for de minimis agreements will be of limited value in reducing the burden on small businesses. That is counter to the prime objective of the competition regime. I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond positively to amendment No. 80; or, if he does not find it totally satisfactory, that he will tell us how he thinks he will cope with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity briefly to support the arguments presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and, indeed, the hon. Member for Eastleigh. If we were to go down the path proposed in the amendment of setting a de minimis level of turnover, we would substantially reduce the risk of increased compliance costs to business.
<P>
In response to a brief exchange about compliance costs, the Minister of State was kind enough to send every member of the Committee a copy of the compliance cost assessment. Given that assessment, I want to make one or two points that support the argument that we must do all that we can to reduce the risk of a substantial number of companies incurring costs under the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
The compliance cost assessment is interesting. I shall confine myself to the chapter I prohibition, with which we are dealing. Annex A of the compliance cost assessment deals with the number of agreements that have been notified under the current system, and that figure is compared with what is assumed to be the number of notifications of agreements under the new system. Built into the assessment are several assumptions, which I shall not question. For example, the Department has estimated the cost per agreement on the basis of correspondence with legal firms. Let us hope that that estimate is accurate.
<P>
It is assumed that the cost of business managers' time within the businesses involved--not the legal firms--will be 50 per cent. of the legal charges. I have no reason to question that assumption. However, some of us might well think that the Department's estimate of compliance cost per agreement is modest compared with our own estimate of the real cost to firms, but I shall leave that aside.
<P>
Let us consider the one assumption in annex A that seems arguable on the grounds that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry gave when moving the amendment. If I summarise it correctly, it is assumed in the compliance cost assessment that, whereas between 50 and 60 per cent. of agreements were notified under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, only 20 per cent. will be required to be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading under the anti-competitive prohibition. That assumption substantially affects the recurring compliance costs--not the non-recurring costs, which are acknowledged--that businesses will incur as a consequence of the introduction of the new system.
<P>
I have done some calculations and it may help the Committee if I were to run through one or two numbers. For example, if the percentage of agreements notified under the new system were to increase from 20 per cent. to 60 per cent., and if the notifications were distributed between the two types of notification in the proportion that the Department has assumed--that is, one notification for individual exemption for every three that are notified on a precautionary basis--using the same compliance cost per agreement as the Department, I calculate that changing that assumption will increase the potential compliance costs under type F--that is precautionary notifications--by between &#163;3 million and &#163;4&#183;5 million on a 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. estimate, and by between &#163;750,000 and &#163;1 million for notifications for individual exemptions.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If that calculation is used for the earlier figures, we can see that Ministers have been sanguine about the recurring compliance cost of introducing the chapter I prohibition. The compliance cost assessment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the recurring compliance cost of the prohibition of restrictive agreements is estimated to be between a reduction of &#163;2&#183;8m and an increase of &#163;1&#183;1m per annum.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that were to prove correct, I suspect that most businesses would be fairly sanguine. However, if a 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. range of notifications is assumed, the recurring increase in the cost of complying with the chapter I prohibition compared to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 will be between &#163;3 million and &#163;5 million.
<P>
I do not wish to stretch this argument too far, but one of the principle objectives of the Bill is to reduce the compliance costs to business, because the Restrictive Trade Practices Act has led to a large number of unnecessary notifications. It is important that we build the maximum certainty into the operation of the Bill. If the effect on competition of anti-competitive agreements by groups of companies is likely to be insignificant it would be better to go for a de minimis turnover figure of the sort proposed in amendment No. 54. Companies would thereby be unambiguously taken out of the scope of having to make precautionary notifications.
<P>
The compliance cost assessment for the chapter II prohibition is based on a &#163;20 million turnover. I should be interested to see how the Under-Secretary interprets his intentions when considering a turnover figure for the chapter I prohibitions. However, if we were to take small businesses out of the scope of the chapter I prohibition, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, it would substantially reduce the number of potential notifications that would have to be made to the director general. On that basis, a more reasonable assumption--I should say a more pessimistic assumption; who is to say what is reasonable?--might lead to an increase in compliance costs compared to the present regime.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I shall be brief. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) referred to the large number of small businesses in her constituency, which she was seeking to visit. I said that I had been in a business with a low turnover, and that, in the 18 years that I served on that company, it never employed more than 200 people.
<P>
When I set up the business in 1961, there was no other business of that sort, so there was no possibility of agreement with anyone, let alone an anti-competitive agreement. It was a monopoly, but such was our success that we were rapidly emulated by others. I doubt whether our turnover had reached &#163;10 million when I left to join the Conservative Administration formed by Lady Thatcher in 1979, although we might have done so if it was calculated in 1998 sterling prices.
<P>
I said that the company had no interest in the Bill, in terms of agreements. However, I wish, out of that experience, to refer to the burdens that the Government are capable of laying on small businesses, to the disadvantage of their expansion and of the major role that they play in the expansion of employment. In 1966, the Government introduced not only the selective employment tax, which had certain implications for us, but a provision that any foreign company--any company owned outside the country--was obliged to pay dividends at the maximum level, unless it could prove that it needed to keep the money in the country.
<P>
I remember devoting an enormous amount of what appeared to me to be totally frustrating and unnecessary time proving to the Inland Revenue that a business that was expanding at the rate of 20 per cent. per annum needed to retain the money inside the business. In addition to all that has been said by my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and by the hon. Member for Eastleigh about the costs involved for small business, I am concerned about the amount of management time that will be sucked into that area.
<P>
Compliance costs have been admirably dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, so I will not refer to them. I briefly echo what the hon. Member for Eastleigh said on behalf of the British Music Rights group, which is in my constituency. The hon. Gentleman cited the fact that 60 per cent. of British music publishers, of whom there are 3,000, have a turnover of less than &#163;50,000 a year. He will know that more than 85 per cent. of them have a turnover of less than &#163;1 million a year, and yet the total volume of the industry is &#163;600 million. Therefore, it is perfectly clear that the main burden of activity occurs outside those small businesses.
<P>
I very much hope that in responding to the debate, the Under-Secretary will treat on that industry, because of its significance to my constituency. Of course, Mr. Atkinson, I was echoing the hon. Member for Eastleigh only when he was in order, not when he anticipated clauses that we shall come to hereafter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I should like to contribute briefly to the debate; I am spurred to do so both by the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and by his allusion to the large number of small businesses in the constituency of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West. That characteristic of her constituency also applies to mine, although in other respects there are great differences between the two. I have read the hon. Lady's pontifications on small businesses in her area, which I respect, and I hope that my reflections on my area will be relevant and of interest.
<P>
I do not know whether I have yet succeeded in visiting as many small businesses in my constituency as have other members of the Committee, but the fact that I have 28 appointments between now and the end of June to visit small businesses in Buckingham may be an indication of my interest in their wellbeing. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) is chuntering from a sedentary position in a way that is almost certainly intended to be abusive and off-putting, but I shall do my best not in any way to be distracted by his mutterings.
<P>
My concern is simply stated. In subscribing to the principle and, through the Bill, the practice of competition, the Government are in danger of displaying all the apostolic zeal of the convert. That they have come to embrace the idea of competition and want to try to give effect to that principle is welcome. If they should do so in such a way as deliberately or by neglect to damage a significant number of businesses, that would be extremely unfortunate.
<P>
Thus far, we have had no indication as to whether the Under-Secretary intends to accept the amendment. Although I try to look on the positive side, I would be optimisitic if I expected the Government to support the amendment, for the simple reason that it would be the first occasion in my experience since 1 May when they had done so in a Committee that I have attended. I am working on the basis that the Government intend to persuade us that the amendment is either undesirable or unnecessary. It is not clear to me that it is.
<P>
My starting point, which I hope that the Committee will recognise as being well intentioned, is that we should not treat equally things that are unequal. There is a clear distinction between large businesses and the significance and effect of their practices, and small businesses and the significance and effect of their practices. If a large company is engaged in a restrictive agreement, whether vertical or otherwise, the effect of which is to restrict, prevent or distort competition, that effect can be extremely damaging to other businesses. It is a proper purpose of public policy to try to avoid that.
<P>
It is extremely unlikely, to put it mildly, that a damaging effect of a nominally anti-competitive practice by a small business will be to cause great harm to large numbers of other businesses. In particular, it is most improbable that a small business operating a vertical agreement that does not conform to pure principles of competition will damage a larger business. Moreover, the fact that it is a small business almost necessarily means that it will have a relatively small share of the market. It is therefore unlikely that in its operation it substantially exaggerates its share of the market, prevents others from expanding their share of the market, or denies the opportunity for business as yet unborn to be born and to enter the market. That is the essence of the argument for the innocence of small businesses.
<P>
It is clear beyond doubt that substantial numbers of small businesses fear that, if the amendment is not accepted, they will face penalty and perhaps even the threat of going out of business. I am sure that the Under-Secretary does not want that to happen. If he does not think that the amendment is necessary, how will small businesses avoid being damaged? Will he place on the record a commitment, to which he would be morally obliged to stick, that as a consequence of the unamended clause, no damage to small businesses will be done, that no small business will suffer financial penalty--which our amendment would prevent it doing--and that no small business will cease to trade as a consequence? If he is confident about that, let him state it for our benefit. I am worried that damage may be done; there is grave uncertainty out there, certainly in my constituency, as is clear from my discussions with small business men who have been made aware of the Bill's contents as drafted.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will also be aware of a point that is often lost in the debate about industry, commerce and competitiveness. When we discuss small businesses, we are not talking about a small sector of the overall picture only. We are talking about most businesses. We all know, although it is rarely stated, that the vast majority of trading entities within the United Kingdom are small. They are small in the sense that they have a relatively modest turnover, and in the sense that they employ a relatively small number of people. The provision damages them unnecessarily, prevents them from growing into larger businesses--most large businesses were once small--and simultaneously has the perverse and unintended effect of damaging competition.
<P>
I do not dispute that the Under-Secretary wants to extend competition; he is a model and authentic representative of new Labour 1998. He wears the tee-shirt and sports the badge, regularly and for our benefit, so we know that the extension of competition is his intention. Would it not be an extremely unfortunate by-product of a badly drafted piece of legislation and of the failure to adhere to the sound advice of members of the Committee if competition were to be undermined rather than improved?
<P>
<B>Dr. Phyllis Starkey </B>(Milton Keynes, South-West): I have been following the hon. Gentleman's description of his peregrinations in his constituency visiting businesses. If he has been talking up the potential dangers of the clause--as he sees them--to small businesses, will he be telling them after he hears the Under-Secretary's assurances that their concerns were misplaced and that they have nothing to worry about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Lady should be patient and await the ministerial response. I respect greatly her desire to protect what remains of the reputation of the Under-Secretary, but it is a little unreasonable to ask me in advance of whatever offering might come from him to guarantee to tell my constituents that his ill-drafted Bill will not damage them. I am concerned in the context of both the amendment and the wider debate on the Bill whether what remains of the Under-Secretary's reputation can be maintained and whether that which has been lost can be recovered. It is unreasonable for the hon. Lady to think that I can put the hon. Gentleman's reputation above the interests of my constituents.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I give a clear assurance: if the Under-Secretary's response is persuasive and if it satisfies what I consider to be an extremely taxing criterion and the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, and if it meets the exacting standards of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)--the shadow President of the Board of Trade--I would be in an ill position to object. I am answering directly the point that was put to me, something that Labour Members are not accustomed to doing. It must be acknowledged that my right hon. Friend is a demanding individual and if he were content with the Under-Secretary's explanation, I shall assure businesses in my constituency that they are safe. However, it is too early to do so at this stage.
<P>
Important though our amendment is and of concern though the matter that we are discussing is to Conservative Members, I am sure that the hon. Lady will understand when I say that, in my peregrinations round the constituency to which she eloquently referred, I have drawn the attention of small businesses to several threats under the Bill--not only to those to which I have spent the past few minutes alluding. I wait with bated breath with beads of sweat upon my brow for the long-awaited answer from the Under-Secretary.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Nigel Griffiths):</B> Obviously, the Government are concerned about the interests of small businesses and that is why I cannot accept the amendments. I refer first to amendment No. 54. It would not be right to exclude small firms from the application of the prohibition. It is the effects on competition that count, not the size of the perpetrators. As we know, small businesses can fix the market and prices. When they have an appreciable market share, they can enter into agreements that restrict, distort or prevent competition.
<P>
Given the nature of things, their competitors--often other small businesses, as well as consumers--are likely victims of such agreements and they can be the victims of the perpetrators of the anti-competitive practice. As small businesses, they deserve the protection provided by the Bill. It is only agreements that have appreciable effects on competition that will be caught. Agreements between small firms do not have appreciable effects, in which case they will not be caught. We recognise the position of small businesses by providing them with special relief from penalties.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire raised the issue of the compliance cost assessment and gave us his figures, which I do not accept. I believe that people who indulge in anti-competitive behaviour, whether it be a small firm talking to another small local firm in order to fix prices or share markets, or a larger conglomeration, they invariably know what they are doing. They do not need the resources of expensive solicitors to tell them what they are doing.
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 80, agreements that fall within the Commission's de minimis notice will often also fall outside the prohibition because they do not have an appreciable effect on competition in the UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Under-Secretary referred to an immunity from penalty in relation to businesses with turnover below a certain level. The OFT draft guidelines make that clear. The guidelines state that there will be immunity from penalty in relation to both prohibitions. They then refer to businesses with a turnover of less than &#163;X million, with a relevant market share of less than YY per cent.
<P>
Can the Minister guide us a little more since, as far as I am aware, the director general has not published the further document that was promised, entitled ``The Competition Act 1998: effect on small and medium-sized enterprises''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The director general is taking the broad view from the experience of the OFT, and he will come up with a figure that will be generally acceptable to hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire leads me to another point that I want to tackle head on. He said that although small businesses could be exempt from the penalties that the Director General of Fair Trading imposes, they may not be exempt from a third party action for compensation. I am sure that, on reflection, everyone will agree that if someone has suffered from an anti-competitive agreement, he will have to establish it and of course he will be entitled to compensation under third party action. In order to receive that compensation, the courts would consider the failure of the director general to take action. Victims of price fixing or anti-competitive market sharing should be entitled to compensation for the wrong they have suffered, the loss of business and custom and the damage to their company. I hope that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire agrees with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> If the Under-Secretary believes that large numbers of small businesses are engaged in such practices, and if he understands and accepts that it is often on a long-established basis and by agreement that such businesses operate, he must accept that by being obliged to discontinue such practices, those businesses will suffer, even if only in the short term. Has the Under-Secretary assessed the number of such businesses that will be caught and estimated the degree to which they will suffer in the short term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> As I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's initial premise, I can spare the Committee the tortuous logic that he then took us through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is not tortuous at all; it is very straightforward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I do not accept the point that the hon. Gentleman started with and, therefore, I do not accept the consequences that he mentioned.
<P>
I shall cite an example that at least one other hon. Member has raised with me. Amendment No. 80 would exclude from the prohibition agreements that had serious effects within the United Kingdom but did not affect trade between member states and, therefore, were outside article 85. An agreement between bus companies with fewer than 250 employees and a turnover of less than 40 million ecu that had the effect of preventing other bus companies from starting up in a town might qualify under the test proposed in the amendment. However, the amendment would rob the Bill of the deterrent effect of the prohibition against the agreements--companies would have no incentive to consider the risks of breaching the prohibition until the Director General of Fair Trading took action, by which time the damage might have been done.
<P>
The director general has been fulsome in his praise of the Bill because of the speed with which he can take action. The delay that amendment No. 80 would cause--I am sure that in the mind of the hon. Member for Eastleigh such a delay would be inadvertent--would be detrimental to the victims of the anti-competitive agreement, as is the current position. In short, the amendment would provide a serious loophole for agreements that were harmful to our national economy but which had little effect on trade between member states.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I want to pursue the same point but in relation to the figures for turnover or market share that the director general will use in due course. I do not want to anticipate the debate on clause 40, which will give effect to such provisions, but will the Under-Secretary ask the director general to tell us, before we debate clause 40, what he will treat as a small agreement and which circumstances he will regard as being sufficiently serious and anti-competitive to withdraw the immunity from penalty, given that price-fixing agreements are not included?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Bill was debated in another place, where my noble Friend Lord Simon of Highbury gave an indication that the de minimus limit was likely to be in the range of between &#163;20 million and &#163;50 million. Will the hon. Gentleman refresh my memory on his second point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My second point was on the circumstances in which the director general would regard an agreement as sufficiently serious in its anti-competitive effects to lead him to withdraw the immunity from penalty. The Under-Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that the indication given--&#163;20 million plus--related to the chapter II prohibition only. Does it also relate to the chapter I prohibition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I am sorry--one of my hon. Friends coughed as the hon. Gentleman was reaching his peroration, but I believe that the answer to both his questions is yes.
<P>
I conclude by urging all hon. Members to reject the amendments for the reasons that I have given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> At the conclusion of his speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) propsoed a new variant on what might traditionally have been called the cricket test, which might be modified into the Daventry test. Perhaps I would be flattering myself if I were to suggest that he said, with perceptiveness--it might have been fawning flattery--that he would follow the lead that I sought to give him. Having listened to the Under-Secretary's response, I am unable to accept the arguments that he has deployed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that fawning flattery is not my style and will not be in future; nevertheless, I am grateful to him for his comments. Did he notice a contradiction in the concluding remarks of the Under-Secretary, who was once again struggling and heavily dependent on the brief in front of him? First, he said that he did not accept that anti-competitive agreements by small businesses were widespread, and then he said that if our amendment were accepted it would blow a hole in the Bill. Manifestly, those two statements are difficult to reconcile. Does my hon. Friend think that the Under-Secretary owes himself, if not the Committee, an explanation?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I take it that that was something of a rhetorical question. I had indeed noticed a certain incoherence, and I suspect that the Under-Secretary will be reluctant to give a view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I am on my feet, perhaps I can offer my own explanation to my hon. Friend. It appears to me, as someone who from previous experience is not entirely unfamiliar with the ways of Whitehall, that what may have happened is that two lines were offered which just happened to be mutually exclusive. Perhaps the Under-Secretary has an alternative view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> It is sad that the hon. Member for Buckingham cannot listen. What I said was that the amendment would provide a serious loophole for agreements; I did not mention the number of such agreements. If a loophole were opened for any agreements, unscrupulous businesses could conspire to get round the serious attempts of the Bill to stop anti-competitive behaviour. That is the critical matter. Even if only a few companies were involved, their likely victims would be not just consumers but small businesses, whose interests we have very much at heart.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was a helpful intervention in elucidating the Under-Secretary's position. Briefly to conclude my preliminary remarks--my subsequent remarks will also be short--it appears to me that it would be entirely improper for us to commit an anti-competitive practice. We will not conspire or collude. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham and my other hon. Friends are perfectly capable of exercising their judgment after listening to the argument. Whether a single line is taken on the Government Benches is another matter, and not one to be entirely resolved during the passage of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> At the risk of overstaying your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, does my hon. Friend think that if we abstain from anti-competitive practices, Government Members will abstain from abuse of a dominant position?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is taxing the chair too much, and I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Daventry did not answer that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend's intervention spoke for itself, Mr. Atkinson, and I shall not pursue it.
<P>
The way in which the Under-Secretary has trapped himself in his own new dogma, as converts so often do, is interesting. He believes in competitiveness; we also believe in competitiveness. He says that he believes in helping small businesses; we believe in helping small businesses as well. There will be cases in which small businesses will find it difficult to comply with the provision of the clause. The Under-Secretary's assertion is that competition will be damaged in certain cases if the clause is not passed as drafted. He should have acknowledged more readily than he did that there may be cases in which clashes occur, but that they will be a minority of cases involving a very small sector.
<P>
The pursuit of the competition ideal is not cost free in terms of compliance. It is not cost free in its consequences, because it may cause the innocent business, if I may use that phrase, to stumble into incurring if not penalties--because of the exemptions for small business--a suit from a third party. The Under-Secretary appeared to be relaxed about that, and to some extent I understand his position. Nevertheless, there will be cases in which small businesses lose out because of the pursuit of the marginal 1 per cent. of notional anti-competitive advantage, and which will substantially increase the compliance cost and general hassle of enforcing the legislation.
<P>
At the very least, the Under-Secretary would be well advised to ponder the suggestion that I made on Second Reading, which emanated from Clifford Chance. I said that the arrangements should be brought in carefully and over time. I accept that there are transitional arrangements for some matters, but not for the provision that we are discussing.
<P>
We are worried that the provision will catch small businesses. It will have little effect and, in some cases, it may have a perverse effect. The hon. Member for Eastleigh well deployed the issues that we shall turn to in another context when he referred to the centralised collection of copyright, for example. It will be damaging if that does not happen. The Under-Secretary keeps saying, ``It would happen only if there were an anti-competitive effect and that effect were deemed to be damaging.'' I do not think, however, that the provision will work like that in practice. Only time will tell but, in due modesty, I advise my right hon. and hon. Friends that the Under-Secretary's response was too wooden, insufficiently sensitive to the points that have been made and, frankly, deserves the pressing of our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am disappointed with the Under-Secretary's response. The amendments, especially that tabled by the Liberal Democrats, were tabled in the interests of helping small businesses and of competitiveness. There was nothing underhand about that. They were not tabled to provide loopholes for the less rigourous types of businesses to charge through. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said that 3,000 small firms in his constituency deal with music publishing and copyright.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was quoting a national figure but, in support of what I was saying, I must tell the Committee that there are as many businesses as there are households in the W1 postal district, which is particularly attuned to that industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point.Very small businesses that eke out a living as best they can will be worried whether they are within the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred twice to the music industry. We all know that that is one of the most fiercely competitive businesses in the world. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said that there are as many businesses in his constituency as there are households. That is good. Those are the very elements of competition; they are not elements of anti-competitiveness. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the music industry has nothing to fear--a matter that we shall be referring to later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Under-Secretary made an interesting contribution, which I am sure will read well in the report of our proceedings. However, he did not address the key issue. Honest, small businesses that do not usually find themselves caught up in competition law will be worried whether they are still within the law. They will be forced to take legal advice. Their administrative costs will increase, because they will want to reassure themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) said on Second Reading, there is a danger that the provisions may have a certain perversity. If firms were to merge and set up their own individual collection agreements rather than have a collective agreement because they were worried about the possibility of the monopoly provisions, they might be able to do so without falling foul of the Bill. However, they would reduce the level of dispersion and increase the level of concentration in the number of firms in the music industry. That would neither help small businesses nor the quality of output. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That may or may not be the case. I do not want to labour that point. I am concerned about the effect of the provision on small businesses, given their anxiety to act legally and properly.
<P>
The amount of time and money that may be involved could be significant, and it might affect their very survival. In that context, I am rather disappointed that the Under-Secretary has not shown the same degree of sympathy towards business people with integrity. We are dissatisfied with the Under-Secretary's reply.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have had a good and thorough debate on a large number of important issues. Taken with the subsequent analogue at the beginning of chapter II, clause 2 is the flagship clause of the Bill. It introduces a new concept into British law--that of banning anti-competitive practices. As I said only a few moments ago, the Under-Secretary is standing firm on the mantra that whatever it is, the Government are concerned about it being anti-competitive. We are all concerned about that, but people with that attitude will be acting as judge and jury when deciding whether a company should suffer penalties--with the related possibility of a third party suing if anti-competitive action were demonstrated.
<P>
We have had 40 years of restrictive trade practices legislation. I hold no brief for saying that it was the perfect answer, but we have built up a body of expertise in the subject. That is partly because, through the Office of Fair Trading and the related Monopolies and Mergers Commission, we have tended to operate by exception--on whether cases are found to be wrong.
<P>
We shall not debate again the Second Reading issue-perish the thought--of whether there were excessive delays in the system, but we now face a transformation into a new structure, in which action may or may not immediately be deemed to be anti-competitive. If that happens, penalties and the possibility of suit will follow.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will forgive me for saying so, but my presumption about the normal conduct of most businesses is that they act in good faith; they do their best to carry on their business rather than looking for anti-competitive action. In the past, businesses could be anti-competitive until they were ordered to desist. Under the new arrangements they will be liable for action or inquiry at almost any stage of the process. That may not be wrong. The Under-Secretary will no doubt want to say that his predecessor circulated for consideration a Bill along those lines in respect of anti-competitive action. He may wish to say also that it was consistent with the general principles of European Union articles 85 and 86. We understand that.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments was to point out that in some respects the drafting is not clear. The Minister has not always succeeded in clarifying it. The consequences of the clause may be disproportionate to the benefit gained from the exercise, especially for smaller businesses. There may be insufficient filters to prevent more harm than good from being done. The provisions may not be entirely appropriate to the domestic situation, especially as they are read across from article 85.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary will remember, because it is an instance of the difficulties that we face, his exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire on trade within the United Kingdom, who was right to raise such issues. One specific in the Bill is not the subject of an amendment, but has only just occurred to me. In my experience of Bills, it is possible to read them a hundred times and not notice a point that strikes home on the 101st reading. In this case, I can make no such claim to thoroughness, but I can pray in aid--I am sure that some Labour Members will take an interest, given the source that drew the matter to my attention--the Law Society of Scotland law revision committee on competition matters, which produced evidence at the last moment. It suggests that we should examine how the words ``decision or practice'' are dotted around the clause. Whereas it is easy to measure what is an agreement or an undertaking, what is a decision or a practice is less clear, and it not even consistent through the drafting of the clause.
<P>
The committee also points out that a practice could take place within a single company, which would be more appropriately dealt with under chapter II prohibition, because it would constitute an abuse of dominant power, rather than an agreement between individuals. I mention that only at a late stage; I am sure that the Minister has received those representations and wants to correct them.
<P>
Confusions and complexities remain in the Bill, in particular in this clause, which provides the central prohibition of chapter I. It is in everybody's interest--business, Government, the OFT and the consumer--that the legislation works properly. It is not impertinent or improper for Opposition Members to raise such issues. We do not believe that they have been fully concluded in the debates that have taken place. I ask the Under-Secretary to take those considerations, as I am sure his officials will, to examine the matter again and to have a further sift to see whether further points remain to be resolved.
<P>
When we reach later debates on, for example, vertical exemptions, the Under-Secretary will know that responsible people well outside the Conservative party, who have no axe to grind, either as professionals in competition law or as members of trade associations, still have considerable reservations. He knows that the task force vertical agreements is still considering such matters. They must be worried, teased out and perfected. They have not yet been worried, teased out and perfected.
<P>
We retain considerable reservations about how the clause is drafted. We fear that if it comes into effect in its present form, it will lead to uncovenanted problems for genuine, responsible businesses. With that in mind, I advise my hon. Friends that we cannot support the incorporation of the clause in its present form. I shall therefore advise them to vote against it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall not detain the Committee long. I have had the opportunity to speak to amendments that I tabled, which covered some of the substantive issues that the clause raises. I make no bones about that, even if I may legitimately complain that the Minister failed to respond adequately to some points.
<P>
I want to raise one issue. The Bill seems to have had a long gestation period, particularly regarding chapter I prohibition. The Minister chided Opposition Members because a draft Bill published in August 1996 included a prohibition based on article 85, but it is not necessarily wrong to proceed down the prohibition route. However, we have gone to considerable trouble to mitigate some of the adverse effects of a prohibition so constructed as to make it difficult for businesses to understand how it will be implemented in practice.
<P>
We face a disadvantage now because the provision will become clearer when the guidance from the director general is expounded more fully and when case law builds up over time. However, it may become worse as time goes on as aresult of the drafting, which has incorporated the text of the former article 85 up to and including the references to trade within the United Kingdom--for reasons explained in our earlier debate.
<P>
If the clause were to stand part in its current form, a range of other instances would be relevant, as we saw with amendment No. 38, which is itself inadequate in its current form--regarding the application of penalties, de minimis and turnover issues. A range of issues might add up to some mitigation of the structure of the clause, which might have been handled so much better if the prohibition had been applied to reasonably foreseeable effects rather than to all effects irrespective of whether they could be reasonably foreseen.
<P>
I challenge the Under-Secretary on one point. Lying behind the issue--I do not want to revisit our Second Reading debate but it is relevant to our discussion of the clause--is a Government assumption that going down the route of prohibition in this form will lead to a substantial reduction in anti-competitive activity in the economy as a whole. I hope that they are right and that it does.
<P>
However, the assumption is justified by reference to a general estimate that the welfare loss to the UK economy arising from monopoly or anti-competitive activity is equivalent to about 1 per cent. of GDP-- &#163;8 billion. If business compliance costs rise by &#163;4.5 million to &#163;11 million--or more pessimistically from &#163;7 million to &#163;8 million to &#163;15 million or &#163;16 million on a recurring basis--businesses are sanguine. Even if only a very small proportion of the cost--the &#163;8 billion welfare cost to the UK economy--is avoided, the benefits considerably outweigh the costs. Nevertheless, down that route lie many terrors for individual businesses. We cannot quantify, and have seen no attempt to quantify, the actual impact on anti-competitive activity of the introduction of the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is also difficult to quantify how much of the alleged anti-competitive activity that may be contributing to the 1 per cent. loss of economic welfare will be captured in practice by the Bill? It may be difficult to enforce because of its onerous and wide-ranging provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. This curious regulatory appraisal has been offered to justify the prohibition--as if the scales of justice could possibly operate in that way. On the one side, we have an immense figure and an estimated benefit proportion that is wholly unquantified. On the other side, we have some detailed calculations resting on arguable assumptions, which arrive at figures of fractions of &#163;1 million. Tiny fractions of billions are being compared with millions.
<P>
We have no basis for judging how the measure will work. It would have been so much better if we could have been given further examples. I have hesitated to say because it would have seemed churlish, but I recall when my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry, for Buckingham and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) were members of the Committee for the National Minimum Wage Bill, one of the advantages that we were perfectly willing to acknowledge from the outset was that the notes on clauses were often ampified by reference to examples. There are no references to examples in the notes on clauses for this Bill that give us a fix on how some of its effects will work in practice. Likewise, in the regulatory appraisal and compliance cost assessment, we cannot see where the benefits will come from. They are macro-economic in their estimation, rather than micro-economic in their explanation. It is in the micro economy where the damage will be done, so we should examine the Bill to try to remedy some errors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is peculiarly unfortunate that the notes on clauses are so unhelpful in view of the fact that the Bill has already been through its stages in the House of Lords? One would have thought that something better would have been produced. Does not that lead us into the position of being dependent on an ounce of theory rather than a tonne of practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Some of the exchanges that we have had with the Under-Secretary might have been avoided if the notes on clauses had explained the Bill rather better and had made specific reference to the OFT guidelines or comments by the noble Lord Simon in another place. Things have not happed that way, so we are having to revisit many of these matters in ways that the Under-Secretary regards as vexatious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend was comparing the estimated benefit to the economy, which he suggested was &#163;7.5 billion or &#163;8 billion with the highly precise, but much more nominal figure for compliance costs. Has my hon. Friend noted that on the second page of the compliance costs assessment, which we were helpfully vouchsafed, there is a footnote which states:
<P>

<P>
That is a speck in the ocean. I do not know whether my hon. Friend went through the excercise of calculating the compliance costs on the 30 to 60 firms or, conceivably, 100 to 150 firms in the set of 240. The compliance costs for them would be a much higher figure in percentage terms than that quoted in the footnote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a very good point. Although I referred to a figure of &#163;7.5 billion to &#163;8 billion, the Government acknowledge that the benefit will be a very small proportion of that &#163;8 billion. We do not know what it will be, but the costs are of a definite kind. My right hon. Friend rightly points out that under the chapter II prohibition, the costs will bear on a relatively small set of companies which will undertake a considerable amount of legal activity.
<P>
It is not for me to attempt to revisit the Second Reading-style debate that led to the clause being in this form. I do not depart from the general proposition that we should have a prohibition approach that is based on effects rather than form. With regard to anti-competitive activity, that may well be an advantage in the long run, but it would have been so much better if, rather than proceed as they have, the Government had given ground to reduce compliance costs, to introduce greater certainty and to ensure that those who enter undertakings innocently, not negligently, and without the object of distorting competition, were better protected from penalties and economic disadvantage.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> We have had an interesting debate on clause 2. If I may repeat what I said on Second Reading, we welcome the Bill and the concept of prohibition-led anti-competitive legislation. We have ranged far and wide in trying to clarify a large number of issues, from what constitutes an anti-competitive practice to whether supermarkets should be able to purchase goods for the fashion market and whether one can purchase a car in the United Kingdom for the same price as one can purchase it elsewhere in the European Union. We have received some guidance from the Under-Secretary during today's deliberations on some of those issues--on some more than on others.
<P>
We are less than happy with the protection offered for small businesses, although, in the main, the issues have at least been clarified. I suppose that we must be charitable and hope that practice proves successful. Rather than further delay the Committee, I can sum up by saying so far, almost so good, but no quite good enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> The clause introduces the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, which is defined in subsection (8) as the chapter I prohibition. The new prohibition will prohibit agreements that may affect trade within the United Kingdom and which have the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition.
<P>
The Government firmly believe that the prohibition approach is the right way to address anti-competitive agreements in the modern marketplace. By introducing a prohibition approach, we will be in line with the competition law of many of the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, including the European Union.
<P>
It has been apparent for many years that our existing law is inadequate and burdensome. We heard on Second Reading about the deficiencies of existing law, and consultations carried out by this Government and the previous Government have proved that there is overwhelming support for the replacement of existing restrictive practices legislation. Over the years, Green Papers and White Papers, as well as a draft Bill, have been published. In fact, the policy behind the repeal of that legislation was set out in the White Paper issued by the previous Government, which was published as long ago as 1989. That policy was reaffirmed in the consultation document published in 1996 by the previous Conservative Government, but until now the legislation has not been delivered.
<P>
The changes proposed are long overdue and will greatly improve our competition law. Consumers will get a better deal on price and quality, because firms will be prohibited from entering into anti-competitive agreements at the expense of the consumer.
<P>
Too often, under existing laws, consumers lose out where firms are rigging the markets against them--for example, by getting together to limit choice or raise prices. Extra costs affect all consumers and are a real hardship to those who can least afford them.
<P>
On Second Reading, we heard about the secret cartel between laboratory equipment manufacturers that was recently broken up by the Office of Fair Trading. As the director general said, in the end taxpayers and consumers had to foot the bill for the cartel because it rigged the market against the hospitals and public bodies that it supplied, as well as against its other buyers and competitors.
<P>
Existing law is no longer effective in catching anti-competitive agreements. It provides no real deterrent to firms carrying on anti-competitive agreements or practices, and the procedures to prohibit anti-competitive activity are cumbersome and lengthy. There is no recompense for those adversely affected by anti-competitive conduct, and there are no fines for those who operate anti-competitive agreements. The slap on the wrist, ``don't do it again'' approach is no disincentive to cartels.
<P>
The question of unnecessary burdens on industry resulting from the current regime is rightly raised. The current system has a completely different approach from EC competition law. It imposes unnecessary burdens on businesses, many of which have to comply with the EC regime in any case. It is clearly better to have a system that is compatible with EC rules.
<P>
The current system also catches far too many harmless agreements. Currently, well over 10,000 agreements have to be registered with the Office of Fair Trading, even though they are not significant in terms of competition. Such registrations represent unnecessary work for the authorities--and, of course, for business. The current competition system is characterised also by woefully inadequate powers of investigation.
<P>
Those problems are not only occasional. The director general said recently how frustrated he is that in a number of cases the Office of Fair Trading has had strong suspicions that anti-competitive agreements were operating, but that it had not been able to pursue them effectively because of its lack of investigative powers.
<P>
In some cases, the Office of Fair Trading has received allegations from a whistleblower, but has been unable to proceed because it did not have the power to investigate the matter and obtain the clinching piece of evidence. Other cases involving market distortions have gone unexamined because of the lack of power to gather information. The new regime has great benefits and the prohibition approach in the Bill will put right the defects. Cartel members will be liable to penalties from the very beginning. Other businesses and consumers damaged by anti-competitive behaviour will be able to take court action directly.
<P>
One key difference from the existing regime is that the prohibition looks to the economic effects of an agreement, not its form. That is a far more rational approach. In contrast to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, the new prohibition will therefore not apply to harmless agreements. Looking to the effects of an agreement rather than its form will also cut out the possibility of clever lawyers drafting agreements to get around the competition rules.
<P>
We recognise that an agreement that has restrictive effects on competition can nevertheless have a beneficial effect. The prohibition is therefore to be coupled with a power to allow agreements that fall within the prohibition to be permitted by the competition authorities. We shall discuss exemptions in later clauses. In addition, any agreement exempt from article 85 will be automatically exempt from the new prohibition.
<P>
The new prohibition is modelled closely on article 85 of the EC treaty, which is the European Community prohibition on anti-competitive agreements. We have modelled not only the wording of the prohibition on article 85; clause 60, the governing principles provision, is designed to ensure that, as far as possible, the United Kingdom prohibition is applied consistently with EC competition law. In other words, the UK and the EC prohibitions will follow parallel tracks.
<P>
Adopting the European Commission approach has the virtue of minimising burdens on business. UK businesses whose agreements have the potential to affect trade between member states have lived with EC competition law for more than 25 years. At the moment, such UK firms must first assess their agreements against the competition test of article 85; they must then assess them against the different test of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. That means more bureaucracy and a sort of double jeopardy. Under the Bill, agreements will be assessed against a common prohibition test. Businesses can look to EC jurisprudence to determine how their agreements will be treated under the UK and EC prohibitions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I apologise if I venture on to a subject that we shall deal with later. The Under-Secretary talks about the incorporation of European Community jurisprudence into the application of our competition legislation. Much of the practice of competition authorities inside the European Union is in the form of notifications or decisions from the Commission. Is the Under-Secretary comfortable that, in practice, the OFT will be similarly consistent throughout with the manner in which the European Commission undertakes its activities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> That is a fair point. I believe that the OFT can improve on the system that is working under the Commission. That is why the Commission is especially interested in the Bill.
<P>
I praise the hon. Gentleman for having the courage of his convictions. He began his speech by saying that he did not oppose, in principle, the prohibition approach--how different that is from the approach adopted by the right hon. Member for Wokingham, who opposes the prohibition approach. For that reason, I urge the Committee to listen not to a divided Opposition, but to all the arguments that have united so many people behind the principle of the clause.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (5) Where the Copyright Tribunal has made an order it shall be presumed that the terms of any licence or licensing scheme which complies with such an order does not infringe Chapter I of Part II of this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am pleased to have an opportunity to move this amendment, given that we ran around the course a little earlier, when your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, spared my blushes for being slightly out of order. Nevertheless, we had an opporunity to begin to think about the Bill's effects on copyright within the music industry.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 is important because competition authorities in the United Kingdom and the European Union have consistently recognised the fact that copyright and licensing arrangements that facilitate the authorised use of copyright works are generally in the public interest and that, therefore, they should be permitted to continue. Those arrangements ensure that the creators of musical or other works are paid for the use of the fruits of their creativity. That encourages people into the industry because they know that they are likely to get a reasonable return for their efforts, therefore encouraging investment. They also provide greater consumer choice and encourage growth within the industry.
<P>
I urge the Under-Secretary to remove copyright licensing from the scope of the Bill. That exclusion should be stated in the Bill to ensure certainty and stability and to lessen the administrative and financial burdens that would be placed on the industry.
<P>
New clause 4 is a little more complex, but perhaps more interesting, than the amendment. It deals with special provisions, especially in relation to the Copyright Tribunal. It might be helpful to remind members of the Committee that the tribunal is a statutory body. It was established by the Copyright Act 1956 and, subsequently, its scope of jurisdiction was widened by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The tribunal is not overly busy; six or seven references are made to it each year of which about two proceed to a full hearing--lasting a few days or, in some cases, a few weeks. Its proceedings are regulated by statutory instruments and its decisions are independent, fully reasoned and enforceable by order.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was established with the objective of providing for the regulation of collecting societies and stopping abuse of their monopoly position. Collecting societies are essential to ensure that creators receive a proper reward for the efforts and that there are real benefits for copyright licensees. The tribunal's role can be considered as a reference by a licensee of the terms and conditions of a copyright licensing agreement without the licensee having to resort to the competition authorities. That is the crux of new clause 4.
<P>
Various different control systems operate within the European Union in respect of the licensing of copyright. They vary from complete reliance on competition law to the regulations of certain aspects of collective management of those rights. The existence in the United Kingdom of a Copyright Tribunal specifically for the review of copyright licensing agreements puts United Kingdom rights' owners in the unique position of simultaneous exposure both to competition and to copyright legislation. As a result, the danger is that they are placed at a disadvantage to other European rights' owners.
<P>
Unless rulings on agreements by the Copyright Tribunal are prevented from also being taken to the Competition Commission, copyright owners will be subject to risk and the economic burdens of double jeopardy. For those reasons, I hope that the Under-Secretary will take seriously the intent and the application proposed in new clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Eastleigh. They are an example of the difficulties with the blanket provisions under clause 2. Copyright should be an important matter, not least for members of the Government. We hear much these days about ``Cool Britannia''. I elicited some staggering figures from the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport relating to the impact of the arts industries on our national economy. They demonstrated the importance of the matter; it is an area in which we have distinctive strength, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster knows and which he may wish to outline to the Committee. We must look after the industry.
<P>
There are already provisions for the resolution of such matters under the Copyright Tribunal and we do not want to create a structure of double jeopardy. I support the argument of the hon. Member for Eastleigh and I remind the Under-Secretary that, while the matters were debated in another place on Report and the amendments tabled were unsuccessful, the Government agreed to consider the matter further. We now need the fruits of that reconsideration, and rather better news than we received last time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I rise to support the hon. Member for Eastleigh, not only because of the obvious constituency interest, but because I formerly held the office now held by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and am therefore wholly familiar with the importance of the industry to the national economy. Curiously, for so vibrant and aggressive an industry, there was a mild sense of defensiveness within it. It felt unloved and that its contribution was unrecognised. I should be sorry, especially if the matter is on the cusp and is being reconsidered by the Government, if the Bill were to have a demoralising effect on an industry that employs 160,000 people and is a major advertisement for the country's international talent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> I am pleased that the industry is adding spice to our proceedings. I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Eastleigh said about the importance of the music industry. It is a vibrant sector of the economy that provides a great deal of employment and is greatly appreciated by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and by the country at large. Competition issues arise here as in other sectors of the economy. I see no reason why the issues that arise in the copyright field should not fall to be considered under the prohibitions of the Bill, just as they fall to be considered under articles 85 and 86 of the treaty of Rome. Given that those articles have a direct effect in UK law, including in the Bill the exclusion and special treatment that the hon. Member for Eastleigh proposes would not provide the protection that he intends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Under-Secretary, but I am slightly confused. In my earlier contribution, I attempted to emphasise the risk of double jeopardy of having a well established Copyright Tribunal, to which the industry is answerable, but simultaneously falling foul of European competition law. Will the Minister consider that problem in his remarks?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I certainly intend to address those points directly.
<P>
Agreements made void by article 85 cannot be made valid by an exclusion from the domestic prohibition. I know that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will recognise that. Because of itst international nature, the music industry has a clear impact on inter-member state trade, so article 85 will apply. People will be able to ask the British courts to apply article 85 just as they will be able to ask them to apply the chapter I prohibition.
<P>
One of the strengths of our approach of aligning domestic law with the European model is that someone who has received some comfort under one regime is highly likely to be able to rely on the same degree of comfort under the other regime. In the case of a Community exemption, people will have absolute assurance that the agreement is exempt under clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I want to give the Under-Secretary notice of my question, because I do not think it fair to expect him to answer it off the top of his head. Is it possible for contracting parties to determine in their contracts whether their agreement is susceptible to the treaty or to the Bill? Can they determine the forum? I do not expect an immediate answer, but I should like to receive it before close of play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No, it is not possible
<P>
I should like to lead the Committee back to the assurance that I was giving. There is, of course, an exception to the general position where a person is relying on a Commission statement that inter-state trade is not affected, where the agreement may clearly have anti-competitive effects within the United Kindom. For reasons that I hope I explained clearly earlier, that is less likely to be relevant in the case of the music industry.
<P>
The Copyright Tribunal was referred to during our discussion of new clause 4. Our position on the Copyright Tribunal's general role is that its mere existence does not provide a reason for matters on which it adjudicates to be excluded from the chapter I prohibition. The tribunal's role is to resolve disputes between copyright owners acting collectively and those who wish to use copyright works. That is not the same as enforcing competition law. Moreover, the tribunal adjudicates on aspects of an agreement or potential agreement only in terms of its effect on the parties--specifically, the imposition of unfair terms in licensing agreements--and does not consider any wider anti-competitive effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary, in the spirit of my intervention, can clarify one point. Where there is a dispute between two parties on a copyright issue that would fall within the Copyright Tribunal's remit, it may well be that one of the parties--perhaps the antagonist in the dispute--will seek any means at its disposal to pursue its case. What would happen if it pursued its case both under competition law and with the Copyright Tribunal? Which would be the superior judgment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I see absolutely no reason why the two regimes cannot dovetail, unless for a good and proper reason the Director General of Fair Trading or a court were to intervene. The courts and other judicial authorities are, of course, well used to receiving frivolous or vexatious complaints, and to giving them short shrift.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> This is a serious point, and I appreciate that the Under-Secretary is trying to respond to it in good faith. Where there are two separate avenues for carrying forward a dispute, what happens if the Copyright Tribunal finds for one party and, under competition law, a court finds for the other?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The Copyright Tribunal is obliged to consider the implications of article 85. It therefore should not go out of its way to find contrary to both the spirit and the letter of article 85 and to the prohibition that we are introducing into our regime. I am sure that it will be able to liaise well with the director general in that regard.
<P>
The director general's office has indicated that he intends to deal very robustly with any vexatious complaints. Furthermore, where there is a private dispute in an area that is within the jurisdiction of another body capable of providing an adequate remedy, he would expect the aggrieved party vigorously to pursue the remedy with that body before considering a complaint on wider competition grounds under the Bill. An example of that would be the role of the Copyright Tribunal in dealing with the imposition of unfair terms in copyright licensing.
<P>
Of course, the director general would then pursue a complaint only if he thought that there would be merit in it. He would be able to use his powers of investigation only if he had a reasonable suspicion that a prohibition was being infringed--as clause 26 provides. In any case, the exclusion would be likely to be nugatory, given the applicability of article 85.
<P>
In conclusion, where a particular issue has been properly and fully addressed by the responsible authority, it is difficult to see what role there would be for competition law to reach a different conclusion, or even to be prayed in aid of a different conclusion. Therefore, the only cases in which there is any likelihood of the director general or a court taking action are those in which a particular agreement or class of agreement gives rise to wider competition concerns that are not in the remit of the copyright tribunal. I see no reason for not enforcing competition law in those circumstances and I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Under-Secretary has come to the Committee with a detailed and extensive brief in answer to what I had assumed were straightforward and simple amendments. It would be appropriate for me to have the opportunity to study his written text in detail before deciding whether he has sufficiently dealt with my concerns. Therefore, I should like to withdraw the amendments and possibly return to them later.
<P>

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 2, line 42, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Chapter I prohibition does not apply--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to agreements constituting trade associations, or<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to vertical agreements in being prior to the coming into force of this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 63, in schedule 1, page 43, line 46, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Trade Associations 5A. Agreements constituting trade associations which appear to the Director to represent 50 per cent. or more of a given sector shall be treated as if they were designated professional rules within the meaning of Schedule 4.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment relates to possible exclusions under clause 3. My hon. Friends and I hope for better luck this time than previously. Despite our respect for the hon. Member for Eastleigh, it appears to us that the Government have been regressing in their attitude and that their interpretations of what is intended under the provisions on anti-competitive practices have been growing more rigid.
<P>
Two particular public interests arise under the provision that we are considering. They are not quite motherhood and apple pie, but they are serious aspects of the commercial scene and it would be perverse indeed of the Government to try to subvert them.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 59 and 63 would exclude trade associations from the Bill. No doubt if there were evidence that a trade association had been established for the specific purpose of frustrating competition, the director general would be able to intervene. However, in the absence of such evidence, and in view of the general practice of trade associations, it seems indefensible to subject them to the provisions of clause 2 that we have established--to our satisfaction, if not the Committee's--will be unduly onerous.
<P>
The Government, like their predecessor, are strongly committed to the establishment of responsible trade associations. We all know that those are important in managing their members' interests in trade matters. They also raise professional standards in the trade and provide members with information to benefit them in the conduct of their commercial operations. Trade associations are a good thing, and I expect that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have argued on occasion that they should have public law status, and an enhanced role, as they have in some continental countries. We need not debate that tonight, but they are an important part of the scene--yet they may be caught by the provision.
<P>
The Under-Secretary will reply--I can, metaphorically, already read his brief--``We shall resist the amendment, because trade associations will be caught by the provision only to the extent that their activities are anti-competitive.'' However, we question whether they should be caught at all. Amendment No. 59 raises that question. Amendment No. 63 would cover trade associations that in the director general's judgment--which should be easily determinable--represented 50 per cent. or more of a given sector. We are not arguing expressly for public law status but that trade association rules should be treated as designated professional rules within the meaning of schedule 4. The Government have already provided for exclusion in schedule 4. That is all that I propose to say tonight about trade associations. I do not want to underplay the importance of getting the provisions about them right and we will listen carefully to the Under-Secretary's response.
<P>
However, it is even more important for the Under-Secretary to reflect on vertical agreements. He should not have to go too far back historically to understand the situation. I hope that his perusal of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 and schedule 3 thereof will have been more comprehensive than mine. Even if it has been cursory, he will know that the schedule excludes a vast number of vertical agreements--for example, exclusive distribution agreements and licences for intellectual property, which are now even more important than they were in the 1950s. Those were excluded in the 1956 Act on the basis that they were largely pro-competitive. To put it another way, they are the stuff of commerce in this country.
<P>
Horizontal agreements are one matter, but vertical agreements are another. Companies competing in parallel trades may well be directly competitive with one another and there may be an interest in securing their continued competition. But where a company is part of a chain of production and the links in the chain are affected by several vertical agreements--such as exclusive distribution, intellectual property or other sorts of licence--the efficient production of goods or delivery of services is facilitated. Such a company is not necessarily anti-competitive or harmful to the economy.
<P>
Given that the Bill will repeal the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, there is a prima facie presumption that such arrangements, unless specifically excluded, would fall under the chapter I prohibition. I do not suppose that the Under-Secretary would want to cavil at that. The Government have already agreed in principle that restrictions on vertical agreements should be excluded from the chapter I prohibition, but they have not yet formulated a policy on how to achieve it.
<P>
Reference has already been made in Committee to the presence--in the Under-Secretary's elegant description--of some of the usual suspects on the National Minimum Wage Bill as well as on this one. While we used to ask where is the Ark Royal, we can go further because the question is now, where is the task force? A task force is now charged by the Under-Secretary with the specific purpose of finding a solution to the problem of excluding vertical agreements from the scope of the chapter I prohibition in order to avoid the burden of unnecessary notification, without creating at the same time a loophole for seriously anti-competitive agreements.
<P>
Evidence from consideration in another place shows that the task force was continuing to work; but we do not know whether it reached a conclusion. Both sides of the Committee accept that agreements are important and that in principle they could be caught under the chapter I prohibition. It also agreed that the situation is undesirable and that something should be done about it; but that something remains as yet uncertain.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 59 is to secure exemption. It may not do so because the Under-Secretary does not want it to. If the Under-Secretary agrees with us so far, he must provide an answer that exempts vertical agreements. It is not a trivial matter; it is not a case of a few hypothetical examples dragged up by an Opposition who are anxious to prolong consideration of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is persuasive, although his efforts to persuade should be unnecessary. Last August, the President of the Board of Trade said that she saw a good case for excluding most vertical agreements from the Bill. Sadly, that statement is still not matched by action. However, in the light of her statement, the Under-Secretary should support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Precisely so--my hon. Friend makes the point well. We all support the same objective. We wait with bated breath for the Government to fulfil their undertaking to find a way of achieving it, and for the details of that undertaking. We hope that when we have debated the amendment, we will be wiser and better informed, and modestly encouraged by the Government's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Griffiths:</B> There are clear reasons for not including in the Bill the words that the amendment proposes. They pose a threat to fair competition. We shall set up a regime to identify and tackle abusive conduct and agreements that affect competition. Trade associations do not need to worry about the prohibition unless they engage in such agreements or practices. The blanket exclusion that the amendment proposes could be dangerous because it would exclude trade associations that acted as price-fixing cartels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> How would a trade association that had acted innocently know that it had fulfilled the provisions of clause 2 without following an extremely onerous procedure?
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland has produced a draft document, which, as I am sure it would be the first to concede, is imperfect, but that at least excludes vertical agreements--by extension, that can be applied to trade associations--unless they engage in anti-competitive action. Is it possible to clarify matters to make it easier for trade associations to achieve the Government's aim, without going the whole hog, and jump the hurdles of clause 2?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks how trade associations would know whether they had fulfilled the provisions of clause 2. Article 85 has applied to the United Kingdom for more than 25 years. During that time, trade associations have lived with EC competition law with no special treatment. The hon. Gentleman fails to make the case for special treatment.
<P>
Trade associations perform many useful functions, but they have sometimes caused serious anti-competitive harm. Let us take the example of the EC case of IFTRA rules on glass containers. The Commission condemned rules of a glass manufacturers' association, which included an obligation on members not to offer discounts and a term providing for the charging of uniform delivered prices. That is a clear case of anti-competitive harm and one which the Commission moved to tackle. It in no way contradicts the value that trade associations can provide to the community. To exempt them completely would overturn the decision that was taken on glass containers when the glass manufacturers' association was shown to be acting extremely anti-competitively. Is that what the hon. Member for Daventry is sanctioning?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way again. He has cited a European Court case, which presumably relates to trade between member states, or the exclusion of the possibility of trade between member states through cartelisation. Will he give the Committee an example of a similar case of wrongdoing by a trade association in the United Kingdom in relation to its domestic trade? That is what our amendment is about, as is the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> The issue is not whether or not there has been a case. If it did happen under domestic law, the present laws would be insufficient to tackle it. Under the regime that we are introducing, any similar abuse by a trade association can be tackled. It is a tribute to British trade associations that I cannot think of an example. They have lived with European competition law when trading overseas, and many glass manufacturers, based in the UK, are successful overseas, and have not been caught. They know what the rules are and they abide by them. A blanket exemption for all trade associations, even if one of them chooses to adopt anti-competitive behaviour, is not merited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Can the Under-Secretary offer a guarantee that none of the existing trade associations by their constitution have as their object or effect any distortion of competition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> If there is anti-competitive behaviour, that guarantee cannot be given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am doubly grateful to the Minister. Does he agree that every trade association will need to employ lawyers to discover whether its constitution is such that in practice it has as its object or effect distortion of competition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Many trade associations operate multinationally, so they have checked whether they comply. There is no reason why the trade associations, provided that they are not indulging in anti-competitive behaviour, cannot comply at present. I do not think that that can be achieved only at the high cost of employing lawyers. Anti-competitive harm can be caused, as we have seen, but Britain does not have a history of trade associations causing such harm. The amendment should be rejected so that a loophole is not opened up for a trade association to indulge in anti-competitive behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I did not catch the precise acronym of the glass manufacturers' association, but I suspect that it started with the initial ``I'', so was presumably international. I realise that it may have had British members, but can the Under-Secretary say what proportion of domestic, British, non-international trade associations operate internationally?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> No, I do not have that exact information, but I will ensure that the right hon. Gentleman receives it. There is no case for treating favourably any trade association that indulges in anti-competitive behaviour. That would be the exact impact of the amendment. All we want to do is to ensure that British trade associations receive no special treatment at a domestic level given that they have comfortably accommodated article 85 at the European level for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My question was not about that matter. The Under-Secretary was dismissing the possibility of a compliance cost falling on British trade associations because of the provision's inclusion in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I dismissed no such thing. The importance of the clause is that it will ensure that consumers and any victim of anti-competitive practice are treated fairly. The right hon. Gentleman seems to want to put trade associations on a pedestal and give them blanket exemption because he is worried that a trade association that thinks it might be indulging in anti-competitive practices might need to consult a lawyer. I cannot give him the assurance that he seeks.
<P>
The very many honest traders and the vast majority of people in trade associations have managed to operate under article 85 rules. If people have not been operating under those rules, they will have no difficulty in doing so because the vast majority are not out to perpetuate anti-competitive behaviour. That is the criticial point.
<P>
If the right hon. Gentleman wants to put trade associations on a pedestal and if the Opposition want them to be given a blanket exemption, so be it, but they will receive no support from the Government. Indeed, the Opposition are divided about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Under-Secretary has said that he did not exclude the possibility of trade associations coming under clause 2. He also said that he could not guarantee that they would not do so. He said finally that he was not dismissing the suggestion of compliance costs falling on trade associations. Will he tell the Committee what sum was allowed in the compliance cost assessment for the non-recurring compliance costs of trade associations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee. I think that he was out of the Room when I was misquoted earlier. I did not mention the exclusion of trade associations as being a non-cost item. I said that, if they were unsure about whether they fell within the chapter I prohibition, it was, of course, not unreasonable for them to seek legal advice if they thought that they were indulging in anti-competitive behaviour.
<P>
The philosophy of the Opposition seems to be that no costs are justified--which appears to be the amendment's impact--that trade associations should be exempted, and that any unscrupulous trade association should be allowed to carry on anti-competitive practices with complete immunity in the United Kingdom. If that is the position of the hon. Member for West Dorset--it is in keeping with some of his philosophy--so be it, but the Government will not go along with it.
<P>
We have published the compliance costs, and they have been studied. The hon. Gentleman was not here when the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster quoted from the compliance cost assessment. I urge the hon. Gentleman to read the assessment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Unfortunately, whenever the Under-Secretary gets into difficulty he--like the Minister of State--tends to substitute bluster for a coherent response to argument. The Under-Secretary must understand that if businesses are uncertain of whether they will fall foul of the legislation, it will be as a result of the Bill. We do not say that there should be no cost, but it is incumbent on the Under-Secretary to give some estimate of what that cost is likely to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I can only repeat that we have published compliance cost estimates. By backing the amendment, the hon. Gentleman seeks globally to exempt UK trade associations without any consideration of anti-competitive behaviour, or of its impact on other companies and on consumers. I bet you, Mr. Atkinson, that the hon. Gentleman has made no assessment of the cost of that, becuase he simply does not care about it.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that we are all aware that a compliance cost assessment requires a frame of reference and a computation of the cost to the parties who fall within that framework. Unless I misheard him or was momentarily distracted, we have not yet been able to prise from the Under-Secretary whether trade associations were included in that framework. If he does not know or cannot give the Committee an answer, it will shake the whole basis of the compliance cost assessment, because we shall not know whether other sectors of industry--those falling foul of vertical agreements, particular sectors such as agriculture--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Under-Secretary is getting a note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is why I am giving him time to answer.
<P>
It is important that the Committee should know. We cannot have a compliance cost assessment that amounts to a guestimate. We must know which companies have been looked at, and whether a reasonable view has been taken of whether certain categories should be excluded. The Under-Secretary should be able to tell us whether that has happened and, of those companies that were included, what proportion of them are likely to fall foul of the system. That is the substance of the concerns that we expressed on clause 2, and we shall continue to express them on clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> As I said earlier, I am unaware of any anti-competitive agreements that have been entered into by UK trade associations. Compliance costs are therefore likely to be minimal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> As I understand it, the compliance cost rests upon the number of agreements that have been notified under the RTPA. That is carried forward into assumptions about the compliance cost under the new regime. The question then is how many agreements, if any, have been notified to the Director General of Fair Trading under the RTPA and how many trade associations operate wholly within the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the Minister to answer that question, I ask hon. Members to keep interventions short.
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I imagine that trade associations, among the 10,000 agreements that have been registered under the RTPA will have cost business an enormous burden. In 1989 there was a bipartisan willingness to tackle that problem, but the Opposition seem now not to agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> I want to make some progress, but I am in no hurry. The evening is young.
<P>
It is vital that any special treatment for vertical agreements should avoid the risk of preventing action against those with strongly anti-competitive effects, which would otherwise be a burden on their competitors and on consumers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his indulgence in giving way. Will he answer one simple question? What did the President of the Board of Trade mean last August when she said that she saw a good case for excluding most vertical agreements from the scope of the Bill? That statement implied positive action by the Government to secure their exclusion. What did the Under-Secretary understand the right hon. Lady to mean then, and has she changed her mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Griffiths:</B> My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade was clear; she--and the Government--believe that there is merit in granting special treatment to vertical agreements if it is practicable to do so. As the hon. Gentleman knows, a task force comprising the Confederation of British Industry, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading is looking at that difficult question. It is quite wrong for the Opposition to try to foist on us a two-stage regime. Indeed, it is a double regime. Under amendment No. 63, one set of vertical agreements--those in being before the coming into force of the Act--would be treated in one way, and a new set of vertical agreements would be treated differently. We would end up with two regimes. I doubt whether Opposition Members believe that there are strong merits in that. That being so, I urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 59 and 63.
