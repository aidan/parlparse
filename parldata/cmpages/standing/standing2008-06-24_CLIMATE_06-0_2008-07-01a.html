<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000683"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Clause 14 places a duty on the Prime Minister to
put together a report setting out proposals and policies for meeting
the carbon budget. However, the existing proposal is not robust enough.
The Prime Minister should be able to tell Parliament not only what we
should be doing to meet the budgets, but, crucially, how we should do
it. That is an important difference. Rather than merely producing a
report, it would show far greater leadership if the Prime Minister were
to set out a detailed climate change strategy on how the Government are
going to meet those demanding
targets.</div><a name="08070215000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prime Minister should not merely report on the progress made in the
past and display a map of where we need to go. They should lead on how
we will meet our targets in future. The reporting procedures in the
Bill will not be complete unless they include a duty for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>the annual reports to contain an assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce carbon emissions. The
amendments would require that the statement laid before Parliament
should include a comprehensive report on the effectiveness of the
climate change strategy as well as details of any further policies or
proposals that may need to be included. Government policies to reduce
emissions should be assessed regularly, their successes should be
reported on openly and changes should be proposed wherever progress is
falling
short.</div><a name="08070215000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am quite up front in saying that we in the Conservative party fully
intend to be the Government responsible for the report on the first
budgetary period, so we should be holding ourselves to the highest
standards of accountability in meeting those targets. I consider the
strategy report to be like the annual finance Budget. The Chancellor
proposes a tax and spending regime for a year and says that he will
bring in x billion pounds in taxation and spend y billion pounds on
providing services. However, it is inevitable that in the following
year the Chancellor will find that growth was not exactly as predicted
or that events caused a little bit more spending than proposed, so in
the next Budget he will therefore make the necessary adjustments to get
things back on track. If we are to bring carbon emissions under
control, that is how we should deal with
them.</div><a name="08070215000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is precedent for placing a duty on the Government to produce such a
strategy report. For example, section 2(1) of the Warm Homes
and Energy Conservation Act 2000 places a duty on Ministers
to</div><a name="08070215000592"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prepare
and publish...a strategy setting out the authority&#146;s
policies for ensuring...that as far as reasonably practicable
persons do not live in fuel
poverty.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
2(5) requires Ministers
to</div><a name="08070215000593"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take
such steps as are in its opinion necessary to implement the
strategy.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also precedent for requesting a detailed report or proposal.
Schedule 5 to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and
schedule 89 to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 both require
the submission of detailed proposals. The requirement for a detailed
report already exists in regulation 32 of the Ionising Radiation
Regulations
1999.</div><a name="08070215000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
specific reference to amendment No. 47, as we have already discussed,
it would make eminently good sense to set out indicative annual ranges
in this detailed strategy report. The strategy report should be the
natural and authoritative place for the Government to publish their
indicative annual ranges.</div>
<a name="08070215000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000684"></a>The
Minister for the Environment (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
I thank the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle for laying out his
amendment, which, if I have understood him correctly, would replace the
words &#147;report setting out&#148; with</div>
<a name="08070215000594"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;strategy report
setting out the
measures&#148;.</div><a name="08070215000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
amendments would replace the word &#147;report&#148; with
&#147;climate change strategy&#148;, so I am glad to see that he
has adopted the language of new Labour, although I prefer plain
English, especially in relation to legislation.</div>
<a name="08070215000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has made a serious point, however, so let me respond. I
shall deal with amendment No. 47 separately, as you have asked us to,
Mr. Cook, but amendments Nos. 46, 48, 49, 50 and 51 would
change the wording to a &#147;climate change strategy&#148; setting
out measures, proposals and policies. The practical effect of the
amendments would be negligible. The only possible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>problem with them is that the report will cover
measures to reduce emissions only and will not cover adaptation to
climate change. There might be a point to calling the report a climate
change strategy, but equally it might be
misleading.</div><a name="08070215000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report published under clause 14 plays an important part in the greater
predictability provided by the Bill&#146;s framework. We all agree
that those who are planning investments want to know not only the
overall level of the UK-wide budget, but the choice of policies that
will be implemented. The report will be crucial in bringing together
policies and showing how they will combine to meet the carbon budgets.
In that context, we cannot see what amendment No. 46 and amendments
Nos. 48 to 51 would achieve. The report required under clause 14 will
already have a high status, which has been further emphasised by the
Chancellor&#146;s announcement that the Government&#146;s plans for
meeting the first three carbon budgets will be set out alongside the
Budget
2009.</div><a name="08070215000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not clear how calling the report a strategy or requiring it to
contain measures in addition to proposals and policies will
fundamentally change its nature. In addition, calling it a climate
change strategy might be misleading, as the report will cover
mitigation only&#151;measures to reduce emissions. It will not cover
adaptation to climate change, which will be dealt with by the
Government&#146;s adaptation programme in clause 56. Of course, I
agree with the hon. Gentleman that the report will be an important
document, but the amendments are unnecessary. I shall stop there,
because I think that amendment No. 47 will be dealt with
separately.</div>
<a name="08070215000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000685"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. For clarification, amendment No. 47 is
part of the group of
amendments.</div><a name="08070215000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000686"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Amendment No. 47 is similar to amendment No. 54,
which we have already dealt with. Amendment No. 54 would have turned
the annual indicative range into a range within which the net carbon
account &#147;must&#148; fall, and colleagues will remember that
debate from this morning. Amendment No. 47 would give rise to the same
problems: as before, the annual net UK carbon account for any one given
year could be outside the range but the budget could still be met.
Alternatively, for one year we could be within the range, but still
exceed the budget as a whole. The intention behind the indicative
annual range is to provide an indication of what is expected to happen
within each year of the budget based on the proposals and policies.
Therefore, while I welcome the intention behind the amendments, I do
not believe that they are
necessary.</div><a name="08070215000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000687"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> We believe that there is more to a strategy than
to a report. A report could be a very staid, brief and backward-looking
document, whereas a strategy must be exactly that. I take on board what
the Minister has said and note his reluctance, and I will consider the
matter further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="08070215000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000688"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in
clause 14, page 7, line 29, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The report
must outline the implications of the proposals and policies as regards
the crediting of carbon units to the net UK carbon account for each
budgetary period covered by the report.&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div><a name="08070215000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important part of the package of Government amendments. It relates to
the balance between action to reduce emissions in the UK, action at
European Union level&#151;by UK companies through the European Union
emissions trading scheme for example&#151;and the purchase of
international carbon units. Clause 25, which was a change made in the
other place, seeks to ensure the correct balance by placing a limit on
the contribution that action at EU and international level can make
towards our carbon budget. We will come to that clause later.</div>
<a name="08070215000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government do not believe that an inflexible limit is the best way to
approach the issue. However, we recognise that the balance between
action at UK, EU and international levels is extremely important. The
Bill helps us to achieve that by providing a clear framework for action
and ensuring greater clarity for industry and households about our path
towards a low-carbon economy. We must send a clear signal to our
international partners about our commitment in the UK to tackling
climate
change.</div><a name="08070215000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 8 will add to existing provisions in clause 34 by increasing
transparency. Clause 34 already requires the Committee on Climate
Change, as part of its advice on each of the five-year carbon budgets,
to advise on the extent to which the carbon budget should be met by
action within the UK and the use of carbon units. The amendment goes
even further; clause 14 requires the Government to lay a report before
Parliament setting out proposals and policies for meeting the carbon
budget. Amendment No. 8 means that that report must also set out the
implications of those proposals and policies with regard to the
relative balance between action to reduce emissions within the UK and
the purchase of carbon units, which hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee have asked
for.</div><a name="08070215000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, the report could include information on the role of the
emissions trading scheme in helping to meet our budgets or detail the
Government&#146;s broad expectations for the purchase of carbon units
through EU or international trading mechanisms that may come about in
the future. We want to keep the balance between action at UK, European
Union and wider international levels under review, and, if necessary,
we will revisit our approach ahead of each budgetary
period.</div>
<a name="08070215000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000689"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): The Minister has said that the
report will reflect what happens in the EU ETS. Businesses are the
bodies that buy and sell the credits, and the Government want 100 per
cent. tradability. Therefore, if a business exceeds its carbon quota
and buys credits to offset that, the net effect will be nil. Given the
Government&#146;s world view, where there is no cap on the percentage
that can come from overseas, the number will always be the same. In
what sense will information be conveyed in the report, when we know in
advance what the answer will be because the ETS cap is fixed in
advance?</div><a name="08070215000632"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000690"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is a good question. The hon. Gentleman has
said that we want 100 per cent., but we do not&#151;we want
flexibility for 100 per cent. We will have this debate later, but, in
practice, one has to achieve a balance between UK domestic emissions
capping 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>and what is available for offsetting overseas. I do
not want him to leave this debate thinking that we want 100 per cent.,
as we do not. We want to get the balance right. The simple point in
what I have just said, which I want to emphasise, is that we want
flexibility. I believe that the hon. Gentleman agrees with
me&#151;Members of his party in the other place
did.</div><a name="08070215000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the amendment helps to provide the clarity for which
business and others have been calling. Incidentally, for maximum
transparency, the report in clause 14 to which the hon. Gentleman has
referred must be laid before Parliament at the same time as each budget
is set, which is a point that we probed during consideration of an
earlier
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000691"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> We have not reached the vitally important issue of
using overseas carbon credits in Committee, but I have no doubt that it
will be an extremely important and engaging discussion when we do. My
party is strongly of the opinion that if we are to secure first-mover
advantage in the new low-carbon economy, it is vital that the UK
focuses its investment here in Britain, facilitating dynamic industrial
change in our economy, rather than through a trading system that would
involve the majority of the money going overseas. We certainly need to
do that if we are to develop the skills, jobs and technologies to make
Britain a truly green economy, but I shall save that debate for another
sitting.</div><a name="08070215000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will support Government amendment No. 8. Whatever their designs may be
towards the distribution of domestic versus international carbon
reductions&#151;we all have different views on the exact
distribution&#151;it is certainly in the best interests of all
concerned and of the Bill that the implications of carbon trading are
examined and included in the strategy

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000694"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We come to the detail of the Bill, and I suspect
that there will be a robust debate.</div>
<a name="08070215000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000695"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Oh.</div><a name="08070215000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000696"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Robust, not long, Mr. Cook. There is no
reason why the debate cannot be short. The arguments have been
rehearsed in the other place and during pre-legislative scrutiny. The
Liberal Democrats have long campaigned for the existence of
pre-legislative scrutiny. I have never seen a correlation between the
amount of time spent on such scrutiny and the amount of time spent in
Public Bill Committee, but I live in
hope.</div><a name="08070215000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 6 and 7 aim to clarify the Bill&#146;s language,
while also working, of course, within the spirit and the intent of the
amendments made in the other place. They
replace</div><a name="08070215000595"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;international
passenger travel and imports or exports of
goods&#148;</div><a name="08070215000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">with</div><a name="08070215000596"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;international
aviation or international shipping&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070215000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me explain
why.</div>
<a name="08070215000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">As amendment
No. 82 recognises, one possible way of defining these emissions is by
reference to &#147;the transport of passengers or goods&#148;.
However, there are, of course, other ways&#151;I argue better
ways&#151;to define those emissions, which we do not want to rule out
inadvertently. That is why I want to revert to the broader language
of</div><a name="08070215000597"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;international
aviation or international
shipping&#148;,</div><a name="08070215000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is established terminology within the United Nations and the European
Union, as the right hon. Members for Suffolk, Coastal and for Penrith
and The Border will, I hope,
recognise.</div><a name="08070215000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the proposed clause 30(2) gives the Secretary of State the power
to:</div><a name="08070215000598"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;define
what is to be regarded...as international aviation or
international
shipping.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
power was originally part of the Bill, but it was removed in the other
place. It is a useful supplementary part of the Bill&#146;s
framework. It allows us to clarify what we are talking about when we
refer
to:</div><a name="08070215000599"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;international
aviation or international shipping&#148;</div>
<a name="08070215000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">emissions, and to
update that definition as necessary. For instance, and this is a very
important point, the definition would be updated if there were&#151;I
hope and expect that there will be&#151;an international agreement on
how to allocate emissions to individual countries.</div>
<a name="08070215000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
other place set a deadline of within five years of Royal Assent for the
Secretary of State either to include international aviation and
shipping emissions in the UK&#146;s targets under the Bill or to
explain to Parliament why that has not been done; it was an opt-out
rather than an opt-in, if I can put it that way. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>Given the importance of securing international agreement on those
issues, we remain concerned that setting an arbitrary deadline risks
being perceived negatively by our international partners.
However&#151;I look to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North at
this point&#151;given the strength of feeling in the other place and
elsewhere on this issue, the Government are prepared to accept the duty
to act within five years, either by including those emissions in our
targets or by reporting to Parliament to explain why that was not
possible&#151;in other words, the opt-out rather than the
opt-in.</div>
<a name="08070215000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may, let
me briefly set out what clause 30(4) does, as amendment No. 81 would
remove it. We believe that it is necessary, because it clarifies that
the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to make or amend regulations on
this issue does not end once the five-year period from Royal Assent has
elapsed. It ensures that the Secretary of State can still make
regulations or amend regulations that have already been
made.</div><a name="08070215000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
after, say, eight years, there was international agreement on a
different way of allocating emissions between countries, which does not
preclude an international agreement before that time, clause 30(4)
would allow us to amend our regulations to reflect that agreement, but
only after an affirmative vote in both Houses. Alternatively, if we
wanted to make some minor and technical changes to our existing
regulations, as is bound to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050,
clause 30(4) clarifies that that is possible.</div>
<a name="08070215000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me also
briefly set out the three key reasons why the Government feel that we
cannot set a date for including those emissions. First and most
importantly, we all agree that these are global issues and that a
global solution would be the best way forward. Let me reassure the
Committee that the United Kingdom is at the forefront of international
discussions and proposals to address that point. We are also starting
to see progress with both the International Civil Aviation Organisation
and the International Maritime Organisation in the United Nations
talks. Indeed, it was my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State who
successfully proposed at European Union level that aviation and
shipping be included within the targets. If we are to succeed, we will
need to persuade other countries that there is no hidden agenda and
that we are not trying to force something on them now for narrow
economic or political reasons. What we are trying to do is forge a
global solution in the best interests of the international community as
a whole, recognising that we are talking about global emissions that
affect our domestic circumstances and not the other way around. That
will be made much more difficult if we have a domestic deadline for
deciding what the UK&#146;s fair share
is.</div><a name="08070215000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members know, there are several possible ways of splitting
emissions between countries. For some countries, the methods provide
radically different answers. Independent analysis carried out for the
Government that examined different methods found, for instance, that
one of the models gave Belgium, a distinctly trading nation, more than
29 times as many emissions as under the other model. Denmark got more
than five times as many, while Sweden got less than half. Such
differences carry huge potential economic
implications.</div><a name="08070215000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not simply a case of picking the right methodology. Suppose in 2011
or 2012 we were nearing international agreement, with the UK playing a
leading role in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>discussions. Then, for entirely domestic reasons, we were forced to
choose a particular methodology for calculating the UK&#146;s
emissions for &#147;international aviation and shipping&#148;. How
would that go down with our partners? Would that not give ammunition to
those states&#151;there are many&#151;that do not want to see
progress on the issue. They could say that we, the UK, were driven not
by genuine desire for global agreement but by domestic
concerns.</div><a name="08070215000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
it is not impossible that we could reach international agreement
through the United Nations framework convention on climate change, the
IMO or the ICAO. The best way to deal with international aviation or
shipping emissions is through a sectoral approach&#151;my personal
view is that that is the most likely outcome&#151;rather than
allocating emissions to individual countries. In fact, that is one of
the proposals that we are already discussing. We are already starting
to see it at the European Union level, where it is likely that under
the ETS aviation emissions will be allocated to airlines rather than to
individual member states. Once in the EU ETS, aviation emissions will
be capped, and any increase will have to be met by reductions
elsewhere. Any reduction in aviation emissions would simply lead to
emissions going up somewhere else, which is how emissions trading
works.</div><a name="08070215000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000697"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): What is the most optimistic

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000698"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The honest answer to that question is by December
2009. There is pressure for an agreement&#151;remember that all
countries are facing the issue, but what is important is that it is
part of the UNFCCC. However, I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point&#151;the bottle-half-full approach may be seen to guarantee
that we are not dependent on international agreements, but I will come
to my arguments against that in a
moment.</div><a name="08070215000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000699"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Before the Minister leaves that point, I have a
concern with that approach. If the emissions attach to the airlines,
then the airlines would be penalised by passing through a European
Union airport. International flights could simply bypass the European
Union, which could penalise our competitiveness. That has been put to
us by the
CBI.</div><a name="08070215000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000700"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Lady is right. That is the issue with an
international agreement. That is the ultimate interdependency. Just as
I have argued that a global agreement is the best option, the next best
option is a European Union agreement and after that national
definitions, which I believe would cause all sorts of
problems.</div><a name="08070215000633"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="08070215000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
point out that today my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government has outlined the agreements by local
authorities on their performance indicators. Many of those local
authorities&#151;across the political spectrum, I am delighted to
say&#151;have adopted the CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions target within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>their area. How are we to allocate them? Are we to say to Hillingdon,
because it is the host to Heathrow airport, that all the emissions
resulting from the economic of the airport should be assigned to
Hillingdon borough
council?</div><a name="08070215000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall choose a better example relating to my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test. Will all the shipping in and out of Southampton be
ascribed to Southampton city council? I can see arguments in favour of
that, but it would be unfair to the people of Southampton. It is not a
trite point; it is an important one. We all want an international
agreement, but it is a question of how one defines where the emissions
should be allocated. The Government are not trying to duck that. The
essence of our policy is that all emissions should be based on science,
and I cannot argue for carbon markets or for a cap-and-trade system
unless I argue for science. It is a matter of how we
allocate.</div><a name="08070215000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no guarantee that it is possible to calculate what is a UK emission,
or the emissions of any other individual countries. Surely what matters
is what action is taken to tackle the contribution that the aviation
and shipping sectors make to climate change. It does not matter to me
whether that action is taken at national, European or international
level. Of course, we have a leadership role, which the
Government&#146;s proposals recognise, but working towards that
agreement should be our priority. We must recognise that what we agree
internationally could be completely incompatible with national
emissions targets, so we should not prejudge that issue
now.</div><a name="08070215000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
conclude my remarks by saying that, as was recognised in the other
place, these issues are very complex, but more importantly, they are
very significant. We have already said that with respect to
international aviation emissions, we expect to take a decision on
whether to include those emissions in our targets well before 2013. We
have already asked the Committee on Climate Change to look at that as
part of its first task.</div>
<a name="08070215000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
significant practical questions. That is why, for instance, the
Committee&#146;s work plan, which is available publicly on the
Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs website,
states:</div><a name="08070215000600"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
possible answer is that it may be much easier if attempted at EU rather
than national
level.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, what is the UK share of emissions? How would that work
alongside aviation&#146;s current inclusion in the EU ETS? Would one
have two systems running alongside each other, and if so, how would
that
work?</div><a name="08070215000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shipping
is an even more complex question. Neither I nor the Government are
trying to duck the issues. Ships can go for many months without
refuelling, and they can also take on fuel from tankers in
international waters. Based on fuel sold within the UK, shipping
emissions have declined over the past 10 years. By any other measure,
however, shipping in and out of the UK has increased over that period,
so how does one account for
that?</div><a name="08070215000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
especially if we are acting alone, what of the risk of perverse
impacts, which hon. Members often point out when they scrutinise Bills?
What of the problems such as planes and ships filling up elsewhere and
arriving with a heavier fuel load, or of air traffic simply diverting
from Heathrow to Amsterdam or Paris, or of ships 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>docking at Rotterdam and their cargo being driven
here by truck? All those scenarios could increase emissions rather than
reduce
them.</div><a name="08070215000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look forward to the debate on these points, but I ask the Committee to
accept the good intent and practical implementation policies behind the
Government amendments.</div>
<a name="08070215000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000701"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Gummer</b> (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con): I want to share with
the Minister something that, as a representative of Felixstowe, which
is now Britain&#146;s largest port, I am worried about. I am
concerned not only about the emissions per tonne of diesel, but the
quality of the diesel that is used. We, in the European Union, have
been slow in saying that ships that use filthy diesel are not allowed
to dock. I am not talking about whether they take that on board, but
just that they should not be allowed to dock. We need to reduce the
direct air pollution effect of ships, which is very strong&#151;as
anyone with a coastal constituency in this country knows. I am not
criticising the Minister, but it is interesting that he should have
given all the different examples, but did not refer to that. Such
action would have a dual effect. It is something that we could do, and
it is a matter that the Government could lead on in the European Union.
Proportionately, Britain is more affected by the filth from dirty ships
than any other country in Europe. Can we not take that on
board?</div>
<a name="08070215000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000702"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. With
your indulgence, Mr. Cook, I wish to make another point. We
are also a world leader in engine design and manufacture. The most
efficient ship engines in the world are our military ship engines. For
reasons not primarily to do with emissions, but with refuelling Type 55
frigates, I highlight Rolls-Royce. I mention that because part of the
supply chain is in Oldham, East and Saddleworth. I shall stop there,
hoping that the <i class="I">Oldham Evening Chronicle</i> correspondent has noted
that important
remark.</div><a name="08070215000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Gentleman is correct. I am trying to ensure that we have a
verifiable emissions capping regime and recognise its global nature,
that we give UK plc competitive advantage, when we can, and that we do
not unduly punish the UK. I think that I am right that 30 per cent. by
volume in his example of trade between the UK and the European Union
comes through Felixstowe dock, which is significant. I used the
Heathrow and Southampton examples but, given that my hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Test is about to intervene, I suspect that
Southampton is bigger than Felixstowe in volume
trade.</div><a name="08070215000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000703"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I regret to say
that Southampton is not bigger in volume trade than Felixstowe, but
obviously the quality of trade is
better.</div><a name="08070215000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal has cited the example of dirty
diesel. There are also other factors relating to what shipping carries,
how efficiently it carries it, and over what distance. Given that 95
per cent. of what we consume comes into this country via ports, notably
Southampton and Felixstowe, we are concerned about what is coming in
and going out on ships, too. What is the value per mile travelled, for
example?</div><a name="08070215000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
the ships, when in port, give back the electricity that they are
consuming when they lie idle? Can they be plugged into the port when
they are in dock? If that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>were part of the package, Southampton would make an interesting net
contribution, as would Felixstowe, from the power source of ships lying
in port. Will my hon. Friend be considering those matters when
examining the contribution made by shipping in respect of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>
measures?</div><a name="08070215000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000704"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s intervention illustrates
the complexity of the matter. The Government are not trying to dump the
issue. We have argued&#151;above all countries in the European
Union&#151;that, of course, aviation and shipping emissions should be
included in a scheme. Given the importance that we place on the
cap-and-trade system and carbon trading, it would be nonsense for us
not to do so. That does not disguise the fact that there are the
complexities to which my hon. Friend has referred.</div>
<a name="08070215000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
mention some further items to consider. Should we look at emissions
from the transportation of goods to the UK at all stages of the
journey? Ships that dock in Southampton may well be carrying goods,
including passengers, from one country to another&#151;they may be
dropping off at Southampton, taking on new cargo and moving on
elsewhere.</div><a name="08070215000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that the whole Committee is trying to include aviation and
shipping in a pragmatic way, so let me point a way forward. There are
already international rules on how to calculate the emissions from, for
example, journeys through the channel tunnel. If the electricity is
generated on the French side, the emissions belong to France; if the
electricity is generated on the UK side, they are our emissions. I am
trying not to score a point, but to show the difficulties. The
alternative approach, which we will discuss later, risks double
counting. We also have the problem of the administrative burden. How do
we ascribe goods where part of the journey was by sea? Would we need to
examine every single journey of every single ship and aircraft? Huge
uncertainties and data problems need to be
considered.</div><a name="08070215000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s approach meets the objective of those who are
rightly campaigning for the inclusion of aviation and shipping
emissions in the Bill and the international agreement. Let us move
forward on the best
basis.</div><a name="08070215000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000705"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): I am more confused now
that the Minister has moved the amendment than I was before. In his
amendment, is he saying that the Government could introduce regulations
that apply to aviation and shipping and remove the other aspects of
international transport? He referred briefly to trucks, which surely
provides an opportunity for us to charge, for example, the Dutch and
German hauliers who come in with full tanks of more polluting diesel
that is cheaper than in the rest of Europe. Currently, they can
undercut domestic hauliers, who cannot compete with their prices, on
cabotage. I am slightly concerned that by including aviation and
shipping, but putting it out to the long grass&#151;longer than five
years&#151;he is also excluding railway and road transport. Is that
the purpose of his
amendment?</div><a name="08070215000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000706"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Certainly not. I accept the hon. Lady&#146;s
point, but the framework that we have put forward is the best one from
the UK plc point of view, and that it also achieves our objectives.
Government amendments Nos. 6 and 7 work within the spirit of the
changes to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>Bill made in the other place. As I hope the hon.
Lady recognises, we have considered that matter, which is backed up by
statements from my noble Friend Lord Rooker. Those changes set a
deadline of five years from Royal Assent to either include those
emissions or to report to Parliament on why it has not been done. I am
trying to say, &#147;Okay. You&#146;ve got a point. We need to
include them and give surety to industry and the public that they are
included, but can we have five years to reach an international
agreement?&#148; If we do not do that, we will have to explain why
that is the case to Parliament and decide where to go from there. That
is my proposition and I hope that the Committee will accept amendments
Nos. 6 and
7.</div><a name="08070215000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000707"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I need to clarify something. I am anxious
to preserve the tolerant, friendly, brotherly, and almost comradely
exchanges that are taking place, which I do not want to impinge on
adversely, but I must draw a distinction between interventions and
speeches. Some interventions have been very long, and speeches have
then taken up and made the same points that were made during the
interventions. Will hon. Members try to analyse their interventions and
speeches.</div><a name="08070215000634"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000708"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I hear what you say, Mr. Cook, and will
do my best to
comply.</div><a name="08070215000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is vital that aviation and shipping in the broadest sense are included
in this Bill. Despite the surfeit of amendments, and amendments to
amendments, it is important to note&#151;I am grateful for what the
Minister has said&#151;that a great deal more unites the parties in
Committee than divides us, although there are differences of opinion
nevertheless. We all agree on the necessity of including carbon
pollution caused by aviation and shipping in our national carbon
budgets. We all agree that that is, unfortunately, a process far easier
said than done, which is why we have reluctantly agreed on the
necessity of a four to five-year delay before including aviation and
shipping properly in the carbon
budget.</div><a name="08070215000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also come to the conclusion that it is right to agree with the
Government that they should be able to define exactly what constitutes
emissions from aviation and shipping and to say under what
circumstances those emissions should be counted as arising from the
UK&#151;the Minister explained that point very well in his speech.
However, due to the seriousness of the issue, which goes to the heart
of the Bill, I want to reiterate for the record the scope of the
problem.</div>
<a name="08070215000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Aviation is
the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United
Kingdom and many advanced economies throughout the world. In the
unlikely event that the UK&#146;s 2050 target remains at just 60 per
cent., current forecasts project that emissions from aviation will be
equivalent to 26 per cent. of the total UK carbon allowance. That is
why people are right to be alarmed at the role of aviation, not because
of what it is emitting now, but because of its potential to dominate
the carbon economy landscape by 2050. If we end up going for an 80 per
cent. reduction target under current growth rates, aviation could
account for more than 50 per cent. of the UK&#146;s total annual
carbon budget by 2050. To say that that would put extreme pressure on
other sectors of our economy to meet our budget 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>targets would be a massive understatement, even
before we begin to consider the additional impact of the multiplier
effect of releasing heat-trapping gases at high
altitudes.</div><a name="08070215000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its 1999 report, &#147;Aviation and the Global Atmosphere&#148;,
the intergovernmental panel on climate change put the multiplier effect
at two to four times the actual emission because of the effect of being
emitted at high altitude. If that is taken into account, aviation
emissions account for well over the total of the UK&#146;s allowance
by 2050, assuming a reduction target of 80 per cent. That paints a
dramatic and horrifying picture, but it shows the key role that solving
the problem would have in achieving a reduction in our national carbon
emissions. I believe that we can ultimately solve the
problem.</div><a name="08070215000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister has said, emissions from shipping are trickier for two
main reasons. First, shipping emissions are far more difficult to
calculate, primarily because aeroplanes, by and large, carry fuel for
only one trip at a time to keep their weight to a minimum, but ships
are not constrained in that way and often refuel every few weeks.
Furthermore, ships can refuel in many parts of the world, few of which
have a proper carbon accounting mechanism. The second reason why
shipping is more problematic to calculate is that while it is still a
significant polluter, it is by far the most carbon-efficient method of
international freight transport. The comparative figures that I have
seen show that sea freight emits between 30 to 90 g of
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>per tonne of freight per kilometre. Road freight, on the
other hand, emits between 130 to 190 g per tonne per
kilometre.</div>
<a name="08070215000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
shipping must internalise its carbon pollution costs, we must ensure
that we do not, through well meaning but poorly designed legislation
with unintended consequences, offer a perverse incentive to more
carbon-intensive modes of transport, such as road freight, over the
more efficient movement of goods by sea. For example, if shipping
becomes heavily regulated inappropriately, there might be an incentive
to have ships dock at Rotterdam or, worse, Istanbul, and then drive
across the continent and into this country via the channel tunnel. That
was the reasoning behind the Conservative amendments in the other place
that changed aviation and shipping to the broader term,
&#147;international trade and transport&#148;. We want further to
enhance the existing clause through the addition of amendment No. 82,
which would require the assessment of emissions to take into account
all stages of the goods&#146; journey to the UK from their point of
origin.</div><a name="08070215000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
maintaining trade and transport as it is, and by adding amendment No.
82, we wish to prevent the system of measurement being skewed in favour
of more carbon-intensive methods of transport, which could happen if
shipping and aviation were included without reference to other modes of
transportation. Let me give some practical examples. If oranges
exported from Spain to the UK were sent over on lorries, only the short
leg of the journey by ferry would be included in the UK&#146;s carbon
allowance. If they were sent by sea, the whole journey would be
counted, making the carbon cost much more expensive. We would therefore
create a significant incentive for the use of road freight over sea
freight, despite its being many times more carbon intensive. If
national emissions trading schemes exist in the transit states, then
the disincentive to use road freight should be strong
enough.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000709"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman taken into account the
fact that even when goods arrive in the UK by sea, there may be a
number of circumstances in which that freight is then subject to short
sea shipping&#151;one has to say that very carefully&#151;around
the UK? That means that a number of other ports are used for the
ultimate destination of something that has already arrived in
the UK. Therefore, additional measures relating to shipping
within the UK have to be taken into
account.</div><a name="08070215000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000710"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I have taken that into account in the amendments,
but the hon. Gentleman has made a sensible point. Obviously, if
national emissions trading schemes are in existence through the transit
states, there would be a disincentive to use freight transport.
Effectively, what we are saying is why take that risk and not give
clarity when we can close that loophole here and now. If we introduced
our system before some or all of our neighbouring European transit
states, Britain would be perversely incentivising the movement of goods
away from direct shipping and towards a more polluting alternative.
Clearly, if we were leading by example, we would not want that perverse
impact.</div>
<a name="08070215000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, if
one imports goods from China, the best way, both in terms of cost and
the environment, is for the container to be shipped directly to the UK.
Yet, if we specifically mention aviation and shipping in the Bill
without reference to other means of importing goods, it could make
economic sense to ship only as far as Rotterdam and then move the goods
by lorry into the UK to minimise the amount of carbon officially being
counted. The Conservative party believes that it is correct to stick to
the current wording of &#147;international trade and
transport&#148;, because it takes in more than aviation and shipping.
We are not against aviation and shipping&#151;completely the
reverse&#151;but the term should be stretched more broadly. We would
prefer our amendment No. 82 to be included, rather than returning to
the previous definition of aviation and
shipping.</div><a name="08070215000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
opt-out in clause 30 should be removed. Although it requires a report
from the Government about why they were incapable of preparing the
requisite regulations within five years, which would provide an
incentive for them to avoid embarrassment, the fact that the
alternative to having to find a solution exists at all gives the whole
process a degree of uncertainty that should not be
present.</div><a name="08070215000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
party has said all along that the Bill must give business and the
market long-term certainty and clarity. Maintaining the uncertainty
about whether trade and transport emissions would be included in five
years&#146; time does not give that clear market signal that the
private sector needs and deserves. That is why we have tabled amendment
(b) to the Minister&#146;s amendment No. 7. Moreover, I am
happy to speak in support of the proposed change in the reporting
deadline, as included in new clause 1. It makes good sense to have the
new regulations laid out before setting the second five-year budget
period, because, depending on the pace towards Royal Assent, if we are
to stick to the existing five-year reporting period, the necessary
clarity of trade and transport may not be set until 10 months into the
second budgeting period. In the interests of common sense and market
clarity, resetting the deadline to 1 January 2013 is a wise
decision that would be welcomed by the private
sector.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000711"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I suppose that I should start by welcoming the
progress that has been made. The Government seem to have been taxiing
up the runway, but some of the Minister&#146;s remarks suggest that
the plane may be stalling before take-off. As well as welcoming the
need for the inclusion of aviation and shipping, which we welcome, too,
the Minister seemed to be creating a long list of possible excuses and
reasons why this is a complex area with various technical stages. Of
course, it is complex; nobody is arguing that it is not. Almost all
calculations of emissions are complex and there are complexities to be
overcome. However, that is what the Government, the National Audit
Office and many others are struggling with in terms of finding accurate
reporting mechanisms. These are obstacles to be overcome, not excuses
not to be
prepared.</div><a name="08070215000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle has said, the reasons are clear.
Aviation and shipping are important according to the
Government&#146;s own figures from 2006. The fuel sold to the
aviation and shipping industries produced 42.8 million tonnes of
carbon, representing 7.6 per cent. of the UK&#146;s total emissions.
Although the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle has rightly pointed out
that, in the long term, if those emissions are rising and all others
are stabilising, reducing or being reduced through energy efficiency,
the proportion of the whole will be even greater&#151;possibly in
excess of 20 per cent.&#151;and even removing 7.6 per cent. of the
UK&#146;s current emissions would start to undermine the long-term
carbon budgeting process.</div>
<a name="08070215000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point
has been strongly reinforced by a number of Select Committees. For
example, the Environmental Audit Committee, on which I am honoured to
sit, concluded
that,</div><a name="08070215000601"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
the draft Bill contains provisions that allow these emissions to be
included in the future, we recommend that they be included
immediately...There already is an internationally agreed
methodology for attributing and recording these emissions as memo items
to national Kyoto accounts; the Government should simply use this to
track these emissions within the UK's carbon
budgets.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful if the Minister, in his closing remarks, were to
respond to the EAC&#146;s draft report, which made that point. A
similar point was made by the Select Committee on Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, which
stated:</div><a name="08070215000602"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;these
emissions are already reported to the UN as a &#145;memo
item&#146;...The inclusion of the UK&#146;s share of emissions
from international aviation and shipping will have significant
implications for the validity of the 2050
target.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally,
the rationale for amendments Nos. 6 and 7 was that they were about
technical tidying up and rewording where necessary, which we are used
to in Government amendments. Most of that looks reasonably innocuous,
but I am beginning to be persuaded by the argument advanced by the hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle on terminology. Moving from</div>
<a name="08070215000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;passenger
travel and imports or exports of goods&#148;</div>
<a name="08070215000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">to specific references
to &#147;aviation or international shipping&#148; highlights the
precise problem that the Minister has mentioned. Such an approach might
exclude road freight and therefore lead to perverse results whereby
goods that might have come in by air are transferred by an even less
carbon-efficient form of transport&#151;road freight. Perhaps our
noble Friends knew what they were doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>when they came up with the phraseology in the current text. If the Bill
goes back to them, they might want to look at it
again.</div><a name="08070215000635"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="08070215000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Government amendment No. 7, we see the mysterious subsection (3)(b),
which I shall describe as the parachute clause because it would enable
the Government to get out of the five-year obligation altogether by
laying before Parliament</div>
<a name="08070215000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a report
explaining why regulations making such provision have not been
made.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means not bringing the matter to a vote in Parliament, or amending
legislation, but simply laying a report explaining why they have failed
to do that. That is not acceptable.</div>
<a name="08070215000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
clear reasons why aviation and shipping have to be in at the earliest
opportunity. Various arguments to the contrary have been put forward,
such as that international agreements are ongoing and that we are
developing ways of measuring these things at an international level,
but that has not stopped the Government from pioneering other
well-regarded legislation or policies on climate change. The emissions
trading scheme was a UK initiative before it was part of a wider
international scheme, and only this week the Government made an
announcement on the definition of &#147;carbon capture ready&#148;
in terms of new power stations. That is being worked on at the EU
level, but we hear that the Government have come up with a definition
in advance. It is quite possible for UK Governments to be pioneering in
that respect and to lead rather than follow.</div>
<a name="08070215000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, new
clause 1&#151;I shall be interested to hear what the hon. Member for
Bury, North says about that measure in the context of the
Government&#146;s amendments&#151;would effectively achieve the
same thing as the amendments to Government amendment No. 7, so I am
inclined to be sympathetic on that.</div>
<a name="08070215000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has set out some strange arguments against the non-Government
amendments. He has said that our forging ahead would somehow give other
countries the impression that we were trying not to forge an
international agreement, but to force something on those countries. Of
course we are trying to forge an international agreement&#151;no one
doubts that in the slightest&#151;but we are also trying to step up
the pace and lead by example. I cannot see how the construction of a
truly comprehensive budget for the UK would in any way undermine the
development of international negotiations or agreements. If, as the
Minister said in response to my intervention, a truly comprehensive
sectoral agreement on aviation and shipping was in place by 2009, which
is what he has said he hopes for, I would be completely astonished, but
very pleased. However, even if that were the case, it would simply be
another factor to take into account when setting our carbon
budget.</div>
<a name="08070215000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Timing is
quite important, because if we do not bring aviation and shipping in at
the earliest stage, let alone if we allow that move to be delayed for
longer than five years, the industries that have to be included in the
carbon budget will be not be on a level playing field. They will have
to make adjustments to their business 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>plans and practices and take account of a new decarbonising economy,
while airlines and others will not have to make those adjustments.
Those in industries that are subject to quite rigorous international
competition, such as the aluminium industry, might justifiably feel
aggrieved that one of the most dangerous emitters of all was getting
away relatively scot-free.</div>
<a name="08070215000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000712"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that
industries such as the aluminium industry are already seeking
exemptions from the European scheme at the next stage of the EU ETS
discussions? Indeed, there has been talk of the German automobile
industry looking for such exemptions. If aviation and shipping are not
included, will not that send the wrong message and have an effect when
we come to discuss the details of that
scheme?</div><a name="08070215000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000713"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely valuable
point&#151;that is exactly right. If we send out a signal that it is
possible to opt out or to include oneself in the small percentage of
industries that will not have to make fundamental changes, we will
undermine the UK&#146;s progress towards a decarbonising, low or even
zero-carbon economy. In the meantime, of course, it would make a
difference to the other sectors covered by budget. Whether aviation and
shipping are included makes a difference to the emissions budgeted for
in housing, energy generation and so on. If those emissions are
included, and there is an international agreement on the methodology by
2009, all well and good, but that will alter the carbon and energy
reductions that have to be delivered in housing under the UK budget. It
is vital, therefore, that we have a truly comprehensive carbon budget,
which is what our amendments are designed to
achieve.</div><a name="08070215000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us imagine the nightmare scenario in which, in five years&#146; time,
the Government have failed to work out how that is to be done, despite
all the expertise at their disposal and the fact that they are
calculating those emissions already as a memo item for the Kyoto
protocol, as pointed out by Select Committees. What will the situation
be? Under the Government amendments, the Secretary of State could
simply slide a quiet report before Parliament&#151;just before a
recess probably&#151;and get away with a few negative media stories,
and that would be it! In such a nightmare scenario, we would want the
Government to be held fully to account and to amend legislation in the
full glare of parliamentary scrutiny and publicity, because they would
have let down their overall carbon reduction
plan.</div><a name="08070215000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000714"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): The Minister and others
have set out the context of the serious issues underlying the inclusion
of aviation and shipping extremely well. I shall speak briefly,
therefore, to new clause 1, and comment also on Government amendment
No. 7. Although the arguments have been well rehearsed over the
past 12 months, I think that we have moved on considerably from
the initial debate on the draft Bill last year, and it is heartening to
see such an overwhelming consensus on the inclusion of aviation and
shipping.</div>
<a name="08070215000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
stressing the urgency of that inclusion, given the likely increase in
aviation and shipping emissions in years to come. The hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle spelled out the figures for aviation and shipping. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>My understanding is that, as of 2006, they officially represent 7.6 per
cent. of our total emissions. Aviation, in particular, is one of the
very few areas of the economy where emissions are growing, and growing
rapidly. Of course, the official figures understate the reality for two
reasons. The calculation for shipping, which is based on fuel purchased
in the UK, is an underestimate because ships will tend largely to
refuel overseas where fuel is cheaper. Secondly, on aviation, we do not
take into account the impact of radiative forcing, which could multiply
emissions by anything up to a factor of
four.</div><a name="08070215000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no disputing, however, that the measures before us are very complex,
and I still struggle to get my head around many of the measurements,
the different formulae that could be adopted and the different impacts
that that could have on the UK. I also struggle to understand precisely
the way in which the ETS and our climate change legislation will work.
However, in a sense, that does not matter, because just as there is
consensus on the need to include aviation and shipping, there is
consensus on the complexity and a willingness to cut through
it.</div>
<a name="08070215000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The value of
new clause 1 lies not only in the fact that it is quite explicit about
including aviation and shipping, but in the fact that it sets a start
date&#151;1 January 2013&#151;in advance of the second carbon
budget period, whereas Government amendment No. 7 and the
Government&#146;s current commitment do not allow for that. The
earliest date on which they would consider the inclusion of aviation
and shipping would be after the start of the next carbon budget period.
There is, of course, a way around that, as there was a way around the
previous contentious issue concerning the choice between 60 per cent.
and 80 per cent., which is to adjust the date. However, we will come on
to that a little
later.</div><a name="08070215000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other advantage of new clause 1 is that it would do away with the
provision for the Government to provide a report if they are unable to
meet the five-year deadline. The Minister described that as an opt-out;
whether it is an opt-out or a cop-out I would not wish to say. There is
a growing consensus that that is not the ideal way forward. There is an
analogy to be made with the earlier debate about the 60 per cent. or 80
per cent. choice. The Government&#146;s argument is that we cannot
push the issue too fast because of the complex interrelationship with
international negotiations, and that pushing it too fast would cause
problems. We did not make that argument when publishing the Bill in the
first place, although the Bill is moving forward the international
debate significantly, and nor did we make that argument in recognising
that there needed to be a target for 2010 and 2050. If we accept the
argument that it is absolutely legitimate for the United Kingdom to be
the first country in the world to publish such a Bill, and that that
actually advances the cause of international agreement by setting tough
targets for 2020 and 2050, it is logical that the argument for
including aviation and shipping by a set date, preferably in advance of
a second carbon budget period, is perfectly valid and
convincing.</div>
<a name="08070215000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">In drawing to
a close&#151;I do not want to delay the Committee&#151;we know that
the figures are there because the Government collect the figures for
aviation and shipping. First, will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us
why those figures cannot be published alongside the first carbon
budget: not only the figures for bunker fuels purchased in the aviation
and shipping sectors, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>figures showing how they relate to the calculation of emissions? What is
the argument against doing that? I think that it would generally help
the debate along. Secondly, will he comment on the fact that the date
that he is proposing&#151;five years from Royal Assent&#151;will
almost inevitably be after the start of the second carbon budget
period? Could he not consider an alternative before Report?</div>
<a name="08070215000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, we
understand that it may not be possible to introduce the change by 1
January 2013&#151;there may be overwhelming arguments against and
there may be a total failure to move the international agreement
process forward. Does he accept, however, that rather than have the
opt-out of the Government simply producing a report to say why they had
not met the deadline, if we fixed the date in the Bill now, there would
still be the possibility of amending it to reflect the stalling of
international negotiations in the parliamentary Session of
2012-13?</div><a name="08070215000146"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000715"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I agree with much of what has been said by the hon.
Members for Cheltenham and for Bury, North and I will support the new
clause if it is pressed to a Division. Much has been made in Committee
about the 60 per cent. target and the views of the Royal Commission for
Environmental Pollution, which is the argument for why the target
should be included in the Bill. It is worth remembering, however, that
that target assumed the inclusion of both aviation and shipping, and
that if they are not to be included, the target should be higher. It is
the question of the target that really concerns me.</div>
<a name="08070215000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The inclusion
of aviation and shipping is, of course, contentious. We are told that
the proportion of emissions is relatively small at 7.6 per cent, but it
is rising rapidly and, as has already been said, no account is taken of
the fact that aircraft release emissions at high altitude. I draw hon.
Members&#146; attention to the Government&#146;s final impact
assessment, which states at paragraph
3.2.41:</div><a name="08070215000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Emissions
of greenhouse gases from international aviation and shipping represent
an increasing proportion of total global greenhouse gas emissions.
Emissions from aviation in particular are increasing at a faster rate
than emissions from other
sectors.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that concerns me, however, is the passage in paragraph 3.2.42
that
states:</div><a name="08070215000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
these emissions were to be included, the Government may wish to revisit
the level of the targets to ensure they remain both ambitious and
achievable, balancing the need to reduce emissions with the need to
avoid excessive economic or social cost, and consistent with
international
progress.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not necessarily argue with that, but it brings me back to a point
that I made when speaking to several other clauses: we are in danger of
constantly revising the target, whether it be 60 per cent. or 80 per
cent. On the basis of that statement, if the Government get more
information and decide to include aviation and shipping, they may alter
the
target.</div><a name="08070215000636"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
<a name="08070215000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
made clear, my concern is that we are setting a target that is supposed
to be for 2050, which is a long way away. It will be the guiding light
to where we need to go. I have referred to the need to vary carbon
budgets within that period&#151;that is perfectly sensible&#151;but
I am concerned that in several places in the Bill there is provision
for the long-term target to be altered. We have it again in this
clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div><a name="08070215000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would seem much more sensible to set a target now that includes
aviation and shipping, and that will not need to be altered in the
future. If we start to alter the target, we risk alienating the public,
who will become cynical if politicians continually change it. The
public will think that they are changing it to suit their own ends
rather than as a serious attempt to tackle climate
change.</div><a name="08070215000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate what the Minister says about the complexities of including
aviation and shipping. There is the further complexity of where the
ships come from and where they are flagged, which may be another
consideration. I do not think that there is any chance in the near
future of reaching an international agreement that would be much more
preferable. Rather than the UK being seen as pressing ahead and trying
to impose something on the international community, I suggest that
including aviation and shipping would, in fact, show leadership in
pushing forward the
issue.</div><a name="08070215000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a real chance of drift. In four or five years, the Government,
whoever they may be, might come back and say, &#147;We cannot quite
manage it,&#148; and the target will drift for another few years. It
could take a long time for things to come to any sort of fruition, and,
again, there is the danger of the overall target being
reduced.</div><a name="08070215000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would argue most strongly that we need to deal with the matter quickly
and to include aviation and shipping in the target that we set. The
hon. Member for Bury, North suggested that we have a report from the
Climate Change Committee before Third Reading. I suggest that it be
asked to consider this
point.</div><a name="08070215000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
notice that in the briefs prepared for this Committee, and even in the
Government&#146;s final impact assessment, that there are various
suggestions on how to calculate the target. I was struck by the fact
that the assessment quoted a Department for Transport report that
identified the need to increase the 60 per cent. target by 4 per cent.
on the assumption that aviation was included in the European Union
emission trading scheme. That should be taken into account and, at the
very least, added to the initial
target.</div><a name="08070215000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
echo the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham that industry
needs a level playing field. Many industries will find it hard to meet
the reduction targets that we will ask them to meet. I shall not repeat
what I said about the ETS in an intervention, but there is a real
danger of slippage if we allow one or two industries not to be included
in the long-term, overall target that is an important part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08070215000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000716"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I shall be brief. First, I declare an interest. My
business helps a company that is bringing forward the latest advances
in modern ships to operate in an effective and environmental
way.</div><a name="08070215000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I suggest that there is a good reason, which has not so far been
mentioned, for the content of the new clause? For precisely the reasons
that the Minister gave, it would be of huge help if the Government
sought to find what would be the best way for them out of the problems
that this complex matter creates. In other words, part of the reason
why we find it so difficult to get an agreement is because everybody
uses precisely the arguments that the Minister used. I use them myself.
They are good arguments because they are true&#151;it is not that we
are inventing things. This is a complicated matter.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div><a name="08070215000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">There would
thus be a huge advantage if the British set an example by saying what
they would do along those lines. Far from embarrassing our colleagues,
that would begin to make people able to discuss the real issue, which
is not whether, but how. Unless there is a &#147;how&#148; on the
table, we shall go on discussing the matter vaguely and saying,
&#147;Oh yes, of course we should do this, but it is very
difficult.&#148; If we at least create a matrix that gives some basis
for discussion about such issues, we will have moved on significantly,
and rather than making the problem more difficult, we will have made it
easier.</div>
<a name="08070215000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the amendment, because it puts the Government in the right position and
sets an example. If the Minister finds it impossible to accept the
amendment and, for reasons that I cannot imagine, the hon. Member for
Bury, North does not press the new clause to a Division&#151;that has
occasionally happened before, so I must take it into account&#151;it
would help the Committee hugely if the Minister committed himself to
that preparation and said that even if the Government did not bring it
forward, they would bring the facts forward, show the ways in which
such a thing might be done, illustrate and present it publicly, and
start now so that when they get to the date on which they are forced to
do something, at least Britain will have gone down all the alleyways
and byways and shown what might be done to bring that together. That
would bring us significantly forward from where we are at the
moment.</div><a name="08070215000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I hope that the Minister might be prepared to say that it is important
for us to stop treating aviation and shipping as if they were two
industries that have a God-given right to be treated separately. The
hon. Member for Angus has done the Committee a valuable service by
making that key point. I am tired of the aviation industry suggesting
that it must somehow be treated separately because the public will not
accept the same treatment for aviation as they accept elsewhere. That
is not on. We must treat everything from the point of view of climate
change and what makes a difference. If aviation is, as it seems, not
only increasing but particularly damaging, I am afraid that it must be
treated alongside the rest of industry. If, after deciding that, the
Government conclude that for a temporary period particular arrangements
must pertain, at least they would do so within a proper comparable
context. If they never get to the point of considering that, those
industries are left out and begin to believe that they will go on being
able to defend their being left
out.</div><a name="08070215000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
and briefly, there is a huge amount of movement in the shipping
industry. Some of the best shippers want to make the best of a very
good case and are thinking seriously about better engines, better fuel,
and setting higher standards. The Government could encourage that by
showing that they were serious about rewarding people, which is what
will happen if shipping is brought within the system. That would help a
great deal, and I hope that it would, importantly, enable us to bring
forward something else, which I shall set
out.</div><a name="08070215000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have always been suspicious about the measurement of steaming time. I
know that in Southampton and elsewhere many shipowners talk about the
cost of carrying goods further round the coast. It is always cheaper to
unload them and carry them by road. If we concentrate on carbon
emissions, reduce them and start to charge for them properly, we may
find that the old figures 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>change and that it may be more sensible to have two
stops because of the reality of the impact of the carbon emissions of
sea-going craft. I do not know that, but until the Government do the
work, none of us will
know.</div><a name="08070215000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
commend the new clause to the Committee. I would love it to be put to
the Committee because, were it to be pressed by those who proposed it,
it would be accepted. If it is not pressed, it will not be accepted,
and I hope that, as a secondary course, the Government might be
prepared to go down the route that I have
suggested.</div>
<a name="08070215000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000717"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> This has been an important debate. I pick up a
strong feeling from the Committee that backs up a strong feeling from
the other place and, I suspect, the Second Reading debate, about the
desirability of including aviation and shipping within the
emissions.</div>
<a name="08070215000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000718"></a><b class="B">Joan
Walley</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, North) (Lab): I remind my hon.
Friend that there was a very strong recommendation from the
Environmental Audit Committee on this subject. I hope that he will take
that into account.</div>
<a name="08070215000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000719"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My hon. Friend is a member of that Committee and
she is right to remind me about it. Let me bring us more down to earth.
We are debating how we can account for aviation and shipping emissions
and I will run through the answers to the questions.</div>
<a name="08070215000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I will
clarify the point made about reporting emissions under UN guidance. The
UK, along with all other signatories to the UNFCCC, is required to
report on emissions from sales of aviation and shipping bunker
fuels&#151;crudely put, that means fuels that are sold or purchased
in the UK. On a global level, it does not matter where the fuels are
sold. We get a figure of what the global emissions are and that is what
matters. Suffice to say, the data are not completely robust. I point no
fingers at any particular country, but hon. Members will understand
what I mean.</div>
<a name="08070215000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UNFCCC
permits a range of methodologies for calculating those sales on a
sliding scale of provision. However, that method of allocating
emissions is not totally reliable, as planes and ships routinely tanker
fuel from countries with lower fuel prices. That is particularly a
problem with respect to shipping. Ships on international routes have a
significant degree of choice about where they take on fuel. They will
generally do so where the fuel can be obtained for the best price, and
that includes tankers that are moored in international waters.
Therefore, any attempt to calculate the UK&#146;s shipping emissions
on the basis of UK bunker fuel sales will significantly underestimate
our contribution and overestimate that of other countries. My point is
that I am trying to capture more than I would have to if I took the
purest stance.</div>
<a name="08070215000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
with aviation, it is not apparent how such measures would work
alongside the already inclusive nature of aviation in the European
Union ETS. It is not clear how two systems could be operated alongside
each other, with one system allocating emissions to countries on the
basis of fuel sold, and the other allocating emissions and carbon units
to airlines on the basis of which country they were based in. There are
obvious risks of double counting or a system that is over-complex and
burdensome. That is why, when the European Union ETS rules are
finalised, we will ask the Committee on Climate Change for its advice
on methodology.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div><a name="08070215000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North was about
why we cannot publish the figures for aviation and shipping emissions
alongside the carbon budgets. He makes a good point. We already report
those figures to Parliament, and they are published each year, as is
required under the Kyoto
agreement.</div><a name="08070215000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of questions were asked by the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle, who made the valid point that industry needs certainty that
emissions will be included within five years. I agree with his premise,
but I say that committing now to including emissions as suggested would
not provide certainty, but quite the reverse. There would be no
certainty about how we would define the UK&#146;s share of emissions
or what the implications would be. There would be no certainty about
the effect on aviation. Let me repeat that the Bill is not about
measures to address emissions, but how we account for
them.</div><a name="08070215000637"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="08070215000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000720"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am puzzled by the Minister&#146;s remarks. As
both Select Committees pointed out, there is already a methodology for
accounting for international emissions from aviation and shipping. Both
Select Committees suggested simply taking the total and using it as the
interim measure. The National Audit Office also has a methodology for
calculating exact emissions from aircraft on the domestic front that is
based on the nature of the aircraft and the pattern of the flight,
rather than on trying to work out where every ounce of fuel came from.
Is not the Minister making a bit of a meal of
it?</div><a name="08070215000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000721"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am not making a meal of it. I am simply pointing
out that of course there are
methodologies.</div><a name="08070215000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000722"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> You are using them
already.</div><a name="08070215000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000723"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b><b class="B"> </b>Yes,<b class="B"> </b>but the hon. Gentleman must
accept that in the fight to cap global emissions, one has to have a
global agreement. Entering into a methodology now would have
significant impact on our carbon budgeting, and UK decisions in policy
would not be part of an international agreement. We could end up not
only cutting off our nose to spite our face, but&#151;if I can extend
the metaphor&#151;cutting off the nose of global emissions, to spite
that. That is my simple point. I am not trying to wriggle out of this.
The hon. Gentleman made that point on Second Reading, from both a
standing and a sedentary position. With respect, the UN simply provides
a method, not an agreed method. That method is hotly contested by
countries around the
world.</div><a name="08070215000177"></a>

Woolas:</b> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, because he
wishes to push that important
point.</div><a name="08070215000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000726"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The last time that I looked, the Kyoto protocol
was an international agreement. Will the Minister tell the Committee
whether the methodology that we used to calculate our memo item on
Kyoto is significantly different from that of any other
country?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000727"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is right. How we
report our emissions is agreed under Kyoto. That goes back to the point
that, from a global perspective, if we measure bunker fuel sales, we
get a global total. That does not amount to an agreement between
countries that their share of the emissions calculation should be based
on bunker fuels. That, in my view, is naïve. If one goes to
Rotterdam, where approximately 30 per cent. of shipping fuels are sold,
of course the Dutch Government are prepared to report that, as a report
under the UNFCCC agreement. Were there a request to take on the cap
consequential on that in the European Union trading system, the
Dutch&#151;who, I would argue, along with the UK, are possibly the
most environmentally progressive country in the world&#151;would not
agree to
that.</div><a name="08070215000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right to say that the reporting method is agreed, but
I make the simple point that that is not the same as the allocation
between countries being agreed. He is going to push his policy anyway,
and I respect him for that, but I want him to accept that point. It is
analogous to asking Southampton, Felixstowe or Hillingdon to take on
board, within local authority caps, the total emissions generated from
trade through Southampton, Felixstowe&#151;I will throw in Liverpool
and Merseyside, for the benefit of the <i class="I">Liverpool Echo</i>&#151;or
Hillingdon. I hope that hon. Members see my
point.</div><a name="08070215000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000728"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> Just for the sake of clarification, does my hon.
Friend accept that nothing in new clause 1 would require the Government
to accept irreversibly a particular method for calculating emissions
now, and that the purpose of new clause 1 is simply to advance the
process of international negotiations? He fully accepts that this is a
complex matter and that the current method that the UK uses may not be
the one that is finally
agreed.</div><a name="08070215000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000729"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> New clause 1 is sensibly drafted. By including
both international aviation and shipping emissions in the targets and
budgets under the Bill from 1 January 2013, if I have read it
correctly, the Secretary of State would have
to</div><a name="08070215000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have
regard to international carbon reporting
practice.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later
on, clause 86 defines the reporting method that I have mentioned. As I
say, the Secretary of State would have to have regard to that carbon
reporting practice or any other such EU or international agreements as
may be specified. So I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point, which that
is why it is a more difficult argument for me to
put.</div><a name="08070215000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me finish my argument, if I may. My hon. Friend&#146;s second
question was why have a date five years after Royal Assent that falls
in the second budget period? I am very keen to emphasise that the
Government amendment requires us to include emissions or to report to
Parliament within five years, not at the end of five years&#151;we
could take a decision earlier. Why have we chosen that phraseology? The
answer is that the Lords suggested that date and that framework and we
are seeking to work within their amendment. In other words, I am trying
to be consensual and once again I am learning that that is not always
the easiest policy to pursue.</div>
<a name="08070215000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle asked whether we should use a multiplier
for aviation emissions. As I have said, the key point is that there are
considerable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>scientific uncertainties about this issue. The Environmental Audit
Committee looked at this issue as part of its scrutiny of the draft
Bill and it concluded&#151;I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, North will back me on this&#151;that we should not go
down that road. In case it is needed, my hon. Friend has a copy of the
EAC report in front of her. Therefore, we intend to follow the
international practice of not having the multiplier.</div>
<a name="08070215000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The EAC
concluded that, due to the significant uncertainties in this area,
which are widely accepted by commentators, we should use the
internationally agreed methodologies in this area. They do not include
any radiative forcing index or multiplier in that regard.</div>
<a name="08070215000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
specifically asked by the hon. Member for Vale of York about road and
rail on the point that was made about the channel tunnel. Of course,
there are already clear international rules on how to allocate road and
rail emissions to countries, but there is no such international
agreement in relation to international air or sea travel.</div>
<a name="08070215000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me quote
Lord Taylor of Holbeach, the Conservative spokesperson in the other
place, who said during the debate on this issue, in this case in
relation to
shipping:</div><a name="08070215000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the regulations on shipping are not sophisticated enough...it
might prove economical to have goods driven across much larger
stretches of land and then simply loaded on to ferries to make the
Channel crossing, when a large ship could have delivered the goods to
England with a fraction of the carbon
footprint.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4
March 2008; Vol. 699, c.
1015.]</div><a name="08070215000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the point that the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle made, and
that is exactly the type of risk that I am talking about. In the case
of aviation, we would also need to be clear on how a UK system would
fit with aviation&#146;s inclusion in the ETS, which we expect to
start in 2012.</div>
<a name="08070215000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000730"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> That is the very reason why we should have the
broader definition of aviation and transport that we have
suggested.</div><a name="08070215000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000731"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That was not the conclusion that Lord Taylor of
Holbeach came to in the other place. I see the argument, but I believe
that there would be a perverse incentive for that.</div>
<a name="08070215000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me finish
my point on aviation; I think that the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle will accept the logic of my argument. Once the ETS rules are
agreed&#151;and I expect they will be&#151;we will ask our
Committee on Climate Change for detailed advice on whether there is a
methodology that works and that is compatible with both the EU ETS
rules and the wider international context. We will also ask what the
impact of adopting that methodology would be. We expect to be in a
position to take a decision on whether to include international
aviation emissions in our targets ahead of the start of the second
budget period in 2013.</div>
<a name="08070215000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">My argument
is that there is strong agreement&#151;the United Kingdom has pushed
this point&#151;to include aviation and shipping. We base our whole
policy in the international arena on the idea of cap and trade and that
means one has to base emissions on science&#151;on actual emissions,
not on some political fix. Our policy and the political pain that I
acknowledge that we are going through on this point&#151;I am the
recipient of many thousands of communications on this matter&#151;is
not based on our desire to avoid the inclusion of aviation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>and shipping simply because we wish to exempt those sectors. We take our
position because we wish to ensure that aviation and shipping are
included in a practical, pragmatic way that can include those sectors,
that leaves open better possibilities for international agreement and
that is fair to the other sectors within our economy. In an appeal to
my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, I could mention
ceramics, but I could equally appeal to Southampton, Felixstowe or

to carry amounts from one budgetary period to
another</div><a name="08070215000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000751"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 52, in
clause 16, page 8, line 44, leave
out &#145;1%&#146; and insert
&#145;0.5%&#146;.</div><a name="08070215000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment. We propose to reduce the amount of carbon units
that can be carried back from one budgetary period to the preceding
budgetary period&#151;the latter period would be reduced so the
previous period could be increased. We propose to reduce the amount
that we are allowed to borrow from the future from 1 per cent. to 0.5
per cent. Although we appreciate that external factors, such as the
weather, might make this so-called banking and borrowing useful to a
degree, we want to ensure that the budgets are robust and not pliable,
especially under political pressure.</div>
<a name="08070215000638"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="08070215000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also concerned that too generous a carry-back period might allow
any Government of the day to hide their failure to meet the budgets and
allow them to pass the buck on to the next Administration. The issue of
banking and borrowing is worth probing further, particularly in the
light of our earlier discussion about indicative annual ranges. There
is a clear link between the width of any indicative annual range and
the corresponding width in the banking and borrowing between budgetary
periods.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div><a name="08070215000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already argued that the indicative annual range must not be too
broad. I understand that the 1 per cent. banking and borrowing
provision under clause 16 only affects the five-year budgetary period.
However, we still need further clarity on their relationship. For
example, how would banked reductions at the end of a five-year budget
affect the next year&#146;s annual range? Would the Government be
allowed to count their banked reductions towards meeting the first
year&#146;s annual range, or would they have to spread them out over
the entire period? Conversely, if a budget period began with 1 per
cent. already borrowed from it, would all the annual ranges for that
period be adjusted to reflect
that?</div><a name="08070215000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Spreading
out the effect of banked or borrowed reductions across the entirety of
the next budget seems to make sense. It might not be possible to recoup
the entire borrowed 1 per cent. within the first year of the next
budget. Similarly, it would not be appropriate to use banked reductions
to make it seem like the annual range for the first year had been
achieved when in fact the Government were relying on the success of the
previous five-year period&#151;much like the way in which the current
Government rely on the success of the previous Administration to
achieve their Kyoto target. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Suffolk, Coastal played a heroic part in that
success.</div><a name="08070215000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the carry-back provision was narrower, that sort of thing would not
cause the same problems in the calculations of indicative annual
ranges.</div><a name="08070215000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000752"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Has my hon. Friend heard any argument other than
the weather for all this? The British have a tendency to blame the
weather for everything. The truth is that if we consider climate
change, the weather should have a less adverse effect than previously.
Will he ask the Government whether the weather has become the universal
explanation for not tightening this up more
effectively?</div><a name="08070215000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000753"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b><b class="B"> </b>Once again, my right hon. Friend has put
his finger on it. I have not heard of any meaningful explanation other
than the weather of why these indicative ranges would have to be
changed so materially. Although there may be more violent weather
events, we expect the weather to become milder and less severe in our
part of the world. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten
us.</div><a name="08070215000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is vital to know what a Secretary of State can count towards a given
target or range of targets. I am sure that the Minister can clarify the
relationship between banking and borrowing and indicative annual
ranges, and I would appreciate a detailed explanation. I do not move
this amendment to undermine the evident benefits of having a banking
and borrowing system, because I fully accept that that is a sensible
thing for any Government to have in reserve. I know that the necessity
for such a facility is already reflected in the Kyoto protocol, and for
some existing national level cap-and-trade schemes, such as the US acid
rain scheme, which is mentioned in the Stern report. I also appreciate
the importance of banking and borrowing with regard to the carbon price
and the cost of mitigation, and I understand the importance of having a
carry-back facility in case of adverse weather or other unforeseen
circumstances. Notwithstanding those issues, I wish to probe the
Minister for more detail about the relationship between the breadth of
the indicative annual ranges and the similar breadth of the carry-back
facility.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000754"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I wish to make a brief comment on amendment No. 52
in anticipation of a separate clause stand part
debate.</div><a name="08070215000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, which is identical to one tabled in the other place, would
replace one arbitrary figure with another arbitrary figure, albeit one
that is smaller. It would be interesting to know from the Minister the
thinking behind 1 per cent. and whether it is anything more than
something along the lines of saying, &#147;It&#146;s not very much,
is it?&#148;, which is how I think the figure was derived.</div>
<a name="08070215000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
magnitude of the figure, it is a percentage of the five-year aggregate
carbon budget. That means that it is bigger than it looks because 1 per
cent. of the five-year total is equivalent to 5 per cent. of one
year&#146;s total&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It took
me years to work that one out. This is important. It sounds innocuous,
but in the context of 80 per cent. cuts over 50 years, with 1 or 2 per
cent. as a typical annual figure, the amount under this provision could
be 5 per cent. of the annual figure, which is
large.</div><a name="08070215000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I shall explain in the stand part debate, I object to the principle of
borrowing. However, if we have to do that, we need the figure to be
justified, and we should certainly err on the side of a much smaller
figure, given that, in effect, it is five times as big as it looks. If
all we can have is a smaller figure, I would rather have that and I
would support the amendment, but I prefer not to have the principle at
all.</div><a name="08070215000232"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000755"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thought that the amendment was one of the
cleverest that has been tabled because of the point made by the hon.
Member for Northavon. The figure sounds small but, as in all such
matters, the devil is in the detail. He is right that the amendment was
discussed at some length both in Committee and on Report in the other
place, and I refer members of the Committee to the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>record of those
debates.</div><a name="08070215000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
accusation has been made that the figure of 1 per cent. has been
plucked out of the air. Nothing is further from the truth. All the
figures under the Bill are scientifically based and have been debated
robustly. In case the hon. Gentleman mistakes my tone of voice, let me
reassure him. Why do we consider that the 1 per cent. borrowing limit
is appropriate? Our analysis suggested that allowing up to 1 per cent.
of a future budget to be borrowed would be consistent with the rising
emissions that might result during odd weather. The right hon. Member
for Suffolk, Coastal reminded us of the importance of that to the
British&#151;I think that he referred to the English, but I am sure
that he meant that it was the British predilection to discuss it.
Furthermore, we must bear in mind the uncertainty of emissions
data.</div><a name="08070215000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
have been three large emission rises due to unexpectedly cold winters
since 1990, the coldest of which led to emissions in those years that
were between 3 per cent. and 4 per cent. higher than in the year
before. Translated into the clause, that means that if 0.8 per cent. of
the subsequent budget was borrowed&#151;4 per cent. divided by the
five years of the budget period&#151;the shock could be absorbed
within a 1 per cent. limit on borrowing and the budget would still be
met. That is my methodology. I agree that it is not rocket science, but
it makes mathematical sense. It is
symmetrical.</div><a name="08070215000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
more serious point is that those extremes of climate are, of course,
expected to increase with climate change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000757"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I knew that I should not have said
that.</div><a name="08070215000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000758"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> According to the Stern report and other reports,
the problem is that we shall have a decrease in emissions as a result
of cold weather and an increase in emissions as a result of hot weather
because of less emissions due to heating and more emissions due to air
conditioning.</div>
<a name="08070215000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister accept that it would be rather good for the nation if it knew
that it had to face the fact that the Government were going to stick to
the targets? The nation would react much better if, rather than the
Government&#146;s saying, more or less, every time one of these
things happened, &#147;When it is particularly bad, we have this
stuff in our back pocket that we can bring out&#148;, they said,
&#147;We are not going to change this because we are stuck with
targets that are fixed not because of our ability to meet them but
because of the reality of the threat.&#148; That is why I would be
much happier with a smaller figure and a greater degree of
straightforwardness from the
Government.</div><a name="08070215000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000759"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I hesitate to argue this point on common sense
because when Ministers or Front-Bench spokesmen start using that
argument, it shows that they are on weak
ground.</div><a name="08070215000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000760"></a>Steve

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000761"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Not desperate, but on weak ground. I counter with
the opposite argument and say that the British public would not
understand if we were not able to have that point of view. Again, we
are not trying to wriggle out of
this.</div><a name="08070215000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me complete my argument about the emissions data. All of us in the
world of politics and Parliament talk about emissions data as if it
were a pure measurement of geometry: it is not, I am afraid, although
hopefully it will be in future. Provisional figures for emissions in
the final year of the budget period will be available shortly after the
period ends&#151;such figures are generally accurate to within a few
per cent.&#151;but the final confirmed emission figures are not
available until later. That is part of the frustration of the job. As
the budget period would already have ended, if the emissions for the
last year of the budget period were to be revised upward by the amount
proposed, the Government&#146;s options would be limited. The 1 per
cent. limit is therefore considered the most appropriate approach to
providing a small degree of flexibility because it meets the five-year
point that the hon. Member for Northavon mentioned&#151;I am talking
about the end of the period, of course&#151;without undermining the
clarity and certainty that the budget system as a whole provides, which
are
crucial.</div><a name="08070215000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important for the United Kingdom and UK plc that we have ensured
that a robust system of accountability is in place, in that the UK
Government must seek and take into account the advice of the Committee
on Climate Change and consult the devolved Administrations before using
either the banking or borrowing powers in the clause. That will mean
that any decision to bank or borrow emissions will be based on robust
independent analysis. Further to that, analysis suggests that allowing
up to 1 per cent. of a future budget to be borrowed would be consistent
with the rise in emissions that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>might result from these two factors. We have
followed the advice of the other place and provided a credible argument
for 1 per cent. I confess that it is not scientific and can be
challenged, as it has
been.</div><a name="08070215000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle for moving his
amendment to question why that 1 per cent. figure was chosen, because
he has rightly forced the Government to outline their methodology and
rationale; that is the raison d&#146;être of Committees. I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman will hold me, or my successors, to account
on this
point.</div><a name="08070215000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000762"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation. I am certainly more informed. This is a probing amendment
and I do not intend to press it to a Division. I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000763"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> We have considered the specific number, but there is
a wider principle about the banking and borrowing idea. Do we need this
power at all? If there is a problem with hitting the carbon budget in
any period, a facility is available to buy in credits, because this is
the UK carbon account, not UK carbon emissions. Assuming that we do not
get to 31 December at the end of the fifth year and suddenly think,
&#147;Ooh &#145;eck, we&#146;re in trouble&#148;, and assuming
that things will be very closely monitored by experts, scientists,
forecasters, meteorologists and all manner of people, presumably it
should not come as a total shock if we are on course to miss the
target. If there is any prospect of missing the target, mechanisms
other than those in the clause are available to deal with it&#151;for
example, we could buy in credits.</div>
<a name="08070215000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">A facility
for injecting savings into the current period appears unnecessary,
therefore, but the opposite provision of pushing savings into the next
period is, if anything, more worrying. It suggests that, if we do
really well in the first period, we could give ourselves a few weeks
off in the next five-year period. It is almost like working overtime
and then having a vacation, which is fine in working life, but does not
represent a sane or desirable carbon strategy. The clause will allow us
to say, &#147;Not only will we hit our targets, but we will have some
slack and carbon savings to spare, so we will push a few into the next
period, which means that we will not have to try so
hard.&#148;</div>
<a name="08070215000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
everything that we discussed at the start of our
proceedings&#151;about this being a global challenge, of which the UK
is a small point, and about how we need to do as much as we
can&#151;if we over-achieve, we should literally bank that and
continue to be adventurous by maintaining the trajectory, but from a
new starting point. We should not simply pat ourselves on the back and
say, &#147;We have done quite well. We consider ourselves to have
achieved our goals already, even if we don&#146;t do very well in the
next five-year period, because it is already in the bank.&#148; That
is not the mindset with which we should approach this
issue.</div><a name="08070215000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be very worried if we were skating so close to the upper limit of
the five-year target that provisions would be necessary in case we
breached it. After all, we are dealing with ranges, so I hope that we
would aim to meet the targets comfortably, but
fail-safe mechanisms are in place if it looks as though we are going to
exceed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>them. On the other side of the coin, if we are
over-performing and doing really well, which gives us breathing space,
we should not just relax, but say, &#147;That&#146;s great.
We&#146;ve achieved good things, so let us press on from a new
starting point, rather than have a few weeks, months or years
off.&#148; I cannot see any reason for clause 16 to stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08070215000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000764"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I disagree with everything that was just said. If
we are to run this thing sensibly, we should provide for the ability at
either end to sort things out. As anyone who knows anything about
writing books knows, before starting, one must say, for example,
&#147;I&#146;ve got to write 10,000 words a day&#148;. However,
on completing those 10,000 words, it is a great mistake to do another
5,000, because the next 10,000 never get done the next day. It is
necessary to keep to an organised system. There is a great deal to be
said for tough targets run sensibly and a Government who stand by their
word, but who have the necessary opportunity at the end of each of
those otherwise artificial periods to carry over
amounts.</div><a name="08070215000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000765"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am worried about what book the right hon.
Gentleman is writing and when it will be delivered. A draft copy for
review would be dealt with in strictest confidence. I remind him that
the incentives for early action and over-achievement are recognised by
the Kyoto protocol, for the reasons that he
gives.</div><a name="08070215000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000766"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> We must be tough with ourselves and do this
properly. Furthermore, we must not let ourselves down by being
pusillanimous over the targets and carbon budget or get into the
position of the iron
maiden.</div><a name="08070215000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000767"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The right hon. Gentleman makes some very good
arguments. In addition, I use the example of the evidence cited in the
Stern review about the United States acid rain programme, which the
right hon. Gentleman and others will recall. Allowing for banking
between phases of that programme helped to deliver early reductions and
improved participants&#146; efficiency. The evidence suggests that,
because of the ability to bank from the first phase into the second
phase, the emissions reduced in phase 1 were twice that required to
meet the
cap.</div><a name="08070215000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the arguments of the hon. Member for Northavon. They are slightly
purist, but I do not criticise him for that. He is right to press the

to report on proposals and policies for compensating for budget
excess</div><a name="08070215000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000787"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in
clause 18, page 10, line 6, at
end insert</div> <a name="08070229000003"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and any
sanctions proposed against those responsible for budget
excesses&#146;.</div><a name="08070215000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
happens if we fail? Taken collectively, globally, the consequences are
unthinkable. The cost of failure is famine, poverty, disease and death
on an unprecedented scale. However, what happens specifically if we,
the British political class, fail to meet the objectives being
discussed in the Bill? I am saying &#147;we&#148; because I am not
assuming that the Labour Government will still be around in 2012-13. It
could be any of us, any combination of us or any of our successors who
are in government at the
time.</div><a name="08070215000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the moment, the great sanction present in the Bill is a report on
proposals and policies. In a sense, that is appropriate. If the budget
target is missed, action must be taken. It is a greater
threat&#151;but only just&#151;than the letter that has to be
written by the Governor of the Bank of England on behalf of the
Monetary Policy Committee to the Chancellor for exceeding the inflation
target. I suspect that, as more and more inflation targets are missed
and more and more letters are written, familiarity might even breed
contempt for that sanction as well. I can see the Treasury quaking in
its boots at the receipt of another letter. Likewise, I do not see
Parliament shaken to its foundations by the need to produce a report.
Yet in most cases when Governments break the law, which in a sense is
what we are talking about when the targets are missed, some
consequences normally follow.</div>
<a name="08070215000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been various suggestions as to what those sanctions might be. In
another place, Lord Teverson suggested that the Secretary of State
might one day be dragged away to the Tower of London because the
targets had not been met. I do not think that he spoke in all
seriousness but, given the consequences of failure, we must think
seriously about what should happen to Secretaries of State who preside
over the missing of such targets. We as the British Parliament could
think collectively about a financial penalty&#151;the Treasury could
buy the carbon credits, perhaps at a premium, to make up for the lost
target. However, that rather undermines the arguments about trying to
minimise the proportion of targets met by purchasing credits, rather
than by a genuine domestic effort to decarbonise the economy. If, at
some stage, the Treasury could be persuaded to say that that was an
affordable route, the sanction would clearly have been
counter-productive, as it would have encouraged the Government to think
about buying their way out of the problem.</div>
<a name="08070215000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tried to
table an amendment that would have caused an automatic reduction in
Cabinet salaries equivalent to the excess by which the target had been
missed. I thought that it was an exciting amendment; it would have led
to an interesting debate that could have extended 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>into the general area of performance-related pay for Ministers and
Governments. Sadly, it was ruled out of order on the grounds that there
are, apparently, already existing processes for setting Cabinet
salaries, and this was not one of them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000788"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I sense a slight problem with the amendment. Under
the clause, a report must be laid before Parliament. Subsection (2)
refers to</div>
<a name="08070215000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;proposals and
policies of the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers or a Northern
Ireland department, it must be prepared for consultation with that
authority.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the hon. Gentleman propose that the UK Parliament takes powers to
impose financial penalties on the devolved Administrations? That might
be a step too far for the powers of this
Parliament.</div>
<a name="08070215000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000789"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I would hesitate to suggest any such thing, not
simply because I am afraid of the hon. Gentleman, but because I am
afraid of some of my Scottish colleagues. However, on careful reading,
I think that we are amending only subsection (1), so I am not sure that
the criticism is correct. However, it is an important matter and I take
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.</div>
<a name="08070215000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having had
those slightly more exciting and interesting options ruled out, we are
left with the less exciting amendment No. 35, which opens the debate
about what sanctions, if any, will be proposed against those
responsible for budget excesses. I hope that the tabling of the
amendment starts to stimulate that debate both inside and outside
Parliament. I have often drawn an analogy between the challenge and
threat that we as a society face now with that faced in war time. In
that sense, it is carbon criminals, rather than war criminals, who we
seek to hold to account. Given the consequences of failure, it is
important that we address this matter and that the Government and the
official Opposition give us their perceptions of what sanctions will
apply that will really incentivise the meeting of targets in a serious
way.</div>
<a name="08070215000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000790"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Amendment No. 35 opens a new chapter in the story
and direction of the Bill. It proposes that the Secretary of State
report to Parliament on the reasons why, and solutions for, having
exceeded a budgetary limit. The report should include a list
of</div>
<a name="08070215000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sanctions
against those responsible for budget
excesses.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
cannot support the amendment for a number of reasons. First, it goes
against what I like to call the opportunity agenda around climate
change. My party likes to make both business and the public realise
that, in the climate challenge, there also lies an enormous economic
opportunity and the chance to live more fulfilling lives. We believe in
the power of &#147;can do&#148;, not the dour politics of
&#147;cannot&#148; that the Liberal Democrats are so fond
of.</div>
<a name="08070215000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
currently sets a long-term framework and clear road map within which
business can work with confidence towards developing new technologies,
growing new markets and processing the challenge of decarbonising our
economy. The vehicle for getting there can be found in policies outside
the Bill. My party has announced incentives such as feed-in tariffs for
microgeneration, an emissions performance standard for electricity that
is generated in the UK and a new green exchange market 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>to kick-start investment in our low-carbon economy. There is plenty more
where that came from, but the place to legislate for such policies is
not in the Bill, which should remain a lean, focused framework
document.</div><a name="08070215000640"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="08070215000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
include a list of sanctions on any group that breaches its budget, as
the Liberal Democrats propose in the amendment, is beyond the remit of
the Bill. Who would decide those sanctions&#151;the Secretary of
State or the Committee on Climate Change? Under which legislation would
they be empowered to lay those sanctions? Presumably, the sanctions
would take the shape of either a monetary fine or additional
legislation.</div>
<a name="08070215000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000791"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Is not this a manifestation of the Praise-God
Barebones approach to life, in which the only way to solve these
problems is to be thoroughly miserable and to punish people who get it
wrong? Surely, we ought to be doing exactly the opposite, which is to
be thoroughly cheerful about the fact that we are going to get through
and win, and to encourage people who do things right. Those people
should profit rather than have to wear hair shirts of the liberal
variety.</div><a name="08070215000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000792"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> By hair shirts of the liberal variety, I presume
that my right hon. Friend means short-sleeved hair shirts. He is
absolutely right. The Conservatives are passionately wedded to adopting
a can-do, hopeful and optimistic agenda.</div>
<a name="08070215000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Existing
market mechanisms, such as the EU ETS and the carbon reduction
commitment programme, should have sufficient sanctions if the targets
are not met. If they do not, those mechanisms should be tightened,
rather than additional costs and regulations being placed on business.
We can be sure that any final increase in cost will be passed on to
consumers, and the law of unintended consequences should be considered.
Policy makers should remain acutely aware of that at this time of
increased energy costs and heightened energy poverty. In the interests
of optimism and
ambition&#151;</div><a name="08070215000299"></a>

way.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000796"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Let me restate that the Bill is not the place for
harsh penalties. The message that we, as legislators, must send out to
the public, the electorate and the wider world is that we are focused
on finding solutions and funding a road map to a sustainable low-carbon
economy. We have an inherent belief in that mission, and we do not
believe that we should start things by clobbering people with fines,
regulations and tokenistic measures for taking the pay of Ministers.
The agenda is much bigger than that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div><a name="08070215000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000797"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am listening with interest to this hug-a-hoodie
approach to Ministers who break the law. Does not the Conservative
party believe in there being consequences for Ministers who break the
law?</div><a name="08070215000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000798"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Talking about carbon criminals and Government
Ministers breaking the law takes the debate in a thoroughly different
direction. We have to get back to common sense, which is to rely on
Ministers and the good judgment of the British electorate to elect a
Government&#151;in future&#151;who will be good to their word and
who will provide an ambitious route forward, rather than relying on
silly mechanisms in the Bill. For those reasons, I cannot support the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000799"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I did not intend to speak to the amendment, but I
have been spurred into action by some of the remarks made by the hon.
Member for Cheltenham. His response to my intervention was quite wrong.
In the few years left in which Scotland will be part of the UK, we will
be part of a net UK carbon budget, which covers all parts of the UK,
and the report will be on the UK carbon budget. I am sure that Scottish
Ministers will well exceed their part of things, but if one of the
devolved Administrations did not do so, under his amendment, the UK
Parliament would fine or act against Ministers over whom they have no
authority because they are part of a devolved Administration. There has
been a good bit of party political knockabout between the other two
parties, but the amendment is inept and would introduce something that
would only cause division and confusion. I oppose the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000800"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am sorry to intervene in this tremendous
disagreement between the opposition parties. I want to put on record
something that we believe is important in relation to the clause and
amendment No. 35. We are discussing a serious requirement on the
Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament setting out
proposals and policies to compensate for the excess emissions if a
budget were not met. The Secretary of State must lay that report before
Parliament, because clause 5 will establish that
responsibility.</div>
<a name="08070215000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view of
the amendment and its relationship with clause 5 is that, given the
statutory basis of the targets and budgets in the Bill, any failure to
meet a target or budget carries the risk for the Government of judicial
review, like most legal duties on the Government. In such a case, the
remedy would be at the discretion of the court. In most circumstances
when a Government have failed to comply with a duty, courts do no more
than issue a declaration, but we cannot rule out completely the
possibility of a court making a more stringent order, such as ordering
them to purchase credit. No Government would take that risk
lightly.</div><a name="08070215000641"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.22

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000801"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I was drawing my remarks on amendment No. 35 to a
close. I want to add that schedule 2 provides powers to establish
trading schemes and that includes, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>of course, provisions for penalties. In that case,
for example, within the context of the new carbon reduction commitment,
we are looking to develop a compliance regime that provides a
transparent and proportionate deterrent against
non-compliance.</div><a name="08070215000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sanctions relate to the level of the individual trading scheme or
policy, and that is because they are tied to the obligations that fall
upon the individual participants in the scheme. In the same way, the
framework of sanctions set out in clause 18 falls upon the Secretary of
State, because that is where the obligations are placed. I hope that
those reassurances about the transparency of the provisions will allow
the amendment to be
withdrawn.</div><a name="08070215000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000802"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister has made some serious criticisms of
the amendment. He says that there is a risk of judicial review, and
that therefore sanctions will be imposed at the discretion of the
courts. That is an extraordinary admission in respect of a Bill of this
seriousness. We are saying that we will leave whatever sanctions emerge
against Governments, specific Ministers or Secretaries of State to
unelected judges and that we will refrain from ever specifying
sanctions in the Bill or in any legislation that comes before the
House. That does not seem to be very
democratic.</div><a name="08070215000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister suggests that one of the possible sanctions might involve
forcing the purchase of credits and that that might be imposed by the
courts. That is one of the scenarios that I described in my opening
remarks. As I said, it runs the risk&#151;especially if it is not
done at a premium but simply involves buying more credits outside the
planned regime&#151;of allowing the Government to buy their way out
of a situation, with all the problems around domestic effort and
purchasing of credits that we will probably discuss later this
evening.</div><a name="08070215000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the Minister said that if we take the model of things such as the
carbon reduction commitment, there will be sanctions for certain
sections of the economy. In a sense, he is saying that participants in
such schemes&#151;in other words, business&#151;will face severe
sanctions but politicians will not. That is not a very positive signal
for this Parliament to send
out.</div><a name="08070215000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of the Conservative criticisms of the amendment seem to relate to our
dress sense, with references to dour, short-sleeved Liberal hair
shirts. I seem to remember similar criticisms coming from the
Conservatives in the 1980s and 1990s, when we were accused of being
sandal-wearing bearded hippies, but those were the days when the
Conservative party thought that carbon reduction meant closing down
coal mines. We were ahead of our time then, and we are ahead of our
time
now.</div><a name="08070215000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of political reality and some genuine criticisms from the
hon. Member for Angus, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000803"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in clause 18,
page 10, line 10, at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) The Secretary of
State shall certify that the Committee on Climate Change agrees the
factual content of any report laid in accordance with this
section.&#146;.</div><a name="08070215000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
comments will be reasonably brief. We propose the amendment because
distrust has been expressed in Committee, mainly of the <i class="I">Daily Mail
</i>and <i class="I">The Guardian</i>, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>but also of potential successors to this Minister
and other Ministers. At some level, we share some of that distrust. We
see the need for some gold-plating in parts of the Bill, and this is
one of
them.</div><a name="08070215000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that when action plans and reports were
presented to Parliament as the means to remedy the excess over the
carbon reduction targets in the budget, they were not simply a strategy
or a report as described by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, but
were rigorously based on sound science and analysis. For that reason,
the amendment would ensure that the Committee on Climate Change had
agreed the factual content of any such report and that its authority
was attached to the assumptions underlying
it.</div><a name="08070215000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000804"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> In the interests of balance and fairness, I assure
the Liberals that we are happy to support the amendment on the grounds
that it would enhance the authority of the Committee on Climate Change
and improve the transparency of Government reporting on proposals and
policies for meeting future
budgets.</div><a name="08070215000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report provided for in the clause will outline what proposals the
Government would bring forward in the event of an excess of emissions
in a given budget period, and it will be issued as a result of
Government failure. Transparency and accountability are key themes of
the Bill and it is important that we improve it in that direction
wherever possible, so I am happy to lend my support to this
measure.</div>
<a name="08070215000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000805"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> One word comes to mind&#151;shocking. It is
shocking that the allegation should be made that the committee would be
required to check the factual content of a ministerial report. On a
serious point, people have asked what is the statutory enforcement of
the Bill. One thing that the Bill does is put in statute the
relationship between the civil service and Ministers regarding advice.
It will be illegal for civil servants to advise Ministers contrary to
the Bill. That is an important point, although it may not be seen by
the outside
world.</div><a name="08070215000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give some reassurances to counter what I see as the undue
scepticism&#151;not cynicism&#151;of the hon. Member for
Cheltenham. Under the clause, the Government proposals will be a
statement of fact to the extent that they will represent facts about
what the Government intend to do. The report will be a statement of the
policies that the Government intend to implement, so it does not seem
entirely logical that an independent committee should be called on to
verify the factual content of the
report.</div><a name="08070215000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, it is crucial that the committee should remain completely
independent from the Government&#151;that is a debate that we have
had before. It is Parliament that will hold the Government to account
for the progress that we are making towards our 2050 target and it is
important that I emphasise that. That is why, although I understand the

is an important amendment and one that is, in its way, just as
important on a similar set of principles as the inclusion of aviation
and shipping that the Government have already conceded. It has been
subject to a substantial campaign outside Parliament from people who
are concerned that the plans and policies we adopt in this place are
representative of a genuine and comprehensive effort to tackle climate
change. It is pretty difficult to see how that can be done by
legislating for only one greenhouse gas&#151;carbon
dioxide.</div><a name="08070215000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various
arguments have been put against the inclusion in the Bill of the other
greenhouse gases that make up the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gases. It
has been said that carbon dioxide is the most important gas and that,
in any case, it represents 85 per cent. of greenhouse gas emissions.
That is certainly true. It is obviously important that we focus a large
part of our effort on carbon dioxide, but there are other potent
greenhouse gases. The short-term impact of
methane&#151;CH<span class="Sub">4</span>&#151;is much more serious than that of
carbon dioxide. It captures heat 20 times more efficiently than carbon
dioxide, so, in its way, it is a much more potent gas, even though it
is present in the atmosphere in a less persistent
way.</div><a name="08070215000643"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7

the same way in which aviation and shipping should not be allowed to
escape the provisions of the Bill, we need to ensure that greenhouse
gases such as methane are tackled. Otherwise, we could be in the
ludicrous situation in which if the other greenhouse gases that only
represent 15 per cent. of emissions now are allowed to proliferate and
we make huge efforts to reduce carbon dioxide, the percentage of other
greenhouse gases might rise on a much faster scale. We could end up
with 20, 30 or 40 per cent. of our emissions coming from those
remaining greenhouse gases, if they are allowed to
increase.</div><a name="08070215000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>we accurately measure and account for the whole basket of greenhouse gas
emissions. If we were to include other greenhouse gases in the Bill, it
would be a good incentive for developing better measurement systems for
the other greenhouse gases. Perhaps we have been lax in developing a
better understanding of those other greenhouse
gases.</div><a name="08070215000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
understanding is not quite as bad as Lord Rooker suggests. The National
Audit Office&#146;s report, &#147;UK greenhouse gas emissions:
measurement and reporting&#148;, goes into some detail about the
methodology used to look at the whole basket of greenhouse gases. It
talks about the intergovernmental panel on climate change guidelines on
greenhouse gases, which specify in detail what methodologies to use for
calculating emissions, and how trade-offs between precision, accuracy
and resources should be approached. The report states that emissions
should be estimated</div>
<a name="08070215000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;using a bottom
up approach. Using the economic activity data supplied by government
departments, trade associations and businesses, AEA and sector
specialists the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and the
Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER) model
emissions of all known anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases in the
UK within the following five specific source sectors: energy,
industrial processes, agriculture, land use, land use change and
forestry,
waste.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
state:</div><a name="08070215000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
broad areas are then broken down into activity types, subtypes, and
activities. The emission-producing activities include the combustion of
fuels such as coal in power stations, the use of petrol and diesel in
road transport, industrial processes such as cement manufacture,
agricultural sources such as enteric fermentation in cattle, and
sources and sinks of CO2 caused from changes in the way land is
used.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
case hon. Members are in any doubt about the meaning of enteric
fermentation, I can tell them, courtesy of Wikipedia, that it means
fermentation within the digestive systems of ruminant cattle. I am
trying to avoid using any unparliamentary language, but I was
interested to discover that most of that fermentation is belched rather
than emitted in any other way. Half of Australian methane emissions are
created in that way, which has been a serious incentive to the
Australian Government to support research into the vaccination of
cattle to try to reduce
flatulence<i class="I">&#151;</i><i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> Although that
is making hon. Members laugh and smile, that is a serious result of
Australia measuring and recognising the seriousness of reducing methane
emissions. I understand that other research on that is under way in
Japan and
Germany.</div><a name="08070215000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there is the possible excuse that the Government are following the

in case the Government are inclined to quote that Committee in support
of their position, I shall cite some of its other
conclusions:</div><a name="08070215000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
agree with the Government on balance that it is reasonable for the Bill
to focus on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, and we therefore
accept its overall architecture. However, this in no way relieves the
Government of its responsibility to continue to reduce other greenhouse
gases&#148;.</div><a name="08070215000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is difficult to see how we are going to follow that instruction with no
policy tools at our disposal that even look at those other greenhouse
gases.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div><a name="08070215000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is, in its way, as important as the measures on reducing
aviation and shipping emissions. The logic for the Government&#146;s
acceptance that we cannot exclude any large section of the economy from
greenhouse gas measurement and reduction policies applies just as much
to the other greenhouse
gases.</div><a name="08070215000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000808"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I have much sympathy with the spirit of the
amendment, about which the hon. Member for Cheltenham spoke fluently.
It would be foolish to consider the science of heat-trapping gas
emissions on a global scale without taking due consideration of the
full basket of greenhouses gases. It is well known that, as the hon.
Gentleman said, methane has 22 times the heat-trapping potency of
carbon dioxide. It is less well known, although it causes considerably
more concern to learn, that nitrous oxide is 310 times more powerful
than carbon dioxide as a heat-trapping gas. Any agreement that moves to
deal with greenhouse gases globally must therefore include the full
basket of the six major gases. However, we should remind ourselves that
the Bill legislates for only the UK, as the Government were at great
pains to remind us during the discussion over their principal
aim.</div><a name="08070215000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evidence presented in the DEFRA report on national statistics in
relation to UK greenhouse gases shows that carbon dioxide, standing at
85 per cent. in 2006, accounts for the vast majority of UK emissions.
Importantly, the remaining 15 per cent. of emissions, which comprise
the more potent greenhouse gases, are, I am pleased to say, in steady
decline in this country, whereas the UK&#146;s carbon dioxide
emissions have risen substantially since 1997. That is why the primary
focus of the legislation should, at least for the time being, be on
reducing carbon dioxide
emissions.</div><a name="08070215000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
back up my argument with some figures, UK emissions in 1997 were 548.1
million tonnes CO<span class="Sub">2</span> and, in 2006, they were 554.5 million
tonnes CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. That is an increase of 6.4 million tonnes. DEFRA
statistics show that UK CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions have risen in five of
the past 10 years. The UK will meet its Kyoto reduction
targets only because of the dash for gas under the last Conservative
Administration, which resulted in a reduction of the UK&#146;s
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from more than 590 million tonnes in 1991 to a
low of 540 million tonnes in
1999.</div><a name="08070215000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
March 2006, the Government dropped their manifesto commitment, which
was repeated in three successive manifestos, to cut carbon emissions by
20 per cent. by 2010. The 2010 target was set independently by the
Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. It was replaced in 2006 by
the climate change programme review, which pledged to cut emissions by
15 per cent. by 2010. Despite Labour&#146;s three manifesto promises
to slash emissions by 20 per cent., carbon emissions have clearly risen
since 1997. In 2006, CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions fell by just 0.1 per
cent. The Bill must focus on reducing carbon dioxide
emissions.</div><a name="08070215000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allow
me to contrast the figures on carbon with our national emissions of
other greenhouse gases. According to DEFRA, in 2006, methane accounted
for 7.5 per cent. of the UK&#146;s emissions, but that was a
reduction of 53 per cent. below 1990 levels. In 2006, the main source
of methane emissions were landfill sites and agriculture, but emissions
from landfill and agriculture have reduced by 61 per cent. and 13 per
cent. respectively since 1990. Again, according to DEFRA, emissions of
nitrous oxide, which is a particularly nasty gas, fell, thankfully, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>by 40 per cent. between 1990 and 2006, with a
year-on-year reduction from 2005-06 of 3.7 per cent. If only we could
repeat that level of performance on carbon dioxide we would be in a far
better position to meet our 2050 targets in good
time.</div><a name="08070215000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the drop in emissions of the basket of greenhouse gases and, by
contrast, our poor national record of reducing CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, which
constitutes 85 per cent. of our emissions, the focus of the Bill should
remain on carbon dioxide only. We might find that emissions of other
greenhouse gases rise in future. Fortunately, there is sufficient
flexibility in the Bill to allow the Secretary of State to redefine the
scope of the Bill when and if it is seen to be fit to include the other
heat-trapping gases.</div>
<a name="08070215000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
remain mindful of the challenges ahead in reducing our carbon dioxide
emissions. The Government&#146;s willingness to build a new and
unabated coal-burning power station at Kingsnorth springs to mind. That
power station alone would emit more than 7 million tonnes of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> into our atmosphere if the emissions were not captured
and stored from some point in the future.</div>
<a name="08070215000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
the Government&#146;s consultation on the definition of
&#147;carbon capture ready&#148; was discreetly announced last
night. We should bear in mind the implications of that definition as we
debate that further in this Bill.</div>
<a name="08070215000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000809"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I was expecting a debate about science on this
sensible amendment; I am now drawn into politics. My reaction to the
comments by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle is &#147;double
shocking&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070215000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
allegations have been made. Let me address the content of the
amendment, rather than my party&#146;s manifestos. There are very
strong arguments indeed for including the other greenhouse gases in the
Bill&#146;s targets and budgets, particularly scientific arguments,
which are, of course, the strongest. Also, including those gases would
ensure consistency with the international approach. The European and
international approach is for targets that cover all greenhouse gases
rather than just CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>and we recognise that our current
targets are not consistent with that approach. Therefore, we said in
the other place&#151;I repeat it here&#151;that we will include
other greenhouse gases in our targets if that is what the committee
advises; I suspect that it will do so.</div>
<a name="08070215000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
very important point that I ask the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
to consider. In including the other greenhouse gases, one must, of
course, have strategies for reducing them. While we concentrate on the
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>element, on which there are strategies and policies in
place and there is expectation of progress in the future, that is not
necessarily the case for all the other greenhouse gases. That is not a
reason for not including them, though.</div>
<a name="08070215000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000810"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Surely the Minister will accept that a reduction
in CO<span class="Sub">2</span>-equivalent emissions of methane or one of the other
greenhouse gases has exactly the same impact in terms of global warming
as a reduction in CO<span class="Sub">2</span>? Therefore, the priority must surely
be to develop those reduction strategies.</div>
<a name="08070215000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000811"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Indeed. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that that
point is important and is often missed from the debate. We tend to
interchange &#147;CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#148; with &#147;greenhouse
gases&#148; in the public debate, as if they were the same
thing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div><a name="08070215000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">We genuinely
seek advice from the committee on the scope to reduce the other
greenhouse gas emissions. The hon. Member for Cheltenham used some
examples of emissions from agriculture. However, it is not obvious what
the scope to reduce them is.</div>
<a name="08070215000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000812"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> When I listed the other greenhouse gases that
could fall within the definition, I understood the Minister to be
saying that he was minded to introduce them at a later stage and that
the Government had not excluded their introduction, but were not doing
so at this stage. Is that
correct?</div><a name="08070215000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000813"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We are minded to include them, we want to include
them, and we want the advice of the committee as to what the scope for
reducing them is. We want to include them for two reasons. The first is
the science, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham has said, and the second
is international compatibility. It is important that we do include them
for those reasons.</div>
<a name="08070215000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
challenge the arguments about the figures made by the hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle. He claimed that the United Kingdom&#146;s
progress against its Kyoto target was a result
&#147;entirely&#148;&#151;if he did not say
&#147;entirely&#148;, at least
&#147;substantially&#148;&#151;of the dash to gas. That is not
fair. There have been a huge number of energy-efficient measures in the
country that have contributed towards a decline in the emissions: the
climate change levy; the climate change agreements, and the Carbon
Trust in the business sector and the energy efficiency commitment in
the household sector, which are independently audited, as are the
measurements of emissions. In the energy supply sector, the
introduction of competitive markets in production and supply has driven
a large reduction in the UK greenhouse gas emissions since the early
1990s. Further savings in CO<span class="Sub">2</span> per unit of energy have come
from the renewables obligation from higher diesel penetration in the
transport fleet and from the European
emissions trading scheme.</div>
<a name="08070215000644"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div><a name="08070215000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government were cynical, we would simply accept the amendment on
the basis that we could show that the total basket of non-CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>gases has fallen by 38 per cent. since 1997. That
would be a &#147;stick it in your pipe and smoke it&#148; piece of
propaganda on behalf of the Government, but because we have integrity,
we will not fall into that trap, although it would be easy for me to do
so. The figures on the reduction in emissions show that the UK has made
significant progress against the 1990 and 1997 baselines.</div>
<a name="08070215000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since 1990,
UK emissions of all greenhouse gases were 18 per cent. below the
baseline year. For CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>only, UK emissions were 8 per cent.
below the baseline year. Therefore, the provisional UK emission figures
for 2007 were 1 per cent. lower than in 1997 for CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, and 9
per cent. lower for all greenhouse gases. Taking emissions trading into
account, the most recent figures were 5 per cent. lower and 12 per
cent. lower for all greenhouse gases. That shows that economic growth
can be decoupled from a growth in emissions. That is far from the
picture that the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle mischievously tried
to piggyback on to the back of the genuine and improving amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. I ask for the amendment to be
withdrawn.</div>

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments.
He made some serious criticisms of the amendment, including the one
that we should not attempt to introduce too many policy measures
relating to greenhouse gases for which there is limited or uncertain
scope for reduction. Sadly, if that is true, we are all in trouble. If
reductions to 15 per cent. of our greenhouse gas emissions are not
going to be attempted or are going to be outside the scope of policy,
we are in deep trouble, especially as that percentage is set to rise
dramatically if carbon reductions are achieved. If I tell the Minister
that significant efforts are being made in other countries to reduce
such emissions, he might take the matter more seriously. I mentioned
Japan in my opening remarks. According to the team from Obihiro
university of agriculture and veterinary medicine, a few simple food
additives costing about 50p each day per cow might be able to remove
virtually all methane from a herd&#146;s daily output of
greenhouse-gas enriched belches. Given that there are something like
1.5 billion cows on the planet, that would provide significant scope
for reduction in methane emissions. In the same way that renewable
energy can be stimulated by feed-in tariffs and other policy measures,
energy efficiency can be stimulated by policy measures, and carbon
trading stimulates business and industry to reduce its carbon
footprint. There is political business potential to reduce methane and
other greenhouse gas emissions, but we need the policy tools. We need
the policy framework in place to achieve that, and that is why we
support this amendment. However, I acknowledge that if we do not have
the support that I had hoped for from Conservative Members, it is
unlikely that the amendment will be agreed to. On those grounds, I beg

sinks have a vital role to play in the United Kingdom, and certainly
internationally. This is not the point at which we should talk about
the vital role that carbon sinks can play in the rain forest, but I
hope that the Government will encourage companies to invest heavily in
them. However, in the United Kingdom, too, there is a great role for
carbon sinks in our forests, peat lands and bogs. I do not want them
discredited because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>of some inappropriate carbon-sink trading that might be going on, or
some inappropriate or dodgy dealing that does not stack
up.</div><a name="08070215000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I read about carbon sinks, discovering the wonderful role that our
forests and peat lands could perform, I came across more and more stuff
on the internet from environmental groups that had been rubbishing
carbon sinks on the basis that the schemes could be a bit dodgy or the
solution was not permanent. The groups suggested that if the world
warms up, our forests in this country could get warmer and that rather
than our peat bogs and carbon sinks retaining carbon, they could be
releasing it, so let us not touch them. Some of the criticism had a
rather puritanical and misguided streak, saying, &#147;Yes, carbon
sinks may be good, but they do not cause enough pain, and what we
really ought to be doing in the United Kingdom is making sure that we
are closing down industry and making people and businesses suffer, so
let us not pay attention to the trees and the forests and the land that
we have and let us not exploit it to the full.&#148; That is barking.
If we are to be successful in meeting our climate change targets and
are to do genuine good, yes, we must have targets for industry to
reduce the amount of carbon emissions and for the rest of us to drive
less or to have a cleaner or lower carbon lifestyle. However, for
goodness&#146; sake, let us exploit some of the things that we have
in this country and expand
them.</div><a name="08070215000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carbon
dioxide emissions from soils totalled 13.69 million tonnes
in 2005. By comparison, carbon dioxide emissions from domestic aviation
were 2.47 million tonnes. There used to be an old gardener on the
television years ago&#151;was he a Yorkshire gardener?&#151;who
said, &#147;The answer lies in the soil.&#148; The answer in some
part does lie in the soil. If we maintain it and keep it properly, we
will be locking carbon in for evermore. All the peat lands in England
and Wales would absorb around 41,000 tonnes of carbon a year if they
were kept in a pristine condition. However, they could emit up to
381,000 tonnes of carbon a year if they were damaged by practices such
as excessive burning, drainage and overgrazing. The restoration and
enhancement of peat lands could save 400,000 tonnes a year, which is
the equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 1.1 billion car
miles or 84,000 family-sized cars. In addition to that, not only do we
lock in the carbon, but we would safeguard the habitats of 5,000
different species of plants and
animals.</div><a name="08070215000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure, Mr. Cook, that it will be at the forefront of your
mind that Natural England held a conference headlined &#147;Better
Bogs Create Carbon Sinks&#148;. The &#147;better bogs&#148;
conference, which was officially entitled &#147;Moors for the
Future&#148;, in the Peak district,
said:</div><a name="08070215000616"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
must protect and enhance our upland peat bogs&#151;they are the
UK&#146;s most important and vulnerable carbon
store.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the message from Natural England. Sir Martin Doughty, the chair of
Natural England,
said:</div><a name="08070215000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Evidence
shows that the degradation of soils through over-grazing, fires,
drainage and erosion is releasing five times more carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere every year than from all domestic flights in the
UK.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">Peat
soils contain a huge amount of carbon. If it is locked in, it is okay,
but if there is degradation and the peat land is not looked after
properly, it becomes a major source of emissions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div><a name="08070215000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see the
Minister nodding&#151;I have rabbited on about so many different
things that he was bound to have nodded at something. If the Government
accept the analysis that our carbon sinks are legitimate and good, and
that we ought to enhance them, I do not want anyone rubbishing them in
the next few years and deterring businesses from investing in them. I
am happy to have businesses in my constituency that might be emitting
carbon doing a carbon-trading deal and investing in peat bogs, new
forest&#151;or woodlands&#151;and in trees that, hopefully, will
not catch fire accidentally or be cut down. We must distinguish between
that sort of forestry and planting trees for 20 or 30 years that might
soak up carbon while they are growing, but which are then cut down
regularly. That is not what I have in
mind.</div><a name="08070215000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only way in which we can make the approach completely legitimate and
stop some of the misguided environmental groups from attacking our
carbon sinks and the planting of trees is to make sure that the
Committee on Climate Change has the role of approving carbon sinks. It
is no good me or anyone else coming along and saying, &#147;I am just
going to have a carbon sink there. I am investing in this and buying a
bit of hillside, which has good grouse shooting and a lot of peat. I am
therefore doing my bit as a carbon sink, so can I please have that
accredited against me?&#148;</div>
<a name="08070215000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
have legitimate and kosher carbon sinks, the Committee on Climate
Change should accredit them or have an assessment system for saying,
&#147;Yes, this is a good carbon sink and, as far as we can say, it
has the possibility of remaining permanent, so Natural England and
others can put conditions on it to make sure that the peat is not
eroded and not dug up, drained and released.&#148; We want a
legitimate verification system that keeps our carbon sinks as a
valuable resource for reducing carbon and locking it in, and that does
not allow people to discredit the whole
concept.</div><a name="08070215000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
conclude with those words because I am worried that some people want to
discredit the concept of carbon sinks for their own ends. Yes, the UK
should be doing a lot. Yes, our industry should be producing less
carbon, but let us not rubbish carbon sinks as a natural and perfectly
acceptable form of locking in carbon that should be expanded and
increased, and that should not only help British industry, but
contribute to the world&#146;s reduction of carbon in the
atmosphere.</div><a name="08070215000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000818"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b><b class="B"> </b>I congratulate my right hon. Friend on
speaking to the amendment so eloquently and with such knowledge. I wish
to restrict my remarks to clause stand part and Government new clause
2. I place on record how firmly we are wedded to the wording and the
principle of clause 25. In my humble view, it goes to the heart of what
the Government and all of us want to achieve in support of a climate
change strategy. Our aim is obviously not only to come forward with a
Bill that is groundbreaking in its own way, but to create a low-carbon
economy. By being one of the first movers in that regard, it is
important to aim primarily at reducing pollution in this country, and
not to export the problem through the use of more than 30 per cent. of
credits, but to reduce emissions and, for want of a better term, to
reduce pollution in this
country.</div><a name="08070215000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are few more important clauses than clause 25. It puts the
responsibility firmly on the Secretary of State to ensure that at least
70 per cent. of the effort 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>undertaken to reduce emissions to meet our carbon
budget is achieved domestically. The original Bill&#151;indeed, this
is the case for the Bill without the clause&#151;would have contained
no such clarity. I pay tribute to Conservative Members of the other
place who eventually won the argument for including clause 25 in the
Bill, with the help of Liberal Democrat peers, which was much
appreciated. The Conservative party considers that the removal of the
clause would seriously weaken the
Bill.</div><a name="08070215000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have received strong support for keeping clause 25 in the
Bill in a joint statement from the WWF-UK, Scottish and Southern
Energy, Christian Aid and the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds. In their briefing, they go right to the heart of the matter when
they
say:</div><a name="08070215000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Removing
clause 25 from the Bill would undermine a key objective of the
Bill&#151;that of establishing a framework which provides UK
companies with the long-term certainty that they need to incentivise
sustainable and low carbon investments. It would also leave unanswered
the question&#151;to what extent will the UK rely on buying credits
or emission allowances from other countries to meet its targets?
Without a requirement for clear and strong domestic action, the UK
could in theory meet its targets under the Bill without any action to
decarbonise the UK economy&#151;an outcome that would do little to
promote UK leadership in the international climate
negotiations.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one accepts that the point of the Bill is, as has been said, to provide
the market and companies operating within it with the long-term clarity
and certainty that they need to compete and be the best in the world,
the clause should be
retained.</div><a name="08070215000645"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.30
pm</div><a name="08070215000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause says that the Secretary of State must ensure that at least 70
per cent. of the efforts undertaken are achieved by</div>
<a name="08070215000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;domestic
emissions reductions and domestic removal by
sinks.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to define &#147;effort&#148;
as</div><a name="08070215000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
difference between the present UK carbon budget and the verified
emissions for the previous budgetary
period.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
compared the clause with new clause 2, I humbly submit&#151;I hope
that the Minister will respond positively to this plea&#151;that the
wording completely misses the point of seeking to obtain the highest
reduction. Clause 25 writes into the Bill a provision in relation to 70
per cent. of domestic action and will thereby reduce pollution at home;
it will not just export the problem. That will still leave a 30 per
cent. allowance for international credits and will fit and be
compatible with the EU
ETS.</div><a name="08070215000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
commend clause 25 to the Committee and make a plea to the Minister to
keep it in the Bill. Perhaps he will also withdraw new clause
2.</div><a name="08070215000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000819"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady that the clause is
fundamental, and I would like to address the clause stand part issue.
In my short contribution, I shall address some misunderstandings or
myths that have surrounded the debate, which we heard on Second
Reading.</div>
<a name="08070215000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
such myth, which is often quoted, is that a tonne of carbon is a tonne
of carbon, and that it is of no great consequence, as far as the planet
is concerned, where it is saved, as it will have the same adverse
effect wherever it goes up. It is interesting that the person whom the
Government have asked to supervise the process, Lord Turner, does not
take that view. In discussions in another place he has said
that</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="08070215000621"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is not absolutely the case that a tonne of carbon saved in every
country of the world is precisely the same. There is a value in hard
emission reductions targets in developed countries because they will
drive the changes in behaviour, energy efficiency and technology which
will then be required across the whole
world.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>11 March
2008; Vol. 699, c.
1412.]</div><a name="08070215000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
argument that it is all the same whether we do it ourselves or buy it
in is not accepted by Lord Turner. Given that he has been charged with
advising the Government, it seems a shame to pre-empt what he will say
by taking out some sort of assumption about the importance of domestic
effort.</div>
<a name="08070215000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
conflicting arguments, one of which is that we just want to save the
stuff. The other says that there is a leadership role both from the
point of view of British industry, as Conservative Members have said,
and&#151;I hesitate to use the &#147;M&#148; word at this
point&#151;from a moral dimension. That moral dimension says that
because, to a greater or lesser extent, we caused the problem, we have
a responsibility to make the first moves in clearing it up. That means
that we should play our part and make the adjustments
sooner.</div><a name="08070215000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we accept the long-term goal, whether that is described as a
zero-carbon Britain or a low-carbon economy, the sooner we get on with
it the better. Clause 25 allows us to put off the evil day&#151;or it
might be a good day, depending on how we look at it&#151;by getting
savings elsewhere. Our argument for retaining clause 25 is that there
is a strong case on moral, practical and even self-interested grounds
for doing far more of this ourselves than might otherwise be the
case.</div><a name="08070215000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second principal argument used against any restriction of the sort
contained in clause 25 is that it messes up emissions trading. The
point about emissions trading is that it is an elegant, market-based
solution and people will get the cheapest savings possible. People who
find it hard to make emissions savings do not have to spend huge
amounts of money as they can pay somebody who finds it easy to make
those savings and the aggregate costs are
minimised.</div><a name="08070215000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
an economist, I can see the attraction of that, but the working of the
European emissions trading scheme means that there is no conflict
between having some sort of cap on the extent to which we can opt out
of domestic effort and the ETS. That is because the ETS is operated at
an individual business location level. In other words, Governments
agree a national allocation and that is subdivided between individual
operators in the market. Once that has been done, businesses either
meet their carbon emissions cap or they under-emit and sell their
credits or over-emit and buy them in. That is true whatever we do in
Committee this afternoon. It does not matter whether it involves 100,
0, 30 or 70 credits and so on. Whatever it is, businesses
still have their caps and permits and they still buy and sell
credits.</div><a name="08070215000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing
in the Bill will change the duties of businesses to comply with their
emissions caps, so the existence of a cap and an emissions trading
scheme has no bearing on that&#151;it is totally unaffected by clause
25. On Second Reading, at least one Minister said that we should not do
this as it would interfere with emissions trading, but it has no
bearing on that
whatever.</div><a name="08070215000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we delete clause 25, there could be wholesale import, export and
crediting schemes and so on. However, we would get a perverse result.
Half our national emissions are covered by the emissions trading
scheme. That means that the total of emissions from
that source is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>given. Therefore, if every credit that we buy in is
a saving on the national account and anything that we sell is a debit,
there is no benefit from Government policies that incentivise
industries within the scope of the ETS to cut their emissions, as that
has no impact on the national carbon
account.</div><a name="08070215000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, within the scope of the ETS, the Government have a policy that
might get a particular industry to reduce its carbon emissions, which
is great, but the cap has already been fixed, so it comes in under the
total, the business sells its surplus credits abroad and that comes
through on the national carbon account. We already know what the figure
will be for that half of the
economy.</div><a name="08070215000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
worse problem is that the half of the economy with the cap and trade
will probably reduce its carbon emissions more slowly than we want to
be consistent with the rest of the Bill. Because that section of the
economy is fixed because 100 per cent. trading is allowed, the other
half of the economy potentially has to do a lot more of the legwork,
and that is inefficient. It is the opposite of the flexibility that the
Minister talked about&#151;it creates artificial divisions between
the half of the economy that is in the ETS and the other half that is
not. Government activity to incentivise business within the ETS to do
better on carbon is a waste of time from the point of view of targets.
If the Government want to hit their targets, they must do far more with
the other half of the economy, and that is profoundly
distorting.</div>
<a name="08070215000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cutting the
story short, there is no incompatibility between clause 25 and
emissions trading, which does not undermine or affect it in any way.
Deleting clause 25 would mean that everything that that half the
economy did was already predetermined in terms of the national carbon
account, so the other half would have to make most of the effort, which
seems
wrong.</div><a name="08070215000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fundamentally,
there is a strong, self-interested case for national leadership, as
well as a strong moral one, of the sort embodied in clause 25. If the
Minister wants to return with a different number, we would be happy to
debate it&#151;he could say that our 30 per cent. is as arbitrary as
his 1 per cent. It is a case of more so than not: 70 per cent.
represents more domestic effort than not, but we could have a sensible
debate about the
figures.</div><a name="08070215000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
new clause 2 is a token nod in the right direction, just &#147;having
regard to&#148; the merits of domestic effort does not really do the
job, so I hope that the Committee will resist new clause 2 and retain
clause
25.</div><a name="08070215000402"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070215000820"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): We on the Joint
Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill spent much time on this
issue, because as previous speakers have said it is incredibly
important. Our conclusions will have significant economic consequences
for British taxpayers and shareholders in British
companies.</div><a name="08070215000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Minister understands all the arguments involved, and new
clause 2 is wholly inadequate&#151;it does not mean anything and
sends a dangerous signal to British businesses that we want now to
commit to the long-term investment decisions that will make the
difference. In that context, they would need to receive a strong signal
about the commitment to reduce domestic emissions. We must not just buy
our way out of the problem in international markets.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div><a name="08070215000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not only
want British companies to reduce carbon emissions&#151;this is not
just a carbon issue&#151;but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale
of York said from the Front Bench, we want British companies and
institutes to get ahead in the journey towards a low-carbon economy,
because that is in our long-term economic
interests.</div><a name="08070215000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has spoken about striking a balance, and he knows, as does
everybody who has considered the issue, that important relevant
tensions and currents run against each other: on the one hand, the
responsibility of any Government and Parliament to ensure that our
route to reducing carbon emissions is as cost-effective as
possible&#151;the same goes for anyone running a British company in
terms of their responsibilities to shareholders &#151;and, on the
other, our moral responsibility to take a lead as a developed nation in
reducing emissions and our long-term economic interests in being at the
vanguard of a low-carbon economy. Those tensions must be
reconciled.</div><a name="08070215000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
your indulgence, Mr. Cook, I wish to make a simple point
about transparency. As has been said, the 70:30 figure is arbitrary.
There is no science to it&#151;to some degree, it has been plucked
out of the air to generate debate and to make an important point, which
is that we need to reach an agreement on where to strike this
balance.</div><a name="08070215000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Up
until now, the Government have not been transparent on that issue. In
the Environmental Audit Committee, we tracked the progress of the 2010
carbon target. When that target was published, there was no mention of
buying international credits. It was understood that it would be all
about UK domestic emission reductions. It was only when the revised
climate change programme was published in 2006 that the Government
began to count the use of carbon credits purchased from
abroad.</div>
<a name="08070215000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Environmental Audit Committee was quite shocked by a review of the
European emissions trading scheme. Our report states
that</div><a name="08070215000622"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without
the expected contribution of Phase II of the EU ETS, UK carbon
emissions in 2010 are projected to be only just over halfway to the 20%
target, a very significant shortfall.&#148;</div>
<a name="08070215000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been no
transparency up until now about the degree to which we meet our
international agreements through the purchase of international credits.
That issue needs to be brought out of the darkness and into the
light.</div><a name="08070215000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether 70:30 is the right balance&#151;I do not know
whether the Minister even knows what the right balance is&#151;but we
need a transparent number, a limit and a threshold around which we can
build a consensus. New clause 2 is too vague and will not
do.</div><a name="08070215000411"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000821"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> I think that every member of the Committee will
have received a copy of the joint statement by the World Wide Fund for
Nature, Scottish and Southern Energy, Christian Aid and the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds&#151;an unusual combination
bringing together development non-governmental organisations, wildlife
NGOs and business. Two paragraphs from that statement are worth putting
on the
record:</div><a name="08070215000623"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
organisations support the amendment as a necessary requirement to
ensure that the UK becomes a low carbon economy and does not rely too
heavily on carbon credits. A major benefit of the amendment is that it
would bolster the UK&#146;s leadership on climate change by ensuring
significant reduction efforts are made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>at home. Financial flows to developing countries should come on top of
these actions and not instead. Finally, the amendment would not
conflict with the UK&#146;s participation in the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme.</div><a name="08070215000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Government&#146;s proposed replacement amendment (New Clause 2) that
&#145;the Secretary of State must have regard to the need for UK
domestic action on climate change&#146; would provide next to no
clarity or certainty on this issue. Indeed, in WWF&#146;s opinion the
amendment is almost meaningless in addressing the key issue of whether
the UK sets itself on the path to becoming a low carbon economy and
avoids locking itself into new high carbon and long-lived
infrastructure.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister can ignore the Committee and he can ignore the House of Lords,
but I caution him that it is not necessarily sensible to ignore the
combined postcard-writing power of the WWF and the
RSPB.</div><a name="08070215000646"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45
pm</div><a name="08070215000413"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000822"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I ignore those organisations at my peril, and
spend many late nights signing letters to hon. Members who have
forwarded those postcards. I am grateful to people who write
in.</div><a name="08070215000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I deal with amendment No. 83 first? The debate has been important and
perhaps the important points made by the right hon. Member for Penrith
and The Border have been forgotten. He asked for an assurance that we
take account of the carbon sinks in the United Kingdom. As the Member
for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, I understand the point, because much
of the measurement of moorland peat is done in my constituency, and I
have been following that for some 10
years.</div><a name="08070215000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can assure the right hon. Gentleman that the carbon sinks are included
in the targets. The Bill relates to net UK emissions&#151;emissions
less removals by UK carbon sinks. That provides an important incentive
to promote carbon sinks in the United Kingdom. Indeed, the Forestry
Commission is one of the most successful organisations in the world at
increasing forestation in percentage terms, but not in total acreage,
and has responded to that very point. It relates to the subsequent
debate about the balance between overseas and domestic emissions. The
net emissions are
there.</div><a name="08070215000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can provide further reassurance. There are already well-established
mechanisms in place to ensure that removals from sinks are properly
assessed. Information must be compiled in accordance with the same
systems and international methods as for the annual emissions inventory
which the UK is already required to submit to the United Nations
framework convention on climate change. The UK emissions inventory
follows such guidance from the intergovernmental panel on climate
change which is reviewed every year by the United Nations&#151;that
is, by international experts&#151;to ensure that such practice is
followed. We intend to follow exactly the same guidance in compiling
the emissions statement, including information on removal by sinks
under clause 15. In fact, clause 29(2) requires that the amount of UK
emissions and UK removal of greenhouse gases must be determined
consistently with international carbon reporting practice, which is
defined subsequently in clause 86.</div>
<a name="08070215000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is unnecessary,
but I entirely agree that it backs up the point about basing our net
emissions measurements on science and not on a political fix. It also,
conveniently, helps me with my argument against subsequent speakers,
and I shall explain why.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div><a name="08070215000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
heart of the debate and hon. Members on both sides made their arguments
strongly and passionately. Let me try to explain the
Government&#146;s argument. We have discussed Government amendments
to clause 14 on the balance between UK emissions, action within the EU,
and international action. That was a key issue, as has been said, when
the Bill was debated in the other place, and the Government have given
it significant consideration since then. In the debates on the Bill
there has sometimes seemed to be a mistaken idea that this Government,
or a future Government, will do anything they can to buy their way out
of reducing UK emissions, by purchasing international credits instead.
However, we all recognise that the world as a whole will only tackle
climate change if developed countries such as ours reduce their
emissions significantly. That is why we have tabled new clause 2. If
accepted, it will place into legislation for the first time the need
for UK domestic action on climate change. The new clause is intended to
set out plainly the belief of Government and, we hope, Parliament that
we need to reduce our domestic emissions if we are going to meet our
targets and encourage others to reduce their emissions as
well.</div>
<a name="08070215000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
also must not lose sight of the reality that climate change is a global
challenge. We need global emissions to halve by 2050, based on the 2
deg C increase that we talked about at clause 1. The international
carbon market will be the key to achieving the scale of investment
flows necessary to achieve that, which are estimated to be in the
hundreds of billions of dollars, over and above the additional public
money&#151;additional to official development assistance&#151;that
is required. We need action at European Union and international level,
as well as at domestic level, if the world is to tackle climate change.
We do not believe that the policy outlined in clause 25 is the right
one. Apart from the point that clause 25 is inflexible&#151;I do not
want to debate that as it is helpful to specify a figure&#151;the
70:30 limit is arbitrary.</div>
<a name="08070215000420"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000823"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The Minister will be familiar with the
conclusions of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. It
positively recommended that the provision to allow for international
credits should be strictly limited to a quantifiable amount, to be
advised by the Committee on Climate Change for each budgetary period.
What is absent from the new clause is the recognition that although we
want to contribute, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood
said, in the original budget for 2010 there was no mention of any part
being allocated to international credits.</div>
<a name="08070215000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000824"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Indeed, we looked at the Select Committee report
and other recommendations when considering the new clause and I hope
that the hon. Lady expects an honest disagreement. Let me explain why
there are problems with the idea of setting a fixed limit in the way in
which clause 25 suggests. The UK&#146;s policy in this regard is
firmly rooted within a joint-European Union effort. That is one of the
most successful, if not the most successful, area of European Union
solidarity in terms of world leadership. As it stands, clause 25 fails
to recognise the crucial role of action at the European Union
level.</div>
<a name="08070215000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Northavon made some important points about the construct of
the ETS. If one looks at clause 25 in the context of the ETS, it
creates an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>artificial distinction between domestic action and other action in the
European context. That would create a significant risk of cutting
across the ability of the United Kingdom&#146;s companies to
participate freely in the EU ETS. The EU ETS is a stepping stone to the
ultimate prize&#151;a global carbon market that sets an absolute cap
on emissions. The rest of the world is not only watching the EU very
carefully, but in some cases, including within the United States, is
now following it. Under the EU ETS rules, it does not matter if UK
companies reduce their own emissions or buy allowances from another EU
country, where the same emissions reductions might be made more
cheaply. However, under clause 25, emissions credits bought under ETS,
even from another developed country such as Germany or France, would
count as being overseas action and would be counted against the 30 per
cent. limit or any other limit that we would set. That would create
huge uncertainty and would risk increasing costs as well, as the
Government have little or no control over the commercial decisions in
the
ETS.</div><a name="08070215000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me quote what Lord Turner of Ecchinswell said on this issue when he
appeared before the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, which the hon. Member for Vale of York
mentioned:</div><a name="08070215000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Of
course, it is important within the European Emissions Trading Scheme to
realise that we cannot actually in advance define the maximum amount of
buy-in which will occur from the rest of Europe to the UK. That is not
a policy variable which the UK Government or any other
government&#148;</div><a name="08070215000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">within
the EU&#151;actually, he did not say &#147;within the EU&#148;,
but that was the
context&#151;</div><a name="08070215000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;can
pre-fix within the scheme. The amount of buy-in will be whatever the
market determines and will only become clear as we move towards the end
of a budget
period.&#148;</div><a name="08070215000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet
clause 25 invites us to do the exact opposite, defining now, in 2008,
what the maximum amount of credits will be, as bought in from within
Europe and from the rest of the world, all the way to 2050 and
beyond.</div><a name="08070215000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me further back up my argument by mentioning what Lord Taylor of
Holbeach, the Opposition spokesman, said in the other place,
when discussing the
amendment:</div><a name="08070215000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
fixed percentage in the Bill may not be the best way of going about
that.</div> <a name="08070215000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is, addressing
decarbonisation&#151;</div><a name="08070215000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
understand the difficulties in placing such a precise figure in the
Bill, which range from the constraints of the international negotiation
tables to the fact that the carbon market will look a lot different in
42 years.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords</i>11
March 2008; Vol. 699, c.
1407.]</div><a name="08070215000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a difficulty, first, in the context of the
ETS.</div><a name="08070215000429"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000825"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The Minister is answering the point thoughtfully and
seriously, but he is saying essentially that the UK Government are
indifferent about domestic emission cuts and that those bought in from,
say, Germany&#151;a country like ours&#151;or Poland, or a much
poorer country. However, our argument is that it is not a matter of
indifference. Surely, there are strong arguments why the UK would want,
as a positive policy goal, to favour domestic cuts, as even new clause
2 says. His argument that we should just be neutral within the ETS is
inconsistent with his own new clause 2.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div><a name="08070215000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000826"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I have so far advanced the argument about the ETS.
I have another argument that I wish to develop, which encompasses the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="08070215000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, we recognise how important it is that the Bill demonstrates the
need for domestic action to reduce UK emissions and&#151;to address
the point that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made&#151;to
ensure the maximum possible transparency about our plans for meeting
targets and moving the UK to a low-carbon economy. That is why we have
tabled Government amendment No. 8, which we have already discussed, and
new clause 2, which we are debating
now.</div><a name="08070215000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 would place the Secretary of State under a legal duty to
consider the need to reduce UK emissions of greenhouse gases when
considering how to meet the targets and budgets. That important step
forward represents a constructive response to the concerns expressed in
Parliament. It will, if agreed to, set out unequivocally
Parliament&#146;s desire that the UK should move to a low-carbon
economy. New clause 2 will mean that, when developing policies to meet
carbon budgets, the Secretary of State must keep in mind the need to
reduce UK emissions and the positive benefits in doing so, including
improved energy efficiency, which will of course reduce energy bills;
demonstrating our commitment to take action on climate change to
international partners; helping to meet our international obligations;
helping to meet other policy objectives, such as improving air
quality; and addressing the advantages to UK competitiveness of
developing the technologies and industries that can achieve low carbon.
We agree that there needs to be a balance. It is up to developed
countries to show the
way.</div><a name="08070215000647"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8
pm</div><a name="08070215000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
global low-carbon energy market is already worth $38 billion and
employs 1.7 million people. Within the UK, the environmental goods and
services market is likely to grow from &#163;25 billion in 2005 to
nearly double that by 2015. We believe that, taken together, the
Government amendments will ensure that decisions on the appropriate
balance between action at domestic, EU and international level are
first, based on independent and expert advice from the Committee on
Climate Change, secondly, transparent, thirdly, sufficiently flexible
to take account of changes to the international context between now and
2050, and fourthly, guided by the need for UK domestic action on
climate change.</div>
<a name="08070215000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
accusation is made or the implication is drawn that the United Kingdom
Government want the policy to pay off our conscience&#151;so we can
pay someone else to reduce emissions. That is the proposition that is
made; I will not use the word allegation. That allegation misses two
fundamental points. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">] </i>Sorry, I meant
to say proposition. The hour is late, Mr.  Cook and I, like
you, am bored with my voice. The proposition misses two fundamental
points. First, the United Kingdom&#146;s CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions
within our borders are 2 per cent., but the emissions from United
Kingdom&#146;s world economic activity are around 15 per cent. Our
carbon footprint goes way beyond our shores. The mechanisms that we
believe that we must have to address global emissions must take that
point on board. The 15 per cent. carbon footprint is our goal, not just
the 2 per cent. Of course the credibility of the clean development
mechanism and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>the other mechanisms is crucial, but one should not
confuse problems with the CDM with arguments against the need for
offsetting.</div>
<a name="08070215000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on
the whole, developing countries in the G77 welcome and support this
approach, because it provides them with a flow of finance in addition
to overseas development aid that can help to ensure that their
prosperity can grow through low-carbon technology. When one debates in
the international forums on 30:70 or another figure, one hears a plea
from the developing to the developed countries to allow maximum
flexibility, so that the carbon markets can provide a flow of finance
to develop economic prosperity in those countries. I ask colleagues to
consider those two points when they make their
decision.</div>
<a name="08070215000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000827"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> No one disputes the value of the international
capital flows that the Minister has described, but the debate is about
finding a balance. I have listened to him carefully and I think that
the record will show that in the previous debate he talked about the
Government&#146;s desire to have the flexibility to go up to 100 per
cent. of international credits. Where is the reassurance about the
transparency that I was seeking? Where in this process do the
Government imagine we will have a transparent threshold for the
deployment of international credits, or are they trying to avoid that
completely?</div><a name="08070215000437"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000828"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He asks
questions and follows the debates closely. The reassurance that he
seeks is in the amendments that we have already tabled. Clause 35(2)
requires the Committee on Climate Change to comment on action, and new
clause 2, which the hon. Gentleman said was inadequate and not tough
enough for him, places a new legal duty upon us, as I have described. I
hope that the combination of those two factors, which the Government
have considered since the debate in the other place, will be enough. We
are in danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater by not
grasping the profound importance of placing our statutory, legally
binding commitment within the international context of the EU and wider
international
agreements.</div><a name="08070215000438"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000893"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 58, 59
and 62, which would change the nomination procedures and composition of
the Committee on Climate Change. The adjustments that we propose would
make the committee more independent, more scientific and better
equipped to deal with the new responsibilities that have been given to
it.</div>
<a name="08070215000527"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Bill
stands, the committee seems too small to cope with those extra duties.
Amendment No. 58 would increase its membership to ensure that the
additional burdens could be covered adequately. We believe that a
membership of seven is not quite sufficient. It is important to ensure
that the committee is able to give due attention to those matters as
well as to nominate people with relevant experience. We therefore
believe that it is important to allow the option to increase the
committee to no fewer than seven members and no more than 12.</div>
<a name="08070215000528"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
59 relates to the nomination procedure. To ensure the independence of
the committee, we believe that approximately half of the appointments
should be made by the Royal Society. That would depoliticise the
committee, so that we did not end with a group of people potentially
beholden to Ministers, political parties or special interest groups. I
expect that there might be some
criticism&#151;</div><a name="08070215000648"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.16

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000894"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I am delighted to resume proceedings,
Mr. Cook. As I was saying, the amendment is an effort to
depoliticise the committee and not end up with a group of people who
are potentially beholden to Ministers of the day, political parties or
special interest groups. There might be some criticism that the Royal
Society has its own internal politics. It has been mentioned in
previous debates that the world of science is not one of monolithic
agreement and unified opinion, but I hope that members of the Committee
will agree with the intention behind the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
needs to be a mechanism to ensure that appropriate experts and
scientists are appointed to the committee through a process that is
apolitical, independent and credible. What assurance can the Minister
give that that will be the case, even if he can explain that
nominations and appointments will be carried out with the utmost care
and contentiousness? We do not doubt the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>Government&#146;s commitment to ensure that members of the committee
are indeed appropriate, but we consider that there needs to be a
provision under the Bill to ensure that that will continue to happen in
future. What mechanisms are in place to ensure that, after the initial
appointments, the committee will continue to be truly
independent?</div><a name="08070215000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am keen to move on to amendment No. 63, but amendments Nos. 59 to 62
are effectively probing amendments, so I shall confine my
remarks.</div><a name="08070215000534"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000895"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Amendment No. 60 would remove the devolved
Administrations from any decision in respect of the appointment of the
chair. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he has tabled such an
amendment?</div><a name="08070215000535"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000896"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> No, I cannot&#151;off the top of my head. If I
were a Minister, I would promise to write to the hon. Gentleman.
However, I am not, so I shall have a word with you outside in the
corridor
later.</div><a name="08070215000536"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000897"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It is delightful to be resuming our business,
even at this slightly late hour. I congratulate all those Labour
Members present on their stamina, although I warn them that Liberal
Democrats will talk about climate change until Christmas if given half
a chance. However, I shall try to be brief in the interests of
everyone&#146;s blood
pressure.</div><a name="08070215000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are happy to support amendments Nos. 58 and 61. Amendment No. 58 is
wise. It would increase the potential for a diverse committee with a
range of expertise, while amendment No. 61 quite rightly seems designed
to reinforce Select Committee scrutiny. Amendment No. 59 and its
derivative, amendment No. 62, would give an interesting role to a
charitable body, the Royal Society, which also has within its
charitable objects and strategies the remit to influence the
Government&#146;s policy, so in a sense it is a logical and
appropriate body to be reflected in the Bill as a strong, independent
voice.</div><a name="08070215000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only slight worry is that the Royal Society might consider that its
freedom of action to criticise the Government&#146;s policy would be
compromised by the arrangement. Nevertheless, the amendment is
important. We suggested an alternative amendment, which has not been
selected. It would have provided the SDC with an independent remit and
expertise in a wide range of areas relating to sustainable development.
It was an alternative for the Government to reflect on, if they
considered that the Royal Society was
inappropriate.</div><a name="08070215000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am completely baffled by amendment No. 60, which seems designed to
irritate the Scots and the Welsh and to re-impose of central UK
authority by the Conservative party. However, since the hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle is as baffled by his own amendment as we are, I
suggest that we do not spend further time on
it.</div><a name="08070215000650"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000898"></a>David
Maclean:</b> In rising to support the amendments, I want to
press the Minister to confirm that, among the membership under
paragraph (3)(b) to schedule 1, those with expertise in climate change
policy at national and international level and, in particular, the
social aspects of such policy, will have a detailed knowledge of the
impact on indigenous peoples in rain forest areas of the world. I also
seek his assurance that any other experts in</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="08070215000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;climate science,
and other branches of environmental science&#148;</div>
<a name="08070215000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">will have expertise in
biodiversity in particular, and also the rain
forests.</div><a name="08070215000542"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000899"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I want to make a number of points about amendments
Nos. 58, 59, 60, 61 and 62. First, my answer to the right hon. Member
for Penrith and The Border, is yes. That point has been raised
throughout the proceedings and on Second Reading by a number of hon.
Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)
has also raised the point and written to me about it, and I was able to
give her the reassurances that she sought. Expertise is also included
in the adaptation
sub-committee.</div><a name="08070215000543"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
five amendments would increase the size of the Committee on Climate
Change and remove the devolved Administrations&#146; input. To be
fair to the hon. Gentleman, he said that they were probing amendments,
so I will not tease him about forgetting the Scots&#151;I will leave
that for another occasion. They also aim to ensure that all nominations
are considered and approved by a relevant Commons Select Committee. The
practical effect of the amendments would be to create a larger
committee than currently envisaged of between seven and 12 who have
been approved or appointed by a Commons Select Committee. Half the
committee would be nominated by national authorities, and half would be
nominated by the President of the Royal Society. Amendment
No. 60 specifically requires the chair to be appointed only
by the Secretary of State, as opposed to national authorities
collectively.</div><a name="08070215000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the intention of the amendments is to create a larger
and more scientific body and to bring further transparency and rigour
to the process by giving Parliament a role. Let me reassure the hon.
Gentleman about the method of appointment of the committee. The
committee will be first of its kind. It will be a UK-wide body
reflecting the nature of the devolution settlements. Identical
amendments were discussed in the other place, and the
Government&#146;s view has not
changed.</div><a name="08070215000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that between five and eight members plus the chair is a good
size. The shadow chair agrees with that point of view, as he stated in
his evidence to the EFRA Committee in March. It strikes the right
balance between ensuring that the committee contains a good mix of
relevant experience and making sure that the committee is focused and
dynamic. Amendment No. 58 would increase the number of committee
members to between seven and 12, which would be a mistake because the
committee would be too large to be
focused.</div><a name="08070215000546"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000900"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Is the Minister saying that the Cabinet is not
focused? The Cabinet is twice that size. Maybe that accounts for recent
developments.</div><a name="08070215000547"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000901"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> God so loved the world that he sent his only son
and not a committee. I believe that there is a balance, given the remit
of work to be done. The Committee on Climate Change needs to have a
focused agenda, particularly running through to the period of 1
December, which we have discussed. I am mindful of the size and shape
of the committee. My noble Friend Lord Rooker gave a commitment in the
other place that the Secretary of State and the chair would review the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>committee&#146;s size during its first year of
operation and increase it using the powers already in the Bill, if
necessary. It would be a bit hasty if we were to increase the size
significantly now.</div>
<a name="08070215000548"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
mentioned the obvious about the devolved Administrations and the impact
of amendment No. 60. To reassure the Committee that the
committee&#146;s appointments will be independent, the appointment
processes will, of course, be conducted in accordance with the Nolan
principles and monitored by the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments. That is to make sure that the committee is not formed of
people who are beholden to Ministers, political parties or special
interest groups. I hope that gives
reassurance.</div><a name="08070215000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 59 and 62 change the operation of the appointments process so that
the Royal Society is responsible for appointing half of the committee
members. We are concerned that that would make the appointments process
less transparent. Indeed, Lord Rees of Ludlow, a former president of
the Royal Society, made his views clear when discussing the amendment.
He said that it would not be reasonable to expect a body such as the
Royal Society to appoint members. I assure the Committee that we
consult the Royal Society on appointments related to scientific
matters, which I have recently done with regard to the
committee on radioactive
processing.</div><a name="08070215000550"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000902"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. My point,
which has just occurred to me, relates to a slightly different aspect
of what he is discussing. The committee will consist of a chairman and
a maximum of eight other people, yet paragraph 1(3) lists nine distinct
disciplines on which an expert is needed&#151;that is only one of
each. When the Bill says &#147;climate change&#148; and
&#147;other branches of...science&#148;, it can only be at
most one person. Unless there are more than nine people on the
committee, not all the disciplines and skills will be covered. Or am I
utterly
wrong?</div><a name="08070215000551"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000903"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> No, the right hon. Gentleman is not utterly wrong.
I remember asking that very question myself six months ago. I took
advice and said that we should review the matter during the course of
the year&#151;I have already committed to
that.</div><a name="08070215000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me reassure the right hon. Gentleman further. One of the first
appointments to the committee, in its shadow form, was Lord Robert May,
who is an expert ecologist. I believe that, through his appointment, we
have demonstrated our commitment to ensure that the committee considers
the impact of its recommendations on the natural environment. However,
Lord May has other expertise. We have really got the best and
brightest, as is evident through the chair, who has taken on board a
number of skills, experience and expertise. I am confident that we have
the stature and status of committee that we
require.</div><a name="08070215000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the first job of the committee is to advise on the setting of budgets,
so we will review its composition during the course of the year. I give
the reassurance that all the appointments are within the correct
procedures of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments,
which, I can assure you, Mr. Cook, are robust and prevent
Ministers from interfering unduly while maintaining accountability to
Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div><a name="08070215000554"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000904"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> As I said at the outset, the amendments are
probing. To a certain extent, I was reassured by the Minister&#146;s
comments about possible future flexibility on the size of the
committee, because it seems to us, despite the evident expertise of the
existing members, that the committee is nevertheless taking on a huge
task. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border has
pointed out, extraordinary expertise will be called upon if the
committee is to do its job properly. Likewise, in an ideal world, we
would prefer a more independent appointment process, but at this stage
we take the assurances of the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000555"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08070215000556"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000905"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in
schedule 1, page 44, line 36, at
end insert</div> <a name="08070229000006"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and each
term of office must be at least six
years&#146;.</div><a name="08070215000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment proposes a statutory minimum on the term limit of members of
the committee. There are a number of reasons for having a statutory
minimum. As evidenced by the debate so far, there is support in the
House for making the committee independent, scientific and apolitical.
I hope that the Minister will appreciate my scepticism when this
Government have stuffed so many commissions and quangos with members of
their own party. A six-year commitment would mean not only that members
outlast a Government, but that they are locked in for the long haul. It
would be a shame to see a Government replacing members after a year or
two because they did not like the advice that they were
receiving.</div><a name="08070215000558"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000906"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain the meaning of
the term &#147;locked in&#148;? If a member of the committee wanted
to resign, as Lord Turner intends to do, would they be prevented from
doing
so?</div><a name="08070215000559"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000907"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> No, a member would not be prevented from
resigning, but they would be prevented from reappointing themselves if
the term of their appointment were less than that which I propose. The
impartiality of the experts is arguably the committee&#146;s greatest
source of authority, and a longer term would help to ensure that that
is protected. Under the amendment, committee members would sit for
longer than a budgetary period, guaranteeing that they would be on the
committee when it makes at least one of the reports on the five-year
budget periods. Given the number of reports that the committee will be
responsible for preparing, continuity is certainly
advantageous.</div><a name="08070215000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
six years seems like a reasonable term limit, hon. Members will
appreciate that the amendment was motivated by impartiality and
continuity. Will the Minister explain what mechanisms are in place in
the Bill to ensure that those two vital aspects of the Committee are
respected?</div><a name="08070215000561"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000908"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I, too, support the amendment. Had I studied it
more carefully, I would have suggested the slight refinement of making
the limit between four and six years. It is important that members are
on the committee for an average of about five years, not so that they
can be locked in, but so that there is continuity. We do not want to
lose all members after five or six years. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>In the case of national park appointments, if there
are 14 people in a national park, their appointments do not all come up
for renewal at once. Some are on a cycle of four years; some are on a
cycle of five years; and some only three years, which is far too short.
It would be best if we had assurances from the Minister that there will
be a minimum term appointment of say four years with some being
appointed for five and some for six with a rolling
spread.</div><a name="08070215000562"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000909"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The amendment was discussed in the other place, so
I am in danger of repetition. I will start by explaining for the record
that the Government&#146;s intention is that the first committee
members should be appointed for a term of five years. For current
committee members, the five years will include the time that they have
spent working on the shadow body, which will meet the proposals in some
respects. That is not stated in the Bill, because it is not normal
practice to specify a term of office in primary
legislation.</div><a name="08070215000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment suggests a term of appointment of six years. I think that
that is bit too long, and I will explain why. Public appointments are
usually for terms of three years each. Whatever their duration, they
are restricted under the Nolan principles and the Office of the
Commissioner for Public Appointments rules to two terms. In total, that
cannot exceed 10 years. While a five-year term allows the Government of
the day to extend an appointment, assuming that the OCPA rules are met,
a six-year appointment may not be doubled because of the duration
limit.</div><a name="08070215000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my noble Friend Lord Rooker said in the other place, the arrangements
satisfy the points made by the amendment. The practical impact of a
six-year limit would be to stop somebody from being reappointed for a
second term, whatever the merits of their expertise and so
on.</div><a name="08070215000565"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000910"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I thank the Minister for that explanation and I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000911"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 64, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000912"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 65, in schedule 1, page 45, line 10, leave out
&#145;otherwise&#146; and insert &#145;physically or

Barker:</b> The amendments outline various instances that
should prevent somebody from being a member of the Committee on Climate
Change. Our intention is to clarify a few of the reasons why a member
can be excluded. The amendments would add a few points that we hope
will not find too much discord in the Committee. The purpose of the
amendments is simply to make the Committee on Climate Change more
robust by adding a few more situations that we feel should result in
removal or
exclusion.</div><a name="08070215000569"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
pm</div><a name="08070215000570"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are designed to clarify what is meant in the Bill by
&#147;otherwise unable or unfit&#148; to serve on the committee. We
suggest, first, the phrase &#147;reasonable opinion&#148; and,
secondly, the phrase &#147;physically or mentally unfit&#148;. We
hope that our intention of increasing the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>clarity of the provision is welcomed by hon.
Members. The proposal would not only provide clarity, but tighten the
scope of the removal process so that only those who were truly
physically or mentally unfit were excluded, not those whom the national
authorities merely deemed unfit to serve. We hope that the Minister
will welcome this
clarification.</div><a name="08070215000571"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000914"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I understand the spirit in which amendments Nos.
64 and 65 have been tabled. Perhaps the Conservative party is imagining
nefarious goings on in which appointments are made for political
reasons and there are then attempts to remove members from the
committee for political reasons, so that if control of the national
Government in Scotland changed from Scottish National party to Labour
or even Liberal Democrat, political affiliations might be sought out
and people might be removed at sudden
notice.</div><a name="08070215000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that amendment No. 64 would be a sensible tightening of the
wording, but I am puzzled by amendment No. 65 because there are other
bases on which people might be unfit to serve on a committee of this
stature other than being physically or mentally unfit. I appreciate
that the amendment is perhaps designed to prevent people from being
removed because their opinions are controversial. That would be an
unfortunate move, but what if their scientific credibility had been
compromised? What if they had been caught out indulging in plagiarism
or their professional reputation had been compromised by particular
revelations? Those might be unfortunate developments that we would not
like to happen, but the wording in amendment No. 65 is much too
prescriptive.</div><a name="08070215000573"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000915"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Again, these amendments were discussed in the
other place and consideration was given to them by their lordships. The
circumstances in which the national authorities may remove a member are
set out in the four sub-paragraphs of paragraph 5 of schedule 1. I want
to highlight the fact that this is a standard power in relation to many
non-departmental public bodies, which this committee is. We expect that
it would be exercised only in exceptional circumstances, but it is
important to make certain that the committee can carry out its duties
appropriately.</div><a name="08070215000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment No. 64, the national authorities, when forming an opinion of
whether a member of the committee was unfit or unable to carry out
their duties, would have to reach an opinion that was
&#147;reasonable&#148;. The amendment is unnecessary, as their
lordships accepted, because the duty for national authorities to act
reasonably and, in this case, to form a reasonable opinion is already
in place under the well-established general principles of public law,
including within the procedures identified in the Nolan report for
public appointments. That is therefore already implicit in the
schedule, so I see no reason to add
it.</div><a name="08070215000575"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000916"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> If there was a change of Administration at
national level, would the removal of a member of the committee for
political reasons be considered reasonable under the legal terms that
the Minister is talking
about?</div><a name="08070215000576"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000917"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I have just given the reason why we think that it
is unnecessary to add the provision. We think that it would be
detrimental to add it precisely because of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point. Let me give a brief explanation. Amendment No. 65 would reduce
the scope 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>of the words &#147;unable or unfit&#148; by specifying that members
may be removed by national authorities only if they are
&#147;physically or mentally&#148; unable or unfit to carry out
their duties. Paragraph 5(d) is an important provision that allows the
national authorities to remove or exclude a member in a number of very
limited circumstances. It is important not to tighten the scope for the
removal processes, for obvious reasons. The words &#147;unable or
unfit&#148; may cover certain circumstances that impact on a
member&#146;s ability to do the job, such as serious illness that
prevents attendance at meetings, or it could cover other situations,
such as a conflict of interest that was not a problem when the member
was originally appointed to the committee. There might be other
unforeseen circumstances. It is a standard provision that ensures that
the committee can function properly, and that members who cannot fulfil
their duties appropriately for whatever reason can be removed. However,
I stress that the power is to be exercised only in limited
circumstances. It is not a power for the national authorities to use to
remove a member without just cause or reasonable consideration. That is
outlined in well-established public laws on such matters. We believe
that following the well-established procedures and laws will achieve
the right balance between what the amendment seeks and what there is a
desire to protect against.</div>
<a name="08070215000577"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000918"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I listened to the Minister with interest and have
I taken on board what was said by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. In
light of our discussions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08070215000578"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="08070215000579"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000919"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 66, in
schedule 1, page 45, line 34, leave
out from &#145;executive&#146; to end of line
35.</div><a name="08070215000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bill stands, the appointment of the chief executive by the
committee is subject to the approval of the national authorities. We
consider that intervention by the national authorities in the make-up
of the committee is undesirable. The role of the chief executive is
important. The committee should be left to decide the appointment, but
although it can choose the chief executive, the appointment must be
approved by the national authorities. Will the Minister explain the
necessity for political approval regarding a scientific committee from
Whitehall or the devolved Administrations? We have said that the
committee should be genuinely independent. Having such an approval
process will diminish that independence.</div>
<a name="08070215000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
motivation for having an independent committee is two-fold. Not only
will it ensure that the committee can make its decisions without regard
to political expediency, but it will ensure that the committee does not
appear to be making decisions that could be interpreted&#151;or
misinterpreted&#151;as political manoeuvres. That second reason alone
should be enough to remove the provision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>for national authority approval. It should not appear that the choice
was made in such a way that it could be considered to be a political
appointment. The choice should be made resoundingly on the merits of
the person&#146;s ability to fulfil that important
job.</div>
<a name="08070215000582"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000920"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Again, I have some sympathy with the amendment.
However, I shall explain how far we have moved, and I hope to persuade
the hon. Gentleman not to press it to a Division.</div>
<a name="08070215000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure the
committee&#146;s independence, we have from the outset given it the
power to appoint its own staff. It is a non-departmental public body.
The committee must appoint a chief executive, and it may also appoint
other employees. I have some sympathy with the intentions behind the
amendment, which would further strengthen the independence of the
committee.</div>
<a name="08070215000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
having listened to the recommendations made during pre-legislative
scrutiny, we amended the draft Bill to confirm that the committee will
appoint all chief executives. Previously, provisions allowed the
national authorities to appoint the first chief executive. However,
having listened to the views of others, we do not consider it
appropriate to remove completely the requirement for the
committee&#146;s chosen candidate to be approved by the national
authorities, as proposed in the amendment.</div>
<a name="08070215000585"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the
view also of the Joint Committee. When it considered the draft Bill
last summer, it decided that the committee should appoint the chief
executive, but that the national authorities should approve the
appointment. The Secretary of State is ultimately accountable to
Parliament. It is taxpayers&#146; money, and Parliament has the right
to hold the Secretary of State to account. The chief executive will
also be the accounting officer of the Committee on Climate Change. That
is a crucial part of the role, just as it is for a permanent secretary
in a Department. It is important that the Secretary of State should be
confident that the person selected by the committee is
suitable.</div><a name="08070215000586"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have considered the matter, moved towards the point of view proposed in
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, and gained the Joint
Committee&#146;s support for the position that we have arrived at. We
think that it strikes the right balance between independence and
accountability while allowing the committee to appoint its own chief
executive.</div>
<a name="08070215000587"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070215000921"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I thank the Minister. I appreciate that he has
moved some degree towards our position. We think that independence of
appointment is of the utmost importance, but in light of the fact that
he is coming towards our position and of the importance that we place
on consensus where possible, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070215000588"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
