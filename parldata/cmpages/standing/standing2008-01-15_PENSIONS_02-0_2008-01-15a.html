								Joanne

						</i> One of the ways in which we can make sure
that personal accounts are adequately targeted is by ensuring that the
Bill is crystal clear on this point. One of the things that we would
like to see is an amendment to the Bill that, where we are talking
about the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>principles, makes it absolutely clear that PADA is focusing personal
accounts on those who currently have no pension

							<a name="080115121000163"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> In terms of pension provision more broadly, the
aim, obviously, is that people should go to not just personal accounts,
but other types of pension schemes. The aim of
personal accounts is to complement, rather than to compete with,
existing pension provision. Therefore, how do we ensure that other
pension schemes, such as some of the ones that you represent, are able
to access those who are currently without
provision?</div>

								Joanne
Segars:
							</b>
						</i> As you know, NAPF has been a strong supporter
of auto-enrolment. Many of our member schemes already adopt
auto-enrolment. Those that do not&#151;75 per cent.&#151;will need
to make changes as a result of auto-enrolment in the personal account
process. Schemes seem to be well geared up for that. We think that one
of the things that could make sure that those schemes are still around
in 2012 is pursuing the package of simplification and deregulation
measures that you have started to bring
forward.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): May I just follow up
that question by putting a similar question to Stephen Haddrill? More
specifically, what kind of measures do you think should be in the Bill
to minimise the erosion of existing provision, particularly to avoid
the worst case scenario painted recently by the Pensions Policy
Institute about the levelling down of existing
provision?</div>
					<a name="080115121000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Stephen
Haddrill:
							</b>
						</i> First, on the point about levelling down,
there is going to be a risk of levelling down the more an employer has
to decide and the more complex that decision is. If employers face a
situation where, for instance, they are potentially going to end up
with an existing pension scheme and having to set up a personal
account, they are going to think quite hard about whether they want to
carry on with an existing pension scheme that has a higher level of
pension contribution from the employer than the personal account will
do. We think that that kind of simplicity will mean that employers will
keep their existing provision. At the moment, we have about 100,000
group personal pensions provided by the insurance industry, and the
average employer contribution into those schemes is 6 per cent. There
is &#163;900 million going into those schemes every year, so that is
an awful lot to lose if it is levelled down to a 3 per cent. personal
account. That is very
important.</div>
					<a name="080115121000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you
will forgive me for going on for a second, the other issue is whether
the personal account system is going to remain targeted at the people
it is really designed for&#151;those who do not have any pension
provision at the moment and are on low to middle incomes&#151;or it
is going to draw in, as I am afraid that stakeholder did, a much
better-off and more affluent person? Money speaks, and we fear then
that personal accounts will get delivered for the people with more
money. That is why we do not like the idea of high levels of
contribution being allowed during the year&#151;the Minister has
given assurances on that, but we do not see that &#163;3,600 figure
on the cap actually on the face of the Bill. We would much prefer that
to be in the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>
					<a name="080115121000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not see anything about
transfers in from other schemes on the face of the Bill in terms of
them being stopped, which is what we would like to see. I think that we
should also be very cautious indeed about random lump-sum
contributions&#151;in fact, not allow them&#151;into these schemes,
because they will not be matched by an employer contribution and they
will not necessarily be the right thing to do. This is an advice-free
zone&#151;rightly, we think, because of the cost&#151;so people
will be making mistakes, and, in 20 years&#146; time, liabilities
will be laid at the door of the Government as a result. Rather a long
list, I am afraid, but the points are
important.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="080115121000165"></a>Mr.
Waterson:
						</b> Can I just follow up on one point? Going back to
group personal pension schemes, what is your preferred solution to the
problem? Joanne and Dick might also want to have a go at this. What do
you think that we should do about what everyone acknowledges is a
problem because of European
legislation?</div>
					<a name="080115121000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Stephen
Haddrill:
							</b>
						</i> The problem arises from European
legislation&#151;you are quite right. We think that the best
possible solution is to persuade the European
Commission and our partners in Europe to change the legislation. We
think that the Government should strenuously pursue that because the
European legislation was designed to promote a single
market&#151;cross-border trade. This has nothing to do with
cross-border trade, and while the Government have a difficulty in that
probably no other member state has this problem, that should, I think,
be taken as an advantage, since no other member state would necessarily
oppose what we want to do here. I therefore think that vigorous pursuit
of that is very
important.</div>
					<a name="080115121000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond
that, the insurance industry does pursue what we call streamlined
joining&#151;techniques to encourage people to join a group personal
pension through an e-joining mechanism, through face-to-face joining
being arranged by the provider, and so on&#151;with simplified forms
and simplified letters. We get a high level of take-up when that is
done by the companies, so we feel that streamlined joining should be
allowed. Where that is taking place, the employer should have an
exemption from having to set up a personal account, which would bring
in complexity and the likelihood of levelling
down.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Joanne
Segars:
							</b>
						</i> We do. We agree with the ABI and, I think,
with the Investment Management Association,<b class="B"> </b>that the preferred
solution would be to sort this problem out through a change in European
legislation. In the absence of that, we take a different view from the
ABI. Our preferred solution is that auto-enrolment
should, as nearly as possible, apply to group personal pensions and
workplace personal pensions. We do not believe there should be an
exemption for workplace personal pensions&#151;we believe that that
would undermine the principle of auto-enrolment that is at the heart of
these reforms, and on which the success of personal accounts really
depends. It would create an uneven regulatory and cost playing field
between occupational pensions&#151;whether defined-benefit or
defined-contribution pensions&#151;and workplace personal pensions.
The cost of auto-enrolment to occupational pension schemes is between
&#163;1 billion and &#163;2 billion a year.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>
					<a name="080115121000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also slightly unclear as
to how some of the solutions around streamlined joining&#151;which,
as I understand it, is by no means universally applied by the insurance
companies&#151;would work in practice combined with targets. We
believe a better solution lies in requiring employers to auto-enrol in
workplace personal pensions through a system of master trusts. We
believe that that is feasible, affordable and
workable.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Dick
Saunders:
							</b>
						</i> I would support what Stephen has said on
this. Clearly, the best solution would be to negotiate an acceptable
outcome in Brussels. This is, quite clearly, an unintended consequence
of the directive. Between the two alternatives, I think it is very easy
to underestimate the cost to the financial services industry of
imposing a so-called master trust system. I think that that would need
to be thought through very carefully indeed. It is not just the life
insurance industry that would face those costs, but the fund management
industry as well. Bear in mind that what we have here is, in essence, a
transitional problem. It will not be a problem for anybody joining a
scheme after 2012 because it will be impossible to incorporate it into
their contract of employment. Assuming we cannot negotiate a solution
in Europe, I would suggest that some kind of short-term, flexible,
transitional remedy, perhaps based around streamlined joining, would be
the way
forward.</div>

investment management industry, or a part of the investment management
industry, would get the job of managing the money here, but in terms of
its significance to the industry as a whole, it would be pretty small
in relation to the fact that the UK asset management industry now looks
after &#163;3,000 billion. This would be nothing like that amount,
and what is more&#151;and rightly&#151;the management fees on the
mandates to look after the personal accounts money would be very modest
indeed. Indeed, that is one of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>purposes of personal accounts. So while business for the investment
management industry would come out of this scheme, it would certainly
not be something of huge significance to the

group personal pension into something else, which we regard as
significant. Earlier, we were heavily involved in trying to assess what
was an acceptable cost for a personal account to be charged out at, but
that has been the limit of our
involvement.</div>

Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con):
May I ask what your views are on the issue of possible future legal
liability in relation to generic financial advice? We have obviously
just been through the saga of the 125,000 to 140,000 people whose
occupational schemes collapsed, and prior to that there were various
legal challenges about how much they were able to rely on information
put out at the time about those pension schemes. What is your view on
the possibility of problems in that area, should people save and
believe that the generic financial advice that they were given was
wrong, perhaps because they do not benefit through the loss of other
means-tested
benefits?</div>

						</i> I am not in a position to comment on the
issue of legal liability. However, the issue of means testing is an
important one, but one that needs to be kept in
perspective. When you hear some commentators on the Bill, you would get
the impression that anyone going into the scheme would be no better
off, and indeed possibly would be worse off, as a result. All the
analysis that has been done suggests that that is far from the case. I
shall just give one example: on Second Reading, the question was asked,
&#147;Would you advise someone earning &#163;16,000 a year to save
in this scheme?&#148; If you look at the numbers, someone earning
&#163;16,000 a year would have to pay &#163;8.46 a week of their
own money into the scheme. If they did that for 40 years at that level,
they would end up with a pension pot of around &#163;100,000, which
would pay for an income for life of about &#163;100 a week and which
I would suggest is not a bad return for &#163;8 a week.</div>
					<a name="080115121000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, there are
clearly some areas where the interaction between means-tested state
benefits and personal accounts or any other form of savings is more
complex. I believe that there are relatively limited areas, but think
it is important that more analysis should be done by the Department
about where those problems are going to arise. If problems do arise,
the way to fix  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>them is through the benefits system. To postpone or abandon personal
accounts as a result of those kind of problems would be a
mistake.</div>

						</i> From NAPF&#146;s perspective, we very much
agree that the issue of generic financial advice and the ability of
consumers to depend on that links closely to the issue of means-tested
benefits. I agree with Dick that it is important to get some
perspective. There are clearly many millions of people who will benefit
from the introduction of personal accounts, and we really should not
lose sight of that in our very important discussions on means-tested
benefits. It is important that we use the time between now and 2012 to
look for a solution to means-tested benefits and ensure that we
minimise&#151;we will never be able eradicate the
problem&#151;those who will potentially lose out, through
means-tested benefits, by saving in a personal account. There are a lot
of interesting options on the table, and we need to work to explore
some of them and work with Government and across all parties to find
solutions to the
problems.</div>

						</i> I think that the best
protection against legal liability is to keep the scheme simple, so
that people really know what they are getting into. That is why, as I
was saying earlier, I feel that it is absolutely important that any
contribution that is allowed in can be matched by an employer
contribution. That should make it suitable for most people. If you
allow in other, random, lump-sum contributions, they will not
necessarily be suitable and people will possibly have cause for
argument down the track. Whatever you manage to put in the Bill and in
law, we know that if things go wrong, you get political pressure and
liability on the Government for a non-legal reason at the end of the
day.</div>

Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): Will the group expand a little on
some of the submissions that you have made on the effects of personal
accounts on existing pension schemes? I know that concerns have been
raised about the proposed contribution limit and whether things can
transfer, and whether that will lead to a levelling down of existing
pension schemes. What evidence do you have that that is likely to
occur?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Stephen
Haddrill:
							</b>
						</i> We think that there is a risk of that,
because if the employer is forced into a position of having to reassess
its existing situation, a number of things will happen. First,
employers will not want to overcomplicate their lives, so they will not
want to run an extra, new personal account alongside an existing thing.
The chances are that in those circumstances they will go for a personal
account, and personal accounts have an employer contribution of half
what is typical in insured systems. There is a big risk
there.</div>
					<a name="080115121000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also
dispute some of the Department for Work and Pensions
evidence on levelling down. My understanding is that, when employers
were polled on that subject, the polling was directed at human
resources departments. Our anecdotal evidence is that if you ask the
finance director, you get a rather different answer about how they
might look to the
future.</div>

								Joanne
Segars:
							</b>
						</i> We undertook some analysis in 2006 that has
since been corroborated by the Pensions Policy Institute. It showed
that the effect of levelling down could be quite significant in the
occupational pension scheme sector. Where that bites is on
auto-enrolment. The costs to employers who sponsor occupational 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>pension schemes of auto-enrolling employees into them at existing rates
would be, as I said, between &#163;1 billion and &#163;2 billion a
year.</div>
					<a name="080115121000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to recognise that auto-enrolment remains a minority sport in
occupational pension provision, so the number of employers that will
have to amend their schemes to accept auto-enrolment is quite
significant. The costs associated with that, for having additional
people coming in with additional contributions&#151;the typical
employer contribution to a defined benefit scheme is 16 per
cent.&#151;are quite significant. At that point, employers may say,
&#147;Well, this is all a bit too rich for our blood.&#148; It is
therefore important that, as well as designing personal accounts and
the auto-enrolment process, you ensure that there are protections on
transfers, although we take a slightly more flexible position than the
ABI, and on low contribution ceilings. There must also be incentives
for employers to keep their existing occupational pension schemes going
with the package of deregulation measures that is also in the
Bill.</div>

						</i> It is very important to keep this one in
perspective. Very interesting charts and numbers were produced by the
Department for Work and Pensions in its 2006 White Paper, which
examined the 18.6 million employees in the private sector. Of those
18.6 million, 12.4 million&#151;about two thirds&#151;are in no
occupational pension scheme, and would therefore benefit from levelling
up under personal accounts. Another 1.9 million are in schemes, but the
employer contribution is less than 3 per cent., so those 1.9 million
would also benefit from levelling up under personal accounts. It is
only the balance&#151;4.3 million, less than 25 per cent. of private
sector employees&#151;who are currently in a scheme in which the
employer pays more than 3 per cent. contributions and are therefore at
risk from the sort of levelling down that has been discussed. While I
think that with such schemes one should avoid levelling down at all
costs, if possible, let us not forget that the vast majority of people
will benefit from
this.</div>

produces a simple pension scheme that everyone should reasonably be

an enormous great hole at the moment, as Dick&#146;s numbers have
shown. It is a way of energising pension saving in this country. Where
we do not support the Bill is at the interface with the existing

The other point is one that we have already talked about: it has to be

testing. If that is not reasonably clear, and word on the street gets
out&#151;however fair or unfair&#151;that it is not a good bet,

will be a group of people, Mr. Saunders, because 40 years is
a long time. In the mean time, many people with a working life span of
10 or 15 years could find themselves paying in and not receiving what
they consider to be a benefit because of the interaction with the
benefit system. Ms Segars mentioned that there are schemes that could
right that potential wrong. Can you give us a bit more of a flavour of
what they might be and whether they should be in the Bill before it

the suggestions about trivial commutation, the Swedish system, in which
pension income is disregarded when setting eligibility for means-tested
benefits, and the suggestion about the refund of contributions. They
all need examining, and whatever the solution, they need to apply
across the piece to pensions, not just to personal accounts, which
clearly carries a cost. All the issues need to be looked at and
thoroughly analysed. We have great respect for our colleagues in the
DWP, and we work closely with them, but it would be a tall order to
expect the work to be done before the Bill&#146;s conclusion. I am

if somebody has 40 years ahead of them and you advise them that it

they might be worse off, you are asking them to make two assumptions.
The first assumption is that their life chances do not work out, they
do not pursue a full career, they are unemployed and end up on housing
benefit&#151;there might be reason to think that that will happen to
them, I do not know. The second assumption, which I suggest is a real
gamble, is that they need to take a bet that the benefits system in 40
years&#146; time will look like it does today. Set against those two
huge uncertainties, I should think that for somebody with 40 years
ahead of them, the prospect of saving with an employer&#146;s
contribution matching theirs pound for pound, when you include the tax

return of contributions over a long period, because the risk of having
lost money over that period would be so small, the cost of the hedge
would, I guess, be quite low. If you are looking at it over a shorter

a trust-based scheme is regulated by a different regulator from a

out are written in a different way. That also applies to the
information that is provided and so on. There are a number of visible
differences. We also have different IT platforms for different sorts of
provision, so there are costs involved in that. Given that we are

Coming back to the point that John Greenway made, I, and I am sure
other members of the Committee, would welcome any thoughts that you
have on how the unintended consequence of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>schemes&#151;the risk of the schemes&#151;could be reduced.
Mr. Haddrill referred to the risk of the levelling down of
the schemes that currently cover 4.2 million people. You will never get
rid of the risk, but you can certainly reduce
it.</div>
					<a name="080115121000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I ask you
some questions about the self-employed? They will not be covered by the
scheme, but they will be able to opt in. You are part of an industry
that is famed for its marketing. If you have not been able to encourage
somebody who is self-employed&#151;not necessarily on a particularly
high income&#151;to take out a personal pension plan, how do you
think that the opt-in will work? Do you know how many self-employed
people do not have a personal pension
plan?</div>

not think that this is going to work for the self-employed. Without a
clear employer contribution sitting alongside it, I think that it is
going to be quite hard to convince people that it is what they should
do. I also think that the self-employed tend to think of their business
as their pension, so there is a big cultural thing to get over there,
but perhaps I am being
pessimistic.</div>

pension provision for the self-employed has been a concern for many

the way they will for employees. I think that perhaps there are
different routes into tackling pension provision among the
self-employed than through personal accounts. Perhaps Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Small Business Service and
other routes through which the Government reach the self-employed could
be one of the solutions. It is a very difficult problem that has been

I take you back to the point about the European Union and workplace and
personal pensions? You said that this was an issue that applied to only
the UK. Are there examples in the recent past where the Government have
gone into battle with the EU, perhaps on some issue of City regulation,
and have come back with a result? You seem to be indicating that
perhaps with a bit of oomph the Government might be able to achieve a
result here? Would that be a fair summary of your views?</div>

lot of the examples where the Government have achieved things against
the flow, so to speak, are where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>they have stopped something rather than initiating something. I agree
that that is a bit more difficult. We have spoken to the European
Commission, which feels that the Government&#146;s interpretation of
the existing directive is correct. From what I have heard, the
Commission would not necessarily be in a great rush to take us to court
if we took a more liberal definition.</div>
					<a name="080115121000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real risk is that an
individual will take the Government or somebody to court, and whatever
the Government want to do, they cannot protect against that, so we
could end up in the European Court of Justice anyway, which we want to
avoid. That is why we must try to get the Commission to do something,
rather than just doing a sort of Italian job on
this.</div>

first? Our central estimate is that about &#163;10 billion a year
will go into this scheme, which sounds a lot of money but to put it
into perspective it is about what will be invested in retail mutual
funds this year. There may be some offset to that number from levelling
down, but my guess is that it would be a lot less than &#163;10

most of the submissions from the industry is the concern about a level

there is a power in the Bill for the Secretary of State to make loans

charging any interest and I cannot see why that should be the
case.</div>
					<a name="080115121000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very
important that the system and the consumers of it&#151;the people who
go into it&#151;absorb the costs of it just as people who are in
other pension schemes have to absorb the costs of those pension
schemes; they get charged out. Why should someone who is in a personal
account get a taxpayer subsidy other than the basic pension subsidy
when somebody in another scheme does not? We should look all the way
through and ensure that there is no scope for that subsidy. I was
alarmed when I saw that the clause had been written in that way and I
could not understand why that was the
case.</div>

						</i> Having said that, there will be a need for
finance in this scheme. We tend to talk about charges as a percentage
of funds under management, but a lot of the administration costs are
fixed; they are &#163;10 per account or whatever. There is no
question but that in the early years, if we have the sort of low
charges that we all want to see, the scheme will be  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>loss-making until those funds build up and the management fees are big
enough to cover the cost and the
borrowings.</div>
					<a name="080115121000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be a need for the scheme to borrow in the early years to beat that
J-curve, which any business plan has. Obviously, that borrowing should
be on arm&#146;s-length terms; I am sure the Treasury will not want
to lend to it
interest-free.</div>

it will vary company by company. Certainly with a GPP, very often the
provider goes into the workplace to explain what it will involve. There
is an enormous volume of regulation, which requires a great deal of
advice to be given every year to the person in the scheme about how it
is performing and whether they are should go back into the state second

over 1,000 workplace pension arrangements. That varies from scheme to

in what we might call generic financial advice. Clearly in regulatory
terms that is much easier to do in the occupational pensions scheme
setting at the moment than in the contract-based setting in which
Stephen&#146;s members operate. Our members are more engaged,
particularly where there are final contribution schemes, in offering
information to their members. They are very cautious in what they say
about state pension provision. The contributions are often much, much
higher than is available under personal accounts, which is a helpful

You are obviously regulated. Do you think that a requirement, which
might attach to personal accounts and therefore would probably have to
attach to any other pension scheme that is created, would need to be
much more developed than it is now or do you think that the current
level of regulation gives people sufficient understanding of what they

						</b> Thank you, Chairman. This was really on the
theme that Mr. O&#146;Brien raised. Perhaps I could just
address the issue the other way around. In fairness we all have high
hopes of the Thoresen results. In another Committee Room this morning
the Financial Services Agency told the all-party insurance group that
its retail distribution review will be leisurely in order to take
account of that. There will be an opportunity for us to look at
this.</div>
					<a name="080115121000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should not the
question that Mr. O&#146;Brien put be the other way
around? Is there a fear from the point of view of the existing industry
that personal accounts, with their lower regulatory regime, much lower
costs and quite a number of investment vehicle opportunities&#151;we
were told this morning by the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority that
it would be perhaps as many as a dozen or 20&#151;will make the
existing contract-based pension products look increasingly
uncompetitive? We may be looking five or 10 years down the track, but
if that is an issue should not we address it now and is this one of the
reasons why everyone seems to be so opposed from within the industry to
additional contributions being permitted for personal account
holders?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Stephen
Haddrill:
							</b>
						</i> The real reason why we do not like
additional contributions is because we think it complicates matters. We
think it will be taking money out of financial pots where people have
had advice and where they have got good investments and are putting
them in something on which they will have no advice. Can we compete is
the question. We think we have a good product. We think its features
will appeal to many people. It often has higher levels of contribution,
as I have already mentioned, and it may come with life insurance
protection of one sort or another. It is potentially a more
sophisticated product, a better product, and we are confident about it
competing.</div>
					<a name="080115121000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
factor is that, yes, personal accounts will be low cost. Talking to
PADA recently, I think that it is coming to the view that this 0.3
mantra is the one that is going to be delivered. We always felt that it
would be closer to 0.5 or 0.6. The numbers will come out when the
numbers come out, but from our experience of running these things that
is where we think it will end up. That is where the larger GPPs come
out already, so we do not think that the gap is as great as all
that. But what we do feel is, if there is a level playing field
with no taxpayer subsidy, that we will take on the competition. That is
the sort of industry it is.</div>

an opportunity for the first time for those individuals to be able to
save in a low-cost employer-supported environment in a simple scheme.

personal accounts, will provide real opportunities for many people to

of the auto-enrolment principle, which we see as very central to the
post-Turner commission consensus. It breaks the need to keep it simple,
which I think is a good mantra from the earlier evidence session, and
makes things more complicated. Even if the vast majority of employers
operated another system in good faith, it would provide opportunities
for abuse. A threshold system would delay things as well because there
would be a time period during which the tests were being applied
regarding whether recruitment was sufficient to meet the threshold. We
are also concerned that putting a percentage as some kind of test fails
to reflect that work forces are different&#151;80 per cent. might be
an appropriate figure for one work force, but not for somewhere else.

auto-enrolment, but we accept that auto-enrolment is the pragmatic way
to move forward on this issue. Like the TUC, we would be concerned if

about the circumstances of different individuals is actually a cop out
when we ought to be seeking to educate individuals about their options
and making them understand a bit more about the pensions regime. I
understand the thrust of the question because I can see that there are
going to be quite a lot of people who are in perhaps the last 10 years
of their working life and have not put aside any pension funds so far.
For them, it is probably not going to be a brilliant idea actually to
go for enrolment into the new personal account scheme, but I would
rather explain that than have them exempted

						</i> The pay-as-you-save issue has
been coming up time and time again. It is a really important issue. We
certainly do not want people on low incomes paying into pension schemes
and then finding that they are little better off in retirement.
Similarly, we do not want some of the many people who will benefit from
paying into private pensions to be deterred because they hear some of
the debates, or because their neighbour says that it is not worth
saving. We are concerned about that because we do not want people not
to benefit from the new
scheme.</div>
					<a name="080115129000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
difficult. I have spent an awful lot of time looking at it, and you
might have seen the paper that we produced with help from colleagues
here. It is one of those issues that the more they are looked at and
the more one understands how means-tested benefits work and
people&#146;s circumstances differ, the harder it sometimes is to
think of the answer. There is not just a single answer.</div>
					<a name="080115129000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support some of the things
that previous witnesses have said, and we need a detailed debate. We
have had some discussions with DWP analysts and the Pensions Policy
Institute. Both have done a lot of work, which is a good starting
point, but we want to explore what more can be done and what modelling
can be done so that we know exactly who these people are not only at
retirement, but earlier. We would also like a detailed analysis of the
different policy options and looking at changes to means-tested
benefits, trivial commutation, and the range of things that could be
done. We need those options to be worked out with the pros and cons
because there will be trade-offs. For example, there could be a system
whereby everyone benefited from saving involving means-tested benefits,
but that might make more people reliant on means-tested benefits.
Helping the system in one way might mean that we do not achieve another
policy aim.</div>

introduce a particular form of risk-sharing pension, I can respond. We
are not against risk-sharing pensions. It seems to me that there is
room for creativity, although sometimes the more creative the scheme,
the more complicated it is, so the principle of pension simplicity goes
straight out of the window. However, we are not convinced that that is
the one proposal that should have the privilege of an amendment. If
there is to be a discussion about what legislative blocks there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>are to risk sharing&#151;we are not convinced that there are
many&#151;we think it should be a longer-term process with a much
wider debate.</div>
					<a name="080115129000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal is interesting, but there is no need to have an amendment
favouring that scheme, which we think has some problems. It may be not

quite
right.</div>

contribute to a longer-term discussion about risk-sharing, hybrid

Government&#146;s proposal in their own Bill on looking at the
indexation of deferred pensions is aimed at reducing the cost of DB
schemes. Help the Aged is far from convinced that the jury is in or out
about the future of DB schemes, based on their cost. One might even be
able to say, if the good work that will be unrolled eventually from
Otto Thoresen and others raises the awareness of pensions around the
workplace, that employers will actually up their game and offer better
pensions. To start legislating as this stage, either with the clause
that is in the Bill or with this proposal for conditionally indexed
pensions, to cut the benefits of DB schemes does not seem to me to be

of the general consultation that has taken place post-Turner with
groups and consumer groups specifically, which I will refer to, I think
that the Department for Work and Pensions has been open and able to
encourage contributions to the debate so that our voice has been heard.
We have been keen for consumer representation, and with PADA there is a
consumer panel, which I think is an important feature. Moving forward,
in terms of future consumer representation in the actual trustee
co-operation, there are some issues where we would like to see debate
around specifics. If you refer to the Financial Services and Market Act
2000 or the Legal Services Act 2007, there are some specific areas that
are set up for consumer representation, including the right to
research, the right to publish and the right to have payment of members

on being involved in any detailed administrative costings, we have not

one specific issue: the charging regime that might exist for consumers.
Debate is taking place about whether there should be an annual
management charge or an upfront contribution charge. Our own view has
historically been an annual management charge, although we would be
open to consideration if it was demonstrated that other systems would
be more cost-effective for the consumer. That has been the one area

fully with the scheme and great difficulties are not envisaged.
However, it is feared that a minority of employers will not be inclined
to co-operate. Therefore, we have to address the issue of how to put
that right. There are issues not only of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>publicity and how to raise awareness but one of enforcement as well.

						</i> Clearly, there was a debate in Government
about which was the best agency to enforce the scheme. Some argued that
it should be Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, and some that it
should be the Pensions Regulator. The arguments were finely balanced,
and reopening them does not seem to be terribly helpful. What is more
important is whether TPR has the resources and powers to do it properly
and whether individual employees have the rights that they need for
their own protection. The resource level is not an issue for the Bill,
but it is something that will arise. We are convinced that there is a
pretty effective compliance regime in the Bill. Obviously, we would
like it to go further in some regards, but we do not want people to
think that we do not believe that it is going to be effective.
Certainly, the proactive nature of the TPR and its ability to deal with
errant employers is important, as is the fact that all employers will
have to register their pension arrangements. The fact that people who
opt out will do so directly to PADA and not via their employer is also
very important, and the employment rights in the Bill are drawn from
equivalent employment legislation and protection, and that generally
works fairly well. Therefore, our tests will be in how it is applied.
Will TPR have enough resources and will it be proactive enough? It is a
big change in role. At the moment, it is dealing with what you might
call the responsible good employers who already have pension schemes.
Things may go badly wrong in one or two of them from time to time, and
it will have to deal with that. Indeed, we think that it does a pretty
good job at the moment. The Tennant case, which is live at the moment,
is a good example of it acting well and efficiently. The TPR will now
have to deal with many more employers, some that are at the opposite
end of the responsibility scale and some that are just a bit
disorganised. They are not evil, but just do not get round to doing
things properly and do not understand their obligations. Therefore, it
will be a test. However, that is a question of resources. I do not
think that there is a problem with the powers in the
act.</div>

that is slightly over the threshold and one under, or those people with
two jobs that are both over the threshold. Because of the way that the
lower earnings band works, people only pay their contributions in on
their earnings that are over that &#163;5,000 limit. We would really
like to see that issue explored further. An individual could perhaps
opt to pay in their contributions on their full earnings, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>so go right down to zero pounds under that &#163;5,000 threshold. If
an individual opts to do that, their employer should have to match

discriminatory against part-time workers, who are mainly women. There
is a problem there. We understand that it is technically very
difficult. It is difficult to have auto-enrolment for such people, as
one employer will not know about their situation. However, the basic
problem that someone can be treated differently if their equivalent
income comes from two or three part-time jobs is wrong, and we need to

more irregular basis when the opportunity presents itself, is
important. I know that there will be a review on that for 2017, but

they would or would not be permissible. In previous evidence, we heard
reasons for why they should not be permissible, but we find that
people&#146;s lives are not linear, there are changing circumstances
and sometimes people will be in better paid jobs than at other times,
they may receive inheritances, and certainly, in so far as it is

Stephen Haddrill, the director general of the Association of British

in occupational pensions whose employers contribute more than 3 per
cent., there was a real risk that some of those employers could start
to level down their schemes. I would guess that a significant
proportion of those 4.3 million people are represented by trade unions
in the TUC. Your paper does not touch on that issue&#151;&#151;the
potential unintended consequence of the new schemes. Does that mean
that you do not share Mr. Haddrill&#146;s fears, or that
you were not really aware of the matter?</div>

								Nigel
Stanley:

						</i> It was more that we did not feel able to
submit every single bit of pensions policy that we had to the
Committee, and we wanted to deal with the live issues that were causing
controversy at the time. To 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>address the remarks on levelling down, I think that we must accept that
one cannot introduce a new pension system without employers noticing
it. If employers are made to think about pensions, they might make
decisions about the kind of pension that they offer. There is no
technical way to stop employers levelling down if they decide to try to
do that. Frankly, the best way of stopping that was referred to in your
question, and it is to have good, strong trade union organisation in
the work place concerned. Perhaps the Committee would like to consider
that&#151;I suspect that it may be outside the long title of the
Bill, but it is a matter of work place
power.</div>
					<a name="080115142000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mervyn earlier made the point
that we also hope that making pensions more prominent and important
will lead those good employers, who want to be employers of choice and
differentiate themselves from other employers, to value the pension
contribution. Staff will be more aware of the fact that they do this,
and we hope that there is a market incentive that goes the other way as
well. Will there be some levelling down? Of course there will be. Will
there be huge benefits for everyone who does not have access to a
pension scheme at the moment? Yes, there will. We think that the
equation is positive overall. We are very wary of those arguments that
say that you have to make personal accounts really awful to stop
employers levelling down, as that seems to be punishing the vast bulk
of people in the work force who have to rely on personal accounts. We
are wary of those arguments, although we accept the compromises that
are currently in the Bill around that point. Too many of the arguments
about levelling down seek to make personal accounts really
unattractive, so that not even miserable employers will level down to
them. That is false logic.</div>

million years. Surely the experience of the last few years has been
that employers that were recognised as good, including in the public
sector, have changed their pension schemes and have, in many cases,
ended final salary schemes because of the cost involved. Unfortunately,
the evidence so far is that irrespective of whether employers are good
or bad, given certain circumstances, they are likely to seek to reduce
the costs of their contributions to a scheme. Do you have any ideas
other than increasing the power of trade unions in the work place?
Other than that, are there any technical things that you think could be

						</i> We have gone through a deregulatory review
and some of the proposals from that review are included in the Bill.
There are other things that I believe that the Government will do that
they do not need primary legislation for, so some technical fixes can
do this. But if employers make a business decision meaning that they
can reduce the cost of their pension scheme and not suffer any ill
consequences from that, they are quite likely to do that. So it is much
more a case of making employees value pensions more and making
employers want to differentiate themselves from other employers by
making good pension provision an important tool not just for recruiting
staff, but perhaps more importantly for retaining staff. That is the
way in which you are more likely to do
it.</div>
					<a name="080115142000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking for

that one can do to help 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>and a deregulation review has looked at those, but there have been other
measures before and employers have made that calculation. One reason
why we are all sitting here today looking at a completely new

is that an enormous number of employers have already levelled down or
never levelled up in the first place by starting and never offering a

before personal accounts were a dream in anybody&#146;s eye,
employers were trimming their pension obligations. It is not as if
people necessarily will downsize their existing pension schemes because
there is an offer of an apparently cheaper alternative; it is probably
much more to do with a sort of yo-yo prediction of life expectancy: the
way in which FRS 17 required companies to declare their pension
obligations in a different form. If one is looking for technical fixes,
this is the area in which to look for it. If we had had a little bit
more consistency across the piece at that stage, it might not have
provided the same sort of shocks that employers respond to then

						</i> I should like to echo some of the points that
have been made. Clearly, there has been a levelling down from defined
benefit to defined contribution and a reduction in employer
contributions over recent years. I was struck by a survey recently on
why firms provide employees with pensions, which ranked these things in
order: first, we consider our responsibility as a good employer to make
adequate arrangements; secondly, the scheme helps us to build our image
as a caring employer; and thirdly, the scheme helps us to compete in
the labour market. In a sense, from the supply side, there is an issue
there. From the employee consumer side, there needs to be more
awareness that those things are key features when choosing an employer
and maybe that has not always been the case in the past. But I suspect
that, as pensions become a more important, significant part of the
planning process for consumers, the good employers that offer the best
schemes will have a competitive advantage in the market as far as

the moment for an employer to offer a financial inducement to their
employees not to be auto-enrolled, because they might want to save
their costs. The Bill is silent on this subject at the moment. Were
that to be the case, there would not be a level playing field as far as
employers were concerned, in that the cost-base of some employers could
be significantly lower than others. Do any of you have views on that?
Is that perhaps an area that the Committee needs to examine going
forward?</div>

						</i> To answer the first question, about
compliance, as we understand it, the Bill will not stop an employer
offering a financial inducement to a member of staff to opt out, but
there would be nothing to stop the member of staff taking the
inducement and then not opting out, because that deal would not be
enforceable. So, &#147;roll on the employers who want to try it
on&#148; would be my line, because we would certainly be there
saying, &#147;Take the money and don&#146;t run.&#148; I think we

might get a savvy employee who might do that and more power to him or
her were that to be the case, but there might be others who just take
the money without really understanding the issue and think that they
have got a good deal up front, and actually they would lose out in a
significant way. Then that employer has a lower cost base and can go in
and undercut other good employers in the area. So I take your point,

have concerns about, because it does seem slightly odd that financial
incentives are not prohibited but they cannot be enforced. It is okay
if you have got a trade union and you have got Nigel there telling you
that, but there will be an awful lot of employees who, if their
employer says, &#147;Oh, you know, if you opt out I will give you an
extra &#163;500&#148;, they will not have read the detail of the
legislation that says that that deal is not enforceable. It is really
important that information goes to both employees and employers about
rights and responsibilities in terms of the new pension provision, and

Here&#146;s a cutting from such and such newspaper that says
they&#146;re a bad deal.&#148; Again, outlawing that type of
propaganda is very hard, but I would hope that the regulator would have
a view about that and some codes of practice for that kind of thing;
that might be a way round that. I am more worried about the canteen
culture encouraging that propaganda than I think that I am about
obvious bribes, because clearly there is a kind of risk to the employer
in doing that if the staff find out what they are doing, and then the
employer would lose out. It is more that type of murmur and rumour
stuff that I think is the problem. It is very hard to outlaw
rumour-mongering.</div>

						</i> On the second question&#151;no, we have
not. We were trying to do some creative thinking about where a
discussion might start about how you would do that and a number of
suggestions have been made about trivial commutation limits, which
would be particularly useful perhaps for older workers joining who did
not have the chance to build up enough to buy a significant annuity,
but who built up enough to take them perhaps just a little over the
trivial commutation limit. Perhaps there are some ways of allowing
income from pensions not to count against some of the means-tested
benefits, particularly housing benefit, which is always the one that
seems to cause the most difficulties. Indeed, people can be in
perfectly good DB schemes and lose out because of the interaction with
housing benefits at the moment, although no one uses the argument that
they have been mis-sold. So these are issues that go much wider than
personal accounts. We would welcome a longer term discussion of the
attempt to reach consensus between the approaches, which has been the
hallmark of the debate since Turner. We welcome that and would like to
participate in it. This is not easy, it is technical, and there will be
trade-offs and difficulties. To at least share a menu with prices would
be a good step, rather than rushing into anything in the

asking such questions in interviews or in job references. We think that
that is an important advance. We would like to have seen the Bill go
further and introduce that pre-employment right, so that, effectively,
employers could not discriminate against job applicants on the basis of
their pre-existing pension history. We understand the argument that
pre-employment rights are rather unusual in British employment law, but
our argument is that they are not that unusual. In some ways, it is
analogous to the trade union membership right: employers cannot
discriminate against you on the basis of your pre-existing membership
of a trade union. I am not sure that that many employers will do so or
whether it will be a huge issue. The clear outlawing of asking such
questions is very important, but we would have liked to have seen that
pre-employment right in the Bill and were disappointed not

there has been a levelling down from defined benefits. I thought that I
detected in Mr. Stanley&#146;s initial answer a sense that
there is an issue here of the contraction of the number of defined
benefit schemes or of the number who are in such schemes, but that you
were not quite convinced with the ACA proposal. Perhaps it needs to be
explored more, and so on. We need to provide some impetus for the kind
of review that you talked about. If we tried to include in the Bill a
clause that might not be as prescriptive and specific as the ACA
proposal, but that provided impetus for a review, would you go so far

						</i> We would have to look at the clause, rather
than give that kind of blanket approval or not. There are a number of
issues. To what extent does the law currently stop risk-sharing
schemes? The view of the deregulatory review was that the law allows
quite a lot of risk sharing, so the first question is whether there is
a need for legal changes in the first place. The second question is: if
you are going to have changes in the law, what kinds of risk sharing
should they encourage? There are other ways in which employers can
reduce the cost of DB schemes. Moving to career averages over final
salary, for example, is one that unions have negotiated and, indeed,
can be an egalitarian measure in many
workplaces.</div>

scheme is without merit; we are saying it is one possible way of

the Government have already said they are open to a discussion on risk
sharing in their response to the deregulatory review. Whether an
amendment is needed to the Bill saying the Government shall conduct a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>review of this, I do not know. It is probably unnecessary to write that
into legislation, but if the Government are saying there should be a

move on to a couple of other points in the TUC memorandum, which I have
to say was one of the better reads among the papers that we were sent.
The first issue is payment of arrears. We are talking about employers
simply not enrolling people when they should or not making the
contributions when they should. Is it your view that the employer
should be responsible for the loss of investment return that the
individual member suffers by those contributions not being paid? It
could be quite
considerable.</div>

						</i> It could be, though it could of course be at
a time when the funds went down as well. Our view is slightly more
simple than that. We think that if it is the employer&#146;s fault
that contributions are delayed, there will come a point when, if the
employee has to pay the back contributions, they become such a size
they may even become an incentive to opt out so the employee does not
have to find that amount of money, which would be unfortunate. If it is
the fault of the employer that contributions are not made or someone is
not auto-enrolled, obviously there needs to be some administrative
measure. Three months is a figure that has been talked about as a
recent compromise for this, but beyond that it seems to us to be the
responsibility of the employer to put right what the employer should
have
done.</div>

						</b> The point that I was just about to make to
Mr. Stanley concerns paragraph 5.7 of the memorandum. It
reflects on the fact that our general understanding is that personal
accounts will not be suitable in the Government&#146;s view for
transfers in and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>out, even of fairly small amounts. As a result of the Bill, we are
increasingly likely to see migrant workers, who might be in this
country for two or three years&#151;some for a longer time, some for
a shorter time&#151;who, because of the level of earnings and the
fact that they now have such an opportunity, will build up personal
accounts and have a fair amount of accrued benefit in
them.</div>
					<a name="080115141000003"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if the
migrants leave the country and never come back, the question arises
whether there should not be a mechanism to provide for that. What
underpins the matter is a growing sense in European institutions that,
if the individuals are making contributions in host countries, they
should receive the benefits for which those contributions provide. Is
that the scenario you envisaged when you made the suggestion in the
memorandum? Do you think that there ought perhaps to be at the least
clarification of what regulation-making powers will be in the Bill to
cope with such matters, if they became a problem in the
future?</div>

						</i> We think that that is a good point and agree
with the premise behind your question. We understand that part of the
consensus is a desire to stop there being big transfers in and out of
personal accounts and between other personal accounts. That is
understood, but we were concerned that we could end up with a lot of
very small pension pots in personal accounts. That is not good for the
person with the small pot or for those with personal accounts because
they are expensive to run. It is more complicated than that, but
essentially there is a fixed cost per account rather than a cost that
goes with the size of the account. In particular, if we then talked to
a worker who had gone home to Gdansk, but has a small pension pot stuck
in personal accounts in Britain, it just seems that that person should
not be a victim of the consensus that people have not thought about or
the exceptions to
it.</div>
					<a name="080115141000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our reading of
the Bill suggests that regulation-making powers would allow that, but
it might be useful for hon. Members in Committee to probe the
Government about whether they think that such a provision would be a
suitable exemption to the general consensus, which people generally
understand and sign up to. After all, there will be an exemption in the
general sense that there will not be transfers in that will cover
people who have not yet been vested in employer schemes. For example,
such people have been members of a scheme, but the employer only puts
it into the DB scheme if they have been working for two years. If they
leave just before the two years is up, they would normally get back
their money and be allowed to put it into personal accounts in one
lump. That is obviously a sensible thing to do. The migrant worker
argument and other such arguments are similar exemptions to the
transfer-out side.</div>

suppose that the migrant worker thinks, &#147;Well, I might not be
here for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>too long, so therefore I shall opt out. I would rather have the money
and send it home&#148;. The employer might then think that that is a
good idea because he saves money. There might be a general environment,
culture or climate in which migrant workers think that such matters are
not for them, whereas in reality about 25, 30 or 40 years later some of
them might still be here and, if they have not taken the opportunity to
invest in personal accounts, we will end up with a whopping great
pension deficiency in respect of those workers. If we could clarify
matters in Committee, it might be particularly helpful in explaining to
a growing number of people&#151;the number of whom is likely to
increase by 2012&#151;why it is a good idea for them to take

issue on how we differentiate between migrant workers and someone who
was born in Britain, and should we therefore insist that it has to go

taking out the money that they put in? Should there be a limit on how

						</i> Clearly, it is not a simple question. With
regard to the first point, I think that generally everyone accepts that
transfers out of a pension scheme can only be into another pension
scheme, as anything other than that would open another completely
different set of issues. It would therefore have to be transferred into
another pension scheme. I think that, as you suggest, the test will
probably end up being about a reasonably small pension pot to which no
one has contributed for a period of time, so that you are generally
dealing with the problem of small orphan pension pots, rather than a

it just seemed that the migrant worker can rather graphically
illustrated what is possibly the most extreme case of that. It might be
an issue for others as well, but transfers should certainly only be
between pension funds. I think we are moving towards more EU
understanding on that, and am sure that there is a suitable definition
of a pension fund in most other EU countries, although I must admit
that I am not an expert on the Polish pension

						</i> This is thinking off the top of my head, but
that could possibly be one way of doing it. I would like to get it
flagged up at this stage as an issue and am sure that good minds can
come up with a solution to the problem. The idea that there can never
be a transfer out under any circumstances will give rise to problems,
and one can understand why it has happened and support the compromises
and trade-offs that were behind it. Will it, however, have unintended
consequences? Yes it will. That is a point that we are trying to make
at this

Borrow:
						</b> I want to come back to the issue of flexibility. I
think that most people would instinctively feel that
we should have the maximum amount of flexibility, whether that is a
matter of people with multiple jobs being able to put income from all
of those jobs into one pot or people who have money left to them being
able to put that into a personal account, or a whole range of other
things that we have just talked about.</div>
					<a name="080115141000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the things that I
picked up on during this morning&#146;s evidence session with PADA
was that they were still working and acquiring information in this
country and overseas on both the administrative and policy problems.
Would you agree with me that one of the important things for the
Committee as we deal with the detail of the Bill is to ensure that
there is sufficient scope for regulations to be laid at some point in
the future to allow the issues of flexibility to be addressed when
administrative and cost problems are met?</div>
					<a name="080115141000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that we would all
recognise that greater flexibility brings administrative difficulties
and has cost implications. What we do not know at the moment is how
great those will be. The key thing is that the Bill has to have enough
flexibility through future regulation to ensure that, if things work,
we can bring in flexibility in due course. Is that the way you see that
going
ahead?</div>

						</i> We would agree with that. Clearly, no one
has built personal accounts before and I think that it should not
require PADA and its successor to discover a big problem that comes
back and then requires primary legislation, when really a more flexible
regulation-making power would deal with that.</div>
					<a name="080115141000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our general perception of the
Bill is that it is fairly flexible. There are lots of regulation-making
powers. Sometimes people object to that in primary legislation, but I
do not think anyone should in this, because there will be a need for
some flexibility and for learning from experience. No one should
underestimate what a difficult administrative task it is setting up
personal accounts. There will undoubtedly be some lessons from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>that, and I would think that the more flexibility that there is in the
system the better. We have used, for example, unforeseen outcomes
already quite a lot. There may even be others&#151;actually, we have
tried to foresee them, but I am sure that there will be others that we
have not foreseen yet. Having regulation-making powers will be helpful
in dealing with
that.</div>

thing that we would like to see in the Bill is that PADA has an
overriding responsibility to exercise its duty in the best interests of
future members. There are a series of principles there. They currently
do not appear as a principle. If it were a principle in the design of
the scheme, then in terms of future flexibility it would be informed by
that drive to make future members the key issue for PADA in the way
that it puts this
together.</div>

Committee should remember as well that this legislation is designed to
try and help people who by and large are living slightly untidy,
disorganised and forgetful lives. I think that there has got to be the
flexibility to understand that this is the kind of target group that
one is predominantly aiming for and that one needs to make sure that
the system that we set up at the end of all this is one that takes
account of allowing people to have second thoughts and slightly change
their order of priorities and things like

but I will wait until 2012&#148;, so that people could be encouraged
to save maybe in an ISA and then transfer that to the personal
accounts, if that seemed appropriate when the system was introduced. I
think it would be a positive start to the system if we were able to
have that additional contribution in the first year.</div>

						</i> We strongly agree with that. It seems to us
that too much is made of the dangers of putting in lump sum
investments. I have an AVC that goes alongside my&#151;I am one of
the lucky ones&#151;DB scheme. No one said that I should take advice
before I put extra money into my AVC, and I think that there should be
the ability to put extra money, within reasonable limits, into lump sum
payments&#151;particularly the kind of lump sum payments from the
target group, which would not be enough to interest a commercial
pensions company. The odd &#163;5,000 here does not make much sense
to invest in a personal pension pot with an insurance company, but it
might make quite a big difference to someone who suddenly comes into
that amount and wants to do the responsible thing with it, which is to
put it into their pension. Simply adding it to their personal account
is a straightforward and simple thing to do. One suspects that if they
cannot do that, they might not put it into their pension at all, and
might spend it in some other way, which would not suit public policy
quite so
well.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I want to return, if I may, to the
interesting discussion that was prompted by the questions asked by my
hon. Friends the Member for Ryedale and for Bromsgrove on the issue of
migrant workers. In some parts of the country and in some industries,
there are firms staffed entirely by migrant workers. I am concerned
that if none of those migrant workers auto-enrolled, because they were
here for just six months, a year or a couple of years, that business
would have a significant competitive advantage over other businesses in
the area. That is an observation as much as a question, but I would be
interested if you had any comments on it.</div>
					<a name="080115141000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is there a case for generic
financial advice being directed specifically at migrant workers who are
going to be in the country for short periods of time, advising them
whether there are transfer possibilities to send money back to Poland
or whether it will be tied up in the UK until they are 60 or 65? I can
see the matter being a real problem by creating a competitive advantage
in local economies up and down the country, and I would be interested
in your comments on
that.</div>

						</i> That is an interesting point. One is in
danger of making a lot of assumptions without
researching to what extent that is a problem. Competitor companies may
tend to employ a lot of part-time workers on the minimum wage who would
not be best advised to have a personal account anyway, so one does not
know whether there would be much of a competitive advantage. It will
certainly be a problem&#151;whether a big problem, I do not
know.</div>
					<a name="080115141000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
certainly a case for providing information and advice to migrant
workers on a range of their rights in this country, including
employment rights. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>Some employers of migrant workers exploit the fact that they do not know
their employment rights, cannot speak English and do not know how to do
it, just as there are also exemplary employers of migrant workers.
There is a case for ensuring that migrant workers are helped to
understand the work environment that they find themselves in and given
generic or particular advice on whether they should opt in or out of
personal accounts. That certainly does apply, and you have raised an
interesting
issue.</div>

different generic advice to suit their

Kirkbride:
						</b> I must say that I have not read all the
briefings that have come through, so this point may well be in them.
While you were talking, the question crossed my mind whether there is
any assurance provision attached. In most private pension schemes, if
one snuffs it, the family gets something out of it. In some cases, you
can pass on your pension contribution to someone else. It stays in the
scheme, and they get many more years&#146; benefit as a result of
your early demise. Do you have any views on whether something could be
done on that, as an incentive for some people to take out pensions in
the first
place?</div>

						</i> My understanding is that it is a standard
defined contribution scheme, so it is an inheritable pot before
retirement. That also leads on to an important debate on what happens
once you have withdrawn the income from your pension scheme and chosen
which annuity to buy. People&#146;s information and advice needs when
choosing an annuity are vital, particularly on choosing a single-life
or joint-life annuity. It is vital to ensure that individuals and
couples make the correct choice about what annuity is right for them in
their circumstances, with regard to providing a survivor income or a
guarantee on their annuity income should they
die.</div>
