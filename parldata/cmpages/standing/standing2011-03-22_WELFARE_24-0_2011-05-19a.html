                           </span> On a point of order, Mr Weir. I
welcome you back after our break. Before lunch, the Minister reminded
us that we had been invited to a seminar about child care support in
universal credit on Monday afternoon. When the Secretary of State gave
evidence to the Committee on 24 March, we asked him what plans the
Government had for setting out options and proposals for supporting
child care in universal credit. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
hope to be able to come forward to the Committee with those sets of
options so that there can be some greater decisions made in time for
that part of the Bill. I promise to try to do that but if I do not, it
will certainly be done within the Committee
stage.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Welfare

                        <p>I
understood that to mean that before the Bill left Committee—that
is to say, by Tuesday—we would have a new clause or amendment
from the Government setting out their conclusions on child care. I am
seeking to establish whether a proposal will be tabled by Tuesday for
us to debate, because there is no such proposal on the amendment paper
at the moment. Can we be informed whether one will be on the amendment
paper for our debate on Tuesday, as, I think, the Secretary of State
indicated to us?<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000015">&#160;</a>

not sure whether my contribution or that of the right hon. Member for
East Ham is a point of order. However, the Government intend at the
meeting on Monday afternoon—it will be an informal as opposed to
a formal setting—to discuss the different options available with
members of the Committee. We have narrowed them down to a small number,
and if the meeting goes swimmingly, and everybody agrees that the
approach set out is the right option, who knows what we will be able to
achieve in Tuesday’s

                           </span> I was coming close
to the end of my response to the Minister. I was expressing some
disappointment about what he told us in response to our probing
amendments, which leaves us very concerned about the extension of the
application of civil penalties in cases of error. We are concerned
about the possibility that Jobcentre Plus advisers will be in the
position of imposing civil penalties and required to decide whether to
make applications on the basis of the flexibility given to them and
their own judgment. That makes it quite likely that two individuals in
identical circumstances in different Jobcentre Plus offices will be
treated differently. That, in turn, is likely to generate the potential
for challenges to decisions, and the savings that may accrue from the
different penalties may be offset by additional appeals and challenges.
Unfortunately, that is the downside of injecting discretion into the
system, particularly when Jobcentre Plus advisers will find it
difficult in many cases to make rulings on the issues, such as the
extent to which conditions such as poor mental health are legitimate
grounds for people making errors in their applications.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000025">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In our short
break, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham prompted me to
mention the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which
provides a parallel in some ways. Were Members of Parliament subject to
a civil penalty in each case where IPSA ruled that we had made an error
in an application, that would be deeply unpopular. Were an automatic
penalty of £50 or £300 to apply when someone
filled in an IPSA application incorrectly—it might simply be for
the purchase of a pen in a travel claim—that would be wholly
disproportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000026">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The introduction of universal credit in two or three
years’ time will be one of the largest transformations in the
welfare system in decades. We have said this on several occasions, and
my right hon. Friend has said it particularly in respect of the IT: it
will be a triumph of hope over judgment to expect that there will not
be, at least in the transitional period, a number of difficulties in
implementing the system. That is not a critique of universal credit,
and it is certainly not a principled criticism; I am simply saying that
that is inevitable. If

found the philosopher’s stone in a system that will not lead to
administrative error or inadvertent error on the part of claimants,
they are likely to be disappointed. Many vulnerable individuals will

be subject to proportionately harsh civil penalties as a

any form of target or incentive for applying civil penalties, the two
amendments seek to find out a little more about how widely the Minister
expects the penalties to be applied. I hope that he will correct my
understanding of the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
interpretation of the projections is that the Department expects to
raise £30.5 million from civil penalties by 2014-15—the
first full year of the application of universal credit. That equates to
the application of 610,000 penalties every year, which is in staggering
contrast to the 1,221 penalties applied to tax credit claimants under
similar legislation last year. I was struck by the Minister’s
written response to a parliamentary question I read in <em>Hansard</em>
yesterday on other social security benefit penalties. He stated that
the number of administrative penalties issued last year in respect of
the benefits service—benefits rather than tax credits—was
merely 7,249, down from 9,810 in 2006-07. Therefore, fewer than 10,000
penalties were applied in the last financial year and the
numbers—in the social security field—are falling, yet the
Government appear to anticipate an income of £30 million, which
would mean a potential application of 610,000 penalties at the expected
minimum level or a significant number of much larger
ones.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am baffled that, in a simplified system that has been sold to us so
convincingly on its merits, the Government expect such a huge increase
in the number of civil penalties. That seems to fly directly in the
face of what the Government are telling us. It gives rise to a concern
that, while I am sure that the Department for Work and Pensions
business plan will not set a specific target to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1040<a class="bkMark" name="Column1040">&#160;</a>
                           </div>apply 610,000 penalties, if that £30 million is put into the
financial projections—we talked about this earlier in relation
to sanctions—there will be a culture and an expectation that, if
that money is to be raised, offices across the country will be looked
at. There will be a review, no doubt, of the number of penalties
applied by each office and, if certain offices are not applying any
civil penalties, someone will ask why. That will, in turn, generate a
cultural response. The Minister says that DWP officials will act with
discretion and common sense when applying the penalties, but they will
be put under a countervailing pressure that will encourage them to
exercise less discretion and spend less time digging into the details
of a claimant’s mental health condition, or the good reasons
they give for why they made an error or a late
application.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000034">&#160;</a>

filtered wholly and exclusively through a party political prism. Labour
Members have been frank in saying that we would have wanted to avoid
aspects of the administration of tax credits. I accept that problems
that arose from the tax credits were a flaw in the system. We are
urging the Government to learn from the mistakes in the tax credit
programme, and to avoid going down the same path, but that is what they
seem intent on
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000036">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has explained how the misunderstandings that arose from the
sanctions regime led to a culture in which, in some cases, officials
felt that they needed to increase the number of sanctions. However, a
savings target and an expectation for £30 million to be
generated from several penalties are more likely to lead to a repeat of
that kind of
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000037">&#160;</a>

that, unless the Minister contradicts my statistics—I would be
delighted and thrilled if he did and told us that we are reading the
figures wrongly—he is completely wrong. Despite the assurances
that we received and believed during our debate on sanctions, the
Government now appear to be saying that a specific figure underpins
universal credit. The implication is that 610,000 civil penalties will
be applied per year, raising £30 million. That is a vast number
of penalties. I do not have a calculator to work out how many times
greater that civil penalty figure is than the total number, but it
seems to be 40 or 50 times higher. That needs to be
explained.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000039">&#160;</a>

Minister square what appears to be an expectation that the number of
civil penalties will be much higher with the expectation that the
number of appeals will be much lower? Either one of those is wrong, or
a barrier between claimants is anticipated.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
this case, we are not talking mainly about fraud—which should be
prosecuted to the utmost—but official or individual error. If
the number of civil penalties applied was higher, we would expect there
to be a capacity for vulnerable individuals to make appeals against
those impositions, and we do not understand why appeals are expected to
be lower. Will the Minister address the appeals point? Exactly how much
money has he written into DWP expectations from civil penalties? How
many civil penalties does he expect to be applied in the average year?
What variance is there between the current level of tax credit and
benefit civil penalties, and those built into universal credit? We
would be delighted if the Minister addressed those points, and we could
then enthusiastically withdraw the
amendments.</p>

straightforwardly. In debate terms, this is like “Pirates of the

looking forward to seeing this summer. It is “Targets debate
2”. We heard it all a couple of weeks ago. As I said at the

had to unravel, and the culture that they built up. I am always

down to the number of people who mis-declare information to the
Department, transgress and break the rules—no more and no less.
If there are no transgressions, no penalties will be charged; if the
figure is high, a lot of penalties will charged. It is as simple as

in each year to 2014–15, rounded to the nearest thousand, will
be in the region of 513,000, 542,000, and 571,000. We estimate that, of
those claimants who incur an overpayment related to customer error each
year, around 40% will be likely to incur a penalty. That means that
four in every 10 mis-declarations to the Department are likely to lead
to a civil penalty.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The number of
cases that would meet the £50 civil penalty criteria is taken
from our debt management administrative data, from which we estimate
that 40% of the 1.2 million customer error cases have the potential to
attract a penalty, if one existed under the new rules. We do not have
any comparative figures now because that civil penalty does not
currently exist. It is being introduced for a purpose. It is immaterial
whether the percentage is 20%, 40%, 50% or 60%—there is no
target. There will be no target if the number of mis-declarations is
zero. We would all be delighted in that case, because it would mean
that people were are providing

                           </div>100% accurate data to the Department, and that no customer-generated
error was taking place. That is all fine and hunky-dory, but if it does
not happen, several sanctions and civil penalties will be applied.
However, to be absolutely clear, the number will relate exactly and
directly to the number of transgressions that meet the criteria for
administering the penalty—no more and no less. There will be no
guidance for targets or financial goals. There is a broad estimate of
the impact of the change because it is our job to produce an impact
assessment and provide our best estimates to the Committee and the
House. We will continue to do that. However, no penalties will be
introduced other than those that result from a transgression by a
claimant.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000045">&#160;</a>

Although the Minister tells us that there will be no targets, which I
am happy to take his assurance on, he has not explained why there will
be such a phenomenal increase in the number of individuals liable to be
subject to civil penalties. In fact, he appears to have confirmed the
figures that I quoted and he did not challenge the financial figure
that will be written into the DWP business plan. It is completely
extraordinary that a Government who have given us such sincere
assurances about their wish to protect vulnerable individuals should be
quite happy to anticipate an increase of this order in the number of
civil penalties that people who are not currently subject to such
penalties will have to face, and that is in addition to any overpayment
that may arise as a result of the official error.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
did not respond to my point about the level of appeals and the apparent
incongruity between a huge increase in the number of civil penalties
that will apply and a fall in the number of appeals. He says that that
is almost an automatic response in universal credit to errors within
the system and that if there is a transgression in an application, an
appeal can be made. However, we have discussed several times before the
extent to which Jobcentre Plus staff will be able to exercise their
judgment. Therefore, the concept of there being an automatic
transgression simply does not
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000047">&#160;</a>

will be a subjective assessment and there will be enormous pressure on
Jobcentre Plus staff who will be making those relatively subjective
decisions about what makes good cause, and they will be doing so
entirely aware of the number of so-called transgressions that the
Government expect and the amount of money that is likely to be
generated as a consequence. Although £30 million is a
significant amount of money to individuals, it is relatively small beer
in terms of the DWP budget and it will at least be offset by the number
of appeals made on behalf of individuals, so it is a false
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000048">&#160;</a>

significant time in doing so—let me pull together some of the
strands. During the debate, those strands have become significantly
more alarming to me than was the case beforehand. The amendment asks
the Secretary of State to take action on behalf of the Government by
striking a balance between the additional responsibilities that he
seeks to lay on claimants—who are, in many cases, vulnerable and
do not have the necessary resources always to understand the workings
of a system—and ensuring that civil penalties are not introduced
before very clear and transparent criteria are set out to ensure that
claimants are not penalised unnecessarily for making innocent errors,
or for failing to understand the need to report changes within a
required time
frame.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would allow for the definition of “reasonable
excuses” to take account of a claimant’s individual
circumstances. It would put flesh on the bones of the discretion that
the Minister has told us about. It would enable claimants to meet their
responsibilities by ensuring that they were provided with the necessary
support from within the Department to build trust within the system so
that claimants were better qualified to make an accurate
application.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000057">&#160;</a>

applications and change of circumstance notifications to be made
through the internet rather than face to face, and there are many
advantages to that. However, set against that is the fact that it is
the most disadvantaged and vulnerable claimants who are not able to
apply in that way. We want to be reassured that the Department will
meet its responsibilities and that there will be capacity in the system
for the DWP to assist those individuals who need assistance. All this
is set against the backdrop that universal credit will be introduced

proportion. Listening to that, people would think we were imposing some
draconian penalty, rather than creating a £50 civil penalty for
people who mis-declare their circumstances to the DWP. This penalty is
intended only for those who are overpaid benefit as a result of their
own fault or action, or because they could and should have provided the
correct information to prevent overpayment of benefit, but failed to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000060">&#160;</a>

result of customer error, and this a sensible and balanced response to
that. We do not intend to sanction every individual. The hon. Lady
keeps making reference to the “huge increase” in
penalties, but this is a new approach. There is no comparison that can
legitimately be made, and decisions are made carefully about who is an
appropriate person to sanction and who is
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000061">&#160;</a>

sensible approach. I am afraid that the amendment would impose a

                           </strong> Once again, I am disappointed. I think that
proportionality is a problem for the Government, not us. It is all very
well for the Minister to say that £50 is a meaningless figure,
but for people on marginal incomes—as he well knows; he has been
eloquent in expressing this view in other contexts—£50 is
a lot of money, particularly when, almost invariably, those individuals
will be repaying an overpayment. My hon. Friend the Member for
Edinburgh East is right in saying that fraud must be put into a
different category; in many cases, overpayments arise either from
official error or from a simple error made by people facing language or
literacy barriers or mental health problems. Fifty pounds, on top of an
overpayment, is not far short of the entire disposable income of an
individual on jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support
allowance. That is the proportionality problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
again made the point that it is a new benefit, so there is no
comparability, but he has told us time and again that the new system is
so simple that there will be no error, so why does he expect such a
phenomenal increase in the number of sanctions? The problems are
genuine. He is right to say that prosecution should occur only in a
minority of cases and cannot always be justified, but a civil
enforcement penalty cannot be made without scrutiny or accountability.
The figures written into the impact assessment create a climate of
expectation about penalty levels, which places a significant burden on
vulnerable claimants that is not matched by a corresponding expectation
from the Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, I
think the absolute truth of the matter is that if anything approaching
that number of civil penalties is applied in the early days of
universal credit, all the Minister’s fine words about savings
and reducing pressure on DWP staff will go out of the window, because
those staff will be tied up in a constant stream of challenges to civil
penalties. The figures cannot be shrugged off. A Member of Parliament
might easily be able to shrug off a £50 civil penalty without
even going to the effort of writing a letter to challenge it, but
someone on a very low income will not. They will challenge the
penalties, and they will do so in tens if not hundreds of thousands, if
the figures are to be trusted. That will be a false economy for the
Government. However, I do not intend to press the amendments, as I am
sure that we will return to this debate on another occasion. I beg to

(1) shall not take effect until the Secretary of State has published a
report setting out how the appropriate authority will compensate
claimants where an overpayment or delay in payment of benefit has
arisen as a result of official
error.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
288 asks the Secretary of State to publish a report before the penalty
arrangements come into effect showing how claimants will be compensated
for overpayments or delays arising from official error. We have heard a
great deal about errors due to claimants making mistakes, not filling
in their forms or not declaring things such as changes in
circumstances, and we have heard that the Department loses £1.2
billion as a result. It would be interesting to put that into the
context of losses incurred by other large organisations in similar
circumstances for the sake of comparison. Without making such
comparisons, however, the total loss is estimated to be about £3
billion, so there is more loss through departmental error than claimant
error.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although we
all hope that it will not happen, or will happen less, in the future, I
do not think there is any organisation or human being who does not make
errors. Such errors can be very difficult for people on very low
incomes. For people who receive less than their usual payments for a
period, even if that payment is later reinstated, or for people who
struggle to maintain their family in a situation in which they receive
less than they would have done if no error had been made, that is a
significant and serious
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
that basis, the amendment seeks to create a parallel and a balance
between the two forms of error. As it stands, the clause will impose a
penalty on claimants. Where an error is made by the Department, there
should be a system for compensating claimants who have suffered as a
result. That would also provide an incentive for the Department not to
create errors. If the system is designed in the belief that claimants
are not careful when they fill in forms and do not ensure that they get
everything absolutely correct, that should also work the other way and,
if it did, that would create an incentive for the Department to ensure
that due care and attention was paid to the processing of claims and
that errors were kept to a
minimum.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would also create a balance between the Department or
Government body dealing with such matters and claimants. There would be
mutual respect on both sides about the fact that while a claimant might
be at fault, at other times the Department might be at fault. People
would therefore understand that the process is a mutual endeavour, and
they would feel more trust and confidence in, and work better with, the
Department in those circumstances. That is the context of the
amendment, and I am interested to hear the Minister’s
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000074">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think I can give the hon. Lady a fairly rapid
response. We are investing many hundreds of millions of pounds in a
system for universal credit that will, I hope, eliminate much of the
official error that she rightly says is made. That will happen because
more of the system will be automated, more will be based on real-time
information and movements into and out of short-term periods in work
will be dealt with within the universal credit automated system. We
will therefore significantly reduce the amount of official 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1047<a class="bkMark" name="Column1047">&#160;</a>
                           </div>error, although we can never remove it altogether. As she has rightly
said, people are only human, and there will be errors in the inputting
and processing of data, but I am confident that the universal credit
system as a whole will reduce the amount of
error.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady is right to draw attention to the fact that the Department
should accept where it gets things wrong, but I do not agree with her
amendment. She talked about producing a report, but that would consume
time and resources and take people away from the front-line job that we
want them to do. Of course, we already provide compensation. For cases
in which a claimant has suffered as a result of departmental
maladministration, we operate a discretionary, non-statutory scheme to
provide financial
redress.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
letters crossing my desk, I regularly see cases in which we have made
errors and are making payments to claimants in compensation for the
inconvenience and disruption that has been caused. That amount varies
according to the situation. We routinely consider financial redress
when we rectify any cases of maladministration. Claimants may request
that they be considered for a special payment or an extra statutory
payment by outlining what has happened and its impact on them. We are
sympathetic to claims that are bona fide and legitimate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions in appropriate cases allow for the making of a consolatory
payment when, as a result of an official error, there has been a
specific impact on someone’s life. Importantly, each payment is
considered individually to ensure that the redress provided is
appropriate to the circumstances. If the hon. Lady wants to find out
more, the DWP website gives details of the special payments scheme, so
she will be able to see more clearly what we are doing. Local
authorities are autonomous bodies, so they have their own arrangements
for matters in their ambit, such as providing compensation when they
have made a mistake in a housing benefit claim.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I reassure
the hon. Lady that mechanisms are in place. They will vary depending on
circumstances, which is one reason why a set scheme with a fixed amount
would be inappropriate. The individual impact of an error can be very
different in different cases. I cannot accept her proposal of another
report because, arguably, the Government already produce too many
reports. I reassure her, however, that the mechanisms are in place to
ensure that when we make a mistake, compensation will be paid to the
affected person.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000079">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his reply. The
arrangements are complex and time-consuming. They apply when there has
been substantial error, but not necessarily when there has been regular
error. The Government are not the first to suggest that they have found
the nirvana of a system that will not have errors, but a simple system
for compensation might have been more acceptable, especially as that
argument is being used as an incentive to reduce error for
claimants.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
share the Minister’s great optimism that automation is the
answer to everything. As we know, automated response systems can go
horribly wrong—and they can go even more horribly wrong when
they apply to many people. I hope that the system will not be like
trying to correspond with a certain council’s outsourced council
tax system. Whenever people ask for a response, the system states that
the council will respond in 10 days; 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1048<a class="bkMark" name="Column1048">&#160;</a>
                           </div>when people write back to complain that it has not done so, they get an
e-mail stating, “You haven’t responded; we will respond
in 10 days.” It is an endless loop that seems to be unbreakable.
I am sure that that will not happen under the DWP system. I shall not
press the amendment to a vote, but I hope, as we see how the system
develops, that the Government are minded to reconsider our suggestion.

technical change to the Bill. Clauses 112 to 114 make changes to the
rules for restricting payments for sanctionable benefits. Clause 115
introduces a similar scheme, which restricts working tax credit when
the claimant has been convicted of, cautioned for, or accepts an
administrative financial penalty for tax credit or benefit fraud. The
clause specifies the scheme’s commencement date as 5 April 2012;
clauses 112 to 114 allow commencement by order. The amendment simply
aligns the two, because it does not make sense to have two schemes
starting on different days. The change will enable the start date to be
implemented in a joined-up manner simply by issuing a Treasury order.
The amendment is technical and certainly makes no material change to
the substance of the Bill, so I hope that the Committee will accept
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000087">&#160;</a>

the living wage within their budgets. During his leadership campaign,
my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition wrote to the chief
executives of 30 major employers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco,
Holiday Inn and The Carphone Warehouse, asking them to adopt the living
wage for their staff. An early champion of the policy was Ken

particular Conservative policy since the election, but it might be in
the same category as other policies we heard about—maintaining
education maintenance allowance, not increasing VAT, recruiting 3,000
extra midwives—that were abandoned as soon as the election was
safely won. There is no doubt, however, that the Prime Minister, at one
time at any rate, regarded the living wage as a Conservative
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000100">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions is also on the record as a supporter of
the living wage. In December last year—after the general
election—he delivered a speech about welfare reform to the
think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research. During a
question-and-answer exchange afterwards, he said that the Government
were “very keen” on the idea of a living wage. I hope
that the Minister will follow the Secretary of State’s lead when
he responds to the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the most vocal supporters of the living wage—in the
Conservative party, at least—is the Mayor of London. The work
was begun by his predecessor, but the Mayor has maintained the policy,
for which he is entitled to a good deal of credit. He put the case
cogently in his foreword to the seventh annual report on the London
living wage, published earlier this
month:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is right that their skills and commitment to London’s success
are recognised, and one of the most fundamental ways of doing this is
to ensure that all Londoners are paid properly. That means receiving at
least the ‘London Living Wage’, which is designed to
provide a minimum acceptable quality of
life.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
campaign for the living wage was launched just 10 years ago, and I was
at an event in Central hall on bank holiday Monday earlier this month
to mark the anniversary. The campaign is a product of the citizens
organising movement, and Citizens UK rightly identifies two key reasons
to support it, the first being to help to address the challenge of
in-work poverty. We have touched on that in Committee and will return
to it when we debate the Government’s new clauses on child
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
high rate of poverty exists among households in which at least one
parent is in work. Working poverty imposes a high cost on the UK
economy, for example by worsening the health of those who suffer from
it, and wider adoption of the living wage would reduce such costs. The
Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates that, in total, poverty imposes a
cost of £25 billion a year on the UK economy, and working
poverty is part of that
bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the living wage would help to reduce the cost to the Exchequer of
supporting people on low incomes. People on low incomes are supported
through the tax credit system, but in future, as we have been debating,
they will have their income topped up by universal credit. The
organisation Working Families made this point about universal credit in
its written evidence to the Select Committee on Work and
Pensions:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
benefits system should not subsidise poor employers paying minimum
wages. A move towards a living wage would significantly reduce the
burden on the welfare budget and ensure more families were able to
progress in
work.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Citizens
UK set the case out
thus:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Living Wage is an effective tool to create good jobs, combat child
poverty, incentivize work and save the taxpayer money in in-work
benefits. By introducing and championing a non-statutory
‘moral’ minimum that complements the National Minimum
Wage, the Government can encourage the private sector to take
responsibility for low pay without endangering employment. Success of
the Living Wage in London is a strong example of how a
‘nudge’ policy can be used to tackle the difficult
problem of working poverty. A combination of productivity gains and
saved spending on in-work benefits makes this policy entirely
affordable and when the ‘nudge’ works, will be a way to
reduce public spending while improving social
outcomes.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
warmly welcome the progress that has been made in the campaign. A few
weeks ago at the event I mentioned, the uprated London living wage
calculated by the unit

			Column number: 1051<a class="bkMark" name="Column1051">&#160;</a>
                           </div>operated by the Mayor of London was announced. The London living wage
has increased to £8.30 per hour, which is nearly a 25% increase
from when it was introduced six years ago. For the first time ever, a
national living wage was also announced for people outside London. It
is proposed that that should be set at £7.20 per
hour.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
pay tribute to Citizens UK for the imagination and determination that
has gone into that campaign, which goes back to TELCO—the east
London citizens organisation—whose launch I attended soon after
the 1997 general election. That organisation brings together hundreds
of people from churches, mosques, synagogues, trade union branches,
community organisations and schools. Its impact is unquestionably
building, and slowly but surely the idea of a living wage is catching
on. Citizens UK has calculated that the campaign has already secured
more than £70 million in extra wages. It estimates that it has
lifted more than 10,000 families out of poverty, but there is still
undoubtedly scope for a considerably greater
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000108">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No. If the hon. Gentleman’s suggestion is
that the level of the living wage should be the statutory national
minimum wage, I do not agree with that. Citizens UK is very clear that
it is not calling for that. The statutory minimum wage is calculated on
the basis of the advice of the Low Pay Commission and is set very
carefully at a level that does not threaten employment. Citizens UK
makes the point that if one simply increased the minimum wage from
£5.93 to £8.30, which is the current London living wage,
there would be an effect on employment. Therefore, I am not proposing
that it should be made statutory, and neither is the campaign. However,
there is an opportunity to look at how the vast amount of information
that will become available to the Secretary of State may be used to
inform policy on the living wage. Ideally, I would like that to take
the form of an independent review. That would enable as much fresh and
imaginative thinking as possible. A report would be
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000116">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me suggest a few lines of inquiry. The first way in which all that
information could inform policy on the living wage is by helping
calculate what the level of the living wage should be. The living wage
unit in City hall in London has a great deal of experience in
calculating the level of living wage for London. The method it uses is
well developed. It has strong links with the methodology for minimum
income standards, which was developed by Loughborough
university—my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston
described that to the Committee in an earlier sitting—and is set
out in the annual report of the Greater London authority living wage
unit entitled, “Fairer London”. It uses two basic
approaches to calculate the living wage. The information, which will be
shared on the basis of the clause, could support both.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
approach is what it calls the basic living costs approach; the second
is the income distribution approach. The first starts by assessing
costs—housing, council tax, child care and so-called regular
shopping basket costs—for various types of family. The next step
is to deduct taxation, add the benefits to which households would be
entitled—working tax credit, housing benefit and so on. That is
where the data possessed by the Department could be particularly
valuable. Drawing on the data at his disposal, the Secretary of State
will be able to make much more authoritative assessments of the value
of those deductions or additions. Based on its calculations, the London
living wage unit then calculates the weighted average wage, across
various household types, that is required to meet basic living costs.
In 2011, the most recent calculation, that figure came to £6.85
an
hour.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other side of the calculation is the income distribution approach. The
Department for Work and Pensions provides the unit with indicators of
average household incomes after housing costs. That is where the
real-time PAYE data, which will be assembled under the clause, could
prove extremely valuable. There will be an immensely rich set of data
assembled every month, in real time, about precisely how much every
employee in the country has been paid that month. That will be far more
data on regional and seasonal variation than anyone has access to at
the moment. It will be available in real time, and not a long time
afterwards as is the case with the various surveys that are available
at the moment, or even with tax data, which are available only a
lengthy 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1053<a class="bkMark" name="Column1053">&#160;</a>
                           </div>period after the event. Those data will be invaluable in assessing the
right level for the living wage, certainly in areas other than London,
where at the moment the calculation is in its infancy. As I said, the
first stab at setting a figure has only just been
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the official poverty threshold is 60% of median income, the unit
calculates the wage that is required to meet that income level. In
2011, that calculation, across various household types, came out at
£7.65 an hour. The London living wage unit brings those two
approaches together and takes an average from them, so £6.85 and
£7.65 results in an average of £7.25. It then adds in a
15% margin against poverty, resulting in the final figure that was
announced earlier this month, which I have already mentioned, of
£8.30 an hour for the living wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000120">&#160;</a>

generous in taking interventions. A moment ago, I asked him whether he
thought that the living wage should be backed up to be a real strong
policy. He has expressed a concern that it would actually increase
unemployment. Therefore, what policy is he advocating on the living
wage that the Government should take on board? I am slightly at a loss.
He says, “Don’t back it up, or give it teeth, but somehow
just generally advocate it, or exhort private sector employers.”
What should the Government do to further the right hon.

certainly like them to adopt the living wage for their employees and
contractors in the public sector, which the Labour party manifesto
proposed at the last election. On top of that, I would like more
exhortation. I would like the approach to be similar to that taken by
the Government in relation to corporate responsibility: not making it a
legal obligation for companies to behave in a socially responsible way,
but providing a variety of exhortations and encouragement. We know from
what happened with corporate social responsibility that that approach
is effective, and I would like the Government to adopt it, particularly
as the Prime Minister said that that is Conservative policy. We would
like to see him acting on

simply say that the amendment provides the solution to the hon.
Gentleman’s problem, because 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>with the data that the Department for Work and Pensions will have under
clause 121, it can work out the appropriate level for the living wage
in north Wales. The hon. Gentleman is making the point that it should
be less than elsewhere, and that is a fair point, but he underlines why
the Member for Dover is mistaken about making it
statutory.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not my intention to advocate a particular mechanism for calculating
the living wage, but I want to highlight the ways in which, as a
consequence of introducing real-time PAYE data collection to support
universal credit under the clause, the Department for Work and Pensions
will have access to a vast amount of data in real time, which could be
of great value in developing policy on the living
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000125">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I think I have now understood the
right hon. Gentleman’s amendment. Its effect would simply be to
talk about the fact that the Government will have a lot of pay data as
a result of the new systems. With the transparency that the new
Government believe in, I am sure that that data will be available in
some form. What use is then made of the data by campaigners against
poverty, campaigners on the living wage, or anyone else will be up to
the users. It will not be for the Government to prescribe how it is
disseminated.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have been told by the Prime Minister himself
that the living wage is his policy, so I hope that he will seize the
opportunity of the vast amount of data to promote it. That is what I am
advocating. However, the hon. Gentleman is right, and there is a wider
point. At the moment, a good deal of effort goes into income surveys
and various household surveys, and some data are available through the
tax authorities on levels of income, but this system will completely
transform the landscape. Suddenly, data will be collected about every
single mum and every single employee in the country, and perhaps the
Minister will tell us how he envisages that being made
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
would have to be careful, because individuals’ pay data must not
be allowed to get into the public domain. There are some security
issues with this enormous new system. As long as those data can be
protected, our understanding of pay and local variations—in
north Wales and around the country—will be transformed by that
rich, new data
source.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
first suggestion, therefore, is that the information could help inform
the level of the living wage, and my second suggestion is that it could
be used to calculate the cost to employers of implementing a living
wage. The Mayor of London has on several occasions argued strongly that
paying the living wage is in the best interests of businesses, and in
the foreword to the Greater London authority living wage unit’s
latest annual report, from which I quoted earlier, he
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Paying
the London Living Wage is not only morally right, but makes good
business sense too. What may appear to a company to be an unaffordable
cost in a highly competitive market should more often be viewed as a
sound investment decision. I believe that paying decent wages reduces
staff turnover and produces a more motivated and productive
workforce.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Citizens
UK makes a similar
point:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Implementation
of the Living Wage has gone hand in hand with improving the quality of
low-paid jobs. As the pay is increased, employers have sought to
increase the range of task 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1055<a class="bkMark" name="Column1055">&#160;</a>
                           </div>performed by the employees. Increased pay has led to greater staff
loyalty and much reduced turnover in staff. These two factors alone
produce significant savings and, combined with increased training and
improved career progression opportunities, have the potential to
produce greater overall productivity and much higher levels of
service.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
has certainly been the experience of a number of the employers who have
adopted the London living wage. For example, Barclays has commented on
its experience of introducing the London living wage for its contract
cleaning
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regardless
of whether the assessment is agreed, it might be helpful to have an
indication of the cost to employers of paying their staff a living
wage. The vast amount of data that will now be held by the state should
make it possible at least to estimate by how much wages would need to
increase. Should the Secretary of State wish it, it might also be
possible to calculate the additional cost on a regional or even more
localised basis, which would give us a better measure of the challenges
involved in implementing the living wage across the country. My second
suggestion, therefore, is that the system be used to estimate the cost
to employers of implementing the living
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is of course a weakness here. As we have discussed, the real-time PAYE
system will not collect data on hours worked. It would be a major
additional burden on employers to collect that information as well. The
Department for Work and Pensions would like to have those data; it
would enable it to apply the hours threshold for its exemption for
working households from the benefit cap, instead of using the pay
proxy, which will have the absurd effects that I described to the
Committee on Tuesday. I wonder though whether we might end up with that
data being collected, notwithstanding objections from employers, in
which case a much fuller assessment could be made of the cost to
employers of introducing the living
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
leads to my final suggestion, which is that the data could be used to
assess employers’ compliance with the living wage. In its
written evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee, the Child Poverty
Action Group
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Given
the data that the government will hold on employees and earnings
through using PAYE to deliver Universal Credit, it will be more
possible than before to identify major employers who exploit poverty
pay and the top ups made by the tax payer. The government should commit
to investigating if this will provide an opportunity for applying
levies to companies that exploit the presence of Universal Credit
wage-subsidies in this
way.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
assess properly compliance with the living wage, the Government would
need to collect details not only of earnings but of hours worked. If
the Government eventually decide that they have to collect the
information, they should use it to assess compliance with the living
wage. Larger companies probably already collect details of hours
worked—a lot of small companies will not—and they might
well have the capacity to supply such information to HMRC monthly,
alongside their earnings
data.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
line of inquiry for the report could be to consider requiring the
largest employers to provide hours data or rates of pay for each
employee alongside pay data, and to use that in assessing compliance
with the living wage. Perhaps it might even be possible to publish some
assessment of the extent of major employers’ compliance 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1056<a class="bkMark" name="Column1056">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with the living wage. That is an example of the kind of encouragement
that the Government could give to promote the living wage, without
making it statutory as the hon. Member for Dover suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
are three suggestions for how the information-sharing systems that the
clause facilitates could be used to inform policy on the living wage. I
give them simply as examples to highlight possible lines of inquiry for
the report. Others could well be suggested, but the large new PAYE
real-time monthly data collection will certainly provide a remarkable
new resource.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000137">&#160;</a>

that the debate has strayed quite a long way from the purpose of the

stray a tiny bit into some of the principles addressed by the right

                        <p class="tabbed">From the
Prime Minister downwards, both sides of the coalition have voiced
support for the principle of the living wage and the London living
wage. It is my absolutely clear view—I agree with the right hon.
Gentleman’s point—that it is to employers’ benefit
to pay their employees a decent wage to secure their loyalty and avoid
staff turnover, quite apart from the fact that it is the right thing to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
and proper that politicians from all parties should encourage employers
to pay a living wage. One of the first steps that we took as Ministers
when we entered the Department was to ask whether our own work force
was paid a living wage, and every single DWP employee is. Employers
across the public sector and outside it should all be encouraged to
consider the issue seriously. As I said, it makes good business sense,
quite apart from anything else. I agree with that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The work done
by voluntary sector groups to highlight the issue has been enormously
valuable. It is a sign of how our society works today that grassroots

have campaigned for the living wage, including the Mayor of London. I
support and endorse the comments made by the Prime Minister, but I am
afraid that this is the Lord Nelson amendment because the right hon.

why.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000146">&#160;</a>

we collect data as a matter of routine. We input that data into
research projects for different Departments and across Government, and
that will certainly be the case when universal credit is introduced. It
is a matter of routine, and the right hon. Gentleman will be aware from
his time in the Department that we spend a considerable amount on
analysis of our own data and of research data gathered from outside the
Department to inform policy making. That will not change, but
unfortunately for him, in proposing an amendment that would require the
Secretary of State to produce a report, he is looking down the wrong
end of the data-sharing pipeline set out in the

London living wage and the living wage as an overall principle are a
responsibility for the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
so, while I am delighted to confirm that we will be sharing data of the
kind that the right hon. Gentleman suggests with the Treasury and with
HMRC, and that we will pool resources and work together to understand
more clearly the nature of the audience we are dealing with over the
introduction of universal credit, the impact of universal credit on
poverty and the information that we garner as a result of the use of
real-time data about employment trends or pay levels, it is the job of
the Chancellor and his team at the Treasury to assemble the report and
make recommendations on the

I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will be aware from his time in

Treasury’s toes and moments when it is not. In this case, I am
happy to say to my colleagues in the Treasury that I hope they will
make use of the data we collect to inform their thinking on the living
wage. We will make findings available where it is appropriate to do so
under data-sharing agreements and the regulations and rules set out by
the Information Commissioner, so that outside researchers can use the
data we have collected for some of the purposes that the right hon.
Gentleman described. If he wants to achieve the goals set out in the

                           </strong> We come to a very important section of the Bill
that has attracted considerable press attention to date and will
continue to excite further public comment, particularly as the Bill
progresses and these clauses become more well known. It is important as
it touches on a number of key issues concerning families and children.
At the heart of the debate, our amendments are about supporting
families through difficult transitions, ensuring that focus remains on
the best interests of the child and on ensuring that parents fulfil
their proper parental
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am about to make a very controversial statement, one that I never
thought I would hear myself say, that will come as a great surprise to
many of my friends and colleagues, which is that Mrs Thatcher had a
point. <em>[Interruption.]</em> A great shockwave. I intend never to make
such a controversial statement as that ever again, but let me quickly
explain, and please do not ever take that comment out of
context.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The point
that that lady had when she established the Child Support
Agency—she provided the drive behind its
establishment—was to ensure that parents, particularly absent
fathers, fulfilled their responsibilities to their children, even when
they were no longer living under the same roof as those children. It is
not appropriate that, when some parents leave the scene, they assume
that their commitment to the child is somehow watered down, and the
state is essentially left to pick up the tab when parents take off, if
I might put it so crudely.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Over the
years, there have been developments and improvements in the law and the
operation of child support systems, most recently the Child Maintenance
and Other Payments Act 2008. That legislation has great bearing on the
discussions we will be having this afternoon and, indeed, as the Bill
progresses. Some in the Government will argue that they are simply
building on those developments, but that argument cannot be sustained,
which is what our amendments will explore.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
should bear in mind the key clauses of the 2008 Act, because they put
into context the work of the Bill and our amendments to it. That Act
provided a mandatory conversation. Wherever possible, private voluntary
arrangements should be encouraged and supported, and we should utilise
the machinery of information, counselling, mediation and so on to
promote voluntary arrangements. It is now widely acknowledged that the
Options service that was introduced is operating increasingly
effectively to deliver voluntary arrangements. However, as I will
explore this afternoon, the Government’s proposals have taken us
a step too far and have begun to undermine that drive.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will turn
to amendments 268 and 269 and consider the issue in some depth. The
Government’s proposals must be judged on key criteria: are they
fairer, sustainable and, most importantly, effective in ensuring that
the commission meets its main objective as set out in the 2008 Act?
That objective was to<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“maximise the
number of those children who live apart from one or both of their
parents for whom effective maintenance arrangements are in
place.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000348">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Amendment
268 would ensure that the commission’s priority continues to be
the well-being of the child and that that is centre stage. It would
ensure that the commission’s overall motivation is what works
best to reach successful and lasting maintenance arrangements. That is
not what the clause seeks to do, which is to enforce voluntary
arrangements simply as a means to reduce case load. That is a very
important distinction in the debate
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
269 applies the rationale set out in amendment 268 to existing
applicants who wish to transfer to the new system. We support voluntary
arrangements wherever possible. For the record, it is essential to
remember the commission’s original objective, as set out in
section 2A of the 2008 Act:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“to encourage
and support the making and keeping by parents of appropriate voluntary
maintenance arrangements for their
children”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
commitment to the importance of voluntary maintenance arrangements is
already enshrined in legislation. We strongly believe that the
commission’s purpose must involve assisting and facilitating
those voluntary arrangement wherever possible. However, the clause goes
one step too far. It gives the Secretary of State power to enforce
private arrangements, even if that may not always lead to the best
outcome for the parents or children involved. To empower a Minister in
that way is a very significant
step.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Groups
working with families across the country have clear reservations about
introducing a mandatory gateway in a way that will undermine the
importance of the commission’s primary objectives, which are the
best interests of the child. For example, the Church of England is, we
can safely assume, a strong advocate of marriage and lasting
relationships.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000197">&#160;</a>

                           </div>intention of the Bill is to support parents to make voluntary
arrangements about child maintenance wherever possible, thus reducing
the need for applications to the statutory scheme, so saving the state
money. However … mediation is an excellent principle but it
cannot work in all cases… We fear that the laudable focus on
mediation will fail to serve some of the most vulnerable families and

                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore,
there are real concerns about the proposed mandatory gateway
effectively acting as a deterrent to parents who genuinely need the
statutory system to help them deliver their maintenance
payments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According to
the Government’s consultation paper “Strengthening
families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child
maintenance”, to which I am sure we will make many references
this afternoon:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
family-based arrangement is one in which both parents agree on how to
provide child maintenance for their child, how much and when,
independently of the CSA or the courts. It is more flexible than other
types of arrangement, emphasises collaboration between parents rather
than conflict and helps to keep both parents involved in their
child’s life after
separation.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>No
one could argue against that; we would all support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
far it goes, we strongly support the approach, but there is a bigger
picture. We need to focus on the families who are not beyond the stage
where collaboration and flexibility of arrangements are possible. To
declare the gateway to be mandatory for all is an over-simplistic
response to the very complicated and challenging consequences of family
breakdown.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
some 1.15 million parents using the Child Support Agency have never
lived together or separated a considerable time ago, are part of a
parental conflict, and the parent with care is poorer or out of work.
The chances of individuals in those categories making successful
private arrangements are therefore likely to be considerably lower than
those of others who choose to make such arrangements. There is
considerable research evidence, which we might discuss, to back that
up. We need to look at the circumstances of parents and children who
live in particular
difficulty.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
way in which the mandatory gateway is to be applied raises a range of
fundamental questions, with which the Minister has been engaged for
some time. I shall pick two to clarify the issues involved. First, in
what circumstances will private maintenance arrangements not be
regarded as appropriate—when will the agency accept those
arrangements? Secondly, in what circumstances do the Government
envisage that a parent with care’s application to the statutory
scheme could be turned down at the gateway stage, and will there be a
right of appeal? If it is mandatory, how will that element be enforced
if the parent with care does not feel that it is proper and
necessary?<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Gingerbread,
a well-respected organisation in this field, has provided various case
studies of private arrangements that simply do not work. One individual
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000207">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“I
worked in a private agreement for many years without a hitch but then
the non-resident parent decided he no longer wanted to see his child or
pay for her, how is this my fault? I think the Government are
overlooking one major issue in the breakdown of many relationships
which is the issue I am faced with—my ex-partner sees the
payment of maintenance as a payment to me to fund my lifestyle and NOT
payment to support our child... In my case no amount of negotiating
would work I’m afraid.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000352">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Implementing
a compulsory gateway, forcing family based solutions where they could

                        <p>Our
position is about not throwing more parents straight on to the
commission’s case load pile and telling people that going there
will sort out the problem, instead of encouraging private
arrangements—that would go against the objectives of the
commission, which was set up by the previous Government. We strongly
support voluntary arrangements, but we have to recognise that that does
not apply in every
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000214">&#160;</a>

commission must take all possible steps to ensure that in each
individual case the parent makes the right decision in the best
interests of their child. That should be our guide whether it results
in an effective private maintenance agreement or an application to the
commission. Alongside section 2 of the 2008 Act, the amendments would
ensure that a careful balance was struck between encouraging families
to pursue private arrangements wherever possible, but not to the extent
of deterring applications from those parents who require statutory
support to arrange effective maintenance agreements. If we do not have
that balance, in effect the children will suffer, and it
would be a breach of the fundamental principles for setting up the CSA
in the first

                           </strong> I support both amendments. It is easy to
underestimate how far we have come since the original formation of the
Child Support Agency in 1993, in getting it to work and ensure the flow
of maintenance to more
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000216">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not pretend for one minute that the CSA is operating perfectly, but
we are light years from the difficulties experienced by parents in the
mid-1990s. Members of Parliament who were in the House at that time
might remember their case loads when the agency was
established, but they know now that the preponderance of child support
cases in surgeries today is much lower, by a major factor. That is a
tribute to the hard work of 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>the agency’s senior management and staff over many years, often
in the teeth of considerable public hostility, which has been difficult
for them to contend
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
after a time, the Labour Government realised that, fundamentally, a
system that collected money in hostile circumstances from a
non-resident parent while not in any way ensuring that that money was
transferred to her or, more usually, his children but was instead held
on to by the Treasury, which cut the lone-parent benefit, obviously
created a sour and poisonous atmosphere in which to get money out of
the non-resident parents. Now, if maintenance is collected, it flows in
full to the parent with care of the children and, therefore, makes a
contribution to their material living standards. That is an important
point and a significant step
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
should, absolutely, want to incentivise parents to make private,
voluntary arrangements if they can, provided that such arrangements are
made without the kind of conflict that can be extremely damaging to
families and, in particular, to children—provided that the
arrangements can deliver fair maintenance. In many instances, it is all
too easy for women to enter into voluntary arrangements, but for not
very much, for small sums of money and for sporadic support from the
non-resident parent. They often do so because it is too much grief to
negotiate a sensible level of maintenance. If we are interested in
improving children’s material circumstances, as we all are, it
is important for the right level of maintenance to flow and, as far as
possible, for the child to have as similar a lifestyle and material
circumstances as if her or his parents had not
separated.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Since
1997, Labour has rightly seen the purpose of the child maintenance
system as getting that maintenance flowing to the family. It is
important that any increase in the use of voluntary arrangements is not
to the detriment of that maintenance flow, which we have always seen as
the paramount purpose of the system. One question I very much direct at
the Minister: does that remain the Government’s top priority in
promoting voluntary arrangements? There is certainly a perception that
the top priority is simply to keep people from using the agency, and
not actually to ensure that the maintenance
flows.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
thing we know about maintenance is that, once even a small amount
starts to flow regularly and once the habit of maintenance is
developed, such arrangements tends to stick. In truth, that is probably
more important than how the maintenance arrangement is arrived at,
whether voluntary or through the statutory
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No
one wants to prevent the making of good-quality voluntary arrangements,
if they can be put in place. I think that the Government acknowledge
that to make such arrangements more likely to be fair, good for
children and lasting, parents might need some support. Ministers are
keen to bring together a range of services in the community to support
parents as they navigate their way through those voluntary
arrangements. People are concerned about whether voluntary local
services will continue to have funding available to provide the support
that parents
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000222">&#160;</a>

example, people will need financial as well as relationship advice.
They will need to know what the right level of financial support is in
their financial circumstances and in those of their partner. They will
need to know what financial commitments that, as parents with care,
they incur to look after their child.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000224">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In a lengthy
debate in Committee a couple of weeks ago, we expressed our concern
about the loss of funding for local advice services across the piece.
Although I welcome Ministers’ intention to give additional
support to organisations that provide help with relationship breakdown
and negotiating some of its consequences, voluntary arrangements will
not work if parents cannot access decent support. Will the Minister
reassure us that making funding available, particularly to
non-statutory organisations, is not a question of payment by result? If
organisations were given incentives to get parents into voluntary
arrangements, there would be a real risk of people ending up in
unsuitable arrangements. I hope that he can reassure the Committee on
that matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
requirement to go through the gateway might deter some parents from
taking steps to achieve child maintenance, either through a negotiated
private arrangement with a former partner, or through the statutory
scheme. My hon. Friend—if I may call her that—the Member
for West Worcestershire and I heard some interesting evidence about
access to the gateway on Monday afternoon in the Select Committee on
Work and Pensions. I think that the transcript of that session has not
yet been published, so I am speaking from memory and from watching the
video of the session this morning on the Select Committee website. I
had a quick nip through it and scribbled down a few key points. A good
watch it was too—I strongly urge hon. Members to go and watch it
on the telly when Committee ends this afternoon.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000226">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The session
was interesting. All the witnesses highlighted the fact that it is the
parent with care—the applicant for child support—who must
go through the gateway. Right from the outset, it is more likely that
the non-resident parent will become disengaged. In the vast majority of
cases, the non-resident parent is the man; more than 90% of parents
with care are women. Even at the beginning of this maintenance journey,
witnesses whom we met on Monday were concerned that fathers were
distanced from arrangements for the well-being of their kids. People
are concerned that the gateway itself should be designed so that there
is equality of arms for both parents—they must both be engaged
with it from the outset.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000227">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for West Worcestershire and I were struck by the figures that we
heard in the Work and Pensions Committee on Monday, as were other
Committee members. The number of parents who are not using the Child
Support Agency is substantial—they receive no child maintenance
at all. We were told that 60% of parents with care who do not receive
maintenance through the Agency do not receive any child maintenance
from the other parent of their kids either. We were all staggered by
that fact. I thought that I was hardened to people’s poor
experiences of child maintenance, but I thought that that figure was
shockingly high. Children are the ones who lose out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000228">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">We certainly
hope that some parents among those 60% might be persuaded to make
private arrangements, but they are not doing so at the moment. To put
it at its gentlest, they need some pretty heavy-duty persuasion to
begin doing that. We probed a little more in the Select Committee. We
asked, “Who are these people? Why aren’t they making
claims? What is the problem with them?” We were told by our
witnesses that in 30% of cases, the parent with care did not know where
the non-resident parent was and had lost contact completely. Let us
remember that many arrangement cases affect couples who have perhaps
spent little time together before separating and may not have had any
meaningful relationship. In 20% of cases, the parent with care believed
that the non-resident parent would not pay up, so they did not intend
to go to any effort to get them to do so, because they believed that
that was a hopeless goal.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
underestimates how far the Child Support Agency has moved in its
effectiveness. Its original reputation has had a long-tail bad effect
right through to today, nearly two decades later. We can all understand
why that happened. That is not a point about the Conservative
Government who introduced it any more than it is about successive
Labour Governments. Governments on both sides have had huge
difficulties over many years in getting the operation of the CSA
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000230">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
recent years, the CSA has been on a more even keel. Inevitably, that
message does not get through very quickly to parents. What they know is
a long period of considerable operational difficulty, which has
naturally deterred them from having any confidence in it. There is an
opportunity, which I am worried may be about to be lost by this
legislation, to begin to build up the reputation of the CSA, now that
its performance is becoming stable and stronger. I pay tribute to the
staff who have helped to bring that
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000231">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other point I want to make about voluntary arrangements concerns the
nature of the people who enter into them. Again, we discussed this in
the Work and Pensions Committee on Monday afternoon. We asked Caroline
Bryson, a social researcher who had been involved in research on child
support arrangements—I think I am right in saying that it was
for the DWP—particularly as a researcher at the National Centre
for Social Research a couple of years ago, who entered into voluntary
arrangements. To a considerable extent, she felt that those people were
something of a self-selecting group. Someone was more likely to enter
into a voluntary arrangement if they had a longer, more stable
relationship before separation. That probably meant that they had been
married, or in a long-standing, co-habiting relationship over a number
of years. She said that the separation had to be amicable. It is
difficult to negotiate a voluntary arrangement if there are
difficulties and conflict in all other aspects of the
relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Caroline
Bryson did not say this, but in my experience, particularly when I was
director of the National Council for One Parent Families—which
is now Gingerbread— it tended to be the better-off,
professional, qualified and generally higher socio-economic groups of
parents who were able to make successful voluntary arrangements. Again,
that does not mean that we cannot facilitate arrangements for others in
some circumstances, but a heavy-duty infrastructure of support and
advice would be required to ensure that they can make good—for
the children, first and foremost—and sustainable
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000233">&#160;</a>

help us better understand the effect of the legislation, can she, from
her experience—I realise this will not be based on a huge amount
of data—tell us what proportion of people in break-ups where
children are involved are likely to come to a voluntary arrangement,
with the finances at the right level, without any intervention from
anyone
else?<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000234">&#160;</a>

people are not using the CSA and receive no maintenance. I have no
doubt that that could be improved, but it is a massive gap to fill and
an awful lot of children. If the parent with care goes through the
gateway, she will have to demonstrate that she has genuinely made
efforts to reach a voluntary agreement. That is not just picking up the
phone and saying, “I don’t think it will work for
me.” I say “she”, because it probably will be a
she. That, of itself, may be likely to deter a substantial proportion
of the 60% who are not in the system
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000235">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right. As a result of
the Government’s investment in advice on negotiating voluntary
arrangements, some of those voluntary arrangements might become better.
They might become stronger, and there might be more systematic payment
of the right level of maintenance. Later in this debate, we will talk
about the calculation service and how the Government intend to make it
work. There is potential to improve the situation in some cases but,
from all of my experience, it is more likely that a substantial number
of those families will not come anywhere near the gateway and will not
receive any support or maintenance arrangements and payments at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000237">&#160;</a>

is important that we address the points on changing circumstances made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow East. Interestingly, the
Select Committee was told on Monday that voluntary arrangements tended
to work quite well when children were younger and during the early
years, but as children became older, as the arrangement got older and
circumstances changed, the arrangement might come under pressure. My
hon. Friend mentioned some of the pressure points that make it likely
that a non-resident parent will lose his enthusiasm for an arrangement
that he made. The arrival of a new baby or second family, his forming a
new relationship, his moving to another part of the country for work,
and so on, may mean that he has less sense of being around his
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000238">&#160;</a>

second question is what support and infrastructure will the Minister
provide for those who have made voluntary arrangements, perhaps with
the help of the voluntary service or others, which she is keen to
facilitate? What support will be available to help people to
renegotiate and recalibrate arrangements over
time?<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000239">&#160;</a>

am concerned about the gateway proposal. I accept that we now have a
choices model, which was introduced with the creation of the Child
Maintenance and

                           </div>Enforcement Commission some years ago, but the compulsion to go through
that gateway, and the way in which the Government have designed it, is
likely to deter a substantial number of parents with care from having
anything to do with child maintenance arrangements. That means that
maintenance will not flow to the benefit of children, so their material
circumstances will deteriorate. Fewer cases will be handled by the
statutory scheme, because people will not go near child maintenance
arrangements of any sort, which will increase the cost per head of
dealing with cases that get into the statutory scheme, so it may not be
a great cost saver in the end. I am particularly concerned about the
impact on child poverty in such
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some
time ago, I tabled parliamentary questions about the impact of
maintenance arrangements on child poverty. Ministers said that the
changes to child maintenance will have no impact on child poverty. In
statistical terms, that is probably right, because the differential of
a few tens of thousands of children either way may not show up in the
statistics, although I find it surprising. The parliamentary answer I
received was thoughtful, and it explained how the child poverty impact
might not show up in the statistical data. I accept what I was
told.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000241">&#160;</a>

the case may be with the national statistics, there is no doubt that
the circumstances of children in families to whom child maintenance
does not flow will be worse. That is why our starting point is that any
gateway to get people into the system must be designed to ensure that
the maximum possible amount of maintenance flows to the benefit of
children. I am concerned that introducing the gateway as proposed will
get in the way of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000242">&#160;</a>

and derives from the Government’s view of how to proceed with
child maintenance. I referred in the previous sitting to legislation by
assertion. There appears to be a view, which is asserted rather than
proved, about the nature of statutory child maintenance arrangements.
Slightly oddly, the consultation began by effectively challenging
everybody involved to say that they had the wrong picture of those who
went through statutory schemes and that they might be “surprised
to know” that quite a lot of people who went through the
statutory system retained contact with each another or with their
children. I am not surprised about that. We are creating a straw man in
order to knock it down and say, we need to largely
dismember—because, in the end, that is what will happen

intention, as I understand it—although it does not necessarily
appear in the Bill; it is considered that it does not require

just new applicants and people who may separate in the future. In a
relatively short space of time—over a two-year period, it was
suggested, although that may change when the results of the
consultation come through—even for people who have a statutory
arrangement in place, that arrangement will be closed and people will
be told effectively to start going through the process again, which is
quite an unusual way of dealing with change. I think that that stems in
part from assumptions about the existing processes and statements that
do not necessarily bear out a lot of investigation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
remembering why a system was introduced in the first place. The
Conservative Government of the day were extremely concerned
that existing arrangements—those made through courts, agreements
that could be reached, or voluntary arrangements—simply did not
provide sufficient maintenance. The system, such as it was, did not
work. The replacement was not set up for no good reason; it was set up
because the problem was perceived to be that absent parents were not
making a sufficient contribution for their children. There was
therefore a concern that the state was required to cover far too much
of the
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
the past, efforts by the State have had the effect of taking
responsibility away from parents, instead encouraging them to use a
system in which conflict is

                        </p>
                        <p>Yes,
there is often conflict around separation, but my experience as a
family lawyer was that the conflict often lay with the parties
themselves. Statements are often made in relation to changes in the
legal system, in the legal aid system and now in child maintenance,
that somehow, statutory or legal arrangements are the ones that cause
conflict and bad feeling in separation. Actually, what causes it is
usually the circumstances in which people find themselves. I have often
attended joint negotiations where, far from it being the legal process
or the lawyers present who caused the situation to deteriorate, the
real anger, bad feeling, disappointment and all the emotions came out
of the separation. That is what drives a lot of these feelings and,
indeed, most of us spend most of our time calming people down and
trying to negotiate. The notion that we spend all our time ratcheting
people up to court is simply not
true.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000247">&#160;</a>

that that often depends on how recent the break-up is? If it is a
recent break-up and people are trying to get the parties together to
negotiate, they might have a better chance of getting an agreement, but
if it is a couple who split up a long time ago, and have been in the
system and the CSA for a long time, getting the parties talking, when
they probably have not talked for a number of years, will be much
harder, and it will be harder to reach a compromise

                           </strong> There could be a problem in moving everybody back
through a system of this kind if it involves saying, “Right,
we’ll close your case and you have to start again,” and
people have not had that kind of contact. It can cut both ways, because
the initial stages of separation are also extremely painful, and it can
be difficult to get people to act in the way they might otherwise. On
the other hand, there are circumstances in which people show
willingness to enter into arrangements, whether through guilt or
otherwise, which at a later date might become more difficult, possibly
because of a change of circumstances in their own lives. As people form
new relationships and even have further children, the whole thing
becomes quite fraught.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000249">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">While it
sounds laudable to say that people should be able to reach their own
arrangements, to translate that into saying that they must do that
beforehand changes the tenor of the debate and the experience people
have. Nor is it the case that there are a lot of institutions out there
that can give people the necessary help. That certainly was not my
experience, and I do not think 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1069<a class="bkMark" name="Column1069">&#160;</a>
                           </div>things have changed very much. In an ideal world, it would be good if
organisations existed, and were well funded, that could pick people up
at the beginning and give them all this help and assistance. However,
my experience is that the number of organisations that can do that is
limited. Family mediation schemes often struggle for funding and are
not always in a position to take people on quickly, or indeed to take
on all those who might want mediation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a further issue with mediation in financial situations. Mediation
is the flavour of the month—that has been raised already in
relation to legal aid matters—but where financial issues are at
stake, mediation can be extremely difficult The concept of mediation is
that everybody comes together, compromises and comes to some kind of
agreement. If there is an imbalance of power between the
parties—for instance, if one partner has all the financial
cards, or has hidden financial cards in their hand—one must be
very skilled at mediating them. There are some very skilled mediators,
but some are not that skilled. Sometimes what may seem like a mediated
settlement is one person rolling over and saying, “Okay,
I’ll accept that,” for the sake of peace and quiet,
reaching an agreement or simply not getting into any further conflicts
with the former partner. That is not necessarily
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have to be very clear that it is not just in cases of domestic
violence, which it has been suggested should be excluded, that such
problems arise. There are many situations that would not necessarily
add up to domestic violence, but where there is a serious imbalance
between the parties in their financial capacity and their power in the
relationship. If the thrust is to say, “Go away, reach an
agreement and don’t come back unless you’ve really failed
in that,” that may lead to people making arrangements that are
very weak and not enforceable—that is, unless they have signed a
legal agreement that can be properly enforced, which is why it is also
important that that option is given to
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
legal agreement is better than a purely voluntary agreement, but a lot
of people working in this field, including those who remember the
situation pre-CSA, have concerns. I had criticisms of the CSA from its
start, and I could bore everybody with why I think it went badly wrong
in its early years, but it was introduced to meet a need, and I do not
think that that need has necessarily gone away. If we take the view
that we will resolve the problems by taking people out of the statutory
system and requiring them to try to reach voluntary agreements, we will
find that the amount of child maintenance received by many people will
reduce, for the reasons that I have given. If we are to have some form
of gateway, it has to give people all available information very
clearly, not lead to people feeling forced to go away for a while to
try to negotiate with someone who, by definition, they are having
difficulties in dealing with.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000253">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
clear from the Bill what are “reasonable steps”. At what
point could someone say, “I have taken reasonable
steps.”? What will they be required to do? Will it be that they
have had to go to some form of mediation? What if there are no such
forms of assistance available? Will it be good enough for them to come
back and say, “Well, I tried to talk to him”—it
probably would be “him”—“but he
wouldn’t talk to me. I have at

                           </div>least tried.”? We need to know more about what “reasonable
steps” means, so that people can pass the gateway and use a
statutory system that, for all its faults, has been recovering
substantial sums for children and has created greater acceptance of the
idea that absent parents, of whatever gender, should pay for the upkeep
of their children. Regardless of other issues, it is important to hold
on to that and not devalue
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be concerned about going back to a system in which people were
acting on a largely voluntary basis, perhaps without the infrastructure
described in the consultation paper. It would sound good if there
really were such great resources in operation, but I do not believe
that they exist countrywide. There are some good groups working, but I
doubt that they have the countrywide coverage that would enable people
to get assistance and advice, particularly if simultaneously steps are
taken—in England and Wales at least, but gladly not in
Scotland—to reduce the legal aid, advice and assistance people
can get to pursue their own legal remedies. Both those things are going
on at the same time, and I urge the Minister to consider the amendment
before proceeding with the
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000255">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is good to be able to consider these important
provisions, which look at the issues of child maintenance. If I may, Mr
Weir, I shall set in context my comments on the Opposition amendments,
but before I do so, it is important to reiterate something that the
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston said and to pay tribute to the
hard work done by the staff of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement
Commission and the Options service. They are at the sharp end of the
business and have to deal daily with the problems that are still very
real in a very difficult system. They do a lot to help families and our
constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
there is an inherent contradiction in the contributions to the debate
on whether there is a need for a gateway for child maintenance. On one
hand, the hon. Lady talked about her shock at the number of children
who are still not receiving financial support. I share her shock at
some 50%—or 1.5 million—of children in this country
living in families where their parents are separated or simply not
being in receipt of effective financial maintenance. Yet, on the other
hand, we hear that Opposition Members are quite happy. They even talk
about a stable and stronger maintenance system that is on an even keel.
Perhaps they have been listening too much to what the previous
Government said about the improvements that had been made to our child
maintenance system. Perhaps they are remembering the words of John
Hutton, now Lord Hutton of Furness, who talked in 2006 about a brand
new system being in place by 2010. Actually, the facts and the reality
of the situation are somewhat
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000257">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
inherited a tragic child maintenance system that is still failing. It
is doing so because of the number of children who have no effective
maintenance in place and because the system is still running two
parallel computer systems at great financial cost to the taxpayer, and
at the great cost of taking people’s efforts away from ensuring
that we provide the best service to everyone. We must remember that we
have a record number of clerical cases, which the two computer systems
cannot cope with. A third contract is required with a computer systems
provider to deal with those cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000258">&#160;</a>

this country live in separated families. Effective child maintenance
arrangements are in place for only half of those. The vast
majority—more than 800,000—of children who receive
maintenance through CMEC do so through the statutory system, and around
90,000 receive maintenance that may have been loosely attached to the
Options system. The right hon. Gentleman should keep those figures in

question. Every family is different, as are the circumstances that they

their

will be a system of support to help parents understand how they can
establish effective communication, perhaps overcoming some of the
problems that the hon. Lady outlined in her intervention. At the
moment, it can be difficult for people to access that until many years
after they have split up, which leads to difficult situations becoming
entrenched and, in certain circumstances and cases, encourages leaving
unchallenged the sort of negative behaviour that we have all seen and
dealt with. With the gateway, we will put in place early intervention
and support for parents immediately after separation, which could avoid
some of the problems that the hon. Lady outlined in her intervention.

will now address the amendments. Clause 128 allows us to require an
applicant to take reasonable steps to make arrangements before making
an application to the statutory maintenance scheme. Several questions
have been asked about what those reasonable arrangements might be.
Reasonable arrangements will depend on the individual circumstance. The
gateway is not a cut-and-dried, hard “people are in or
out” arrangement. It will prompt people to consider what they
could do to reach the best arrangements for their children, and it will
challenge them to think about their children from the start. The
gateway will direct and signpost parents during those early days to the
help that can make all the difference, rather than leaving a festering
situation to become entrenched and difficult over several years, which
is what happens
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000272">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to press the Minister on that point. Clause
128 certainly requires the parent with care to go through that process,
but there is no obligation on the non-resident parent that I can see.
It is almost certainly his behaviour that will be predominantly
important in determining whether maintenance
flows.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000273">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Children
are most likely to prosper when both parents are involved in their
life—I am sure that no member of the Committee would disagree
with that—but too often one parent becomes disengaged from a
child’s life. Often that is because of the friction and problems
that are created by trying to ensure that financial arrangements are in
place. We want to ensure that parents see that putting financial
arrangements in place and co-parenting are the norm post-separation. It
is right that we encourage parents to work together. The hon. Ladies
may feel that that is the case at the moment, but if, as I did, they
were to listen in on some of the conversations that Options has on a
daily basis with parents who do not know where to go to for help, and
who do not know how to resolve some of the circumstances they face,
perhaps they would realise that all is not quite as rosy in the garden
as they would like to
think.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000275">&#160;</a>

are dealing with a sensible and adult section of the population when we
talk about CSA customers. They are parents and are often in their late
30s. They have often been married for five to 10 years, or have at
least been in a secure and stable cohabiting situation. It is
interesting that six out of 10 parents have contact with their
ex-partner. Most often that contact is through the children, but there
is some contact. Unfortunately, the child statutory maintenance system
can create situations that make it difficult for those people to
maintain those sorts of relationships on an even
keel.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000276">&#160;</a>

statutory system, unless things have hugely changed in the past two to
three years, because they cannot reach voluntary arrangements? A
picture seems to be emerging that the only thing people do is rush off
to the statutory system, creating a conflict and making their
relationships difficult. In reality, many reach their own arrangements.
Those who cannot do that have gone to the CSA for help. In some ways,
there is no necessity to put another bit of process in place, which may
discourage or delay those who cannot make their own

are talking about ensuring that there is a gateway in place that can
direct people to the right support, rather the current position,
whereby those individuals go straight to the statutory system. Instead,
they will be signposted to the help that could make all the difference.
We will come on to talk about the calculation-only service, which will
allow just the sorts of parents that the hon. Lady is talking about,
who currently end up in the statutory system, to go and work with Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs data to understand what private
arrangements might look like

not have been hammering at the CSA’s doors. This picture of
there being an awful lot of people who find themselves in the thrall of
the CSA by some kind of system that pursues them is not one with which
I am familiar. Maybe non-resident parents have found themselves in that
position. To say that 75% of non-resident parents would rather make

to her original intervention, based on a statistical fact that there
are many people within the CSA currently, who, with the right support,
would not be there. Given that we know that arrangements made outside
the statutory system are more likely to endure and more likely to
ensure that finance is flowing, the hon. Lady would probably agree that
the evidence suggests that we should pursue those arrangements. That
was the approach at the heart of Sir David Henshaw’s
recommendations to the then Labour Government in 2006. The then
Secretary of State accepted them and worked on them as a platform on
which to reform CMEC, as it is
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000282">&#160;</a>

statutory system would prefer voluntary arrangements. We know that
voluntary arrangements tend to last, which suggests that we could have
a better picture if more of those people were removed from the
statutory scheme and made a private arrangement. Will the Minister not
respond to the evidence that the Work and Pensions Committee heard from
Caroline Bryson about the characteristics of those who made successful
arrangements? She said that they were more likely to have had a
long-standing relationship, be from better-off socio-economic groups
and to not have conflict in the relationship. Can the Minister be
confident that those in the statutory scheme who say that they prefer a
voluntary arrangement will have the right characteristics, even with
support, to make that voluntary arrangement
work?<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000283">&#160;</a>

Perhaps I can go back to the statistics. She implies that many people
within the CSA’s current case load would not fall into the
category that she is talking about; people who have a good, long and
enduring relationship with their ex-partner. I suggest that the
statistics show that many people in the CSA’s current case load
have regular contact with their ex-partner. About three-quarters of CSA
parents have had contact with their ex-partner in the past year, and of
those, around half maintain contact once a week or more. The average
age of a parent with care who is in receipt of child maintenance is
about 39. As I said previously, many of them have

norm—so I do not recognise the picture that the hon. Lady paints
of CSA parents being in some way different from other people. In fact,

downside to CMEC at the moment is that it is extremely expensive. It
costs £440 million to the taxpayer every year, and for every
pound that we move from one parent to another, it costs the taxpayer
40p. It is a very expensive system. I am not sure that anyone would
resent that if they felt that the money was used in the most effective
way possible, but going back to my comments to the hon. Member for
Edinburgh East, we believe that at least half of parents with care and,
research would say, three-quarters of non-resident parents would, with
the right support, prefer not to be involved in the CSA, creating the
sorts of costs that I have

that the organisation is known to strew up and down the land, in all

personal cost deeply felt by many people. Is it not right that as many

                           </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for his contribution. The
problems created by the CSA are probably to do with the way that it is
set up, its structures and the failing IT system, which seems to have
been ignored in earlier comments by Opposition Members. People strive
as much as they can to make the system work for families, but if he is
asking whether people would be better off making their own
arrangements, the answer is, yes, many people would be. I stress,
however, that it is important that we have a statutory system for
people who simply cannot do that, for whatever reason. Perhaps they
have had such an acrimonious breakdown that they cannot see through
that at that stage in their life.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we have both systems running in parallel, but that we
get back to the recommendations that Sir David Henshaw made in his
report in 2006. They were incredibly important, valid and accepted by
the Labour Government at the time, but they are perhaps not now so much
in line with Labour Members’ thinking, I do not know.
Unfortunately, the system can embed the sort of conflict that my hon.
Friend has mentioned, and until recently some parents were compelled to
apply to it. Parents might not be aware that they need not do so
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
delivering the clause, we will develop a gateway that parents go
through before an application to the statutory system. It will take the
applicant through the various maintenance options open to them and
support available. A significant proportion of parents feel that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1076<a class="bkMark" name="Column1076">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that would be an incredibly powerful thing for them to have access to.
Where collaboration might be feasible, it is important that they are
supported early on, before conflict becomes entrenched. The gateway
could direct people to the further support that is provided in our
communities and that, as we all know, is powerful and can make a real
difference to people’s family lives if it is known about and
taken
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
in some cases the conversation will be a step towards the statutory
scheme, in others it will be a step towards receiving more support to
reach individual arrangements. At the point of the gateway, the
conversation will vary according to what the applicant says. We can
only ever ask parents to take reasonable steps, and the requirement of
the clause is therefore self-limiting. We do not see the gateway as a
complete barrier for people moving forward into the statutory scheme,
but simply as a way to ensure that they take account of the available
support and are aware that they have several choices about how to make
maintenance arrangements, rather than thinking that the statutory
system is their only
option.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000291">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition to asking applicants to take reasonable steps to make
family-based arrangements, the clause will make it easier for parents
to access the range of support that they need. Research indicates that
one key driver of child maintenance, whether or not a successful
arrangement is in place, is the behaviour of and the relationship
between the ex-partner and the non-resident. We know that separation is
a time of huge distress, and it is not always easy for people to set
aside their emotions and put their children’s best interests
first. To be able to identify effective support that helps parents work
together at that point has to be in the best interests of all
concerned, which is why the proposed system has been positively
received by so many groups that are expert in this
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000292">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was coming on to that in my responses to the
hon. Lady’s questions. The answer is just as we have now with
the Options service: both non-resident parents and parents with care
call in for advice. She is not characterising the situation with
complete accuracy when she says that there is no support for
non-parents now; there is, either through CMEC or the Options service.
It is entirely proper and right for a non-resident parent to be
involved in that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000294">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are working actively with experts in the field, such as Families Need
Fathers, Relate, One Plus One and the Centre for Separated Families. We
want to do so to ensure that we can involve both parents in the process
and that both parents can receive support that can make a difference.
Unless both parents feel supported, it will not be easy for families to
come to arrangements that, as we know from research, are in the best
interests of the
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000295">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
existing Options service goes some way towards doing what the clause is
intended to provide, but it focuses primarily on child maintenance and
we want to go further. That came home to me when I listened in to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1077<a class="bkMark" name="Column1077">&#160;</a>
                           </div>conversations between Options service personnel and parents. Parents
showed their frustration—they know that they need to download so
much of what is going on in their lives to someone, but the personnel
can talk only about financial stuff and cannot even direct parents to
the support that might make such a difference on the other issues that
they face. We are talking about a service that will be a real
progression from the existing Options service, and it will be even
stronger because of the integral involvement of experts working in the
organisations that I have
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000296">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> How will the gateway work where mediation is
signposted to a family as the best way to resolve the dispute, but the
non-resident parent does not turn up at that mediation? What are the
implications for the parent with care? Are they then allowed to go
straight to the statutory
service?<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000298">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Absolutely; if that is what they feel is most
appropriate at that time. As the hon. Lady will know from working with
her constituents, every family situation is different. What will be
appropriate for one will not be so for the other. Mediation may well be
an option that some want to choose. We will work closely with our
colleagues in the Ministry of Justice on the sorts of reforms that they
are putting in place, to ensure that there is clear read across between
the two. However, if any intervention or support is not helping to get
to a resolution on child maintenance, a parent with care can, of
course, opt to go into the statutory system.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said from the outset, the gateway is there not to prove an insuperable
barrier for parents going forward into a statutory system, but to allow
people to intervene at a really timely moment in the family’s
life to ensure that they get the right support. Currently, many find it
takes almost years to identify and get hold of such support, often too
late, when the sort of negative behaviours that we are only too aware
of have become entrenched.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
that outlines some of our thinking in this area. I will now try to
answer some of the issues that the hon. Ladies have raised. The hon.
Member for Glasgow East set out very useful criteria for us to evaluate
whether our policies go in the right direction, and I completely agree
with her. Fairness, sustainability and effectiveness are criteria that
I would also use to analyse whether our policies are working: fairness,
because we are trying to make sure that we keep both parents involved
in a child’s life and get the right outcome for the child;
sustainability, because whatever arrangement is put in place, it will
be something that will last into the future; effectiveness, because
only effective financial arrangements will make the sort of difference
to children’s lives that all members of the Committee
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked about the number of people who are already making
voluntary arrangements. I may have already talked about the figures,
but of the people who go through the current system, only about one
tenth will make their own family-based arrangements. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1078<a class="bkMark" name="Column1078">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Yet we know, as I have already said, that more than half of parents feel
that their own arrangements would be what they want first and foremost,
but that the support is not
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked when it is not appropriate to make a family-based
arrangement and how we would characterise that. As I said—I hope
that she feels that this has been clarified—we can only ever ask
parents to take reasonable steps to make their own family-based
arrangements. If they and the people whom they deal with in the gateway
feel that a reasonable step has been taken, the clause will be
self-limiting; they can opt into the statutory system. It will be
important to have extremely well-trained people involved in the
gateway, but I have been very impressed with the training and support
that people already get through the Options service. We have a good
point from which we can movement forward. Regarding when the gateway is
not appropriate, the hon. Lady asked the same the question in two
different ways, and I hope that she feels that I have answered
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston talked about a number of
different issues regarding priority. She asked whether the intention is
to get maintenance flowing, and I would agree; it is. At the moment,
the average payment to a family is some £30 a week, which can
make a real difference to children’s lives. However, the
shocking situation—to use her own words—is that currently
50% of children in separated families do not have that money flowing.
The system is not working for them, and that is why we need to consider
how we can encourage people to make their own arrangements if they are
able to do so, and perhaps leave more space in the statutory system for
those who are finding it very
tough.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady talked about the need for a range of advice. I hope that she
felt that my comments earlier showed my recognition of that need. We
must give parents a real opportunity to get a wide variety of support
and advice—something that Options is currently unable to do. She
also discussed the importance of fathers being a part of the process,
and I hope that the question asked by hon. Member for Glasgow East has
helped me to answer that. I see fathers as being active participants in
the gateway process if that is what they choose to do. I hope that they
choose to do that, otherwise will be difficult for families to reach
such co-operative
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000305">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
child poverty, it is important to say that the hon. Lady was absolutely
right that the Government’s analysis of the impact of this
policy is that it will not have a negative effect on child poverty.
That is probably predominantly because all parents with care keep 100%
of their benefits when they are in receipt of child maintenance, so
child maintenance is over and above the benefit level, which, from
memory, is some £219 a week for an average lone parent with two
children after housing costs. Maintenance is on top of that, whether it
is done through a private arrangement or the statutory system. If a
parent is in work, it is a tax-free lump sum, which shows that the
Government recognise the financial straits that lone parents are often
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have mostly covered the other points that the hon. Member for Stretford
and Urmston raised. She talked about funding in terms of support for
services. Obviously, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1079<a class="bkMark" name="Column1079">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the Government already make a great deal of funding available for
services such as family support, parenting support and relationship
support. The Department for Education is currently spending around
£30 million over the next four years on relationship support,
and that also includes support for separating couples. The hon. Lady
will no doubt be aware that my Department also spends some £5.6
million a year on the Options community service, so a great deal of
support is going in there. To reassure her, let me say that as we look
at the geographic spread of that support, we will ensure that there is
good information, support and advice on the ground locally as well as
centrally and I will be looking at that with the Department for
Education. We are working together to ensure that the support is
available not just down the telephone line or on a website, but face to
face as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
talked about parents with care entering into maintenance arrangements
that are not necessarily in their best interests. That point was
reiterated by my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar and the hon. Member
for Edinburgh East and they are absolutely right; that probably does
happen. There is no longer a compulsion for people who are on benefits
to be part of the statutory system. They can come to their own
arrangements, but the support and advice are not always there for them.
There is a good online calculator service, but it does not have access
to the real income data of non-resident parents. I fear that there may
well be people who are not making the best sorts of arrangements for
themselves, which is why we wanted to make these changes and why we
think the revisions in the Bill are so
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000308">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston also asked for some assurance
that we are not establishing a payment-by-result regime. Again, that is
not something that we are pursuing. We are listening to the third
sector about how we can best shape this support. I do not want to move
away from where the expertise lies, which is in the sorts of
organisations that we all work with day in, day out in our own local
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000309">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the Minister see a place in all this for
legal advice? I am not saying that the voluntary and third sector, if
properly funded, do not do a good job on this. One of the ways in which
we have kept people out of the statutory system has been good legal
advice at the beginning of separation—the drafting and
preparation of separation agreements that can be legally binding on
people. I wonder what conversations the Minister has had with her
colleagues in the Ministry of Justice about being able to facilitate
that
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000310">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady mentions a very important point.
Having a legal background herself, she will know that the vast majority
of people in this country do not go near the court system. Some 95% of
separating families do not use the courts to resolve their situation,
although, interestingly, many go to a solicitor in the first instance
to ask for the sort of advice that I hope they will be able to receive
through the
gateway.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Ministry of Justice is currently undertaking a family justice review,
and I have met the people conducting it. I will continue to work

is always difficult to ensure that services are uniform. Perhaps they
are not uniform because the need for services is not uniform. We are
working with many, if not all, the main third-sector organisations in

great deal of innovation is already going on. Recently I was privileged
to see the work that Relate is doing. Some of the face-to-face chat
support that it offers—if it can be face-to-face down an

comments that have been made shows that that is far from the case. We
are going back to the basic principles that were set out by Sir David
Henshaw, and we are looking at the research on our current customer
base at CMEC and on the behavioural issues faced by separating
families. Based on that evidence, we are introducing what we believe is
an important reform of the current system, which will help more parents

are trying to ensure that there are choices so that families can come
to the right conclusions. We are not trying to stop people who need to
use the statutory system from doing so, nor are we forcing people who
need it to make their own family-based arrangements. We are trying to
provide choice, but also to encourage parents to take responsibility

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for her reply; those are
exactly the issues that we want to explore. In later amendments we will
pick up on comments made by Lord McKenzie during the progress of the
previous legislation. My noble Friend also emphasised a point that I
would emphasise, which is that the best interests of the child must be
enshrined in the legislation. That must be the drive, and must be
sacrosanct, not the particular operations of an agency or the need to
reduce the case load. I am sure that that discussion will
continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000322">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was interested in the Minister’s comments about the operation of
the gateway. She was perhaps more flexible than I had expected, and I
want to continue to explore the impacts with her. For the Opposition, a
particularly outstanding element of the discussion is the profound
inequality whereby it is mandatory for a parent with care to engage
with the gateway, but the non-resident parent may choose. That is what
I extracted from the Minister’s comments. Again, if she wishes
to correct that, either now or later, I would be more than happy for
her to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000323">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I recall the words that I used, and the hon. Lady
is absolutely right; I did say that. To clarify, that is only because
the vast majority of people who make claims for the statutory system
are the parents with care. Of course, if we are trying to encourage
more collaborative working, that cannot happen without the non-resident
parent’s involvement. By definition, we

like to see more often, which is the sort of collaborative family
arrangements that I have set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000324">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes. Obviously that would be the case—I had
assumed that. The nature of mandating people and how we compel them to
engage in the system will flavour many of the comments and discussions
in future. No sensible person would dispute what is at the core of the
Minister’s comments. I think she said that some people in the
system would not be in it if they had the right support. It is
certainly disappointing if that is so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We should, of
course, do all we can and use every labour to ensure that such people
are not in the system if different services and support could be
available. The Minister has my very best wishes for that objective,
which I support. However, I am trying to focus debate in my
contribution on those people for whom the system does not work. With
the greatest respect, the Minister has genuinely underestimated the
impact on parents with care of the delay that the measure might kick
into the system. We must think that impact through. A degree of
manipulation is inherent in how these processes are used and we must be
aware that some parents manipulate the system to avoid payment. We must
not create systems that allow them to do so and it is vital that we
address that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall not
press the amendments to a vote, although many of the Minister’s
points require further explanation. I am not reassured about the
system, because in an effort to improve matters for the vast majority,
we might make them worse for the most vulnerable. I would like to
return to that argument, because it has not been answered. The core
principle behind the purpose of a child maintenance agency should be
protection for women—essentially, it affects women, but not
always—who cannot access proper maintenance support anywhere
else. We must send the message to men—predominantly men, but not
always—who are unwilling to pay that they cannot get away with
it. The shift is not in Labour policy; we may be witnessing a shift in
Tory policy this afternoon, but the Minister has not convinced me that
she has understood that matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051955000327">&#160;</a>
