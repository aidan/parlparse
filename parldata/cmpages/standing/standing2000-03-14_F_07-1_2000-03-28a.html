<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 98, in page 14, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person on whom a notice under subsection (2) is served may, within seven days from the date on which the notice is served, appeal to the Court.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) An appeal may be brought on any of the following grounds-

<P>
(a) that such steps as may be specified or described in the notice are not technically competent for the purpose set out in subsection (1);

<P>
(b) that such steps are not proportionate to the purpose set out in subsection (1); or

<P>
(c) that such steps exceed what is necessary to achieve the purpose set out in subsection (1).

<P>
( ) On an appeal under this section, the Court may either cancel or affirm the notice, and, if it affirms it, may do so either in its original form or with such modifications as the Court may in the circumstances think fit.

<P>
( ) The Court to which an appeal may be made under this section shall be-

<P>
(a) in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the High Court, and

<P>
(b) in Scotland, the Court of Session.'.-[Mr. Heald.]

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): The right of appeal proposed by the amendment would enable communications service providers to negotiate with the Government to achieve a satisfactory solution not just as humble petitioners but as companies or individuals with rights. I commend it to the Committee on that basis.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> I agree with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) that an appeal mechanism is needed. The Minister said that individuals or companies could pursue civil proceedings if they were unhappy with notices, but I believe that that procedure is unsatisfactory. It has been repeatedly pointed out that there is now a large range of telecommunications companies, many of which will not have sufficient resources to pursue such proceedings. In spite of recent rumours about stock market prices, many such companies are not beneficiaries of the enormous wealth that seems to be available in the internet world and are small or are just starting up. The sort of company that decides to resist the application of a notice because of the cost involved will not have sufficient resources to pursue civil proceedings.

<P>
The amendment is helpful as it would introduce a formal right of appeal. In addition, it might be another strengthening of the case for a technical approvals board, which was discussed in relation to a group of amendments considered previously. The Minister tried to improve the proposals that were made with suggestions of ways in which the board could be made more impartial and be seen to be impartial by the industry. A company or business that wanted to challenge a notice could go to such a body and find out whether it could mount a challenge on technical grounds. If that failed, the case could be moved into the court arena. It is always best to deal with technical issues that involve many technical questions in such forums. It is easy to imagine the expense that will be incurred in the courts. The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire referred to judicial review as a possible route, but the procedure is already expensive and will require lawyers who are expert in the technical issues involved. The pursuit of such cases would involve the use of an expensive and select group of lawyers. One cannot go to any high street solicitor or barrister and ask him or her to deal with such matters; the proceedings will be very expensive because the points at issue will be at the forefront of technological developments. Such points should not be argued in courts if another mechanism can be used.

<P>
I fully support the right of appeal proposed by Opposition Members, but I further suggest that that right should initially involve a technical board and that cases should enter the court arena only when that procedure fails. Such an arrangement would help the Secretary of State, who would spend less money on judicial review and court proceedings. It would also provide particular help for small companies, most of which want to go about their business and try to do whatever is reasonable to co-operate, but which could experience genuine technical difficulties in trying to comply with an order issued by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> The amendment would allow communication service providers served with notices requiring them to provide a reasonable intercept capability to appeal to a court if they thought that the requirement was disproportionate or technically unsound before the notice took effect. In effect, this avenue is already open, through judicial review of the actions of the Executive. I shall address those specific points in a moment, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider asking leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of my remarks.

<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), I should point out that it is profound belief and intention-I know that I was accused of using warm words earlier-that the question of legal costs will not arise. I have tried to describe the process, which we believe will be fulfilled, of an order being served only on an agreed basis. Aside from the issue of a judicial review, there are good reasons why it is in the Government's interests to have the order determined in that way. If we fail to get agreement, even on a specific order and certainly on the whole framework, it would be a serious matter because it would imply that force majeure was being wrongly applied.

<P>
I agree with the intention of any amendment that is based on the principle of ensuring that the requirements that part I places on industry are properly considered and reasonable. That was the essence of our earlier debate. The provisions will achieve that, and I explained the consultation process.

<P>
There will continue to be a great deal of technical discussion and consultation between the communications service provider, the Home Office and the intercepting agencies before notice is served. It will not come out of the blue. Instead, it will follow a substantial process of discussion. I am talking not about the general consultation framework, but about the content of a particular order.

<P>
I want to reinforce that point lest I give the impression that no one who works for the Government is likely to understand the technical issues. The Government and the agencies employ excellent technical specialists, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire would concede. They undertake detailed technical discussions with public telecommunications operators. I have outlined a process in which those discussions will continue and develop, especially in relation to the internet sector. Companies will not suddenly find themselves faced with a technically impossible or inappropriate requirement. That is not feasible. They will have a chance to discuss concerns well before notice is is served.

<P>
I emphasise the point that I made to the hon. Member for Hallam: it would be counterproductive to serve a notice with which a provider was unable to comply. Enforcement action would have to be taken, which could bring the discussion of intercept capabilities into the public arena. The Government are keen to avoid that for the obvious reasons that it is not in the interest of the intercepting agencies or the vast majority of communications service providers.

<P>
The many representations that we received from public telecommunications organisations made it clear what priority they placed on technical discussions with the Government remaining confidential. We accept and honour that. The same would be true for internet service providers. Given our commitment to develop co-operation, we have a strong motive not to allow matters to come to such a pass that legal action is considered.

<P>
In the unlikely event of the Secretary of State serving a notice that is unreasonable or disproportionate-both words can be tested in law-the communications service provider will be able to apply for a judicial review of the notice. The hon. Gentleman, with his legal background, knows that there are three limbs to a judicial review: the Wednesbury test, which is constantly being developed by the courts; procedural impropriety and subsequent unfairness; and unlawfulness. That is a rounded base on which to test a case in the unlikely event of the Secretary of State serving a notice that is unreasonable or disproportionate. If the remedy of judicial review fails, the onus would still be on the Secretary of State to enforce the notice through civil proceedings. He would have to convince the court of its lawfulness and reasonableness.

<P>
There are substantial tests if there is a failure to agree on a notice, but the Secretary of State would have to consider the appropriateness of court action. He would have to weigh up the need for secrecy, which surrounds such activity, with the need to enforce a notice in a particular case. Other options may be available to him, perhaps including further consultation if an impasse is reached, although the hon. Gentleman did not suggest that that would be a routine occurrence.

<P>
The amendment would raise the stakes by taking the matter straight to court without any possibility of further dialogue and would risk placing sensitive discussions in the public arena. Further, for the reasons that I have set out, I do not believe that the amendment would add anything to the judicial review avenue, which will automatically be available. For three reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, and if he will not, I urge hon. Members to resist it.

<P>
First, the amendment addresses a situation that we believe will not happen. The Government have technical experts, and it is a fundamental principle of our approach that notices should be served by agreement.

<P>
Secondly, in the unlikely event that it did happen, the service provider would not be forced to comply without a hearing before a court. The service provider would be able to apply for judicial review or wait for the Secretary of State to bring enforcement proceedings; either or both routes could be pursued.

<P>
Thirdly, the extra legal process would add further risk of public dissemination of the techniques and capabilities under discussion, with a consequent threat to security, which is the Government's concern, and commercial confidences, which are the ISP's concern. I hope that I have given some assurance about the process that will permit the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My opening remarks still have a good deal of validity and I have continuing concerns about the clause, but it is only fair to consider the Minister's remarks and the points raised by the hon. Member for Hallam about pursuing a different, cheaper, route. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 64, That the clause stand part of the Bill:-

<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Grants for interception costs</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 15, line one, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may, if he thinks fit' and insert `shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
More rapid progress might be imminent in our proceedings on the Bill; I feel it in my bones. I am sure that the Minister and his colleagues will be pleased to hear that. However, this is an important clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his insight into the workings of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I do not know how I found out so much. I am grateful to the Minister for his congratulations and characteristic courtesy. I thought it was fraying at the edges this morning, but he seems to be back on an even keel now.

<P>
This is an important clause. As I frequently remind the Committee, I am not a lawyer or a computer nerd, but I was a business man, and I believe that we should be careful to consider the costs imposed on business by legislation. Opposition Members have received extensive representations about the implications of clause 13 and its relationship to clause 12. I know that the Government also received extensive representations in response to their consultation on the issue, and they clearly understand the seriousness of the issues raised in clause 13, due to the costs that will be imposed on the industry as a result of the provisions it must make to enable warrants to be implemented. The Government demonstrated their concern in paragraph 5.7 of the consultation document and set out what costs they are prepared to meet. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government will meet the marginal costs incurred by CSPs (i.e. the costs associated with implementing individual interception warrants), as occurs under existing arrangements with PTOs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not regard that as an especially generous offer.

<P>
A little later in the consultation document, the Government hold out an olive branch to the industry.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In order to assess the cost and impact of the above proposals, we have included a number of specific questions at the end of this document.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is interesting that the word ``cost'' comes before the word ``impact'' because it demonstrates that the Government understand how serious a regulatory burden will fall on the industry as a result of the provisions. However, I am still worried that they do not understand how extensive the costs will be. It is not a one-off cost; a continuing cost will be imposed on the industry as a result of the requirements in clause 12, which the Committee has already accepted. There is the cost of software and hardware, of extra staff and training for that staff and of the constant communication with the law enforcement agencies. On that note, I hope that what the Minister said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire on the last clause is borne out by experience. it is crucial if the costs are to be kept low that those individuals who are communicating with the industry understand the issues they are debating with them. Therefore, it is important that those individuals be effectively and thoroughly trained. There is the cost of testing the mechanisms, of the software and hardware put in place and of the management of the process, which will include legal advice on whether companies are complying with the legislation. There will be the cost of billing the Government for those costs that the Government and the industry have agreed it will meet. Extensive costs are being imposed on the industry. I emphasise again that these are not a one-off cost, but continuing costs.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
What I find interesting about clause 13 is its contrast with clause 23, which deals with a separate, but related, issue regarding charging. The explanatory notes tell us on clause 13, that this
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>clause permits, but does not require, the Secretary of State to make contributions towards the costs incurred by communications service providers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the heart of our amendment. It seeks to turn the clause from a permit to a requirement on the Secretary of State to make some contribution towards the costs incurred by communication service providers.

<P>
Clause 23 appears to be tougher on the Secretary of State than clause 13 and puts a more onerous burden of discharge of financial responsibility towards the industry on his shoulders. The explanatory notes state on clause 23 that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> clause allows for payment arrangements to be made in order to compensate holders of communications data for the costs involved in complying with notices issued under this Chapter.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This seems to be a tougher test. Again, we have the issue that I raised last week of an inconsistency in the definitions and approaches used in different parts of the Bill. I prefers the approach of clause 23 to that of clause 13. It is important to remember that clause 12, which the Committee has already considered and to which the charging arrangements of clause 13 relate, has some tough provisions in it. Subsection (2) provides a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>power to impose the obligations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) speaks of ``providing any assistance''. This is the blank cheque that my hon. Friend spoke of as he opened the sitting this morning. That is the phrase that comes to me this afternoon.

<P>
The Minister's letter of 14 March is genuinely helpful. It sets out the way in which charging arrangements between the Government and industry for the interception of telecommunications have operated in the past. I quote from that letter.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Public telecommunications operators (PTOs) are responsible for meeting the costs of developing, maintaining and updating a basic capability to intercept voice telephony. They also meet the costs of delivery of the intercept product to an agreed handover point on their network for onward distribution to the intercepting agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister also lists the costs of the intercepting agencies, which appear to be rather less onerous than those on the PTOs: administration, transmission of the interception product and additional assistance required beyond the basic interception capability. That might have worked well in the old voice telephony days. It might have been an adequate arrangement for the historic situation, but the greater complexity of the new information technology world, as indicated by the issues addressed in the briefs received by the Government in response to their consultation and by us, suggest that the historic breakdown of costs might no longer be appropriate. The Minister needs to look hard at whether that old arrangement can remain in place. The Minister says in his letter that the Government are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>keen to minimise any additional costs which might be imposed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then makes a stab in the dark with the figure of some £20 million as the threshold used by the Cabinet Office. He appears to assure us that ``It will be all right, boys: it is going to be less than £20 million.'' I have looked over at the Minister and I suspect from the way that notes are being taken that it is a different Minister from the one we are used to. I welcome the new Minister, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), to her first speaking role in the Committee. [Hon. Members: ``hear, hear.''] An equally courteous and charming Minister as the one we are used to dealing with on this Committee. [Hon. Members: ``steady on.''] The Minister has other virtues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Political toughness being one of them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Velvet gloves and iron fists come to mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Ask Derek Hatton.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> The Minister should reflect carefully on whether the new requirements imposed under the Bill justify that historic arrangement remaining in place.

<P>
The Minister's letter rather bravely states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We remain fully committed to making the UK the best place in the world for electronic commerce, and hence do not intend to impose any unreasonable burdens on ISPs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We welcome that. I understood what the Minister said this morning about the consultant's study, but I regret that we should be debating clause 13 without the benefit of its conclusions. That is not necessarily a criticism; rather, it is a genuine observation. It would help us to consider the merits of the clause and our amendments if we had access to those conclusions.

<P>
I was relieved to hear that the Government remain committed to the consultation procedures set out in the Minister's letter and to the publication of draft secondary legislation. We certainly welcome that, but we would be reassured if we knew exactly what those costs might be-or if we could at least have a better stab at them than the arbitrary figure that the Minister mentions in his letter.

<P>
It is important that the industry's view is heard. There is a lack of consensus on how the costs should be split between the Government and the industry. Those are the Government's words: they admitted as much in their analysis of the responses to the consultation. When the Government admit to a lack of consensus, we know that a problem must be lurking somewhere nearby.
<P>
The Federation of the Electronics Industry said in a briefing note to hon. Members that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whatever the eventual solutions might be, added cost and complexity are certainties and this must threaten the UK's ambition to be the best place in the world to conduct electronic business, for the one abiding truth of the Internet is that electronic business will go where it is easiest to operate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why the Minister should satisfy us that the provisions of the clause are adequate and that our amendment, which would toughen those provisions, is not necessary.

<P>
The Alliance for Electronic Business, which includes the Federation of the Electronics Industry and the Confederation of British Industry, says of the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government may contribute to the costs of interception, but is not obliged to do so. We believe that such an obligation should be written into the Bill-there is such an obligation in the USA for example.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If there is such an obligation in the USA, why have the Government dismissed copying that provision into British law?

<P>
The submission received by the Government from the London Internet Exchange is interesting. I shall not weary the Committee with the details of its response on costs, as both sides wish to make a little progress this afternoon. However, I emphasise that the exchange states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not possible to give accurate figures without much more information.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, we are grappling with something about which we have no detailed knowledge. The exchange states also that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Due to the inherently short lifecycle of internet infrastructure equipment, and the need to replace and enhance networks due to traffic growth, it is misleading to think in terms of a once-off upgrade to an ISP's network. These networks are constantly evolving and expanding and the need for additional engineering work to support the capability for interception will be ever present.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are strong reasons for believing that the Secretary of State need to be more generous than anticipated in the Bill.

<P>
The Internet Services Providers Association states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ISPs need confirmation that they will not be made to bear the full costs of the implementation, maintenance and usage of unlimited interception capabilities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the problem of ``unlimited'' that lies at the heart of our concerns. Exactly how much will be expected of the industry? What level of interception is expected-one in 500, one in 1,000, one in every 10,000? It will make a huge difference to the cost that the industry will have to bear. I shall spare the Minister further recitation of the comments of the Internet Service Providers Association. She knows what they are, and I commend them to her.

<P>
All of those doubts suggest that the Secretary of State must come forward with some sort of compensation scheme. It should not be left to his discretion. I know that it is a parliamentary tradition to debate ``may'' and ``shall'' at some length, but this is not just any old ``may'', it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may, if he thinks fit.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a pretty generous and loose ``may''; it is a heavily qualified ``may''. To replace that ``may, if he thinks fit'' with ``shall'' should not pose too many problems for the Government, but it would give great reassurance to the industry, because the rest of the clause includes get-outs for the Government.

<P>
We have let them off lightly with our amendments. Line 5 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as the Secretary of State considers would represent an appropriate contribution.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who is to define such a contribution? We have not sought to define that but perhaps should have done so. The Government could comfortably accept the amendment, knowing that they would not be writing a huge blank cheque. However, they would be sending a signal to the industry that they understood that the burdens on its shoulders could be considerable and that they owed it assistance in meeting the demands of the legislation.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall be brief as I know that we want to make progress, but I want to state our firm view that intercepting communications is the Government's business and that they ought to pay for it. It seems unreasonable to require or to ask business to pay. As we have discussed, businesses would positively not want to open up access to their telecoms systems. We should adhere to the important principle of the Government paying for their own affairs. They will get plenty of help in kind from organisations in the business sector, which will make considerable efforts to assist Government. The Government should not abuse such assistance by loading cash costs on to businesses having to deliver on the Government's requests to intercept.

<P>
I have a technical question regarding the payment mechanism. We are considering an on-going system-the subsections refer to making payments for communications for interception warrants as they are issued. Payments will be made over a period and will relate to the business of several Departments-different requesting authorities may ask for an intercept to be made. Will the Minister say whether the money will come entirely from a Home Office budget, or whether, in the days of resource accounting, costs will be charged to appropriate bodies? If Customs and Excise wanted an interception warrant, would it pay its costs while the Home Office paid its costs? I am aware of a long list of people who could ask for interception warrants. It would seem strange if costs were not related back to the investigation that required them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton):</B> I shall not go over the ground that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) covered in his excellent speech, although I shall welcome, in perhaps more restrained terms, the Parliamentary Secretary. I notice that she leaps into Committee action as soon as the text of the Bill turns into italics. I might now trawl through it to ensure that I know when she will next perform.

<P>
The clause is important, but need not be dealt with by the Opposition at length. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary if well apprised of the difficulties-they arose on Second Reading and have been referred to in the debate on clause 12. I hope that she agrees to the amendment. I agree with my hon. Friend that the change to ``shall'' from ``if he''-or, here, ``if she''-``thinks fit'' is generous spirited.

<P>
I often would have liked to have included such a clause in a Bill for which I was responsible when I was a Minister, but I had tougher civil servants than the Home Office seems to have hidden away in its lockers. Having seen such a clause, envy alone asks me to try to remove it or to have the word ``shall'' inserted.

<P>
There is a serious purpose. We have discussed the technology and need not do so again. It is difficult for companies to assess their liability and to conform to the intercept requirements. A different configuration will be necessary as technology develops. I mentioned this morning that the infrastructure providers-the routers and the switchers-are made by companies not based in this country, although they have operations here. The operators group that I quoted this morning specifically asked in its recommendations that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Home Office gives a clear and unequivocal commitment to the sharing of costs commensurate with the implementation of the interception requirements that will be detailed in secondary legislation.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
My hon. Friend mentioned the comments of the Internet Service Providers Association. I add to those the international comparison to which I referred this morning. There would be disadvantages in operating in Britain if the costs of compliance fell entirely on industry. That view is echoed by the European Informatics Market. In these days of over-cautiousness, I declare that I am an honorary director of EURIM-the European Informatics Market-as part of the all-party parliamentary contribution to that body. Its briefing states that ``Clause 13 enables''-rather than requires-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State to reimburse costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This provides yet more uncertainty. The UK should follow the lead of other countries, such as the USA-where CALEA commits the US Government to funding telecoms operators for the provision of an intercept capability that meets requirements agreed between the FBI and industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
If EURIM and others, including myself, have not misunderstood the United States obligations-which we might have done-I strongly urge the Minister to be more generous with Treasury money. If the Home Office can pull off a trick with the Treasury and ensure that the word ``shall'' is inserted in the manner proposed in the amendment, it will find that the Bill is a good deal more welcomed by industry as a whole, because the obligation placed on it and the Government will be more fairly shared, bearing in mind the nature of the interception requirements that the Government are imposing. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment favourably.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border):</B> First, I apologise to you, Mrs Michie, to the Committee and to the Minister for being late in arriving. I had hoped to be here on time, but my last meeting overran.

<P>
I should tell my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) that this is not a matter of the Minister being generous, but one of justice and precedent. No doubt the Minister, with her impeccable resources, will be able to tell me immediately if I am wrong, but I do not think that there is any precedent for ensuring the imposition by organs of the state and the Security Service of an additional financial burden on industry for the benefit of the state and then saying that industry should pick up the cost. There is a big difference between what is imposed by clause 12 and a police request for co-operation from all of us as citizens and as businesses. There is a world of difference between building in potentially expensive technology and asking a telecommunications company, ``Excuse me, in the interests of the state, do you mind if our people tap into your wires? It won't cost you very much.''

<P>
The Minister will know that in the interests of national security, contingency arrangements have been made with various transport providers to be used in the event of war. The Ministry of Defence and other organs of the state establish such contingency arrangements to ensure that particular facilities will be available if we need to deploy our people in the event of war. The state pays a retainer for the continuing availability of those facilities, which the transport providers-whether British Airways, the ports or P&O Ferries-would never usually provide, as they exceed commercial interests. The companies undertake to provide them only because the British Government say ``In the interests of national security, we would like you to do X, Y and Z, which are not commercial operations.'' The companies say ``We will do that, and here is the cost.'' They provide the service and, rightly, the Government pay for it.

<P>
Clause 12 tells internet service providers and others, ``We want you to do something that you would never dream of doing in a million years. It is against your ethos and operating practice, but we want you to build in this technology and to pay out costs in the interests of national security, combating serious crime or other interests spelt out in clause 5.'' All legal precedents dictate that the Government should pay for that additional burden, which industry is asked to provide, but from which it does not benefit in any way. The Minister is a reasonable person, so I hope that she agrees.

<P>
The burden imposed is different from a health and safety burden. The Government impose such a burden on all companies, and they must pay for it. The Government may impose paternity leave in the interests of certain important fathers to be, and industry has to pay. They impose a host of burdens-indeed, the Labour Government are expert at imposing great, heavy and onerous regulatory burdens on industry in general.

<P>
Although we may disagree about the content of the regulatory burden imposed by the Bill, we all accept that if Parliament imposes a burden in relation to health and safety, paternity leave, Single European Act compliance, the national minimum wage or other such standards, it is up to industry to bear that burden and the Government should not subsidise it.

<P>
However, the Government want Departments of State to say ``This is not a general regulatory burden. We want you to do something that is specifically in our interest and against your own commercial interest''. Currently, Government Departments ask air transport providers to make available in the event of war specific facilities that they might not usually provide, and they pay extra for that service. Similarly, the state pays specific groups to provide food resources in the event of war. However, the Government are proposing that the Security Service and other organs of the state wil ask industry to build in facilities at minimal, medium or great cost and, at its own expense, allow the state to intercept communications. All the precedents tell us that the state should pay for such services.

<P>
That is why the word ``shall'' should be inserted as the amendment proposes. The state must pay for such services at a reasonable cost. Arbitration machinery can be built into the clause to determine a sensible and reasonable cost, which cannot merely be what the state considers fit. It must pay companies at a reasonable cost if it wants to impose burdens such as those proposed.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> First, I am grateful for the kind words that have been said in welcoming me to the Committee. I have listened carefully to the deliberations.

<P>
I noticed that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) was not in his seat at the start of the debate. I had hoped that he would miss the debate, in the light of his reputation as a persistent questioner of Ministers. I can, however, answer his questions about precedent. He suggested that there was no precedent for the approach adopted in the Bill, but such a precedent does exist. My comments may also deal with the questions asked by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton, who spoke about how envious he was of the clause. The Interception of Communications Act 1985 has imposed a requirement such as that which has been proposed for the past 15 years, and it has worked well. Most importantly, the requirement relies on the extensive co-operation that exists between public telecommunications operators and the Government. The Committee should bear that in mind as it listens to the rest of my remarks.

<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire made a thoughtful contribution, in which he made clear the view of every Opposition Member who has spoken on the issue. He referred to a genuine concern among affected businesses and said that the burden should be shared-a view that was expressed by every Opposition Member who spoke.

<P>
The Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) made some important points in a letter from which hon. Members have quoted extensively. I should like to refer to one or two statements that underline that Government's acknowledgement of the concerns expressed. My hon. Friend wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recognise that it may be unreasonable to ask some Internet Service Providers to meet new costs of this magnitude.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have made it clear that we will not consider the figures in detail, but my hon. Friend has repeatedly sought to reassure Committee members and people involved in the industry that we are conscious of their concerns. I do not propose to go back over the ground covered by my hon. Friend in debates on clause 12 relating to the report that we expect to publish, but I remind the Committee that we expect it to be published soon. After publication, extensive consultation will continue in preparation for the order that will lay down the cost regime.

<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee by repeating what has already been said, but it is worth stating that the order will set out what the Government believe should constitute a reasonable intercept capability. It will provide a detailed assessment of compliance costs based on those specific requirements, and it will explain what contribution the Government propose to make to those costs. I acknowledge the importance of the costs; I became increasingly aware of their importance during our debates on clause 12. I hope that what I have said will reassure the Opposition. The hon. Member for Hallam asked who will pay. The intercepting agencies will bear the burden: the more warrants they seek, the more they will pay.

<P>
Finally, I must answer the hon. Member for Esher and Walton. We have reached agreements with public telecommunications operators on costs and who should bear what proportion of them. We intend to include those provisions in the arrangements that we make with other communications service providers. I repeat that we want a level commercial playing field; it is important that no sector of the communications industry should be disadvantaged. We must continue to work in partnership with the industry and to foster the good relations that already exist.

<P>
I invite the Committee to resist the amendment. Amendments to change ``may'' to ``shall'' are frequently used by Opposition parties, but in this instance, it will insert a rigidity into the system that will not assist us in maintaining and fostering that good working relationship. We still need to work out much of the detail that will be required to make the system work, so to introduce such rigidity would disadvantage the Government and business.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> In the old days, when dealing with PTOs, arriving at an agreement was a good deal more simple than in this new era. We have many new internet service providers, not all of which are totally identified with Britain, and for them the marginal cost of equipment that may need to be modified is quite high. I urge the Government seriously to address the problem of costs, so that they do not remain in the realm of uncertainty. I am not quite satisfied by the degree of reassurance offered by what the Minister and I am sure that she is about to deal with the international comparisons, because competitors in the UK could face real problems if the costs are high.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I was not proposing to deal with the international comparisons. However, we acknowledge that marginal costs are pretty high. They cover the costs of staff, training, accommodation and so on when the staff are employed in processing interception warrants.

<P>
We are at the first stage of the three-stage process that my hon. Friend the Minister of State described in the debate on clause 12. First comes the Bill; we shall continue to consult while the Bill continues its passage through Parliament. Next, we shall prepare the order; however, consultation will continue even after the details of the order have been determined. It is an ongoing and live relationship that will continue to evolve. It would be nonsense to include too rigid a provision in the Bill, given that we are still discussing the details of the order. The Opposition should bear that in mind and accept that the Government recognise the serious nature of their concerns. We intend to address those problems when the order is introduced.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is such a pleasure to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary that I feel a bit of a cad and a bounder challenging her. She is a nice, decent person and it is a shame to hear her read out that cold, callous and hard-hearted Home Office brief. I would not have done that in my day. [Laughter.]

<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary said it might sour the working relationship with commercial companies if the Bill included a requirement to pay them money: that would be a new scenario for commercial enterprise. I know that new Labour has tried to engender a new working relationship with commercial business, but business must have changed considerably in past few years if it finds the Government giving it money an unacceptable rigidity.

<P>
The precedent that the Parliamentary Secretary quoted is not quite right. Of course British Telecom and other telecommunications operators co-operate with the Government and the security services. They are big companies and can afford low-level co-operation. I do not want the Government to have to reveal information that could endanger national security even marginally, but I would love to speculate on how much it costs British Telecom to maintain its present level of co-operation with the security services. Am I wrong in thinking that, if the security services require the co-operation of British Telecom or others to intercept communications, the security services bear the bulk of that cost, which involves their manpower and equipment? The telecommunications companies co-operate by making their wires and facilities available, but they do not have the burden imposed by clause 12. There is no requirement to install different telephones, wires, systems or equipment to make it easier for the security services to intercept.

<P>
Clause 12 would establish a new relationship. It does not require the industry merely to co-operate with the Government, but to install equipment that Government think is necessary. Companies might have to introduce new software or redesign their systems, possibly at enormous cost, for the Government's benefit. If it is right that the Government benefit from equipment and software that the industry would not usually install, they must pay the cost of introducing it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am with my right hon. Friend because I, too, am in an uncomfortable position. I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary was going to give us what we wanted. All her logic pointed in that direction, especially when taken in conjunction with the Minister of State's letter of 14 March, which she also quoted. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We continue to see a case for a sharing of the burden of costs between government and industry<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that draft secondary legislation would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>explain what contribution the Government proposes to make to these costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Her speech echoed that. Both Ministers referred to the cost of the requirement. In that spirit, I cannot understand why she is resisting our modest amendment.

<P>
The rest of the clause gives the Secretary of State considerable discretion to determine the Government's contribution. Individuals such as Adrian Norman have highlighted some of the costs that will fall on the industry. The Internet Service Providers Association has said that it wanted the Bill to include the Government's commitment to meeting the costs. It concluded its representation by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If ISPs in the UK are made to carry the burden of the costs of interception-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which the hon. Member for Hallam rightly described as the legitimate function of the state and not of the private sector-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at best they will be at a disadvantage compared to their European and even international competitors, and at worse will be unable to operate. It does not seem that this position would help make the UK the `best place in the world for E-Commerce'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On Monday of this week, we heard the Prime Minister, at the Dispatch Box, trumpeting that as his ambition.

<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary came so close to giving us what we want. I do not accept her argument that inserting the word ``shall'' would make the provision rigid, and I urge her to think again. If she is not prepared to accept the amendment, I intend to press it to a vote.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I did not intend to respond, but perhaps I should say a few words for the avoidance of doubt. Perhaps it was my lack of clarity that caused Opposition Members not to understand why we resist the amendment. It cannot be right to tie the Secretary of State's hands at this stage, but if we have not made it clear that the Government will meet marginal costs, it may be possible to include a provision to that effect in the Bill. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment so that we may reconsider the matter and perhaps return to it at a later stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> My high hopes of the Minister have been fulfilled. Those are precisely the conciliatory words that I hoped to hear from her.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mclean:</B> Did I not say to the Committee that the Parliamentary Secretary was a thoroughly decent lady, who would always accede to a sensible argument and had justice in her heart?

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> And intellectual rigour and consistency too.

<P>
On the basis of that assurance from the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>General safeguards</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This is an important clause, despite the fact that no amendments have been tabled to it. Earlier, the Minister referred to the disposal of material, particularly intercepted material that is not seen as product, or some such phrase. The clause relates to very sensitive material. Hon. Members should look in their in-boxes and out-boxes and decide whether they would be comfortable if all their e-mails and the websites that they have visited were in general circulation, because I think that would make most people nervous.

<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how seriously the Government take the issue. As we move into the world of the internet, away from traditional telecommunications, all sorts of possibilities arise. Recently, we heard about the David Shayler case, in which confidential information was put on to web servers, so that it was instantly available to millions of people, unlike an old taped telephone conversation. Previously, it took a tabloid newspaper to put information on a 0898 number, so that someone could listen to a member of the royal family, for example. Now, we have e-mailed material, which can be broadcast around the world instantly. Even if the Government take action to prevent disclosure, the use of mirrored servers means that the material will be replicated elsewhere. I hope that the Government are aware of that. E-mails, which are caught by the Bill, showing an individuals tendencies towards Stalinism, or any other political flavour, could be stored away and released at some future date, as it may be uncertain whether the material has been disposed of. That is a hypothetical situation, but it reminds me of the issue of, security service material that was collected on the Home Secretary and Northern Ireland Secretary in the early 1970s. We have not got to the bottom of that, but similar things could happen. Under the Bill, that sort of material could be collected and we want it to be disposed of once individuals have been proved to be entirely innocent, as the individuals in that case were.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the material might be lost and, if so, has he seen the front page of The Sun today?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I was about to refer to that and ask whether the Government will give a commitment to be as careful with the disposal of material-and to employ the best technology for its disposal-as they are with its collection. It seems, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire pointed out, that we have an unsatisfactory system for disposal at the moment whereby material is transferred to a laptop computer and placed in the back of a London taxi. That is not a secure method for the disposal of confidential information although it does seem effective in that the material never re-surfaces, or has not done so in the last couple of days. Some serious technology will be required to make clause 14 work. Currently, people who want to ensure that confidential information is erased when they dispose of computers have to pay large sums of money for that certainty. I know that the MOD and the police use contractors. My concern is that there would be a natural tendency within the authorities concerned to devote more effort to obtaining the material than to its disposal. Therefore, I am seeking assurances that clause 14 will be adhered to.

<P>
I would be interested to know whether the Government have procedures for reviewing what happens in respect of the disposal of material. Also, I would be interested in knowing whether they have considered what will happen if something goes wrong and an individual finds confidential material from his e-mails circulating in the public realm and believes that this can be traced back to a communication which was intercepted via a warrant. I would like to know if there would be any route of redress for that individual other than the obvious one of taking the case to the European Court of Human Rights and asserting an invasion of their privacy under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. It would be better if the Government built a redress into the Bill. How would the system provide redress if it were felt that material had gone astray contrary to what the Secretary of State will require under clause 14? It may have gone astray because of a rogue agent, somebody like Shayler, who the Government cannot control. Perhaps the Minister will say a few words concerning the seriousness of the Government's intentions in clause 14.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I have only a few words to say on this, but I hope they will reassure the hon. Member for Hallam.

<P>
Clause 14 updates the Interception of Communications Act 1985. It brings the provisions of that Act forward into the modern age in order to deal with the electronic communications we have today. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on the disposal of intercepted products by saying that all the intercepting agencies take the issue very seriously. They have strict operating procedures and they destroy material not covered by the warrant. The safeguards are subject to close scrutiny by the interception of communications commissioner, Lord Nolan. We take seriously the misuse of any such material.

<P>
As to whether the safeguards are stringent enough, the number of people to whom any material is made available and the disclosure and copying of such material is strictly limited to the minimum necessary for the authorised purposes as set out in the clause. As to a right of redress, anyone who believes that their communications have been unlawfully intercepted may apply to the tribunal established under the Bill for redress. I hope that reassures him though my comments have been brief.

<P>
This clause is detailed. It restricts the use of intercepted material to the absolute minimum necessary for the authorised purposes. As I said in my opening comments, the clause imports the safeguards set out in section 6 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 and updates them. That is a necessary part of building into the Bill precisely the safeguards that concern the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will support the clause.

<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusion of matters from legal proceedings</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed. That the clause 16 stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> First, I thank Justice for providing me with a briefing on clauses 16 and 17. There is a certain amount of inter-relationship between the two clauses, which means that in discussing clause 16 it is necessary to mention clause 17, although clearly clause 16 is the main focus of my remarks.

<P>
It has been traditional to prohibit the use of evidence that comes from interceptions, and clauses 16 and 17 continue that tradition. However, that tradition began a long time ago. Certainly it was the regime when the Interception of Communications Act was passed in 1985. Since then a lot of water has flowed under the bridge in terms of the way in which the courts deal with sensitive evidence. Under parts II and III of the Police Act 1997, the evidence obtained from, for example, surveillance activities is admissible, but subject to a particular regime under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As I understand it, a police disclosure officer, or any official dealing with a case involving a defendant, gives general information about the sensitive material that has been obtained-details about informants, surveillance, undercover operations-which is listed and sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS has a duty to disclose to the defence material that it considers might undermine the prosecution case. However, in respect of sensitive material that it would not be in the public interest to disclose, it must seek a court ruling on whether the material should be disclosed. The CPS must also disclose to the defence the schedule of non-sensitive material, but sensitive material would not be disclosed. There is then a procedure whereby, if the prosecutor decides that the material is within the criteria for disclosure, but believes that a court needs to make a ruling on public interest grounds, that is determined in one of three ways using the procedures in various cases that have been decided.

<P>
One method is an inter partes hearing, where both the defendant and the prosecutor are represented and there is a full hearing in front of a judge. Another procedure is an ex parte application, where the defence is notified. Then there is what could be described as an ex parte ex parte application, where there is no notice to the defence and the whole matter is dealt with secretly. There are three levels because the information can be very sensitive, so it has always been thought right to deal with it secretly and securely. That regime is now generally accepted, although some difficulties arise about the quantity of disclosure being required at present.

<P>
If all this sensitive information is already being dealt with by the courts, using the public interest immunity procedure that I have outlined, why should evidence obtained by interception be treated differently? Information obtained by surveillance can be just as sensitive as that obtained by interception, and the requirement to keep it secret can be the same. Modern surveillance techniques are very sophisticated. The question being asked widely by lawyers is why the Government do not take the opportunity to have one coherent system, so that our courts do not run in two different directions over much the same category of evidence. After all, it is sensitive material, whether it is obtained by interception or surveillance.

<P>
Justice argues that having two separate regimes is a problem, and I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on that. An element of unfairness creeps into clauses 16 and 17 in relation to article 6 of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees a defendant a fair trial. The principle established in cases is equality of arms-the defendant should not be put in a worse position than the prosecutor in terms of evidence, cross-examination and running his case. Clause 17(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nothing in section 16(1) shall prohibit any such disclosure of any information that continues to be available for disclosure as is confined to-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a disclosure to a person conducting a criminal prosecution for the purpose only of enabling that person to determine what is required of him by his duty to secure the fairness of the prosecution; or

<P>
(b) a disclosure to a relevant judge in a case in which that judge has ordered the disclosure to be made to him alone.</UL></FONT>
<P>
That contemplates a problem of procedural and substantive fairness. The prosecutor could be armed with material that is helpful in framing cross-examination-it cannot be adduced in evidence because of clause 16, but he can ask questions of the defendant while fully armed with such knowledge. The defendant and his legal team will not have that advantage, which poses a problem in terms of the equality of arms principle. Does the Minister also recognise that difficulty?

<P>
Justice states:
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
Even though the material may not be used by the prosecution as admissible evidence, it nevertheless may assist the prosecution as to how it conducts its case, including the asking of questions based on knowledge of the material. Second, it is a blanket provision whereby there are no circumstances when the merits of disclosing to the defence may be considered.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would be interested to hear what happens if the judge becomes aware of such material, as it is not explained how that would occur. Justice states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although clause 16 sets up a complete prohibition on making disclosures in legal proceedings, the prosecution will have to communicate in some way to the judge that it has this material and that it might be relevant to the proceedings. One question is how is this to be done?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will not the judge be put in an impossible position in terms of providing a just hearing, even within the principles of natural justice, never mind article 6 of the ECHR? If he becomes aware of information that the prosecution could use for cross-examination purposes-not in terms of making allegations, but as useful background information-what can he do about it? The answer is nothing. All he can do is insist that the prosecution makes an admission of fact. However, that may not be the issue. Often, the kind of information available enables the targeting of questions, which is a huge advantage in cross-examination.

<P>
Furthermore, Justice argues that the procedure for disclosing intercepted material to the judge and ordering an admission fall far short of the PII procedures that I mentioned. There is no provision for disclosure to the defence in any circumstances, even when justice requires it. The threshold for making admissions involves not fairness, but exceptional circumstances. There is no opportunity for the defence to make representations, even in a general sense, about that category of evidence. An admission, even if it was considered to be essential, may not be made if making it would breach the provisions of clause 16(1). It is hard to see how a fair trial could follow in that situation.

<P>
In the briefing, Justice states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>lawfully intercepted material should be prima facie admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings, subject to the usual disclosure of evidence rules under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and judicial discretion under section 78 of PACE.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before the more recent provisions came into force-in the old days-the traditional argument involved saying, ``This matter is so secret that any knowledge of any kind about intercepted communication or about any of the procedures would be terribly dangerous to reveal.'' The Minister will probably say that today. If some surveillance equipment, much of which is highly sophisticated and can be used for exactly the same purposes, may be subject to the procedure-courts deal with those matters every day of the week-why cannot the procedure apply in this context? I ask that in a spirit of genuine inquiry and because Justice made a strong case about that in its briefing.

<P>
We thought about tabling a relevant amendment, but I want to hear the Minister's response. Her reply may satisfy us totally, but if it does not, she may hear more about this matter on Report.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> I shall tread carefully because I do not want to pre-empt our discussion of clause 17. I take my cue from my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, and risk testing your patience, Mrs Michie.

<P>
My hon. Friend pointed out that the provisions of clause 17 are relevant to our discussion of the broad principles of clause 16. The broad principle of the clause is that the prohibition on the use of intercept material as evidence will remain, but that a prosecution may be ordered to disclose it to the trial judge, who may in turn direct the making of admisison of fact. However, neither clause makes provision for the disclosure of material to the defence. My hon. Friend pointed out that, on the face of it, that appears to be a stark breach of article 6 of the European convention on human rights and of the principle of equality of arms, which in this context broadly refers to the rights of the defendant to be able adequately to mount a defence in proeedings.

<P>
We should remind ourselves of the way in which that principle could operate in relation to the clauses. First, the prosecution but not the defence will have access to potentially relevant evidence. The material may not be used by the prosecution as admissible evidence as such in court, but it would clearly assist the prosecution to frame further questions in the court's proceedings. It may give the prosecution hints about what to look for, although the admissible evidence itself may not directly help the prosecution.

<P>
Secondly, the clauses appear to involve a blanket provision. That means that the disclosure to the defence cannot be ordered even when the circumstances are exceptional. I want to focus specifically on subsection (5)(b) and subsection (6) of clause 17. Subsection (5)(b) states that a disclosure may be made to a relevant judge
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in a case in which that judge has ordered the disclosure to be made to him alone.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (6) goes on to state that the judge
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall not order a disclosure under subsection (5)(b) except where he is satisfied that the exceptional circumstances of the case make the disclosure essential in the interests of justice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That contains two key concepts-exceptional circumstances and essential in the interests of justice. The problem is that neither case law nor the definitions in the Bill provide a clear understanding of what those concepts mean. In the absence of any such case law, the Minister should explain what ``exceptional circumstances'' could mean.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The third reason why we should reflect on how article 6 may be breached by clauses 16 and 17 is the reference to disclosure to a relevant judge in clause 17(6). That says nothing about how the judge might make an order for disclosure to him or herself alone. Although clause 16 sets up a prohobition on making disclosures, the prosecution will have to communicate to the judge that it has material that might be relevant to the proceedings. How is that to be done?

<P>
Justice gives an example of a communication that might be made in an ex parte public interest immunity hearing. In such circumstances, the question would be whether there are sufficient safeguards for the defence, as is required by recent ECHR decisions in Rowe and Davis v. UK, Jasper v. UK and Fitt v. UK. The problem that is revealed by those cases is that the procedures for disclosing intercept material to the judge and the judge's ability to order an admission in such cases sharply diverge from the provisions of the clauses.

<P>
The differences are as follows. First, the clauses contain no provision for disclosure to the defence in any circumstances. Secondly, the threshold for making admissions is not a fairness test, which is what case law would suggest, but the funny things that I have referred to-``exceptional circumstances'' and ``essential'' admissions under clause 17(6). Thirdly, the clauses apparently give the defence no opportunity to make representations during proceedings as to what the exceptional circumstances might be. That causes Justice much concern and, having done some digging, I am equally perplexed. I am sure that the Minister will want to explain how the two divergent propositions can be squared.

<P>
When exceptional circumstances make a disclosure essential in the interests of justice and the judge considers that admission should be made, clause 17(8) places restrictions on the sort of admissions that can be made. An admission cannot be made if it suggests that an interception has taken place: that is what clause 16(1) states. If the admission points to the existence of an interception or suggests that an interception has been made, it looks as if we are stymied and that the exceptional circumstances cannot operate because clause 16(1) will be in force. Perhaps the Minister will explain how that will operate because there seems to be a flagrant contradiction.

<P>
Finally, will the Minister explain why the judicial discretion that is exercisable under section 78 of PACE does not appear to be permissible if clauses 16 and 17 come into play? That point was made powerfully by Justice, which concluded, having examined case law, that prima facie evidence in criminal proceedings should be admissible if it is intercepted material, subject to the disclosure of evidence rules under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and section 78 of PACE. It also said that that is the position for other material obtained by intrusive surveillance methods under part III of the Police Act 1997 and part II of the Bill. It concluded that if the objections can be overcome for one form of intrusive surveillance, it should not be too much to ask the Minister what the continued justification is for interception material to be treated differently. I am not sure how or why the difference arises and it is puzzling.

<P>
A further point arising from case law that has been thrown up by clause 16 and the exceptions in the subsequent clause was raised by the Criminal Bar Association in the context of international co-operation. The association said that, in the context of crime with an international dimension, foreign agencies often supply our law enforcement agencies with their own intercept material. When such material has been gathered according to the law of a foreign state, it is admissible in the United Kingdom. If a foreign agency believes that intercept material may be useful to a drugs bust in Dover by Customs and Excise, that material would be admissible in a United Kingdom court under Aujila and others 1998 2 Cr. App. R 16. I was surprised to read that the Criminal Bar Association believes that policy considerations in that case applied by the prosecuting authorities in the United Kingdom-Customs and Excise-prevented the use of such material as evidence in courts here. That resulted in the worst of both worlds, because the material, with the consent of the foreign donor intelligence agency, was disclosed to the defence in full but was not used in evidence. The association's observation from the case is that the capability to intercept was revealed, without use being made of the material in question.

<P>
Given that, I wondered why the Minister included these clauses in the Bill, because the case law and the statutes to which I referred, particularly section 78 of PACE, seem to contain a raft of contradictions. It would be hugely useful to have some elucidation as to why the clauses provide for one regime, while the case law and the statutes to which we have referred and to which Justice has drawn attention outside this place are so different. Therefore, I look forward to an interesting, technical trot round the block by the Minister. I shall not be as florid in my praise of her as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, because I shall not refer to her as a girl. I see her as a competent, clever and legally skilled Minister, and in that spirit I look forward to a heavyweight and detailed anlaysis in response to my questions.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate has ranged over clauses 16 and 17, which was reasonable, given the close connection between them. Therefore, if other hon. Members wish to make remarks on clause 17, separately from Government amendment No. 54, they may do so in this debate. Otherwise, I call the Minister.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I fear that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) will be sadly disappointed by my response. I defer to hon. Member's knowledge of the law and of the technical detail in the Bill.

<P>
To use a phrase that Opposition Members seek to lasso as their own, I want to bring some common sense to our discussions. Instead of speaking of these issues in legal terms, quoting case law, perhaps it would help if I first answered the reasonable question that I was asked. If we deal with intrusive surveillance in one way, why can we not deal with the interceptions of electronic communications in a similar way?

<P>
Surveillance would normally revolve around one or two types of equipment that could be protected by application to the court. No third parties are involved in such surveillance. However, with interception we are dealing with a different set of circumstances. First, many types of technology are involved, not all of which can be intercepted. If we allowed such intercepted material to be used in court as evidence, that would expose the methods of communication that can be intercepted and those that cannot, so criminals would gravitate towards the service that cannot be intercepted.

<P>
Secondly, a third party is involved in obtaining the intercepted material-the communication service provider staff. Use of the evidence in court would almost certainly require such staff to appear in court for cross-examination, with the associated possibility of threats to them. Telecommunications operators have made it clear to the Government that they would strongly resist such a move.

<P>
As you said, Mrs Michie, the two clauses are closely connected. Clause 16 excludes evidence subject to the exemptions set out in detail in clause 17, so it excludes evidence, questioning or assertion in legal proceedings likely to reveal the existence or absence of a warrant. A similar provision is contained in section 9 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985, which the Bill repeals. Therefore, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire rightly said, this procedure has been followed for a long time.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the principle of equality of arms. Equality of arms is guaranteed by article 6 of the European convention on human rights and is preserved by the existing process. As neither the prosecution nor the defence can make use of the intercepted material, its disclosure to the prosecution or to a judge ensures that there is no disadvantage to the defendant. This is where we get into difficulties in dealing with two clauses, because disclosure to the judge is laid down in clause 17(5)(b). If the intercepted material clearly shows the defendant's innocence, the case would have to be withdrawn and it would be the prosecuting officer's responsibility to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister's last remark is very useful. I am glad that she said that.

<P>
Clause 17(5) says that there should be no disclosure except that set out in (a) and then
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a disclosure to a relevant judge in a case in which that judge has ordered the disclosure to be made to him alone.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does the judge obtain the information to know that he should make an order for disclosure? In other words, how is the order triggered? Does the Crown
Prosecution Service give him the documents? If so, when and how does it do it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Why does it do it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Yes, why does it do it?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The prosecuting counsel must satisfy himself or herself that nothing in the intercept material could assist the defence or undermine the prosecution. I hate quoting case law, particularly as hon. Members will know more about it than I do, but this is known as the Preston duty, which was confirmed in the House of Lords case.

<P>
I appreciate that my responses will not provide the detailed discussion of these issues that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds sought. We have considered this subject many times in recent years, particularly in the past two years, and our considerations have included a number of specific studies, including, most recently, research into the experience of seven other countries operating an evidential regime.

<P>
No direct comparison with other countries is possible. In countries that allow intercept material to be used in evidence, the interception warrant is generally ordered by an investigating judge. Our criminal investigations are supervised not by judges but by the law enforcement agency. The difficulty with the proposal that we should move to the other regime lies in devising a system that ensures equality of arms between prosecution and defence that is both practicable and affordable. That is why we have said that we do not intend to go down the route of judicial warranting.

<P>
Clause 16 places a prohibition on the use of intercept material in connection with court proceedings and is straightforward. Clause 17 deals with the exemptions to that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> This is clearly a complex and legalistic area. Would the Minister be prepared to write to me and other members of the Committee to deal in a more legal way with the Justice points that I raised? Would she consider that useful?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I am more than happy to do that and will make sure that hon. Members receive a copy. As far as I can, I shall answer the points that hon. Members have raised on the documents supplied by Justice.

<P>
Finally, how would a judge know that he could make an order? It would be up to the prosecuting counsel to say to the judge ``I invite you to make an order under this section''. The information would be provided to the judge in that way, thus clearly placing the onus on the prosecuting counsel.

<P>
This has been an interesting discussion, and one that I have found stimulating and testing. I shall answer the points raised in a letter to members of the Committee after giving further consideration to the comments that they have made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee any longer than is necessary, and I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's comments. It will be helpful to receive a written response to the series of questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire and me relating to the points raised by Justice.

<P>
However, I would like her to underline one particular issue when she is going through the questions in Hansard. It is the use of the term ``exceptional circumstances'' in clause 17. The term does not appear to have any obvious provenance, and ``fairness'' would have been an obvious word to draw from case law. I am perplexed as to where ``exceptional circumstances'' has come from. I am always wary when we, as humble jobbing legislators on the Opposition Back Benches in Standing Committees, encounter terms such as this. Its use could have serious consequences for the prosecution of what will often be very sensitive cases.

<P>
Is it the Government's intention to incorporate the term into the Bill and leave it to the judges cheerfully to interpret what they think it means? Alternatively, is there a precedent in case law that defines its use? The Government do not appear to have borrowed from case law; if they had, they would not have used that term. The Parliamentary Secretary has offered to write to my hon. Friend on that point. It will be useful to have all our questions answered, but I am especially interested in the answer to that one. A lot could turn on that response, as it is clear that orders under clause 17 cannot be made unless a judge is satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply. We need, therefore, to know what those circumstances might be. I am unhappy about the term being interpreted ab initio once the provision passes into law, should the Bill receive Royal Assent.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I was going to address this question during our debate on clause 17, but if I do so now it will not be necessary later.

<P>
Ministers offer examples with some trepidation, because they can give the Committee the opportunity to trot off down other avenues. I therefore offer this example advisedly. A defendant might be on trial with a group of others, charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery. The evidence could suggest that they were all together at the time of the robbery, yet intercept evidence might show that this defendant was elsewhere at the time. In such a case, an admission could be made that the prosecution accepted that that defendant had not been present, but without having to say how it knew that.

<P>
I hope that that example will help to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, and if it is possible to provide other working examples in my letter to the Committee, I shall try to do so.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exceptions to section 16</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 19, line 3, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where any disclosure is proposed to be or has been made on the grounds that it is authorised by subsection (3), section 16(1) shall not prohibit the doing of anything in, or for the purposes of, so much of any legal proceedings as relates to the question whether that disclosure is or was so authorised.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment relates to subsection (3), and is designed to ensure that when intercept evidence is used in legal proceedings-perhaps because one party consented to the interception-it can be fully challenged.

<P>
We tabled the amendment, which we expect to be welcomed, to ensure that when intercept evidence is used in legal proceedings, the decision to use it can be fully challenged by all parties.

<P>
The amendment will apply to subsection (3), which relates to the disclosure of intercept material if it is obtained lawfully without an interception warrant. That could occur, for example, when both bodies consented to the interception or when the interception was undertaken as lawful business practice.

<P>
Many people have criticised the Interception of Communications Act 1985 because it was not sufficiently clear about the type of interception that can and cannot be introduced as evidence. I hope that clauses 16 and 17 will clarify the situation. We believe that the amendment will improve the situation even further. When evidence is used, it will be fully examined. That meets an observation that was made in a recent judgment in the House of Lords-Morgans on 17 February-which found that it would be absurd to allow unwarranted interceptions to be used in evidence and to make it impossible to challenge its legality.

<P>
We tabled the amendment to ensure equality of arms during legal proceedings when evidence of lawful but unwarranted interception was introduced. I hope that Committee members will welcome it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Although I welcome the amendment for the reasons that the Parliamentary Secretary outlined, it drives a coach and horses through the argument that she advanced during our previous debate. If evidence of interception involving third parties can be presented and examined in court, despite the difficulties that the Parliamentary Secretary previously outlined, why cannot the regime that applies to surveillance evidence apply to intercept evidence?

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The amendment deals with the specific circumstances that I outlined. I have already explained why it is important for intercept evidence to be protected in the prescribed manner. I gave an example in which parties consented to an interception, which showed how the provisions will apply. The matter should be fully questioned in the legal system. The amendment will improve the Bill. It is in accordance with the decision that the House of Lords reached in February and it emphasises the importance of the equality of arms principle that we discussed in relation to clauses 16 and 17.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 17, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offence for unauthorised disclosures</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to discuss the position of whistleblowers in relation to the clause. Liberty and other groups have discussed the offences that are appropriate for unauthorised disclosures. It is an important subject, to which we may later return. We have not tabled amendments because we want the Government's intentions to be explained to us. I hope that they will respond to the situation that I am about to describe.

<P>
The clause develops a principle that the Labour party, when it was in opposition, back in the dark days of 1988, felt was important when it considered the Official Secrets Act 1989. I hope that we have, as a matter of principle, a commonality of interest. On other occasions during the Labour party's period in opposition, it was keen to protect the rights of whistleblowers across a range of services and areas. An individual might be involved in an interception, and might understand that a further fraud or other offence is taking place-we have discussed the possibility of accessing credit card details through the interception of e-mails. There have been investigations in organisations such as the National Crime Squad and the flying squad in London, which, sadly, have revealed cases of corruption. The individual concerned might have followed the normal procedures, such as referring to a senior officer, which might not have produced a result. At that stage, the individual might feel impelled to disclose the abuse of the interception to another party. In such circumstances, do the Government still intend the individual to be prosecuted?

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The clause imposes a strict liability, for which there seems to be no defence. A statutory defence exists for talking to one's legal advisers, but none exists where disclosure took place in the interests of preventing further criminal activity. There are other public interest reasons for disclosure-for example, political exercises, where interceptions were for what were deemed to be inappropriate reasons. Such a public interest defence, which should be tested in court, is not in the clause. The Government should indicate their thinking in relation to the current wording of the clause, so we will know whether to return to the matter at a later stage. How could an individual defend himself if he felt that there was no alternative to disclosure?

<P>
We understand why there must be general provisions in clause 18. Clearly, if there were threats to secret service agents, for example, one would not want to give a green light to an individual to disclose. There could be a serious threat to the life and liberty of the discloser, even in criminal investigations, because other criminal elements might want to take action. However, we do not understand why the Government have not included statutory defences. Will it be possible to apply a test where there was no alternative to disclosure, and where those involved in interception, perhaps senior officers, have carried out further criminal activity?

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> This is the opposite of a whistleblower's clause. The clause is necessary precisely because of the amount of secrecy that is required by the day-to-day operation of the interception regime. Parliament may debate that regime openly and rigorously, and define its structure and operation. However, the daily operation of the regime, including details of particular targets, must necessarily be shrouded in secrecy. That requirement is taken seriously in clauses 16 and 17.

<P>
Clause 18 further shores up the necessity for secrecy, which was outlined in the two preceding clauses. It applies equally to all of those who may come into the possession of information about interception, including those who work for the agencies and those who work for service providers. We have created an offence in relation to those who wilfully pass on such information. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam expressed concerns about that, and about the lack of defences.

<P>
On whether the provisions are too draconian, we regard them as proportionate to the seriousness of the offence that may be committed and to be a sufficient deterrent. Failure to comply with the requirement to keep secret all matters relating to warranted interception might compromise the national security of the UK and cost lives-as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We believe that sufficient defences are set out in subsections (5) and (9), which I invite him to study further.

<P>
I have explained about creating an offence for those who wilfully pass on information and the statutory defences. It has been suggested that the drafting of the clause is unclear as to whether individuals served with a warrant can consult within their organisation about how best to comply with it. Subsections (6) and (7) provide a defence for a person consulting their legal adviser, for example, about requirements placed on them under the Bill.

<P>
Those defences are sufficient, and I hope that the Committee will support clause 18.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> During an earlier discussion about certificated material, we referred to the definition of external communication in clause 19, and the Minister said that he might reconsider it. The definition is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a communication sent or received outside the British Islands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the internet, material floats around the globe merrily. It is therefore harder to pin it down so as to decide whether it can be covered by certificated warrants or has to be covered by a warrant against a named individual. Has the Minister thought any more about that?

<P>
My general view is that one should not add words to a Bill-they usually have too many words and one should try to reduce them-but I remain concerned that the definition of external communication does not reflect the reality of the ways in which messages are now transmitted around the globe at the speed of light. I suggested at the time that referring to the location of the final recipient or the first originator might be more appropriate, because a message might consist of many sending and receiving actions along the way.

<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I shall respond quickly to that question. My hon. Friend tells me that we are still considering the matter and are not yet in a position to respond in detail. We shall clarify the position at a later date.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I had a little help with the amendments because we were keen to get them exactly right. This is an important part of the debate in which we shall return to some old arguments and embark on some fresh ones.

<P>
Communications data are extremely significant. The Bill is based on an old framework, in which communications data simply meant using a telephone bill from BT to find out the numbers that a person had called. Nowadays, communications data allow one to create an almost complete picture of that person's life. Knowing the websites that they have visited-merely having the communications data, not the actual content of the messages-can reveal who they bank with, who they shop with and where they travel. We must take that seriously, and ensure that there is a fairly high threshold before the Government can intervene to collect that data.

<P>
The amendments aim to ensure that judicial authorisation is given to collection of communications data. This is an old theme to which we have referred several times, but which we wish consistently to advance. Independent authority should be given for the collection of communications data.

<P>
In Malone v. the UK in 1984 the European Court of Justice decided that communications data came within the provisions of article 8-the truancy provisions-and the Telecommunications Act 1984 was amended to take account of that. We have a history in simple BT-type collecting of telephone numbers and a principle was established. We do not know how far that will go, but I understand that a fairly low level of authorisation is required from a police officer to collect numbers from a telecommunications company. We are trying to avoid maintaining a low threshold and we want the article 8 provisions to be fully respected.

<P>
In Kopp v. Switzerland in 1988 the European Court of Justice examined self-authorisation and was astonished that a member of the Post Office's legal department, who was a member of the Executive, was able to carry out the authorisation without supervision by an independent judge. The judgments of the European Court of Justice on article 8 provisions and intrusions into privacy have consistently referred to judicial authority, but have not mandated that. That judgment did not require judicial authority, but it has been suggested that that would be preferable, and the amendments would insert that form of authorisation in the Bill.

<P>
I am privileged to have been supplied with an amended text on the various amendments. We want to get the provision right. Ministers often argue that our amendments are deficient and that that is the principal reason for rejecting them. I hope that in being so comprehensive there is no deficiency in the amendments before us, and that the Government will accept them as a package and a useful route to judicial authorisation for collection of communications data. I hope that the Government will tell us that they are treating the matter seriously.

<P>
The issue of trigger points will arise in later amendments, so I shall merely ask the Government to tell us who can grant authorisation, how it can be granted and how that relates to other forms of evidence that is collected under PACE and the Police Act 1997. There seems to be increasing disparity between the level of authorisation required. When premises are to be searched or physical data is to be collected, the test is quite high and a high level of authorisation is required, but if collection of electronic data is required, the data may be just as significant, but the test is lower. That must give rise to concern. Any indication from the Minister on the extent to which communications data has been collected in the past and the extent to which it is expected to be collected in the future would be helpful. That would help us to understand how significant the burden will be on service providers who are asked for data and on citizens on whom the data is collected and whether that will be routine or exceptional. An explanation for special material under section 9 and schedule 1 of PACE requires an application to a circuit judge, and that may be more appropriate here than requiring a local police officer to request from an ISP a list of data that may describe the entire picture of a person's life, which is intrusive under article 8 on the right to privacy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I should like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman on what may be a record number of amendments in one group. In the late hours of last night I counted them and there are 39, which is impressive.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that during our proceedings the Government have not argued that any amendments have been deficient in character. That can sometimes be argued, but not in this Committee. We have tried to deal with all amendments on their merits, and I shall do that now.

<P>
It is important to place on the record an explanation of communications data, because there is much controversy about what the term means. In so doing, I shall answer some of the hon. Gentlemen's specific questions about the extent to which the data are collected at present.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In simple terms, communications held by the communication service provider, but do not cover the content of the communication itself. Typical examples of communications data are subscriber details to a particular means of communication such as a telephone or itemised billing, although in a small minority of cases the data can be more intrusive than that.

<P>
My officials have creatively produced an example that I shall explain to the Committee. If one draws an analogy between the types of communications data and the proceedings in this Room under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie, subscriber details would equate to a police force being able to find out by examining records who are the members of the Committee; itemised billing would equate to the police force being told who spoke in each part of the debate and how long they spoke for-in some cases a long time, in others briefly; internet data may be capable of equating to the publications that members of the Committee brought into the Room this morning and the documents that the picked up from the Desk; and full interception would equate to the Hansard record of the debate. I am grateful to my officials for generating that example so that we can use our own experience to show graphically what communications data are.

<P>
Clearly, therefore, although accessing communications data is an intrusive activity that requires proper regulation, the degree of intrusion is several orders of magnitude lower than interception.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I assume that the Minister is saying that his third category-the internet data-is included within communications data. Visits to websites are a practical thing that people do now. If people monitored my website, they could find out who I banked with and shopped with, whether I had been to a travel agent and so on, which is far more intrusive than anything has been historically.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall come to that specific point.

<P>
As I was saying, although accessing communications data is an intrusive activity requiring proper regulation, the degree of intrusion is several orders of magnitude lower than interception and equates more closely to physical surveillance. However, members of the Committee might consider, as I do, that being followed around the streets by a surveillance team would constitute a greater intrusion into my privacy than someone looking through my itemised telephone bill or even examining the websites that I visited in my last internet session, to take the hon. Gentleman's example.

<P>
There is no question that access to data affects the way in which we all do business in this country-the hon. Gentleman gave some examples about his banking and so on, but it goes wider than that-and involves not only law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies but anyone who offers a service. If one phones up to book a holiday, one no longer needs to give one's address: one simply gives the postcode, name and house number, and the person at the other end of the phone knows the street, town and credit rating. That happens routinely now. Any member of the public can buy databases off the shelf that provide all sorts of personal information, including communications data. Yet the amendments suggest that, if the police want to obtain such data to investigate a crime, they should first go to a judge to obtain authorisation.

<P>
The number of requests made currently for communications data is far greater than the number of interception warrants, but that is not surprising. There is much more crime than serious crime in this country and far more police officers employed in the investigation of crime than serious crime alone. It is because communications data are so useful that so many requests are made each year. The Committee will want reassurance that the data are being used proportionately and where necessary, so I am happy to give the information that the hon. Gentleman requested.

<P>
So far this calendar year, 96.8 per cent. of all the communications data requests-for example, by Customs and Excise-have been for subscriber details, the most basic level of check, while 2.9 per cent. of the remainder has been for itemised billing inquiries and the remaining 0.3 per cent. for other services, none of which is more intrusive than those carried out by a surveillance team. To give an idea of the scale, that equates to a total of 18,940 requests for data-far more than could be accommodated by judicial authorisation.

<P>
The implication of the hon. Gentleman's question is, ``Are these requests necessary?'' The Bill addresses that question, requiring that no authorising officer may authorise a notice unless obtaining the communications data is both necessary and proportionate. We return to those important qualifications relating to the ability to act under the provisions of the Bill. A significant element of our consideration of the Bill involves making its provisions work within the context of the Human Rights Act 1998, and the words ``necessary'' and ``proportionate'' are important in that context.

<P>
At present, the Data Protection Act safeguards are faily lax, and have been made tighter only through voluntary co-operation between the telecoms industry and law enforcement. There is currently no independent oversight. The Bill places oversight of the use of this power under the remit of the interception of communications commissioner, which will give greater guarantees to the citizen than those that exist under the present arrangements.

<P>
An audit team from the commissioner's office will undertake periodic inspections of each body to ensure that the power is being used responsibly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that proposal. The teams will inspect records, checking the details to ensure the necessity and proportionality of what has been requested.

<P>
<B>Mr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed):</B> I was struck by the Minister's references to audit teams from the commissioner's office. This will be a significant development, compared with the experience to date under the Interception of Communications Act 1985, which has been a relatively lonely task. What scale of resources does the Minister envisage being involved in this task?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> It is worth making the point that, under the IOCA requirements high levels of interception were being discussed. As I have said previously in Committee, we are talking about a relatively small amount of data. However, communications data such as I have described will require a larger responsibility; I have been keen to be frank with the Committee about what is taking place in that context.

<P>
I used the term ``audit teams'' to establish that an audit will check what is happening in practice, rather than examine every case universally. We do not anticipate the need for a substantial apparatus to carry out that task. However, we do anticipate that proper regimes, such as audits, will be put in place to check that procedures are being properly followed. We shall then be able to make judgments about the necessity and proportionality of what is being done. I should like to put the right hon. Gentleman's mind at rest about the scale of the operation. I used the word ``audit'' because we want to establish systems that will genuinely assess what is taking place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beith:</B> I want to reassure the Minister that my inquiry was based on the concern that there should be sufficient resources at the commissioner's disposal to enable him to send in audit teams.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I appreciate that that was the right hon. Gentleman's intention, and I welcome it. We shall discuss this matter when we reach the clauses relating to the commissioner. We are actively considering the details of those provisions at present, which is why I am being slightly less than specific in my response. However, I wanted to lay to rest the idea that we might introduce some great bureaucratic operation, and to explain why I used the word ``audit'' rather than specifying a universal method of checking.

<P>
I have explained that the information that can be obtained through communications data is no more intrusive, and generally less intrusive, than directed surveillance. That is why we have the level of authorisation that we have. Directed surveillance is, as the Committee knows, surveillance in a public place that gives information about life style, contacts and movements. This is a normal, day-to-day policing activity and is authorised within the police force at an appropriate level. We consider that the level of superintendent is right for that type of authorisation, and we also consider that an appropriate level for accessing communications data. From the point of view of levels of intrusion, we believe that internal authorisation is right.

<P>
We must also consider the number of notices likely to be served under the provisions. It will be far higher than the number of interception warrants, because communications data are used for many more purposes than interception of communications-as I have suggested in an answer to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)-or other highly intrusive techniques. Judicial authorisation would be inappropriate, and would place unacceptable strains on the court service.

<P>
I have tried to be as open as I can be in dealing with the points that have been made and to give information not only to the hon. Member for Hallam but to other members of the Committee-and, through Hansard, to the wider public-about what is happening with regard to communications data. I am worried that there has been insufficient understanding of their nature. I emphasise that I refer not to the hon. Gentleman-it is clear from his comments that he fully grasps the subject-but to the wider discussions that have taken place. That is why I gave such a full explanation.

<P>
On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. Otherwise, I shall resist it and ask the Committee to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I shall not request that we vote on each of the amendments in this group, as I want to get home before midnight.

<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his full response-it will be useful to have it on the record. He is good at resisting the temptation to say, ``Your amendment is deficient, so I am not going to talk about it''. That is an incredibly irritating approach that we have not yet experienced during the Committee's proceedings.

<P>
The Minister said that communications data cover a multitude of sins-from basic subscriber details, to itemised billing and to information that is more inclusive and will become increasingly so. Given the way in which the technology is moving, the dividing line between content and communications data is likely to blur rather than strengthen, and it will be increasingly hard to say which is which.

<P>
I do not intend to press the amendment. However, I hope that the Government will consider whether a tiered framework is necessary. That is apparently the view of the data protection commissioner, who, in welcoming the Government's proposals, pointed out that the grounds for wishing to obtain certain kinds of communications data should be subject to prior external scrutiny-ideally by a judge or at least by an independent body such as the commission that the Minister talked about. There is a case for scaling the response according to the kind of information involved. I accept that basic subscriber detail information should be at a fairly low level, but some trapping of communications data could be at a higher level.

<P>
It is difficult for the police to carry out directed surveillance-and they will not do so without a strong incentive-but it will be easier for them to use the technology to carry out its equivalent. Given that the test that we shall debate when we reach later clauses is so low as to cover any crime, there will be a temptation for police officers to intercept wide ranges of communications data. They would be able to justify that on the legal grounds of suspicion of a crime, which potentially applies to large numbers of people. As the technology will enable them to intercept data more easily and straightforwardly, they are likely to use it far more often than directed surveillance, which subjects citizens to an equivalent degree of intrusion. That remains an issue of concern-less so in respect of lower levels of data, more so in respect of more comprehensive kinds of data.

<P>
I leave the Minister with that thought and hope that he will consider whether there should be a tiered structure to reflect the technological changes in communications data, which, in terms of their possible release to the authorities-whether appropriately or inappropriately-is becoming increasingly intrusive. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 150, in page 23, leave out lines 1 to 3.

<P>
The amendment relates to the definition of communications data, which the Minister mentioned. It is relatively easy to understand what subsections 4(a) and (b) mean, but I am troubled by subsection 4(c). The amendment, which would delete it, is a probing amendment to try to discover what it means.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> First, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the rapier-like lucidity and brevity of his intervention. In the absence of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, I want to put that on the record.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. At first sight, if the communications data does not fit into the first two categories, it should not be made available. However, as the hon. Gentleman will know from his professional experience before entering Parliament, those who break the law take measures to avoid detection. For example, where they are not required to leave subscriber details for a phone or internet account, they may decide not to do so. Where they can pay cash, they will, instead of leaving payment details. Any data held by the communications service provider relating to an account could be the vital piece of information that identifies the user. Where necessary, and as one of the designated purposes, the Bill would allow interception of a telephone where the subscriber's real identity was unknown. However, the amendment, which I know is intended as probing, would restrict the ability of law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies to find out who owned it. The purpose of subsection (4)(c), which the amendment would delete, is to operate in circumstances in which the data is not otherwise available. It is worth reminding the Committee that no notice may be authorised unless the authorising officer considers that the communications data is necessary and proportionate. Clearly, the decision is subject to scrutiny by the commissioner.

<P>
I agree that it is a belt and braces provision-the core of the clause is in subsections (a) and (b), asthe hon. Gentleman indicated-but I hope that I have answered his inquiry about subsection (c).

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> That has been helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to recognise the importance and significance of the power to obtain communications data, which should be treated as invasion of privacy. It is appropriate only in serious cases, and should be justified. The amendments would introduce a more rigorous regime for communications data and the obtaining of it.

<P>
We agree with the numerous bodies that have commented that the assumption that data access represents a lesser intrusion into rights of privacy than interception is misconceived. Modern software technology, friendship tree technology and so on can be very intrusive. Every aspect of a person's life can be pried into. The data protection commissioner has questioned the distinction made in the Bill between the requirements for gaining access to data in an intercepted communication and those for gaining access to other communications data. She cites various reasons for that.

<P>
There should be a similar regime, at least to an extent, to that for an interception warrant. Those who can give authorisations should be those listed in clause 6(2) as able to apply for an interception warrant. The long list of those who can be designated persons, which is a result of the wide definition of a relevant public authority, should be scrapped.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter in the way that he has. As he said, the amendments would restrict the agencies that could apply for communications data to the intercepting agencies. The main practical effect of that would be to channel requests from all the police forces in England and Wales through the National Communications Intelligence Service. NCIS handles all the interception warrants on behalf of those police forces, because each force makes only a small use of interception and because recording centres are hugely expensive and require specialist technical and linguistic staff to operate them.

<P>
As I explained in responding to the earlier amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam, communications data are a completely different means of gathering intelligence. I addressed the hon. Gentleman's point about data access being a lesser intrusion, but I maintain that interception-and even directed surveillance-is a much greater intrusion than the collection of communications data. He may disagree, in which case he will say so, but I rigorously defend the proposition that the widespread collection of communications data is less intrusive.

<P>
The use of communications data, which is widespread, must be carefully controlled-that is why the Bill has been introduced-but it is a tool that every police force uses every day. Every police force has a unit set up to process the requests. The standard to which each unit operates is laid down nationally and backed up by a national training course.

<P>
The communications industry has input to the data through the Association of Chief Police Officers telecommunications group, which holds regular meetings and has agreed a detailed framework of voluntary co-operation. I emphasise the word ``voluntary'' in the light of our earlier debates. That framework includes the standards that each party can expect of the other. For example, each police force has a single point of contact from which all requests for communications data must come, and the system has the confidence of the communications industry.

<P>
To pass all police communications data requirements through NCIS would create an extra level of bureaucracy and would not add much value to the process. As it would be operating nationally, NCIS would have no knowledge of the reasons for the requests. It could follow procedures, but it would not have the same day-to-day understanding of the issues. That would slow down urgent applications and would undermine the work that has been done-and is continuing-by the ACPO telecommunications group in building up confidence.

<P>
The framework introduced by the Bill reinforces the useful work that has been done and places it on a firm statutory footing, which is an advance for personal liberties in this area. It removes the liability that suppliers of communications data had under the Data Protection Act 1988 and places it on the agency requiring the data; it provides a clear and independent oversight mechanism that has not existed previously; and people will be able to complain to the regulation of investigatory powers tribunal if they believe that their communications data have been accessed improperly.

<P>
For those reasons, we believe that the Bill will improve the present arrangements. I understand why the hon. Gentleman moved his amendment, but in the light of current practice and the way in which matters are evolving in relation to communications data, I hope that he will accept that it would not be appropriate to remove the power from police forces and deal with every issue through NCIS. I hope that, on consideration and with that clarification, he will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister's comments have been helpful and have referred to some technical points that I want to consider. However, there is a danger that, as a result of the Bill, we shall end up with an incoherent mess, with three different regimes for each of the three key aspects-interception warrants, communications data and encryption. The amendments were an attempt to make the system a little more coherent. We may have had some technical difficulties, and the Minister has made some points that I want to consider. I may want to return to the matter on Report, but, in the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The purpose of these amendments is to learn from the Minister the Government's intention on the broad range of conditions in clause 21(2), which allows them to receive and request communications data. It is the usual case of Liberal Democrats seeking to limit the Government's power to intrude into people's lives because of our general concern that people should live in a free society without the Government having too much authority, sometimes because we do not trust the Government of the day and sometimes because we may not trust a future Government not to use powers that a more benevolent Government had put into statute, but which had unwittingly unleashed later unpleasantness.

<P>
Clause 21(2) contains a broad range of authorities and refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any tax, duty, levy or other imposition,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``protecting public health'', ``public safety'' and so on. Those grounds are wide ranging and we discussed earlier the economic wellbeing provision. When we discussed safeguarding in terms of the interception of communications, the definition of safeguarding seemed to be slightly hazy. The clause refers only to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the interests of the economic well-being.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our concern is that the definition is very broad. The amendments would replace that with a straightforward definition that communications data should be intercepted only when serious crime is taking place.

<P>
The Minister referred earlier to his reasonableness. Perhaps he would consider a tiered approach so that a crime would not need to be serious for basic data to be obtained-for example, subscriber data and basic itemised billing-but tests such as those proposed in the amendments would be required for detailed communications data, which will be increasingly intrusive. The amendments were tabled to put down a marker that we are worried about intrusion, the broad range of the powers in clause 21 and the broad justifications for those powers. I hope that we can secure a useful debate on the scope envisaged by the Government rather than the case on paper. I can imagine someone making a case on paper for requests for communications data from almost anyone and one could find a reason for obtaining the data. Clause 21(2)(f) refers to ``charge payable'', which could refer to an unpaid parking ticket. The clause covers a broad spectrum and I hope that the Minister will clarify the Government's intentions.
