Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 18, in page 3, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and shall have regard to the views expressed by those persons and bodies'.-[Mr. Moss.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Before we broke for lunch, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) had been discussing amendment No. 18. In our differences towards the amendment, we and the Government may be arguing about semantics-if the Minister says that that is the case, I should be grateful.

<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Before making a scheme under this section, the appropriate authority shall consult such persons as appear to it to be likely to be entitled to payments under such a scheme and such organisations as appear to it to represent such persons.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Ministry could conduct a cursory consultation exercise and say, ``We have consulted but we shall go back to what we originally thought before the consultation.'' Our job is to ensure that legislation that passes through the House is clear. Clear action should also be taken as a result.

<P>
The amendment would add after the passage that I have just quoted the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and shall have regard to the views expressed by those persons and bodies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would ensure that the consultation was comprehensive and took people's views into account. If the matter were tested in the courts, the Minister would have to demonstrate that he had undertaken a comprehensive consultation exercise.

<P>
The Minister may say that we are merely arguing about semantics. I do not think that I am, but I look forward to his response.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Elliot Morley):</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and I agree that it is important to have consultations and to listen to the views of those who are consulted. However, statutory obligations apply to consultations-there is an obligation on me, as the Minister, to take those views into account. The Bill does not contain such a provision because it is not required-the relevant obligation already exists and I accept it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss </B>(North-East Cambridgeshire): I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in
 page 3, line 41, leave out ``the lands Tribunal'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the arbitration of such person as may be agreed between the person and the appropriate authority or, in default of agreement, to an arbitrator nominated by the President of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is the last of our amendments that relate to clause 5. Amendment No. 19 would replace the Bill's provision that requires compensation disputes to be adjudicated by the Lands Tribunal with a provision requiring arbitration to be carried out by an agreed arbitrator or, failing that, by someone nominated by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

<P>
The Bill provides for disputes about a person's entitlement under a compensation scheme or about the amount of compensation to be referred to the Lands Tribunal. However, the Lands Tribunal is notorious for reaching decisions on disputes extremely slowly and for being extremely expensive-professional fees are involved when pursuing cases.

<P>
We believe that justice should be ensured, and that that should be done in a reasonable time. A better solution would be for disputes to be dealt with through arbitration. The amendment contains appropriate provisions to realise those aims. If the appropriate Minister and the claimant cannot agree on a suitable arbitrator, one would be appointed by the president of the RICS, which has, in our opinion, the best expertise for the valuation of land and businesses for compensation purposes.

<P>
As the Bill is drafted, there is a risk that a Minister could simply refuse arbitration and then wait for nine months before making his offer, forcing the claimant to settle or face the unattractive option of going to the Lands Tribunal. That would give the Minister unfair leverage in his negotiations with claimants. We want an assurance from the Minister that he will agree to arbitration, if the various parties cannot settle. A similar amendment was tabled in Committee for the private Member's Bill presented by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle). At that time, the Government said that, as a general principle, a formal judicial process was more effective than informal arbitration, although they did undertake to reconsider their position. We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about the slightly changed wording proposed in the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Again, I declare an interest, as one of the two Members who are chartered surveyors. As such, I would be likely to be affected by the amendment. It is more common for a lands tribunal to consist of three chartered surveyors, so there will be lots of work for chartered surveyors either way-three sets of fees, instead of one. I might, therefore, be expected to argue in favour of the Lands Tribunal, but, as it happens, I intend to argue the opposite case.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire ably pointed out the difficulty with the Lands Tribunal. The tribunal is a highly expert body that exists to decide on difficult cases, but I do not think that these cases will be all that difficult. It would not, by any means, be beyond the scope of a single chartered surveyor. He will, by virtue of the fact that he has been appointed by the president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, be a chartered surveyor of some years' standing and will have some specialism in such cases. That would be a more rapid and cheaper solution for the Government and the fur farmer who is claiming compensation. As is common in legal agreements, the case could go to arbitration initially and, if, for any of the reasons laid down in statute, the matter cannot be determined by the arbitrator, it will go to the Lands Tribunal. That is common practice in landlord and tenant agreements.

<P>
It would be perfectly satisfactory to have an arbitrator doing the job, in most of the cases that will arise under the Bill. That would involve less cost for the Government and for the fur farmer who has to pay not only the costs of his advisers-although he will be able to recover those-but the cost of the arbitration. That is a win-win situation; there is less cost and it is a quicker process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The amendment is unnecessary. The Bill provides a choice between arbitration and the Lands Tribunal. I agreed to consider that issue, following our discussions in Committee for the Bill presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Garston, and we incorporated it into this Bill. Individuals can choose, and there is no need to delete the reference to the Lands Tribunal, because people are not obliged to go to it; they can choose arbitration.

<P>
With all due respect to the hon. Member for Cotswold, who is, I am sure, a cost-effective, bargain chartered surveyor, I must say that arbitration is not necessarily cheaper or quicker than the Land Tribunal; arbitration can be slow and expensive. The Bill leaves parties that choice. I received the impression from the previous debate that people would prefer to go through mutually agreed arbitration rather than through the Lands Tribunal, and I accept that. Therefore, that choice exists, but the Lands Tribunal remains as a fallback.

<P>
My final point is that the Lands Tribunal can deal with points of law, which the arbitrator cannot do. Again, people have the choice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Can the Minister clarify the arbitration referred to in subsection (4)(b)? Who would carry out that arbitration? We have suggested a nominee of the president of the RICS. Whom would the Minister recommend? Do the Government intend to hold people to the wire for nine months before pushing them, perhaps kicking and screaming, into the Lands Tribunal's arms?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> To go to arbitration is a decision agreed by both parties, and I cannot foresee circumstances in which the Government would refuse to go to arbitration. It is for the individuals concerned to decide whether they want to go to arbitration on that basis. If my memory serves me right, the person who chairs the arbitration must be acceptable to both sides. In that case the RICS president could, and normally does, appoint the arbiter, as the amendment suggests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> As I said in my opening remarks on the amendments, this is perhaps the most important part of the Bill after clause 1, which dealt with the prohibition of activities whereby farmers raise animals solely and primarily for their fur. It is the biggest concern of those involved in the industry, and it is a concern that remains because they are unfamiliar with the way in which legislation is written. Moreover, although we have debated the Bill for some hours now, it is still not clear what elements of the businesses should be taken into consideration when agreement is sought on the appropriate level of compensation.

<P>
The Minister was a little touchy earlier when I talked about ducking and weaving. I did not imply that he had been ducking and weaving up till now. He has been very straight on this business. He speaks with integrity, and I respect his resolve to honour the commitments given on compensation. We are not arguing about the commitment to compensation, but about the amount of compensation and a system for paying it fairly to those involved. That is where the difference of view and interpretation, if any, has arisen.

<P>
I have already said that I accept the Minister's comments regarding the enabling nature of the clause. There is some merit in leaving the wording fairly flexible, so that during the consultation period-I welcome the Minister's assurance that it will be proper consultation and that he will have regard to the representations made to him by those in the industry-he will ensure that the compensation covers as many as possible of the aspects that we have discussed. We can only hope that during the consultation period the Government will take into account land, buildings, equipment, livestock and good will-although I agree with the Minister that defining good will is very difficult, and enters the equation only if one is prepared to value a business on the basis that it is a going concern.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
That takes me back to my earlier point. The real value of a fur farming business-albeit that it will in future be illegal-is its value on the open market between a willing seller and a willing buyer. That will, indeed, take good will into account as part of the value of the business. It will also involve some consideration of income. We have not homed in on income during today's debates; we shall consider it at a later stage. The Minister has given an assurance that he will consider compensation for income in the course of consultation with the industry. That is welcome. However, we may need to test the matter further by tabling more specific amendments.

<P>
During debate on the amendments, the Minister said that he would look carefully at any discrepancy that arose out of the consultation process in terms of evaluating the values of such businesses. The figure in the explanatory notes is, according to the Minister, the result of research by his staff. That figure, even including income, is a maximum of £1.6 million, yet the full value of fur farming businesses in this country is-although we do not know the exact figure-much more than that.

<P>
Given that large discrepancy, we welcome the Minister's commitment to use independent assessors and advisers to work with the industry to calculate a more meaningful figure. I cannot remember his exact words, but he said that that would have to be taken on board at the appropriate time. I wish him luck in his negotiations with the Treasury for the extra money, or in finding it from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food budget, which is, as we know, already stretched in several directions.

<P>
Will the Minister spell out what he meant by independent advice? My understanding is that it should involve people outside his Ministry, such as members of the RICS, valuers and auctioneers, and people associated with the fur farming business who know about the details of running such operations. I would be most upset if it transpired that so-called independent advice was not quite so independent and included several people directly or indirectly employed by his Ministry.

<P>
As I said, we welcome the part of the clause that refers to consultation, and are pleased with the Minister's assurances that he will have due regard to the representations that are made to him. However, we have not discussed the timetable for the consultation process, and it would be helpful if the Minister would comment on that. Does he envisage beginning consultation before the Bill hits the statute book, or will he go by the letter of the law and wait until the Bill receives Royal Assent?

<P>
I should have thought-this point was raised by my hon. Friends-that there is a case for contact to be made with the industry before the Bill becomes law, so that headings can be set up that focus the minds of both sides on the key issues involved in the calculation of compensation. It would reassure the industry and would help us to prepare for Report if we knew what the main headings and the compensation were likely to be. I know that that was asked for when the private Member's Bill was introduced, but nothing was done before Report.

<P>
We have accepted the Minister's advice that the Lands Tribunal will be a backstop and that there is no alternative to it, but the Minister has also concluded that it is a long and often expensive process. We hope that many compensation claims will be settled and satisfied long before the end of the period set out in subsection (4).

<P>
I want to return to a point that I made in my opening remarks on clause 1 that is relevant to this stand part debate. I referred to the opposition in Europe from all the legal fur farming operations in countries such as Denmark, Spain and France, many of which have made submissions. France, as we know, is expecting a response from the Government. When does the Minister intend to make that response. Is it in the pipeline, or has it been delayed? My worry is that European producers, who see the Bill as a direct attack on their own legal operations, will take the matter to the highest level of the European Court. Could that, in the Minister's interpretation of events, delay the implementation of the Bill? If there is any possibility that the Bill might not become law until the legal machinations in the European Court have been concluded, which would not be a matter of weeks or months, but could drag on for a year or two, where will that leave the industry?

<P>
Given that period of limbo, I cannot imagine our own fur farmers investing in their businesses. They want, in the main, to negotiate sensible compensation and get out. It is not just because they think that the Government will get the Bill through because of their large majority, which is inevitable; many of them have had enough of the terrorism that they face from animal rights agitators, who visit them frequently and use methods of terror that we all deprecate but do little to stop. The fur farmers have had enough of that and want out.

<P>
I am concerned that there may be a delay in making the Bill operative, which includes the negotiations on and finalisation of all the compensation payments. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us that he sees no reason why all the measures in the Bill, particularly those relating to compensation, cannot be finalised within an appropriate time scale, and certainly before
 1 January 2003. However, I fear that hold-ups may adversely affect fur-producing farmers, who might find that the question of compensation is put on the back burner until the process is finalised in Europe.

<P>
Our main thrust is to ensure that the Government honour their commitment to fair and appropriate compensation for producers, but given existing figures of between £400,000 and £1.6 million we doubt whether that commitment can be met. In discussing the clause earlier today, my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) said that compensation of about £400 per breeding female was recently paid to an Austrian producer. We received details on that case from the European Furbreeders Association. There was no basis for making calculations according to the headings that we have discussed today, but a figure of 4.7 million Austrian schillings was agreed in respect of 600 breeding females. At a reasonable conversion rate of, say, 21 schillings to the pound, that equals between £390 and £400 per breeding female.

<P>
That is a sensible level of compensation, and a benchmark that the Government would be ill advised to ignore. There are 11 producers and 13 fur farmers in this country whom the Government are planning to put out of business. There are about 25,000 breeding females in this country. At compensation of £400 a head, the figure of £10 million-which I have mentioned more than once-is reached. Such a figure is likely to be fair and reasonable, rather than the £1.6 million compensation that the Government think appropriate. The massive discrepancy between those two figures is staring the Government and this Committee in the face, and there is nothing in the clause to reassure fur farmers that they will receive a sum nearer to £10 million than £1.6 million. On income, there are no guarantees; only today has the Minister said that he will take that into account in the consultation process.

<P>
We have serious doubts, but I reiterate that we accept the Minister's integrity and commitment to providing compensation. As he said, the Government do not need to do this, but they are using the provision to bolster their moral argument for criminalising an activity that is legal elsewhere in Europe. They have said that the real reason for this legislation is the public morality issue. They have balanced that with the moral case for paying fair and adequate compensation, and we want to ensure that such compensation is indeed fair and adequate. Our doubts remain, and we shall revisit the issue of compensation at a later stage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I hope that you will indulge me, Mr. Sayeed, for I fear that I might stray out of order. I want to probe the question of the timetable, on which my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire touched. However, in doing so I should like to refer not only to clause 5(6) but clause 7, and I hope that you will allow me to widen the debate in that way.

<P>
Under clause 7, clause 5 will come into force two months after Royal Assent. If the Bill receives Royal Assent at the end of July, the Minister will probably require six months of consultation and negotiation with the Treasury.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Three.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I hope that the Minister is right, but I suspect that three months of consultation, consideration of the outcome of that consultation and negotiations with the Treasury will not be completed within three months-especially given that Parliament will be in recess over the summer. I suspect that the process will continue until Christmas.

<P>
Under clause 5(6), having made a decision about the compensation scheme, the Minister must lay a statutory instrument that will be subject to the negative resolution procedure in both Houses of Parliament. That will probably take another three months, which will take us to March or April next year. Under clause 7, it will be illegal to own fur farming animals after 1 January 2003, so there will be less than two years in which to agree the outcomes of the consultation. That does not allow much time to appoint an arbitrator, to obtain statements of case and to seek the views of expert witnesses.

<P>
If fur farming is to continue to be a legal activity in some European countries, it would seem to make sense for our breeders simply to transfer or sell their operations. Will the Minister confirm that that will be possible? If so, it will minimise compensation claims to the Government, bearing in mind that it is a fundamental tenet of compensation claims that the claimant should seek to minimise his claim.

<P>
Will the Minister also confirm that if a breeder sold his breeding animals in Europe he would still be able to claim compensation under the other available avenues-good will, loss of income, demolition of buildings and fees for arbitration?

<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson (North Shropshire):</B> I shall be brief because I should like to hear the Minister's reply.

<P>
The closure of a viable industry that is permitted in other parts of the European Union sets a major precedent. It is critical, therefore, that compensation is fair and adequate. I am sure that the Minister received the same letter as I did from the NFU, in which it urges
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>MPs to satisfy themselves that the Government will ensure that the arrangements for the winding down of this sector and for compensating those who face the loss of their livelihoods are fair and adequate.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I take on board the Minister's comment that the clause is an enabling measure and I understand his intention, but there is still a major difference between us. The clause is drafted sufficiently wide that it could cover all aspects of a business, which is what Conservative Members want, but it does not impose on those who will enforce the regulations the need to do so.

<P>
We have moved on from the argument-perhaps to return to it later-of changing ``may'' to ``shall''. We made progress with the Minister on establishing that income can be considered. However, it is unsatisfactory to find, on reading the famous explanatory notes, that they talk about ifs, perhaps and were to bes. It is up to us, as Members of Parliament, to make sure that, to those who will have to work out the details of the compensation schemes, the Bill is absolutely clear about those elements that must be taken into consideration. It is not good enough to leave the clause as it is. In addition, a huge gulf remains between the Government and the Opposition in respect of the sums of money to be calculated.

<P>
I hope that there is time before Report for the Minister to consider our arguments. It is important that the elements of the business are itemised. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, the whole business must be taken into account. It might have taken 40 years to build up such a business, to gather good will and make marketing contacts; all those activities are key to a business. Land, buildings, equipment, stock, and the generations of breeding that have gone into stock quality are not all that is important; we must ensure that we compensate for the nature of the business itself and, above all, for income.

<P>
It is vital that income is built into the Bill-we cannot leave that to MAFF officials who go out to the regions to discuss such matters with the farmers. I liked the Minister's comments about consultation, but it must be incumbent on the Government to have clear instructions written into the Bill, so that the MAFF officials know exactly what they should be calculating, before haggling it out with the farmers themselves.

<P>
Currently, the only definite commitment I can perceive is the £400,000, which might become £1.6 million. Against that, we can put the figures that we flushed out during debate. We have the figure of £2.6 million, which is the costing produced by a Danish company for setting up a plant from scratch. We also have a figure of 4.7 million Austrian schillings, which comprises 7,833 schillings for each of the 600 breeding females on the Austrian farm. We have the cool £100,000 cost of taking down sheds to avoid paying rates on processing sheds. Therefore, we are a country mile away from the figures quoted in the explanatory notes.

<P>
I should like the Minister to tell us what discussions he has not had with the Treasury-he did not answer that question earlier. As things stand, the Treasury will run rings around him and his Ministry on the issue of paying proper compensation. Treasury officials will go straight to the explanatory notes and say, ``You talked about £400,000, possibly rising to £1.6 million-no one dreamed of figures like those in the Austrian example. Sorry, boys, the deal's off-you go and sort it out''. Alternatively, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, they will say, ``Take the money from another MAFF budget.'' I certainly do not want my farmers in North Shropshire suffering because we failed to do our job properly in Committee and on Report.

<P>
There are fundamental issues to be addressed. There is the issue of compensation for an on-going business, the issue of giving those who are going to work out the details of the compensation in their consultation with the industry clear instructions to include all the elements of running a business, and, finally, the issue to be worked out with the Treasury of how much is to be allotted and from which budget to pay off those unfortunate people.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I shall try to deal with some of the points raised. First, I stress that clause 5 imposes a duty on the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and enables the National Assembly for Wales by order to make a scheme for paying compensation to persons who incur losses as a result of discontinuing of fur farming because of the ban coming into force. That differs from the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Garston. When that Bill was under consideration, people asked what duty there was to provide a compensation scheme, and the Government have accepted that there should be a duty to produce such a scheme. That is why there will be consultation on the nature of the scheme. However, I must stress-I think that it has been accepted-that the Bill is an enabling measure and that the detail of the scheme will be in a statutory instrument following consultation.

<P>
I take the point that some fur farmers may want to get out of the business as quickly as possible; I understand that point. I utterly condemn any intimidation or illegal activity that may influence people to do so. That is wholly unacceptable and the Government will of course enforce the law whenever people are caught breaking it. Although the winding-down period stretches until 2003, I recognise that some people may want to get out of the sector before that. Indeed, because of that, I want the scheme to be introduced as quickly as possible in order to assist people.

<P>
I might add that there is nothing to stop farmers winding down their businesses immediately if they so choose. Disposing of their stock will not preclude them from the compensation scheme. It would certainly be legal to sell breeding animals-abroad, for example-in the winding-down period, although farmers would not be able to claim compensation for the livestock because they would have received money for it. After the winding-down period, of course, it would be illegal to have those animals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether he feels that the sale of stock in the interim period before 2003 is feasible and practicable for those in the fur farming industry? Could they sell their stock to breeders, in say, Denmark and France? Is there a market for such trade, or are we talking hypothetically?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I was asked only about the principle of whether farmers could sell in the winding-down period, and the answer is yes. I do not know whether there is a market. That would depend on market conditions and whether people wanted to buy. I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question; that is an issue for the market and the farmers.

<P>
It will take a couple of months to get the draft consultation up and running. We then envisage a two-month consultation and approximately a month following that for internal consultation. Although I would want the process to be as speedy as possible, it cannot start until the Bill becomes law. The Bill provides the power to introduce the scheme. However, I would have thought that some preparation work could be done in the Department once the Bill had completed all its stages but before it had received Royal Assent, in order that the scheme was up and running as quickly as possible. I must emphasise that, without the Bill, there will be no power to introduce the scheme, consult or do anything else.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On that time scale, it looks as though the two-month consultation will be in August and September. That is a holiday period and will not give people a great deal of time to get advice and submit their responses. Will the Minister take that into account when he is fixing the timetable?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> Yes, I will certainly take that into account; I do not want to be unreasonable. My reading of the situation is that people would prefer speedy consultation and action, but I would not want people to feel that they were allocated a short period. Two months is an average time. It might fall in the holidays, but that will depend on when the Bill receives Royal Assent. We cannot quite predict that. It will depend on its progress.

<P>
On the question of talks with the treasury and funding, I want to make it clear again that we do not accept that the Austrian Government's figure is relevant. We have no idea of the basis of that calculation, of the Austrian Government's motivation or of the relevance of the cost of starting a fur farm. Hon. Members should not think that there is a benchmark because we certainly do not accept that figure.

<P>
Independent valuations will be conducted not by Ministry staff, but by independent valuers who will talk with farmers about capital and income streams before reporting back to the Ministry. Those professionals can be sent out to farms as quickly as possible, and almost immediately after Royal Assent. That will certainly happen in August and September. Once the details have been returned to us, we shall construct a scheme on which we shall consult. Our proposed time scale implies movement as quickly as possible. Once all the necessary stages have been passed, we shall begin our preparation work, but it would be wrong to do so before the Bill comes into force.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have, of course, held discussions with Treasury, which would not have allowed us to publish a Bill, including a figure, without its approval. We will consider carefully whether the figure might have to be varied. I stress that our figures will be identified using mechanisms of the type accepted for similar situations. We feel that our figure is broadly right, but if some adjustment is required, we shall consider it carefully following the valuations. We are confident that the provision that we have made for compensation will be adequate once those calculations have been made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am slightly confused by the timetable that the Minister has outlined. It seems that valuers will go to farms before consultation is complete. [
Interruption.] That is what the Minister said. If I am not correct in that, I should be grateful if the Minister would explain.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I shall try to clarify the point. Valuers would go out to the farms before consultation starts because putting the draft scheme together will require some idea from the valuers of income streams, fixed costs and capital. The valuers will go out, and, when they report back to the Ministry, we shall draw up the scheme and send it out for consultation.

<P>
I was asked whether a challenge in the courts would delay compensation. We are confident that the scheme is compatible with European law and the European court of human rights. Our lawyers checked that point carefully as the Bill was drafted. We are confident that it would withstand a challenge, and we do not expect any delay in the scheme or the payment of compensation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I may be being obtuse, but I should like to probe the point a little further. A valuer works for a client. If the valuers will work for the Government, they will seek to minimise the value paid to the fur farmers. If they work for the fur farmers, they will advise the farmers to make submissions during the consultation process for this, that or the other compensation. We must be clear on whom the valuers will work for and what their role will be. To me, it would be more correct to consult first on what the fur farmers want. They could then consult their own professional valuers, if they wished to do so. The Minister could examine the results of that consultation, and then decide what valuation regime should be put in place. The Minister appears to be doing it the wrong way round, and I am not sure how that will work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I think that he is offering a recipe for long delays. Of course individual fur farmers are free to consult their own valuers and professional advisers. The valuers in question would be independent of MAFF, although they would work for it. Their remit would be to make objective valuations. The hon. Gentleman suggests that people should make their bids and consult afterwards, but it would be better to have an objective assessment using recognised criteria and to consult after that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Objective criteria are all well and good, but who sets them? Who will decide the heads of agreement? Will MAFF give the independent advisers a steer? Will it tell them, ``We have agreed the sum of £1.6 million with the Treasury, so for goodness sake don't include anything in the scheme that will take us over that figure''? I understand that the independent valuers will be directed by MAFF because it is setting up the scheme, but will they start with a clean page to ensure that they devise a compensation scheme that is fair for fur farmers?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The valuers certainly will not be instructed to draw up a scheme within the maximum of £1.6 million. Our professional advisers suggested that figure. They will primarily assess farm assets and look at the books. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the objective criteria for the writing off of capital, for incomes and for land values. When the valuers have reported to MAFF, we shall put the scheme out for consultation, at which point people may ask how calculations were made and we shall take their responses into account.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have a brief question for the Minister. Why does not the Bill apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> It is because of devolution. The Scottish Parliament is proposing its own measure in parallel with the Bill, and the Northern Ireland Assembly will have the opportunity to do the same. The suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly made day-to-day consultation difficult, but I am glad to say that it is now back in action and I am sure that it will want to take comparable measures.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister ensure a seamless compensation scheme in Scotland and Northern Ireland? It would be unfair if different schemes were to apply

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I would if there were any fur farms there!

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Bill apply to dependent territories such as the Falkland Islands?

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is all very well to say that we have devolved powers to introduce Bills such as this to the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly, but what will happen if the Northern Ireland Assembly does not want to impose a ban on fur farming? If it decides not to do so, a loophole will be created whereby fur farmers will be able to move there and set up business. The alternative is that the Minister will dictate what the Assembly should do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> The very nature of devolution is that people make their own decisions and decide their own priorities. Theoretically, the Northern Ireland Assembly could decide not to introduce its own measure and fur farmers could move to Northern Ireland or to the Republic of Ireland. However, there is little incentive for them to do so because of land borders. I suspect that the Northern Ireland Assembly will want to bring its laws in line with ours and will want to ensure that Northern Ireland does not experience the environmental and other problems associated with fur farming.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill to the House.

<P>
<B>Mr. Morley:</B> I should like to say a word of thanks to you, Mr. Sayeed, for chairing the Committee-I am delighted that it has proceeded so smoothly. Members of the Committee made many valuable points, which I tried to answer directly; I also tried to respond to amendments in the spirit in which they were tabled.

<P>
We recognise that issues remain about compensation for affected farmers. That is why, from the start, we have accepted the principle of compensation, even though there were alternatives, such as raising standards to a level that would be extremely difficult to attain. Some Conservative Members argued that we should do just that-simply bankrupt people without taking into account the impact on them. Nevertheless, I thank all members of the Committee, especially those on the Government Benches, who have given valuable and valiant support. I hope that the Bill continues to meet such a reasonable, thoughtful and constructive attitude as it goes through the rest of its parliamentary stages.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> May I associate myself with the Minister's comments about your professional chairmanship of our proceedings, Mr. Sayeed? We have had a good run for our money and a good debate. I thank the Minister for his constructive response to many of the issues that we raised. He has not satisfied all our concerns, especially those relating to compensation, which I am sure we shall revisit. I thank my colleagues for their contributions, voluble and otherwise. No doubt the debate will continue.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Now, I thank the members of the Committee and Elizabeth Payne, our Clerk.
