</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin the debate on clause 2, I must tell the Committee that the clause is infinitely more precise in its wording than clause 1, which was more wide ranging. The amendments tabled to clause 2 are also more precise. I therefore propose to confine the debates more rigidly to the matter of the amendments, and, depending on how the debate progresses, to permit a clause stand part debate at the end of the debates on the two amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton </B>(Congleton): I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 14, leave out 'suffering from' and insert 'with a'.<P>

<P>
The amendment is a simple, housekeeping measure designed to tidy up clause 2, in that it proposes leaving out "suffering from" and inserting "with a". It would simplify and clarify the Bill, and remove any possible ambiguity that might have been caused by the words "suffering from". The question whether a patient is suffering from any mental or physical illness could be open to interpretation. The amendment would remove any ambiguity, and I trust that the Committee will ensure that it is passed.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 16, leave out 'the provision of'.<P>

<P>
This is a similar amendment, in that it is brief and easily understandable. It is designed to simplify and clarify the Bill, and to remove any ambiguity that may be caused by the words "the provision of". A key principle of the Bill is that nutrition and hydration do not constitute medical treatment. There has been much debate about that, both on Second Reading and, earlier today, in Committee. The amendment is designed to focus on the essential elements of that principle, and to remove any question that may be raised about the use or interpretation of the words "the provision of".
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Dr. Brian Iddon </B>(Bolton, South-East): I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 20, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'at the end of one month beginning with'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 5, in page 1, line 20, leave out 'one month' and insert 'six months'.
<P>
No. 6, in page 1, line 20, leave out 'month' and insert 'year'.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> These are probing amendments, designed to discover whether hon. Members are happy with the time scales involved. I understand that it is usual for a Bill to be enacted within a month, once it has completed its passage through Parliament. However, because so many people would be affected by this Bill, we decided to probe the possibilities of both a shorter and a much longer period of time.
<P>
I have tabled the amendments to generate a discussion. I am happy with the period of a month, but I believe that hon. Members will welcome the opportunity to discuss the question of time scales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Joe Ashton </B>(Bassetlaw): I have tabled one of the amendments in the group. You have caught me on the hop, Mr. Gale. I did not expect the Committee to reach this stage of the proceedings quite so quickly.
<P>
We must consider the consequences of the Bill that would arise not only immediately after an accident, but in the long term, for which hospitals would have to prepare. There was a full investigation of the doctor's dilemma in The Sunday Telegraph. It went into the Bland case in great detail. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There are estimated to be some 600 or 700 new cases of this in Britain every year, with 1500 to 2000 such cases alive at any one time. Each has the prospect of filling a hospital bed, and their relatives' lives, for many years: the longest term is 36 years, according to the Guinness Book of Records."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That can mean many thousands of people existing perpetually in a coma, as Tony Bland did. He was kept alive for three or four years. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The open-eyed, spastic, persistent vegetative state Tony Bland is in is different from a true coma--the sleep-like state that is assessed worldwide according to Professor Bryan Jennett's Glasgow Coma Scale."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Professor Bryan Jennett is an acknowledged expert in deep coma. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Many people recover from deep coma, but they will do so in weeks rather than months. Those who are left vegetative open their eyes in a few days or weeks."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are not in a coma forever--they can keep opening their eyes, but cannot communicate. Professor Jennett continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Understandably relatives may cling on to hope, particularly after reading newspaper reports of car crash victims who seem to wake up at the sound of a favourite Jason Donovan tape".
<P>
A picture from a film that victims had enjoyed in the past has also worked. Such people can recover from the coma; there is no doubt about that. However, Professor Jennett said:
<P>
"when we hear of people emerging from comas after a long period, it may be because they were in a viral or drug-induced state, or they may have suffered an injury to the brain and either the injured part has recovered, or another part has taken over some of its functions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although such people come round, they will probably be severely disabled for the rest of their lives. Professor Jennett commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No one has ever come out of a year-long coma, although they have perhaps come out of one very slowly over the course of a year."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Tony Bland suffered a severe head injury combined with damage caused by lack of oxygen, when he was squashed for perhaps 20 minutes against a metal barrier. He could not get on to the pitch at Hillsborough to escape the crush, people were running down the tunnel in hundreds and thousands, some of whom were intoxicated--not the victims but those who came in late when the doors were opened and who did not have tickets--and he was subjected to a long persistent crush. The article in the The Sunday Telegraph also quoted an anaesthetist, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Within 24 hours tests may show such that such a person is brain dead. In the UK this is equated with the patient's death; we are legally entitled to diagnose death and switch off the ventilator. But if the patient is breathing unaided, he is not brain dead. The cortex of the brain is damaged, unable to function in a normal, human way, without hearing, sight or thought processes--but the primitive systems are maintained. This is the persistent vegetative state."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nobody has ever come out of that state after a year. Tony Bland's neurologist commented on the cruel emotional and legal limbo for the patients' families. Parents suffer distress as they see their children grow older--Tony Bland was only 18 at the time. Their children are unable to recognise them. Such parents will know that this Bill could keep their children in such a state until they are 50 or 60 years old. Mr. Gale, I was about to say, "God in heaven", but how inhuman that must be! Does the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) not realise the effect of the Bill on families who, year in and year out, have to visit relatives who are living in a vegetative state?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Trend </B>(Windsor): I accept that Tony Bland's family, and others who cared for him, must have been hugely distressed, but it is a delicate balance. The distress and desperation of such people must be considered alongside the distress of those people who believe that their relatives are being allowed to die of starvation as a result of the Bland judgment, or who have evidence that that is the case. Good and bad can be found on both sides of the argument in this context. We believe that, although the suffering of the Bland family was a high price to pay, it is outweighed by the suffering and anxiety of all the people who are concerned that the Bland judgment led to a form of compulsory euthanasia.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, that would mean that we were playing God. There is one problem for such families. At any one time, 300,000 people are terminally ill. Nottingham has a population of about 300,000 people. Those figures have not been challenged, although they are constantly changing and will probably rise. If the amendment is agreed to, adequate provisions will not be available to deal with the one-month requirement. Hospitals will have to take budgeting and financial decisions, and, for example, decide whether such people should be kept together in one unit. Adequate preparations cannot be made in one month.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that 300,000 people in the United Kingdom might at any one time be suffering from terminal illness. Most of those people will be treated in hospices or in their own homes with the help of Macmillan nurses or others who are experienced in palliative care. Those patients would not appreciate it if they had to be put down, so to speak, for inconvenience or for other reasons. The best response to the fact that so many people are terminally ill is to improve and increase palliative care. The situation in Holland shows what happens when one goes down the slippery slope. I accept that, sadly, we may have to  say no in a few hard cases, but we do so in the best interests of the majority, including those 300,000 patients, whose care will not be altered if the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Lady referred to Holland--it is always dragged into such debates. Whenever that country is mentioned, I always think of Green and Orange, Catholic and Protestant, and arguments that go back 300 years. We should not let that example colour our approach.
<P>
The hon. Lady never discusses the rights of the patient. We are told about a doctor's right to save a life, but what about the terminally ill patient who has had enough? He is not in a position to get out of his bed, go down to the chemist and buy 10 bottles of aspirin. He cannot throw himself under a bus, tie a tube to a car and gas himself in a garage or drown himself. Suicide has not been a crime since 1961, but assisted suicide is a crime, and that is what frightens doctors. I know that the hon. Lady will disagree, but I believe that a person has a right over his own life. Likewise, in relation to abortion, what happens inside a woman's body is her business and no one else's. What happens to the life of a patient who is terminally ill is his business. It is for him and for no one else--not the state or the legal system--to decide when it should be ended.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I said, Mr. Ashton, that this was a fairly narrow amendment, and I should be grateful if you would try to stick to it. We are discussing the introduction and operation of the Bill and the time scale within which that will occur.
<P>
4.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> The hon. Lady enticed me, Mr. Gale.
<P>
This is a fascinating subject, and it is terrible that we do not debate it at length on the Floor of the House. It is a major problem that is always beset by political or religious beliefs. Even the media ignore it. No one wants to touch it because it involves death.
<P>
The Bill will have consequences, but nowhere does it state that it will cost money. My understanding is that a private Member's Bill should not impose cash costs on the Exchequer, the taxpayer or anyone else, but this Bill will certainly cost a great deal of money. In The Lancet, the Institute of Medical Ethics' working party said that the cost to the state of Missouri--as we know, different American states have different laws--of its refusal to allow one of its citizens to die would be about £75,000 a year.
<P>
It costs much more to support a vegetative patient in an American hospital, but according to 1993 figures it costs more than £12,000 a year to support a vegetative patient in a British hospital. The hon. Member for Congleton will say that that is why some would want to switch off 49 50 the machine, which would be a cruel way of looking at the matter, but the fact is that the Bill will cost millions of pounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andy King </B>(Rugby and Kenilworth): The hon. Gentleman is not really speaking to this Bill. He is proposing a euthanasia Bill, but the Government have made it clear that they will never accept euthanasia. Moreover, it sounds as if the hon. Gentleman is trying to put a price on human life, but we in this country respect human life and put it above cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> The hon. Gentleman was not here this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. King:</B> I was in a Select Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman missed two and a half hours of good debate, and he should decide whether he wants to participate in the Select Committee or this Committee. He has produced a simplistic argument, and he should listen a little more. I shall not get into arguments on euthanasia, because we have answered them. We are talking about people who may want to die; that is not the same thing as euthanasia.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh </B>(Bradford, West): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> No. I shall continue. We are talking now about whether the health service, doctors and others should be given much more time than a month to analyse the Bill. As I said, it costs £12,000 a year to support a vegetative patient in a British hospital. In the American case to which I referred, the mother said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My son died at the roadside, but the funeral was six years later."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such circumstances will arise if the Bill is enacted. It would be ridiculous to try to enforce the Bill within a month of its enactment and expect it to be workable.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I rise to probe the amendment a little further. The argument is that the Bill will provide insufficient time between enactment and enforcement. As I understand it, those who are currently in hospital or residential homes are already cared for, so it is not a question of having sufficient time to establish care. I understand that greater warning might be required, but the medical fraternity, nurses and those in health trusts are already aware that the Bill is before the House. We must wait and see whether the Bill will be enacted, but it is not necessary that extra time be allowed for people to make provisions.
<P>
I understand the argument that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) advanced. He kept returning to it with what I was led to believe, when I was elected to this House, was tedious repetition. I must therefore be careful not to follow him down that road. Strange things happen in the United States. Earlier in the debate, I told the non-fictional story of a woman who had brain damage. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw referred to the specialist who decided that there were different types of people--
<P>
4.51 pm
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>5.6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> Before the Division, I was acknowledging that doctors had their own ways of defining brain damage and vegetative conditions, and I would not argue about that. However, I referred to the case of a woman in the United States whose condition reached a stage such that her husband could not visit her, because he could not bear to see her in that condition. She suffered the indignity of knowing everything that was happening, being mistreated by care staff, including being washed with a hose, and hearing people ask, "Why keep such a person alive?", until a nurse noticed that her eyes were responding. The woman began to communicate through her eyes, and the nurse began to put pressure on the physicians.
<P>
To cut a long story short, as a result of proper treatment and care, the woman recovered, but she never saw her child grow up and could not even be at the child's wedding. Her husband, in the meantime, had divorced her, adding to her problem. If we were to act on the suggestions of some in the medical profession, and if those who oppose the Bill were to succeed, the lives of people such as that women would be terminated, and the medical fraternity would say that it was done for their and their families' own good.
<P>
I do not believe that that is an isolated case, and, as far as I can tell, it is not connected with the case about a month ago in which a patient recovered several years, having had a clot on her brain as a result of childbirth. When she recovered, she startled the nursing attendant by saying, "You shouldn't be touching me like that." It has been argued that a period of one month or two months is not relevant because it will not allow time to deal with such people. We are already dealing with such people in our hospitals and institutions.
<P>
We live in a world in which increasingly more people know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. We must restore a sense of value. How can one value an individual and the whole family circle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> If the hon. Gentleman recalls, I did not criticise the cost of the care. I said that private Member's Bills were not supposed to cost the taxpayer money, but that this Bill would. I am not a parliamentary Clerk, but I believe that that is out of order. I did not quibble about the cost of keeping people in hospital.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I appreciate that you have not ruled the Bill out of order, Mr. Gale, and have said that it will incur expenses. Nor did Madam Speaker rule it out of order when it was discussed on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Forgive me for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but it might be for the convenience of the Committee if I now place on the record the fact that the terms of the Bill are in order.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
We are discussing people who are terminally ill. As the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) said earlier, such people may be living with cancer, not dying. Given modern medical technology, we can be thankful that many diseases that, in the past, were terminal do not have the same impact as they once had. For example, let us consider the scourge of tuberculosis or small pox. We cannot base our arguments on the fact that so many people are terminally ill.
<P>
As for the cost to the health service, have we examined fully the cost of the mistakes made by the medical fraternity and the compensation payments that have been settled out of court? To what might we be leaving ourselves open if we did not pass the Bill into law and a physician or nurse, believing that he or she was acting in the best interests of a patient, made the wrong decision and the patient's family sued for loss? The argument cuts both ways. I am against the amendment and support the clause as it is drafted.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Yvette Cooper):</B> The probing amendments are useful. The Government's view is that the current one-month time scale would cause many problems, given that the Bill requires guidance to be given to professionals about their legal obligations, especially in view of the problems of interpretation to which 1 referred this morning. Understandably, professionals will be concerned about what such provisions mean for the decisions that they make, care under advance directives and respect for patients' decisions.
<P>
Given the need to provide professionals with guidance about the implications of the Bill for their legal obligations, a month would be a tight time scale. Certainly, if the Bill came into force immediately, that would cause many problems. The Government also consider that there is not much to choose between six months and 12 months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> The comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw are causing me great alarm. I am glad that you have put the record straight, Mr. Gale, but if the Bill would cost the health service millions of pounds, what is going on in this country? How many switches are being turned off? How many people have been killed by those decisions? If that is truly happening in this country today, the sooner the Bill comes into force, the better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I reiterate that I introduced the cost factor on a technical point of order. I accept the ruling and I am not challenging it. However, some private Members' Bills do not cost the Exchequer any money, but this one will. If it has been accepted by the Speaker and the Clerk's Office, it is perfectly valid. I want to put on record the fact that I did not quibble about the cost of medical care. I merely raised the technical point whether the Bill was in order. That is all.
<P>
5.15 pm
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> I support of a period of one month for enactment of the Bill. That period is quite long enough, notwithstanding the Minister's comments. It is sufficient because the Bill merely seeks to plug a loophole that was created in 1993 when, following the Bland case, the withdrawal of hydration and nutrition became established practice in this country. it is a simple measure to plug that loophole and to revert to the practice followed for many hundreds of years--according to which an act of omission, if the purpose was to kill, was the same as an act of commission.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bassetlaw mentioned some sensitive issues, which I should briefly like to address. He spoke about patients in coma-like states. He admitted that some patients come out of such comas, but if he had his way, such patients would be killed long before they had a chance to come round. He must examine that carefully.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bassetlaw also talked about the rights of patients to commit suicide. However, the statistics show that the terminally ill constitute the smallest number of suicides. Funnily enough, terminally ill people become more interested in life than in death. It is understandable that people who are clinically depressed--or just depressed--sometimes say that they wish someone would kill them, but they do not mean it for very long. The terminally ill have the power to kill themselves but, more often than not, they do not. Why not? They can use the gun; they control their own pain relief. But they do not.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> They are too ill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I am sorry, but there was a case in my own family just before Christmas in which this could have happened. It does not happen because people want to live until they are in the process of dying when, of course, they are no longer in control and when the doctor's duty is to ensure that the patient is as comfortable as possible and to kill the pain.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bassetlaw spoke about the Bland case and PVS. He seemed to suggest that PVS patients could be killed simply because they would otherwise occupy a hospital bed for a long time. He made it clear that he did not mind the NHS bearing the cost of such patients, but does he agree that when the NHS is so strapped for resources, it is very tempting to see certain groups of people off the face of the earth, relieving the national health service of a costly burden. Furthermore, PVS is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Many of those who have been diagnosed with the condition have come round and subsequently been declared not to be in a persistent vegetative state. It would be wrong to withdraw food and fluids from those in a persistent vegetative state, let alone those who are misdiagnosed and may have a real chance of recovery.
<P>
I accept head-on the criticism made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw in the context of the difficult Bland case and the attitude of his parents and family. It is an extremely hard cross to bear, almost the cruellest blow of all. However, what the hon. Gentleman proposes in his amendment would increase risks for patients, whether or not they are in a persistent vegetative state or coma.
<P>
Therefore, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. One month is an adequate period for GPs and hospital doctors to appreciate that the Bill reverts to pre-1993 law.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I have listened carefully to our extensive debate.
<P>
I listened most carefully to the hon. Member for Congleton, who argued that, in the eyes of the medical profession, things changed following the Bland judgment, although the Government did not change the law. Therefore, there is not a lot for the Government to reverse. Having listened to the debate I am happy with the period of a month specified in the Bill. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
No. 10, in page 1, line 22, leave out 'and Northern Ireland'.
<P>
No. 11, in page 1, line 22, leave out 'only'.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> These are probing amendments designed to ensure that we debate the consequences of enactment of the Bill. I tabled them for the following reasons.
<P>
When I was young, I found it ridiculous that marriage laws in Scotland were different from those in the rest of the United Kingdom, resulting in people crossing borders. People used to run to Gretna to get married, which was ludicrous. I also found it curious that the Irish Republic and United Kingdom had different abortion laws, which again resulted in people crossing borders. Of course, I could give many examples of two countries with a common border having different laws on certain matters.
<P>
As the Scottish Parliament is examining similar legislation at the moment, I am worried that we may reach a position in which Scotland has a different law from that pertaining in the rest of the United Kingdom. I therefore thought that it was right and proper for us to consider the matter this afternoon as part of the debate.
<P>
If Scotland voted in favour of euthanasia, patients who were pro-euthanasia could cross the border to have their lives terminated. The opposite could apply. If people who were against involuntary euthanasia were in danger in Scotland, they might get their relatives to transfer them over the border. It would be ludicrous if we had two Acts operating in different ways. I have moved the amendment to probe the matter and to open up the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I welcome what the hon. Member has said. Obviously, there will be many anomalies if Scotland is not included. I did a bit of research into this. The matter was raised extensively in both Houses when the Scotland Bill went through Parliament. Lord Steel proposed that legislation relating to abortion should be devolved. The Government resisted on the grounds that any variation between north and south of the border would lead to unacceptable cross-border traffic of women seeking the more liberal abortion legislation. The debate then moved to euthanasia. I am not in favour of euthanasia. Voluntary euthanasia is one thing, but euthanasia is something different. People always speak of euthanasia, never of voluntary euthanasia. I do not know anyone who is in favour of involuntary euthanasia, but the tag is thrown around, sometimes deliberately when voluntary euthanasia is being discussed.
<P>
Euthanasia has not been devolved to the Scottish Parliament for the simple reason that there is no legislation relating to euthanasia. There are no laws so it cannot be devolved to Scotland. Lord Sewell, speaking for the Govemment, confirmed that as a general principle criminal justice should be devolved from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament but that abortion would be exempted. When he was pressed by the Conservative party about euthanasia, he said that as there was no legislation relating to euthanasia it could not be devolved. He added that, if there was to be a separate body of legislation relating to euthanasia, the matter could be looked at again and decisions could be taken as to whether it should be devolved or reserved to Westminster.
<P>
If Scotland is not included, the law will be thrown into total confusion and chaos. I do not know why Scotland has been left out. If the hon. Gentleman wants to leave out England, Wales and Northern Ireland too, I will vote for that. It would be a good idea. But we have a separate set-up here. This is the Midlothian question that my old Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) has been asking for 25 years. Everyone in the Government knew about it. It was discussed many times, and no one thought that it would apply to private Member's Bills, but it does.
<P>
I am looking at the Hansard report of the Second Reading debate. One of the many protests that I made was that many of us on this side of the argument could not get called to speak. Many people with extensive knowledge such as doctors could not get called. But what do we find? That the hon. Member for Glasgow, Kelvin (Mr. Galloway) spoke for 40 minutes. He represents a Scottish seat, but he spoke for 40 minutes, when other hon. Members were trying desperately to speak. Then he voted. That poses the Midlothian question all over again.
<P>
The hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) flew down specially to vote against the closure. He has not been seen here very often--he comes down about once every three months to vote against the Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know that if he wishes to mount a personal attack against another hon. Member, he should, out of courtesy, give that hon. Member notice that he intends to do so. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman has not done so.
<P>
5.30 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> It would have been very difficult to do that. I did not know until this morning that I was going to say that and it would have been hard for the hon. Gentleman to get down from Falkirk in time.
<P>
Why is Scotland not included in the Bill? People obviously want to have some debate on it, to vote against it, and to press their case--there is a big and enthusiastic demand that Scotland should be included. Another issue that concerns me is a leaflet that has been handed out which states that on 4, 5 and 6 April there is to be a big lobby of the House in favour of the Bill. Thousands of leaflets are being given out all over Scotland, asking people to come here and badger their Members of Parliament to support the Bill. It says that people should come down from Scotland and should write to their Member of Parliament. A huge demonstration is being mounted in favour of the Bill.
<P>
I am not saying that the hon. Member for Congleton has not done her work, but while she may have consulted a lot of medical people, she has not consulted many politicians. The whole thing is a mess because we do not know whether it applies in Scotland. I advise the hon. Lady to accept my amendment, for her own sake. If she did so, all those enthusiastic people in Scotland would be able honestly to say that this was not an example of the Midlothian question and that they all support the Bill. That would put what would otherwise be a total mess in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Trend:</B> I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman has just said. I shall try hard not to be mischievous in the party political sense, but the amendment does pose questions to the Government. I should be very interested to know the Government's view. As I understand it, there is currently before the Scottish Parliament a piece of legislation called the Adults with Incapacity Bill, which includes within its scope proposals on the withdrawal and withholding of medical treatment and of nutrition and hydration. In other words, the Scottish Parliament is thinking along the same lines as this Parliament and is trying to refine the law on those matters.
<P>
However, we understand that the Scottish Executive have taken a different view from the British Government in that they have agreed to remove the definition of nutrition and hydration as medical treatment. As the Minister confirmed, the Government's view coincides with that of the courts that nutrition and hydration can be regarded as medical treatment--a view with which I do not agree. If the Scottish Executive take a different view, we may end up with two different laws, as both the hon. Member for Bassetlaw and the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) have pointed out. Are the Government content with the possibility of such a difference in the law or will they consult their partners in the Scottish Government and ask why they have taken the view that nutrition and hydration do not need to be seen as medical treatment? If the Government see nutrition and hydration as medical treatment--and therefore accept the legal logic of the Law Lords' judgment--they cannot sympathise with the Bill or any of its purposes. People in the country do not care about the cogitations and desperate mental exercises undertaken by judges, parliamentarians or doctors, as they trust those people less each year. They feel that nutrition and hydration--food and drink--are basic human rights that are not to be passed off as medical treatment and therefore as something that could be withdrawn to kill people.

<P>

<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> The Committee is clearly not the place to get into a detailed discussion of the Midlothian question. The matter is devolved to the Scottish Administration. The Bill deals with health care issues relating to the withdrawal of medical treatment and care, which are devolved. It is true that the United Kingdom Parliament retains legislative competence, even over devolved areas. However, the memorandum of understanding and supplementary agreements between the UK Government, Scottish Ministers and the Cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales record that the UK Parliament will not normally legislate on devolved matters, except with the agreement of the devolved legislatures. I am not aware that the Scottish Administration has been asked for or has given its approval to the amendment. For that reason, the Government cannot support it.
<P>
The logical consequence of devolution for such matters is that there could be different laws in England and Scotland. The Government embarked on the "Who Decides?" consultation, and strong views were expressed on both sides of the argument about artificial nutrition and hydration, which was why the Government decided that it was not appropriate to legislate on the matter at the time or to put the Bland decision into statute. Scotland will decide what it does on such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Trend:</B> I forget the name of the Lord who spoke about abortion law being a United Kingdom competence and uncertainty about euthanasia. Clearly, the Government have reached certainty about euthanasia and decided that it is a national responsibility. I do not quibble with that, but what about the hypothetical possibility that people could be moved across the border to get different treatment if the laws were different?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament to decide. Each Parliament must decide appropriately on devolved matters, so it is appropriate that the UK Parliament discusses the Bill but that the Scottish Parliament discusses its own Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I am happy to hear the Minister say that, and I welcome it. However, as I said, someone is distributing leaflets all over Scotland that state that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Time to stop euthanasia. Mass lobby of Parliament 4th, 5th and 6th April 2000. Human life is under threat throughout the United Kingdom...The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children invites"<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Bill does not affect Scotland, why is that lobby being organised? Who is misleading the public on a mammoth scale? People are going to come 350 miles to London to lobby us when the Bill does not cover Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> Although the hon. Member for Bassetlaw was generous enough to say that I had consulted many doctors about the Bill, he also said that I had not consulted many politicians. I have indeed consulted many politicians--some of them are here supporting the Bill. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have neither consulted nor been consulted by anyone who has anything to do with the information that he has just given the Committee.
<P>
As someone who is seeking to introduce a private Member's Bill, I find it extraordinary that organisations outside the House should take action without asking the Member responsible whether she thinks that such action would be helpful. The hon. Gentleman has done the Committee a service in telling us about the lobby. I am rather surprised that all that literature should be circulated in Scotland and, I assume, elsewhere--I know not. I thought that I ought to put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Perhaps they just want to visit the Dome.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I do not think that anyone in their right mind would want to visit the Dome, but that is just a personal opinion. This is nothing to do with what we are supposed to be debating, but if the hon. Gentleman would like to treat me, I will go up in the London Eye with him any day--despite the fact that we are on opposite sides of the argument. He will not receive a fairer offer than that.
<P>
I welcome the amendments because they have allowed the Committee to examine the thorny issue of whether the provisions should apply in Scotland. The Bill is intended to apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where the House of Commons has the constitutional night to decide on criminal law. Neither the Welsh Assembly nor Stormont, when it was up and running, has jurisdiction over matters of criminal law. As we heard, however, the position of Scotland is fundamentally different.
<P>
The Scotland Act 1998 gave jurisdiction over almost all aspects of criminal law in Scotland to the Holyrood Parliament. Although the House of Commons retains the right to legislate for Scotland, I believe that it would be improper for it to do so. As was said, the Scottish Parliament's Justice and Home Affairs Committee is due to discuss these issues further on 29 February. If the Scottish Bill reaches the statute book and this Bill does not, within the United Kingdom there would be two distinct laws relating to euthanasia. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it would remain legal to starve and dehydrate to death certain categories of patient, while in Scotland the same action would be a criminal offence. That prospect cannot bring much joy to the heart of the Government.
<P>
In summary, it is not right that the Bill should seek to impose legislation on Scotland for two clear reasons. First, it would go against the principle of devolved governance over matters of criminal law and, secondly, the Scottish Parliament is currently scrutinising its own Bill, which includes measures to deal with the substantive issues covered by this Bill. I believe that this Bill should extend only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, over which the House has jurisdiction in matters of criminal law, and I therefore oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I sympathise with those who tabled the amendments to probe this issue. There have been separate laws in Scotland for many years. The late Nicky Fairbairn often entertained the House by showing how enlightened Scotland was in comparison with England. There is a new situation now. Scotland has its own Parliament with powers to legislate in competent spheres. I have every sympathy with those who have expressed concern, just as I have with the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, who keeps telling us that we did not have time to debate the issues. However, this is not the only occasion on which the House has had no time to debate fundamental issues; it happens regularly, and our new regime of timetable motions gives us less opportunity to probe. Nothing that has happened to the Bill is contrary to what happens on the Floor of the House.
<P>
5.45 pm
<P>
I oppose the deletion of the words "Northern Ireland", for reasons that are understandable. We are in limbo, and the House is now responsible for Northern Ireland. Therefore, as I have argued time and again, it is wrong when major legislation that affects the Kingdom as a whole is going through the House to legislate in Northern Ireland on the specious ground that we must keep a separate corpus of law for Northern Ireland. As I have already said, there has been a separate corpus of law for Scotland for centuries. If the House could legislate for Scotland when it had no devolved Parliament, it can legislate for Northern Ireland, which does not have its own devolved Parliament.
<P>
The amendments were presented as probing amendments, and they are helpful. However, I would prefer there to be similar legislation throughout the Kingdom. That would avoid a lot of misunderstanding. A prisoner from Northern Ireland is currently not being dealt with under the criminal law in Scotland because it is different from that in Northern Ireland. Prisoners from England have sought to be transferred to Northern Ireland to receive some of the benefits of the laws that have been imposed on Northern Ireland.
<P>
I sympathise with the concept of one law for the whole Kingdom, but that is not the reality. We have devolved to Scotland powers in the health sphere--including aspects of the issue that we are discussing--but we have not devolved to it the whole concept of criminal law. We should at least leave Scotland to work out its own way forward on what is, as we have discovered today, a fairly tortuous issue. In the meantime, we should proceed to legislate in the Bill for England and Wales. I recognise that Wales has its own Assembly, which has no legislative powers. People have asked me, "Why have England and Wales been looked on as one over the years?" I say that it is because the Welsh took over England many years ago under the prince, but that is another issue. The harsh reality is that we are legislating for the three parts of the Kingdom over which the House has power to legislate in vital matters. I support the Bill as it is presently constituted.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I have listened carefully to the debate, which has been interesting. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw were right to table our probing amendments because they have raised difficulties, as hon. Members have heard. I listened carefully to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Congleton. Since we set up the Scottish Parliament, we have given it powers over criminal law. Although this Parliament has retained criminal law powers over Scotland, it would be improper, as has been said, to impose our views on the Scottish Parliament, especially now.
<P>
I should add that the issue will get more complicated. I have in my hand a fax from Rotterdam dated 11 February 2000, which is addressed to the Organisation ALERT in London. It is from the president of the Federation of Doctors Who Respect Human Life, which is based in Rotterdam. It has drawn to my attention the fact that moves are afoot within the European Union to harmonise laws on moral issues across the Union. If we cannot do that across the Kingdom that we represent, it will be difficult to harmonise such matters throughout the European Union. It is right and proper to flag up the fact that we will be involved in such debates for a long time--longer, I suspect, than I shall remain in Parliament. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The question is--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale, I want to withdraw my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's amendment has not been moved. For the Committee's information, when amendments are grouped, only the lead amendment is moved formally. If there is a vote on other amendments, they are moved formally. The hon. Gentleman cannot withdraw an amendment that has not been moved, and there is, of course, no need for him to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I seek your advice. I tabled my amendments before the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East and I do not know why his name appears before mine. Perhaps you can explain, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to do so. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw is wrong; the hon. Gentleman tabled his amendment first. The order of selection is a matter for the Chair, not for debate.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed, That further consideration be now adjourned.--[Mrs. Ann Winterton.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Is this matter debateable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> We have almost completed consideration of the Bill, apart from debating an amendment to the long title. There is still an hour to go in the Committee. What is the point of bringing everyone back next Wednesday morning when we could complete our proceedings tonight?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady has moved the motion; she will no doubt wish to respond to the hon. Gentleman's point and will do so in a moment. On a matter of correction, the adjournment, if it takes place, will not be until next Wednesday, when the House will not be sitting, but until Wednesday 1 March.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> I should like to respond to the hon. Gentleman, who assumed that the Bill would report today. We must bear it in mind that criticisms have been made that there has been insufficient time to table amendments and new clauses in Committee, and it has been suggested that it will be helpful to hon. Members to read the Hansard reports of our proceedings today. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have had a good, intense debate this morning. I felt that it would be helpful for the Committee to have a breather and to return to complete consideration of the Bill on Wednesday 1 March.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> With respect to the hon. Lady, I am the only one who has provided any opposition. I have been here since 4.30 pm, looking round at five or six people. I am prepared to go on and finish the Committee tonight and have done with it. I will oppose the motion. The officials will have to organise the next sitting. I am not being awkward, but it will be for the benefit of the Committee and all who are connected with it that the Bill should report tonight.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I point out that there was opposition to the Bill apart from the hon. Gentleman. Unfortunately the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) cannot be present this afternoon and I should like to hear his arguments on another day, when he can attend.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is a clear motion before the Committee and prolonged debate on the subject would be fruitless. The hon. Lady has moved that further consideration of the Bill should now be adjourned until Wednesday 1 March.
<P>
