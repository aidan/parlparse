               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would undo the watering down of automatic enrolment
contained in the Bill, and we question the decision to include a
three-month waiting period. Amendment 29 would specifically reduce the
proposed automatic waiting period before an employee is automatically
enrolled from three months to one month. The Opposition have also
tabled an amendment to eliminate the waiting period altogether, which
will no doubt not have escaped the Minister’s attention, and
that remains our preference. However, as a considered compromise, it is
surely more appropriate for the delay to be limited to one month, first
to limit the amount of people affected at any one time, and the extent
to which they are affected over the course of their career, and,
secondly, to reduce the risk of increasing opt-out rates. The Turner
report is
clear:<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
aim…is to use the power of inertia…to encourage
individuals, and their employers through the matching contribution, to
make at least minimum pension provision, while leaving individuals
ultimately free to opt-out if they
wish.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000372">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Of
the report’s options for the mechanics of automatic enrolment,
the preferred one is for employees to have the first four weeks of a
new job in which to opt out and, if they do wish to join, payments
would commence only in the second month. Amendment 29 is therefore a
compromise, which is in keeping with the all-important consensus that
Lord Turner and his colleagues on the Pensions Commission came
to.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000038">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In our earlier
debate, I flagged the success of the KiwiSaver scheme in New Zealand;
under it, pension contributions are deducted from a new
employee’s very first pay cheque. As the Johnson review states,
there have been strong and consistent calls from employers to introduce
waiting periods. Employer groups have supported the introduction of
waiting periods principally to reduce the administrative cost of
enrolling people who are with the employer only for a short period, and
to allow probationary periods to pass. Such groups believe that waiting
periods would help employers to adjust the additional cost of the
employer duties, minimising the need for refunds. However, the Johnson
review also estimated that, compared with the status quo of no waiting
period, at any one time an estimated 0.5 million fewer individuals
would be automatically enrolled into pension saving
and<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“those
that are automatically enrolled will not have contributed to a pension
for the initial three months…they spend with any employer during
their working life which will reduce their overall savings pot, unless
they have opted
in.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000373">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>My
estimate is that, by having a three-month rather than a one-month
waiting period, around 330,000 people would miss out on pension saving.
That estimate is based on extrapolating from the 0.5 million who miss
out if they wait for three months rather than paying from day one. I
hope that the Minister can confirm whether that is roughly the number
of people who will miss
out.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
same argument applies to a one-month waiting period but, of course, the
actual amount lost would be far less. Take people on average earnings
of £25,000 a year. A three-month waiting period rather than a
one-month waiting period would cost them around £260 in lost
pension savings every time they changed jobs. If we estimate
that people have 11 jobs during their lifetime, we are looking at a
loss in pension income of some
£3,000.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to further highlight the effects of this policy in two
ways—first, its effects at the time of enrolment and, secondly,
its effects over the course of an average career. On the first point,
there is a concern from the Government that this amendment would
counter the intention of the overall policy. Automatic enrolment
exploits the inertia that people experience on pension savings. While
we may be fully engaged in the subject, many people who could benefit
from pension savings are sadly not. The default position of being
automatically enrolled is intended to make savings the norm on an
individual and collective level. Introducing a possible cliff edge
after three months threatens to undermine that aim. Someone who works
for three months before being automatically enrolled, unless they have
opted in, will see their income drop in the first month that they are
enrolled in the pension scheme. That is an incentive to opt out,
compared with someone whose take-home pay remains constant throughout
their employment period.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Habits do form
and spending patterns are established. A person on an average income of
£25,000 a year would see a drop of £70 in their monthly
income once automatic enrolment kicks in. The drop would be much more
noticeable after a three-month waiting period compared with a one-month
waiting period. The impact assessment states:<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It is
possible that waiting periods will increase opt-out rates. Individuals
subject to a waiting period will receive a ‘full’ wage
for some period, and will therefore be more acutely aware of the cost
of contributing to a pension when they are eventually
enrolled.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000374">&#160;</a>

               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 213<a class="bkMark" name="Column213">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p>It is
also, in the worst case, an incentive for those employers with a
three-month waiting period to get rid of their staff just before
pension contributions kick in. That is why the legislation for
temporary and agency workers is so important. Can the Minister clarify
what regulation or enforcement he will put in place to deal with those
concerns?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second important issue that relates to these amendments is the effect
on an average employee over the course of their career. The Johnson
review shows that on average an individual has 11 different labour
market interactions during their lifetime. If every employer were to
opt for a waiting period, individuals would accumulate something
approaching two years less savings over their career than would be the
case under our
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000045">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I wonder whether, in
looking at the number of employments that someone has over their
working life, we are in danger of looking backwards, which the Minister
advised us against last week, and finding that people on average had
11 employments. If we look forwards, people might be
expected to have more than 11 employments. That number may rise in the
future and we should think about that in our consideration of the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000046">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. I know we
have spent a lot of time last week talking about our mums, dads,
husbands, wives and sisters—although we should not remind my
hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead that she talked about
her sister—but if I think about the working patterns of our
parents and our grandparents, compared with mine, I have already had
more jobs than my mother had during the course of her working life.
Although I was not going to mention the point, it is true that looking
forward we can probably expect people to have more labour market
interactions during their working lives than people have had in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Coming back to
the issue of part-time jobs, which I phrase carefully, if people are
more likely to mix and match between caring, part-time work, full-time
work and part-time study to ensure that they have the skills needed for
a modern workplace, they will have more interactions with the labour
market over time.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
different labour market interactions that I mentioned, 11 is the
historical number, but we should be looking to the future. There is a
risk of losing three months every time somebody changes their job. At
the moment, 11 times three means missing out on 33 months of
contributions. If the number of interactions goes up to 14 times, there
will potentially be 42 months of missing pension contributions. That is
a point worth making, and I urge the Minister and his Department to
keep such trends in mind when considering the waiting period and the
impact on the pension pots that people could expect to build up.
Perhaps the Minister will come back to those points
later.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the Government’s proposal, a person on average earnings with an
average number of labour market interactions—11—would
lose out to the tune of £3,200. Someone whose work pattern is a
perpetual cycle of short-term seasonal work could miss out to a much
greater extent. The review tells us that about 25% of individuals
already have 14 or more employments during 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 214<a class="bkMark" name="Column214">&#160;</a>
                  </div>their working life. The review also identifies an impact on different
ethnic groups. A greater proportion of non-white groups is employed for
less than six months, with 8% of white people having been in work for
less than six months compared with 14% of non-white individuals having
been employed for less than six
months.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
review found that young people are likely to move jobs relatively
frequently, while those starting a job at age 30 to 34 are likely to
stay with the employer for longer. Some 24% of 22-year-olds have been
in work for less than six months. For a programme that should be about
recognising and encouraging persistency in savings and the formation of
habit, it is worrying. If young people move jobs
frequently and are never automatically enrolled in the first few years
of their working lives, they will not build up the habit, which is such
a crucial part of automatic enrolment and nudge
theory.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are clearly some groups on whom the Government’s proposal has a
detrimental impact. When this part of the Bill was debated in the other
place, the noble Baroness Hollis talked about her research, which is
worth repeating. She
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“My
previous research shows that the pattern of job turnover is different
for men and women: men have more turnover in their earlier years and
settle in their 40s or 50s, while women have a higher job turnover than
most men by virtue of being much more frequently in and out of the
labour market and more likely to re-enter into a different job…
Interestingly, 26 per cent of the population on this model have between
12 and 15 jobs in their working lifetime, which would mean, on average
for them…a loss of five years’ pension contributions.
Furthermore, 15% have 16 jobs or more—up to
23—<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000375">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>As my
hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South said, it is likely that the
number of labour market interactions will increase over time. It will
be interesting to hear the Minister’s view on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Age
UK has highlighted the impact on particular groups. It emphasised that
among employers that traditionally use short-term staff—for
example, call centres —there is a real risk that those who move
from job to job will remain under-pensioned if the optional waiting
period is taken by their employers. Reducing the waiting period from
three months to one month would make a huge difference for people who
have staying power, but none the less a rapid job turnover for whatever
reason, and for people who move from job to job more frequently than
others, either because of choice or
necessity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
may be a cycle between self-employment and employment. Take, for
example, hairdressers, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
Nottingham South earlier. Their conditions of employment are often
rather obscure, whether they are self-employed or even if they work in
a salon. None the less, the waiting period of three months can
represent, over a lifetime, a significant loss of working
contributions, matched by the employer, into a
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000056">&#160;</a>

                  </div>self-employed to avoid the auto-enrolment burden.
Does that not reinforce our case for making it easier for employers to
engage with auto-enrolment? If we cut the waiting period and reduce the
threshold, more firms will find it to be more of a hassle, and they
will be more likely to press people to become self-employed. Some will
miss out on auto-enrolment
altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000057">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The aim should be to ensure that employers stick
with both the letter and the spirit of automatic enrolment. Returning
to the Turner report, on considering the evidence, it recommends that
in the first four weeks, an employee should say whether they want to
opt out, and automatic enrolment should go ahead in the second month.
That would get the compromise right. The first month, in which people
are making decisions, is the time for an employee to say whether they
want to opt out. We would get the balance right by allowing the
employer that month to do the paperwork. After working somewhere for a
month, I think people deserve a pension contribution, which is in many
ways deferred income.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
recommendation would also ensure that people who move jobs frequently,
or just the average number of times—11 times—are building
up a pension pot throughout their working life, rather than having
three years in which they are not making pension contributions and so
are missing out on £3,000 or so on of pension income that they
would have got if they were automatically enrolled from day one or
after one
month.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
understand the concerns of businesses, which feel that the
administrative burden would be great in sectors where there is a high
staff turnover. For all the reasons that I have raised, I believe that
the benefits to individuals and society outweigh the cost. The National
Employment Savings Trust was designed to provide a simple and low-cost
pension vehicle for all businesses, in particular to fill a gap in the
market for pension provision for small and medium-sized enterprises. A
company that offers a decent pension scheme, however small, should be
more attractive to employees, create better engagement and reduce staff
turnover. From what I have seen of NEST, I know that it is doing huge
work to make its compliance processes—it is not even paperwork,
because almost all of it is done on the internet—as simple as
possible for employers to reduce the administrative burden that some
businesses have complained about. It is for those reasons that I ask
the Minister to reflect on whether he can make any movement back
towards the original consensus to automatically enrol people earlier
and enable them to build up their pension earlier on in their
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead tabled amendment 36,
which has rightly been grouped with the other amendments, and I shall
speak to it briefly. Amendment 36 would provide that the employer may
give only one notice period to employees. My hon. Friend was responding
to the concern that the operation of a three-month waiting period might
have an impact on employees who stay with an employer, but whose
earnings fluctuate. Let us take the case of someone whose hours are not
fixed, such as the hairdresser whom we considered earlier. In the first
two months of employment, they might earn enough to pass the threshold
to be automatically enrolled, but in the third month, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 216<a class="bkMark" name="Column216">&#160;</a>
                  </div>they might not. Would there be a risk that their
automatic enrolment is perpetually deferred? I ask the Minister to
clarify the position in response to the amendment, which is worthy of
consideration. The hairdresser would represent the direct target of the
automatic enrolment reforms, which is someone who does not tend to have
much pension provision, but who could benefit greatly in later life if
they did
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
removal of the waiting period remains our preference, but the amendment
seeks to find a compromise that would reduce the proposed waiting
period from three months to one month. That would limit the number of
people affected at any one time, limit the extent to which they are
affected over their working lives by lost pension provision and reduce
the risk of increasing opt-out
rates.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
should be grateful if the Minister set out in more detail the research
that lies behind the view that opt-out rates will not fall, because I
am yet to be convinced. Can he elaborate on whether his Department
undertook any assessment of alternative waiting periods of less than
three months, such as one month as we recommend, or two
months?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill makes
another amendment to the changes in the Pensions Act 2008, which were
forged through the consensus of the Turner commission. The measure
threatens to limit the scope of automatic enrolment and to undermine
the purpose of the Act, which was to get people
saving—persistently saving—throughout their careers. The
settlement reached in the 2008 Act was appropriate, and subsequent
changes to longevity mean that we need those provisions more than ever.
We must not unravel the
consensus.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
29 therefore aims to reduce the proposed waiting period to one month.
The change would reduce the number of people being left out of
automatic enrolment who are therefore also missing out on employer
contributions and tax relief towards their retirement income. I hope
that the Minister will consider the amendment and respond to my
specific questions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000065">&#160;</a>

                  </span> In discussing the
amendments, it is important to keep in mind what we are trying to
achieve, which is a total change of attitude to pensions, not only
among employees, but among employers. It is as well to remember that
employers and their organisations have supported a three-month waiting
period, mainly, I believe, because of concerns about administration and
red tape.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition,
we must keep in mind that over the years employers resisted many
changes that we now think were for the better: they resisted changes to
the national minimum wage, to equal pay and to health and safety. It is
natural for anyone in business to resist particular changes that they
believe will stop them carrying out their work, will reduce their
profits or will take up a lot of their time. It is therefore difficult
to walk the line between changing people’s attitudes and
creating a total sea change in how people view pensions, and trying to
implement a measure with minimum disruption.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
aims to ensure that the three-month waiting period is not abused by
unscrupulous employers. Many employers are concerned about their staff
and want the best practices in their businesses. They want a
level playing field, so they want to ensure that employers
who do not play by the rules are brought to book. For the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 217<a class="bkMark" name="Column217">&#160;</a>
                  </div>sake of employees and employers who are going with
the spirit of the Bill, we must be clear where the problems might
lie.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My concerns
are about seasonal workers and people in high-churn jobs, for whom the
three-month cliff edge will be ever present. In addition, there might
be a disincentive to employ older people. We had much debate last week
about older women working for longer. The measures may well provide an
incentive for employers to take on people who are under 22 so that they
do not have to comply with the provisions in the Bill, which creates
another worry for older women.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We must
balance what is workable for employers and what is right for society.
Most employers will comply, and as the measures are rolled out, the
larger, more compliant employers will face the system first. That is
the fair and right way to go, because it will show small and
medium-sized employers that the system can work. We hope that any
wrinkles or problems will be ironed out with the larger employers so
that when the measure gets down to the small baker shop or
hairdressers, lessons will have been learned and things will be
easier.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have a few
questions for the Minister, because I seek reassurance that employers
will not be able to manipulate the system easily. As I have said, I am
concerned about people being employed only if they are under 22, which
would disadvantage older women, who are expected to work for longer
now. Will the Pensions Regulator be doing spot checks on employers?
When employers open a pension scheme, is it at that point they become
known to the regulator? If employers do not open a pension scheme, will
they not be known and therefore not be able to be reviewed or policed?
From reading the Bill, I am not sure how such matters will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
with the national minimum wage, there is the ability for
employees to own up and complain if they are not receiving
it. Will employees have the same ability to complain about an employer
who is bullying them or not allowing them to access the pension scheme?
Although there is a three-month waiting period, people are allowed to
enrol from day one if they so wish. When an offer of employment is
made, will it include information about the pension scheme and the fact
that people can access it from day one? Can that be covered by
legislation or guidelines? I am not sure how it would work,
but if people do not know the facts, obviously
they cannot access the scheme. It is up to the employer to
inform people
proactively.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West, the shadow Minister, mentioned
bogus self-employment. I hear what the Minister said about that, but
bogus self-employment has been quite rife in several professions, such
as the construction industry and IT. It results not only in people
being unable to access their pensions, but in a loss to national
insurance contributions and other employment rights. With a change in
legislation, whether or not the onus is put on to employers, other
drivers might push them to recommend that people become consultants not
employees. I am interested to know whether there will be links with
HMRC to investigate matters if an employer’s workforce decreases
unexpectedly or if, all of a sudden, 80 of the 100 employees become
freelance consultants. Will HMRC assist the regulator to make sure that
sort of thing does not
happen?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000073">&#160;</a>

best time to be introducing such measures but it is better late than
never. Hopefully, it will mean that my children’s generation
will automatically view pensions as part of their earnings and what
everyone does rather than something that is only for people who are
wealthy and can put extra money away. It should be part of
people’s daily
planning.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000074">&#160;</a>

and pay-as-you-earn. Given what some employers would do to make sure
that they pay the least tax in respect of their employees, nothing
would ever surprise me. The measure will be regarded by many employers
as a tax that they have to pay for employees. I therefore hope that the
Minister has listened to my questions in the spirit in which they were
intended. I hope that my worries are unfounded, but they are sincere
concerns and have also been expressed by many trade unionists who are
worried that the measure will be an extra reason why employers will put
pressure on them. I look forward to the Minister’s

employers—for example, someone who needs a carer—will
have to take on direct payments and deal with tax, national insurance
and many other matters from day one, and rightly so, because that
employee needs protection. I am a little sceptical about direct

day one of employment, the employer starts to pay the person’s

about their hours of work, although that will depend on how the
regulations are finally drawn up. We have been assured that one big
advantage of universal credit over how tax credits have worked in the
past is that problems—there have been issues of people being
overpaid, and finding it very difficult to make repayments—will
be avoided, because real-time information will be available from
employers of apparently any size.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000079">&#160;</a>

supplying real-time information to Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs, which will pass it on to the Department for Work and Pensions
so that people’s benefits can be calculated and regularly
recalculated. Some employers will regard that as a burden. If that
really is feasible and practical, I wonder why it would be such a
burden for people to be included in the scheme
immediately.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
relation to time limits, the burden is less applicable than it is in
relation to the threshold. Unless employees move on very quickly, which
probably only a minority of them would, they will—provided that
they meet the earnings threshold—be covered in due course. All
the mechanisms to operate the system will therefore have to be put into
place, whether that is from month one, two, three or four. On that
basis, I hope that we will hear less of the argument about such
enrolment being a burden on employers, in relation to its
administration and practicalities, because there will be the same
amount of work whether the employee is covered from the first month or
from the
fourth.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unless
an employer has very few employees, the chances are that they will be
operating the scheme for some employees and not for others. If they
have three or four employees, some might be covered by it because they
will have been employed for the relevant length of time. I hope that
those arguments about the practicality and the burden on employers will
not now be
repeated.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000082">&#160;</a>

a completely different matter, I have some information for the
Committee. I referred to various adverts for chocolates and pensions
this morning—I have not completely lost my marbles—and I
have tracked down the chocolate advert, which was for Fry’s Five
Boys chocolate. I am convinced that there was a similar advert about
pensions, although which advert inspired which I do not know. I have
not tracked the pensions advert down on the internet, but I would be
interested if anyone can remember it. It was about the way that the
poor man’s facial expression changed as he went from being a
carefree youth who did not care about pensions, to a very worried man
on the point of retirement. I would be interested in
tracking that advert down; I know I remember it and it is not in my

the few members of my family who does not run a small
business—my family also includes the ubiquitous hairdresser who
has been mentioned at various stages of our discussions. We have heard
representations from business organisations that are concerned about
the delay before people are auto-enrolled. I understand some of the
concerns felt by businesses—particularly very small
businesses—about the regulations, and that they may want time to
get people on to the payroll. As my hon. Friends have suggested, the
minute a business puts an employee on the payroll it has to start
paying wages and national insurance. Would it be such a
disproportionate burden also to have to deal with pensions? I accept,
however, some of the points made by businesses. They feel that the last
thing they need in the first few weeks of employing a new member of
staff is more red tape.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000086">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> One of the concerns expressed by larger businesses
when the Government commissioned their “Making automatic
enrolment work” review was that if smaller businesses are not
included in the automatic enrolment, there will not be a level playing
field. Those smaller businesses would have a smaller cost base as they
would not have to pay into a pension. A similar argument could be made
about the waiting period. An employer that changes its work force
regularly will never have to pay into pensions, while an employer with
a stable work force that pays into pensions would have a higher cost
base. That might be another reason why automatic enrolment from day one
or month two would be better.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000087">&#160;</a>

small businesses play a huge role in providing employment in local

three months will allow them to evaluate staff and to decide whether
they can work together. To throw an extra burden on them immediately
would discourage them from employing people. Having run a small
business for 20-odd years, I speak with a reasonable amount of
authority. The hon. Lady is being disingenuous about small business
men, although I agree that they are the country’s engine room,
and drive the country forward. We should bear their present troubles

                  </strong> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I was trying
to be fair, and to put on the record some of the issues that small
businesses have raised. I have not heard much about that from
Government Members, but I will come to that. The Forum of Private
Business has raised with Members on both sides of the House its worry
about liability, and how to comply with the regulations that it
believes the Government will introduce. It is aware that pensions are
complex financial products, and that many small businesses will find it
difficult to distinguish between what it describes as the good and the
bad offerings. It is worried about the effect on small employers of
auto-enrolment into pension schemes, and would like more support from
payroll experts, and to have access to accountants and others who are
familiar with the products. It wants help as the scheme is introduced
because of its impact on businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The forum
believes that employees are unlikely to be happy at what they may see
as lower take-home pay because money is paid into a pension scheme. It
wants the Government to introduce an incentive package for employers to
recompense them for their time and increased liability. It will be
interesting to hear the Minister’s response to those points,
which I have made simply to show the range of issues. Many small
businesses are the life blood of local communities, and most of them
understand their responsibilities to their
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to scrutinise whether the three-month period is right, or
whether one month would allow people the opportunity to deal with the
issues that have been outlined, and to get people enrolled as quickly
as possible. My hon. Friend the shadow Minister described situations
that could become unintended incentives for opting out, and that would
not be helpful. We heard some of that debate this morning on the
thresholds.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to put on the record the fact that there is concern that some
people would risk taking a short-term gain instead of planning for the
future. We heard this morning about various situations, and if one has
a family, current pressures may outweigh planning for the future. We do
not want the cliff edge that my hon. Friend described. I hope that the
Minister will reassure us on that. I may be accused of being cynical,
but I live and work in the real world and regularly have to help people
on fixed-term contracts and agency staff with employment-related
issues. There may be a perverse incentive for employers who may see fit
to get rid of staff within the three-month waiting period just before
pension contributions kick
in.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000095">&#160;</a>

during the three-month period, but is there not also a danger that
employers of staff whose hours and earnings fluctuate could
deliberately ensure that an employee’s earnings fell below the
trigger level in the third month, so that the waiting period would have
to start again? Even if they continued to employ such staff, they could
act in that disingenuous
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000096">&#160;</a>

it is one concern that has been raised particularly by those involved

it interesting what people call small businesses because my experience
is perhaps on the smaller scale of micro-businesses, but if I had a
member of staff who, after two months and 29 days, was good
and could do everything that the business required, I would certainly
not consider getting rid of such a person to avoid auto-enrolment. To
be frank, I know small business men who would be quite offended by that

people’s contracts to get rid of employees at a point before

I hope that he understands that I am pointing out what businesses
themselves have said. Irrespective of the period of time for
auto-enrolment that we are discussing, which they are concerned about,
some businesses see it as a burden whether the period is three months
or one month. We must dispel some of the myths and explain why
auto-enrolment is the right thing to do. We clearly still have a job of
work to do there, which the Minister I am sure will deal with in his

Surely the purpose of our debate is to tease out and discuss the

               <p class="tabbed">Surely
the point is to get the balance right—the balance between not
regulating businesses to stop them taking on more employees, coupled
with the importance of getting more people automatically enrolled.
The figures that I quoted earlier suggest that about 330,000
people at any one time will miss out on automatic enrolment if we have
a three-month rather than a one-month waiting period. When Lord Turner
did his report—I do not think that his objective was to stifle
businesses with regulations—he recommended that an employee
could opt out in the first four weeks, but then in the second month
when they receive the salary, they would be automatically enrolled. He
thought that that was the right balance for regulating business and for
ensuring that as many people as possible started contributing to a
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000107">&#160;</a>

am sure we all have examples of small businesses that we have worked
for, or run, or that we know in our constituencies. I agree with
Government Members that the vast majority of businesses, large and
small, want to do the right thing by their employees, including paying
into a pension for them. We can all agree on that point, but we must
find the right balance between making sure as many people as possible
benefit from automatic enrolment and making it as simple as possible,
as I think the creation of NEST does, for employers to automatically
enrol people into an appropriate
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000108">&#160;</a>

Once again, she has outlined her view very clearly. It is important
that we get the balance right. The purpose of this debate is to tease
out the issues the better to understand them from the perspectives of
businesses and potential employees. It is important that we have the
opportunity to do that. I favour a situation in which people are
auto-enrolled as quickly as possible. That is important. I have
concerns, which I raised on Second Reading, in relation to call
centres, for example. I did not produce such concerns from nowhere. Age
UK raised concerns about employers such as call centres that have
traditionally used short-term staff because of turnover. People may be
employed for a few months at a time, and then perhaps find that they
have a number of short-term contracts throughout the year, none of
which would be enough in this scenario to allow them to be
auto-enrolled. People in certain professions or jobs could spend years
without being able to benefit from having pension contributions paid. I
have real concerns about that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000110">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I listened with
interest to the figures for the number of jobs that people are likely
to have in their working lifetime—between 12 and 15. We have
already discussed people who work in multiple part-time jobs. Many of
them would have undertaken those 12 to 15 jobs very early on in their
working life. Given the current situation, it is not too much to ask
that we try to get them enrolled into the pension scheme as quickly as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to reassure those who perhaps think that I have been criticising
small businesses. As I outlined at the beginning, I come from a family
that runs small businesses, so nothing could be further from the truth.
I know exactly the contribution that they make. I know that people feel
it is very important to have a system that is workable and
straightforward. However, on balance, I believe that if auto-enrolment
can be done after three months, it can be done after one month. That
gives employees greater protection and also fulfils the principles of
the Bill, which we
all—hopefully—support.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000112">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
come to the amendment from both sides of the fence. I was a former
trade union official and my father was a bookmaker who employed a small
number of people. The major tension in the amendment and in
auto-enrolment is that we have to temper the rights of the employee
with the rights of the small business man. I do not think that anyone
here today has talked about larger businesses that already have pension
schemes in place and will therefore not have to worry about the whys
and wherefores of auto-enrolment. They will, more or less, be
there.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have not,
however, looked at the issue of stakeholder pensions in our discussion
of the amendment. I remember, when I was a financial adviser, many
companies had stakeholder pensions, where the only members of those
stakeholder pensions were the managing director and the executive. It
was not set up properly. When a customer came to see me, they would
say, “There is a pension scheme in the company’s name,
but I don’t know how to join it.” I would say,
“Who do you talk to?” and they would say, “I
don’t know.” That issue needs to be looked at when we
discuss
auto-enrolment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000115">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This
is a massive project, on which I support the Government. I take the
point that we should not burden small business men with more regulation
and red tape, because I know that from when my father worked in the
betting industry. There is no industry with more regulation than the
betting industry, where operators have to buy licences and so on. I
admire any small business man or entrepreneur who wants to go out there
and set up their own business, because of the amount of hurdles that
they have to overcome in accountancy and the regulatory burden they
have to meet. I want to hear from the Minister what help we are giving
them to ensure that the auto-enrolment system works properly for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000116">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have to temper the rights of the employer with the rights of the
employee. Three months is a little bit too long, and I would argue that
one month is right. The world of work is changing. People will not stay
in the same job that they had when they were 16. I will indulge the
Committee with more examples from my family. My grandfather started in
the pits at 14 and was carried off at 72, because he did not want to
stop working. That is probably the type of person the Government do not
like. He was in the same job all his life.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000124">&#160;</a>

more prosaic employment record, which we see a lot in the IT industry.
My brother-in-law is an IT consultant and he was moved on from a
company to become a self-employed consultant, so he is not eligible for
auto-enrolment, as the Minister said. How do we ensure that companies
do not encourage employees to become self-employed to avoid
auto-enrolment? That is an important point and I see that problem in
many industries. We have tabled an amendment that proposes no waiting
period from day one, but we need some sort of compromise. I hope that
the Minister will consider reducing the period from three months when
he sums up or that he will discuss the matter beyond Committee
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000125">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am not sure that my hon. Friends have touched
on the small matter of the impact of waiting periods on opt-out rates.
If someone comes into a job and is auto-enrolled after three months,
they will have had three pay packets and will therefore know the size
of their take-home pay. If they are auto-enrolled in month three, when
their pension contribution comes out in month four, it will be far more
obvious.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I note that
the Johnson review said that it had limited evidence to help us
understand the effect of waiting periods on opt-out rates. It says that
the example from the US does not raise a concern, but such a view is
obviously based on scant evidence. What might the Minister do to review
opt-out rates? Will there be a review of the waiting period when
auto-enrolment is in place?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000127">&#160;</a>

after one month. After automatic enrolment is rolled out, and if the
Government go with the three-month period, it might be useful if they
compare opt-out rates in New Zealand with those in the UK. I share my
hon. Friend’s concern that spending patterns become established
after three months, and people will notice the drop in their income
when 4% of it is diverted into a pension. People might not notice that
drop so much after one month, because their spending patterns might be
less entrenched.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000128">&#160;</a>

concern is whether employees will be given sufficient information to
enable them to exercise the right to opt in. Will the Minister explain

the waiting period and there are some serious concerns about the
trade-offs. Should we have a waiting period at all? If so, how long
should it be? The Johnson review, as I indicated, tried to achieve a
series of trade-offs and strike a balance between reducing the burdens
on business while protecting the interests of consumers. The Government
came under huge pressure to exclude micro-employers. We came very close
to taking a million people out of auto-enrolment, but it was precisely
because we could say, “We recognise the pressure on
micro-employers, so we’ve provided a waiting period.
We’ve provided an increase in the threshold and we’ve
made various other easements,” that we were able to keep those
million people in scope. That was the nature of the trade-off, and each
time we try and unpick a bit of it, we risk undermining it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000131">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 227<a class="bkMark" name="Column227">&#160;</a>
                  </div>matters. That world will have a different culture and a different
process. Every job in which people earn above the threshold and are
above a certain age, will be an auto-enrolment job. That will be part
of the process when people start a job. An employer might choose to use
the voluntary waiting period. We must remember that the process is not
mandatory. Employers can auto-enrol from day one if they want to. If it
works for them, that is fine. To assume that it is 11 jobs times three
months, times the average wage and so on will overstate the scale of
such matters, firstly because people who auto-enrol do not, on average,
earn the average wage, but quite a bit less, and for various other
reasons. As people go from job to job in the auto-enrolment world, they
will be going from a job with an auto-enrolled pension to another job
with an auto-enrolled pension, to another one. While people may not be
clued up in their first job, after 11 job moves—the average, and
we have discussed possibly more—pensions will become much more
part of the conversation on day one. It will become much more part of
the portfolio that people build

who work for a series of small firms will often have a NEST pension,
and I was delighted about the positive response that members of the
Select Committee received when they visited NEST. I have visited it
myself and was impressed by its work, specifically to assist small
businesses. If NEST is the scheme that many small firms choose, people
who move from one small firm to another will go with a NEST pension.
The NEST corporation will have been in contact with them and people
will have been thinking about it. It will not be a situation when they
say, “Pensions. Oh, what is that?” Such people will have
a relationship with the pension provider, potentially a continuous one
despite changing jobs, which means that there is not likely to be 11
lots of three

the hon. Gentleman refers to people having a relationship with the

does not exist at the moment. How do we get from a to b; from the point

point yet, and nearly 10 million people do not have pensions. That is
where NEST, in particular, and other providers come in. I am slightly
darting about, but the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said that
small firms were anxious about choice. The regulator will inform them
of the scheme called NEST. Firms will be told that the Government have
made sure that there is a provider that provides decent value for
money, satisfies the requirements of the regulator in respect of the
quality of the scheme and has been designed with them in
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000138">&#160;</a>

pension. The whole mindset of NEST and part of the reasoning for the
caps and so on to be focused on that target market is that it has been
designed with small firms and people who would rather be making widgets
than filling in pension paperwork in mind. The idea is that it is for

and trying to get rid of jargon is being looked at hard, as is the
interface between the individual and the scheme. I keep promising
everyone that there will be a NEST iPhone app and an Android app,
whatever that is. We are talking about young people, in particular.
Nearly one quarter of those who should be enrolled are in the twenties,
so we must think of new ways in which to introduce such things. I
absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. NEST has not opened its doors
for business yet but, by the time the scheme is in operation on a
serious scale, it will have done. The cultural shift will not happen on
day one, but over a lifetime of, say, 11 job moves, we will be moving
into a period when people will be more engaged and the providers will
be working much harder to
communicate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000140">&#160;</a>

the level of take-up of either a personal pension or a company pension
is absolutely shocking. I am sure that the Minister will agree.

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is quite right. Clearly, the public
sector and big firms that run high-quality defined-benefit pensions on
the whole have pretty good membership rates. However, unless you have
auto-enrolment, take-up rates can be poor. I assume that hon. Members
who are new to the House know that their parliamentary staff are
entitled to 10% free—in the sense that the staff do not have to
pay—contributions to the Portcullis pension scheme, but many
staff do not take it up, even when it does not cost MPs anything to do
it. That is free money. Whether it is because of awareness or barriers,
or because the staff do not think that they will be here for long,
there are huge barriers to getting people into that pension scheme. As
he rightly says, the evidence from around the world, as cited earlier,
shows that auto-enrolment completely transforms engagement and take-up
rates. We get people in and then we have to work hard to engage them,
but we get them in, as he rightly
says.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000142">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">What
we have heard about amendment 29, regarding one month or three months,
hardly addresses the issue of seasonal, casual and short-term workers.
A season on average lasts three months. If we have a one-month cut-off,
lots of seasonal workers will be auto-enrolled. The administrative cost
of auto-enrolment is principally the one-off cost in choosing a scheme,
getting people in and building up the relationship with the provider.
The month-by-month process is relatively straightforward. If a company
has to do that repeatedly for large numbers of short-term, casual and
seasonal workers, there will be a considerable cost for particular
employers, such as retailers. Sainsbury’s has said that it
thinks that the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 229<a class="bkMark" name="Column229">&#160;</a>
                  </div>three-month waiting period is a huge bonus, because
it takes on a lot of summer and Christmas staff, who might work for six
or eight weeks and are not lasting employees of the firm. If we
accepted the amendment, we would put a huge administrative cost and a
significant burden on the nation’s employers, while creating
negligible benefit for individuals’ pensions, as six weeks of
Christmas money will not earn much
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000143">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I would dispute the idea that such staff are not
employees in a meaningful sense. If someone works somewhere for six
weeks and they put in their effort and hours and are contributing, they
are an employee, and they deserve some contribution to their future
pension. Are they not the sort of people whom we need to capture
through automatic enrolment? Let us say that someone works in a
café on a beach front for three months in the summer, picks
fruits and vegetables in the autumn and then does another job in the
post office over the Christmas period when it is busy. People who move
from job to job and do not stay anywhere longer than three months will
not be able to build up a pension. Does the Minister think that that is
the right way forward? Will that not mean that people who work hard,
but do not work anywhere longer than three months, do not have the
pension that they need in
retirement?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000144">&#160;</a>

happen, but they are often associated with particular periods in
someone’s life, the classic one being a student who does a
vacation job. Under-22s are not covered by auto-enrolment. The idea
that people do a whole series of three-month jobs through their working
life is not what happens. There will be odd cases and odd periods when
that is the case. People can opt in—I will return to the point
about how they will know about that—so no one will be deprived
of anything if they want it, although they will have to be aware of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000145">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
crucial point of the regulations on the implementation of the waiting
period is that to benefit from the three-month waiting period, a firm
has to notify an employee immediately that they are about to go into a
waiting period, and that during that period, the employee has the right
to opt in. An employer cannot create a waiting period unless they tell
their employee at the start of it about the right to opt in. That is
how people will
know.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000146">&#160;</a>

amendment 30, which refers to whether someone is already working for a
firm. I do not think that the hon. Member for Leeds West mentioned that
in her remarks. Let us say that there is a staging date for an employer
who decides to apply a waiting period for the whole work force. Some
people might not be eligible for auto-enrolment, for example a
21-year-old or someone under the wage threshold. If, as under one of
the amendments in the group, we cannot have a second waiting period, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 230<a class="bkMark" name="Column230">&#160;</a>
                  </div>then at the exact moment that someone turned 22 or passed the wage
threshold, we would have to have auto-enrolment on that day, which
might be in the middle of the month. Employers doing a monthly payroll
or something like that would have to enrol the person two or two and a
half weeks in, which means that they must deal with 23 31sts of the
amount that month, for example, with the additional amount the next
month.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000148">&#160;</a>

point of the provision is that it is an easement. The waiting period
does not have to be three months; it can be up to three months but
could be a lot less if the employer wants it to be. The reason for it,
however, is to fit in with payroll cycles and to give employers
flexibility, rather than pre-empting every possible combination of
circumstance and devising complicated rules to foresee what might
happen. We want a broad easement and the flexibility to get that

am backing up my questions, so I will return to the cost of
auto-enrolment. I do not have the exact figure to hand but we have
produced an impact assessment which includes the cost to business,
which I am sure that the hon. Member for Leeds West has seen. We
estimate the cost of auto-enrolment for individual firms, varying it
according to size. As one might expect, we found that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 231<a class="bkMark" name="Column231">&#160;</a>
                  </div>for the giant employers with HR departments the cost per head is pretty
straightforward. For the small firms, it is much more of a hassle, with
the start-up cost that I described, although we hope that the ongoing
cost will be relatively modest, especially as NEST and so on will be
mainly online. From memory, I think that we are talking about several
hundred pounds, but I will check that
figure.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Going
back to the big picture, under amendment 36 we are being invited to
give employers a maximum waiting period of one month. What has not
emerged in the discussion is that the existing legislation—the
2008 Act passed under the previous Government—includes a
three-month period called a postponement period, but it only applies to
what are called quality schemes. The previous Government therefore
thought, “Actually, we will let people wait for three months, if
we think that they have a really good scheme.” The Bill’s
waiting period replaces the postponement period so, if we do nothing,
there will be three-month waiting periods called postponement periods,
but they will be much less flexible than what we are proposing, because
the three-month postponement period does not allow people to opt in.
Whereas we propose a waiting period during which people have the chance
to opt in, the legislation we inherited deprives people of the chance
to contribute at all during that period. What we propose is more
beneficial and flexible. It would enable the employer to stagger
auto-enrolment over a three-month period—which cannot be done
with a postponement period—or make it coincide with pay periods.
That is not a new idea; three months of waiting is already in the
legislation, but we are making it more flexible and available across
the board.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The answer to
the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire
about maternity pay is obvious to her, I imagine, if not to me.
Statutory maternity pay is included in earnings as part of a total
amount. If occupational maternity pay were to stop and a person ended
up on statutory maternity pay, they could drop out of the system if
they went below a certain threshold, but when their earnings went back
up they would go straight back in. That is key to my hon.
Friend’s question, and I thank her for raising the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The key point
is that each year there will be 2 million enrolments. Of those, 190,000
will be for workers who will leave within three months. If we do not
make this change, nearly one in 10 enrolments will be for people who
will be gone before three months have passed. The Labour party perhaps
slightly understates the importance of buy-in by employers. At the end
of this morning’s sitting, the hon. Member for Erith and
Thamesmead said that employers have duties to pay tax and national
insurance, and that it is part of their civic corporate responsibility
to do stuff. That is true up to a point, but I would emphasise the
issue of proportionality. It is fair to ask employers to do things, and
in answer to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, we are not
planning to reimburse small firms for the cost of implementing the
scheme. We think that auto-enrolment is part of employing someone, just
like national insurance and tax, but we will try to minimise the cost.
NEST has been specifically designed for small firms, and the Pensions
Regulator has been working with software companies and will publish
guidance to make it easier to set up schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000159">&#160;</a>

dilemma is that we do not have much longitudinal data. It is fairly
clear that, at a point in time, pension scheme membership and

Those aged 21 have the annoying habit of becoming 22-year-olds, so that
would be quite a short-term strategy. In addition, not many
21-year-olds are perfect substitutes for her sister or others of a
certain age. People often ask, “Why do you want people to work
longer—aren’t you depriving all the teenagers of
jobs?” However, there is very clear evidence that the contrary
is true: making the most of the experience and skills of older workers
benefits young people as well, and such crude substitution does not
usually occur. If one thinks about why one takes someone on, the
attractions of employing someone who would

how the regulator will know about an employer who is not complying, the
staging process for auto-enrolment is based on PAYE records, so the
regulator will know who is running a PAYE system and, based on that, if
the employee does not report back with a matching scheme satisfying the
duties, the regulator will see that the employer is non-compliant. It
is not the case that if the employer does nothing, nobody will know
about it; they will have to comply with the
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
spot checks, the regulator is currently working through the compliance
regime, which will be risk-based. The regulator will not turn up on
spec at a one-person firm in the middle of nowhere; the regime will be
proportionate. However, individuals will be able to report grievances,
as they can about the minimum wage and other matters. If someone is
deprived of their rights or is unhappy, they can report that, but the
regulator cannot be in 1 million places at
once.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun raised the issue about the
choice of schemes. We have tried to strike a balance. We recognise that
if we had put in an auto-enrolment duty and had not created NEST, we
would have been asking the impossible. We would have told small firms
to enrol their workers into a scheme, but the small firms might not
have been able to find a scheme to take them. NEST will do that, as it
has a public service duty and cannot turn any firm away, for which it
receives a state subsidy. We have guaranteed that there will be a
source, but firms are free to go elsewhere. The smallest businesses
will often just not be attractive to commercial providers, in that it
would not be worth the hassle of taking pension contributions from one
or two lower-paid workers. On the whole, firms will find that NEST is
easy, accessible and attractive, and although firms are free to go
elsewhere, in practice they may not have much
choice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Islwyn raised the issue of firms encouraging people to
become self-employed. That is an important issue not only for
auto-enrolment, but for national insurance and tax, and we are in
conversation about it with our colleagues at HMRC. If 80% of a
firm’s work force suddenly become self-employed, HMRC has a
strong interest in that because it would lose shedloads of employer
national insurance, so there is already a communality of interest
between HMRC and us. At the margin, the existing incentives to make
someone self-employed are the 12%-odd of employer national insurance
and other factors, which are already substantial incentives compared
with the 3% cost of
auto-enrolment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
will be doing ongoing research through the roll-out of auto-enrolment.
We will monitor and research who opts in and who stays out, and
compliance. A huge amount of monitoring, reporting and researching will
be done because we want to get auto-enrolment right. If we identify any
abuse of waiting periods, we have powers to take further action. The
key is that we will be keeping a close eye on these
things.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
crucial factor, which balances the new duty on firms, is the optional
three-month period, during which people will have the chance to opt in.
Although that period does not have to be used, it will give employers
extra flexibility right at the start of an employment, when they
perhaps need it the most. On balance, we 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>think that is the right trade-off. On that basis, I
encourage the Committee to reject the amendments and to agree to clause
6.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000171">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We have had an extremely interesting debate this
afternoon. First, the hon. Member for Edinburgh East told us that she
had remembered that it was Fry’s five boys in the chocolate
advert. She is still trying to remember what the similar pension advert
was, but we have an hour and a half left this afternoon, and if she
cannot remember by then, we will be enlightened on Thursday. We had our
first consensus in the Committee on what a great job NEST is doing, and
for that reason alone our sitting this afternoon will be
memorable.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
afternoon’s debate has been about whether the balance of the
waiting period is right. The Government propose three months, and we
propose one month. We have had an intelligent and interesting debate
about which period is right. Lord Turner suggested that employees
should be enrolled automatically after four weeks, and Age UK suggest
that they should be enrolled automatically on day one. The Government
want three months, but the argument in the Johnson report, which has
been heavily referred to this afternoon, seems to be finely balanced.
This debate is important because the arguments are not
clear-cut.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have heard various arguments this afternoon. The first was that people
have an average of 11 labour market interactions, but my hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham South said that that figure comes from the
past, and that the number of such interactions is likely to increase in
future rather than decrease. My hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn
mentioned similar issues, and how he expects them to increase. My hon.
Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead talked about part-time and
seasonal workers, and the hon. Member for Arfon also touched on that.
Those issues came up many times, including in the Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although they
are different from part-time and seasonal workers, the hon. Member for
West Worcestershire mentioned women who take maternity leave, and how
they will be treated under automatic enrolment. When responding to the
issue of seasonal and temporary workers, the Minister said that he was
not aware of comprehensive evidence, but he thought that what there was
showed that temporary workers are less likely to be in a pension
scheme. My argument is that such workers in particular will miss out if
there is a three-month waiting period, but they are employees and
making a meaningful contribution in their
jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East said that employers pay
national insurance and wages from day one of employment, and suggested
that they should also contribute to a pension from day one. Many people
see that as deferred income. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham
South talked about opt-out rates, and said that if someone experiences
a certain salary for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 235<a class="bkMark" name="Column235">&#160;</a>
                  </div>three months and it falls by 4% in month four, the
opt-out rate is likely to increase. He asked the Minister to keep a
close eye on the trend to ensure that the three-month waiting period
does not result in a higher opt-out rate. We all know that when we get
our take-home pay, we tend to spend it and have nothing left at the end
of the month. For many of our constituents, it is not even to the end
of the month. We know that spending patterns become entrenched and that
habits form. If someone sees a drop in income on the day that they are
automatically enrolled, my hon. Friend and I believe that opt-out rates
are likely to be
higher.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000177">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> While the minimum reduction in take-home pay
would be 4% once one is auto-enrolled, can my hon. Friend confirm that
that is always the case, or could it be more than that, because in some
employer schemes the employee contribution is higher than
4%?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000178">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes, my hon. Friend is right. The minimum amount
is 4%, but it could in reality be higher. The Minister is right to say
that people can opt in in the three-month period, but the question that
people have posed is, would they? Automatic enrolment has many values,
one of which is to build on people’s inertia and nudge them into
doing what is right for their long-term interests. Without that nudge,
it is unlikely that many of them would voluntarily enrol before their
enrolment was automatic, although I hope that they
would.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have put the case for the workers and why I believe that it is right
for them to be automatically enrolled earlier. My hon. Friends the
Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Islwyn, and the hon. Members
for Nuneaton and for High Peak have also made important points about
not burdening employers with regulations and red tape. Many members of
the Committee have said that during these difficult economic times when
we need small businesses to be the engine of growth, this might not be
the time to burden them with additional regulation. However, we also
know—the Minister has confirmed it—that smaller
businesses will not be automatically enrolling employees until much
further down the roll-out process during 2016 and 2017. We all hope
that the economy is in much better shape by then. The staging approach,
with big businesses automatically enrolling their employees first, is
the right
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
asked the Minister specific questions about the costs for businesses.
He suggested that the up-front costs for administration purposes were
in the region of hundreds of pounds, but he was not sure of the exact
numbers. It would be useful if the Committee could see those numbers at
a later stage, so that we are aware of the additional cost. All members
of the Committee have emphasised that auto-enrolment is much less of a
burden on small businesses because of the creation of NEST. The hon.
Member for High Peak talked about his visit to NEST in south London and
how he had been reassured that small businesses will not be burdened
with the regulation and red tape that he had initially feared. That is
good news for all of us, particularly for small businesses that will be
automatically enrolling employees into their
schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have had some heated debates, but the consensus is that small, medium
and large businesses value their staff and want to do the right thing.
Of course, we all 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 236<a class="bkMark" name="Column236">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have examples—from our constituencies and surgeries—of
people who are treated badly by employers of all sizes. That is
important. The Minister talked about the pressure that he came under to
exclude micro-employers. It is right that there is a level playing
field for small businesses, micro-businesses and medium and large
businesses, but there should be a level playing field in terms of
turnover of staff as well. That is one of the reasons why I would opt
for an earlier automatic enrolment date, as my hon. Friends the Member
for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Edinburgh East have also
emphasised.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Today’s
debate has been about balance. It has not been about whether automatic
enrolment is the right thing. It has not been about whether the
automatic enrolment period should be extended to six months, nine
months or a year. It has been looking at whether it should be one month
or three months and where the balance is to be found. It is a narrow
window, but it affects some 350,000 people at any one time, according
to the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When New
Zealand looked at this and introduced the KiwiSaver, they decided to
have automatic enrolment after a month. Lord Turner and his colleagues
on the Pensions Commission also determined that people should be
automatically enrolled after a month. My hon. Friend the Member for
Islwyn said that the world of work is changing. We all know that people
are likely to have more, rather than fewer, jobs in the future. That is
why a compromise of its being one month before people are automatically
enrolled is more appropriate to the changing world of work, to ensure
that more people are brought into pension saving, particularly those
who most stand to benefit from it—those who change jobs more
frequently and those who work for smaller businesses. One month is a
compromise that strikes the balance between employers and employees in
a fairer and right way. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000184">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This clause need not detain us too long. It is about
the timing of automatic re-enrolment, which the Committee will know was
originally proposed to be after three years, with the facility for a
firm to delay by three months beyond that. The clause simply allows the
firm to allow re-enrolment three months before that, at 2 years and 9
months. That is a straightforward easement. Given the conversations we
have had, that will increase pension saving. The essential point of
this is flexibility. That is a small but welcome
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000211">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 8 relates to the way in which the earnings
trigger and the qualifying earnings band are reviewed each year. The
Committee will recall that we have now made a distinction between the
threshold at which someone is auto-enrolled and the band of earnings on
which the auto-enrolment duties form. In our conception, they are now
two different numbers and the clause relates to the basis on which the
two are
set.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
2008 Act introduced earnings-related uprating of what was then a single
threshold. We have obviously deviated those two numbers from each other
so we now have two numbers to set. However, the previous Bill locked in
rises in that threshold to average earnings—in fact, the average
earnings basis used to update the additional state pension. One of the
issues that our 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 238<a class="bkMark" name="Column238">&#160;</a>
                  </div>auto-enrolment review advised us was that we needed a bit more
flexibility to move away from the lock in earnings, so the clause
replaces the earnings-related uprating power under section 14 of the
2008 Act with the power of the Secretary of State to review. He can
and, indeed, should have regard to several factors when he undertakes
the review, such as the level of prices, the level of earnings, the
level of the basic state pension, tax and national insurance
thresholds, and other relevant
factors.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to have flexibility. We need to keep the thresholds up to
date and relevant. The employer duty starts next year. We could not
reliably calculate all the figures we need now, and clearly the
financial landscape changes. The basis on which tax allowances are set,
national insurance thresholds are set and pensions are set are
constantly moving feasts and if we tie the auto-enrolment thresholds to
a single feature of the system that is doing something else, there is a
danger that we will have the wrong number—the number that does
not best serve our
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Johnson review suggested that the trigger should be in line with the
PAYE tax threshold. We argued that there was a good reason for that,
but that the lower limit of qualifying earnings should link to the
primary threshold for national insurance and that the upper limit
should rise in line with average earnings. Although we welcome those
recommendations and recognise that there is a lot of sense in them, we
do not want to be bound by them rigidly from one year to the next. The
clause therefore provides that we review the thresholds annually to
ensure that the right group is auto-enrolled. The Committee will see,
however, that the clause also provides a power for an annual debate on
the measures, which will be subject to affirmative procedure. The
Secretary of State will review the threshold rates, having regard to
the factors in the clause and other relevant factors, and he will bring
to the House recommendations, which must then be
debated.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000240">&#160;</a>

list of factors that the Secretary of State must have regard to. He
must also have regard to other relevant factors, one of which is risk
of confusion by having different thresholds. The irony is that we are
putting right in the Bill precisely what she refers to. The
£5,035 uprated figure is not the same as anything in the system,
so we are taking out a number that does not match anything. The figures
in the Bill match—certainly, the £7,475 matches the PAYE
threshold—and the Secretary of State will be mindful of

of State’s decision will be taken well ahead of the start of the

a duty to apply national insurance and tax above particular thresholds.
There will be a process for notifying employers of thresholds of this
sort. We have indicated the general

                  </strong> I have a couple of questions that build on what my
hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South said. The Minister has
discussed the different ways in which the trigger can be changed in
line with prices, earnings, tax and national insurance thresholds, and
state pensions. What notice period will people receive? How far ahead
of time will they know what the thresholds are? Perhaps I should know
this, but will the Minister confirm whether the provisions relate both
to the threshold at which people are automatically enrolled and the
earnings on which it falls?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000244">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Most
importantly, we discussed today how the threshold for automatic
enrolment will be linked—certainly in the next time
period—to the PAYE threshold. I have reservations about that,
which were expressed in my earlier amendment, especially if the PAYE
threshold increases, as relates to the amendment on which we have just
voted. The advantage of the link is that at least it is not
complicated—although neither was our proposal to link both to
the national insurance threshold. Will the Minister elaborate on how he
and the Secretary of State will decide how to increase the trigger and
qualifying earnings band? Can he give some certainty about
administrative ease and fairness so that we know that the level at
which people are automatically enrolled will not
rocket?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000245">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I shall take the hon. Lady’s questions in
order. On the notice period, the uprating will be done in January for
April, which is the usual process of uprating for the following year.
Most payrolls use payroll software, which all the figures will go into.
The Pensions Regulator will issue guidance to those employers who must
comply with the duty, and he will ensure that they know what the figure
is. I stress that employers are used to getting new numbers at the
start of a new financial year for all sorts of reasons; this will be
another number—or not, as the case may be.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
covers both the review of the earnings trigger and the qualifying
earnings band. The hon. Lady asked whether we could go mad and jack up
the figures by huge amounts and exclude many people. All we know at
present about the tax allowance is the rate that the Chancellor
announced for 2012; we do not know anything beyond that and I cannot
pre-empt what he will announce. However, there is a coalition agreement
commitment to head towards a tax threshold of £10,000. The
Johnson review specifically states that he does not think that a
nominal tax allowance of £10,000 by the end of the
Parliament—not today, it is important to stress that—is
out of the spirit of the sorts of thresholds that he considered to
strike the right balance between not excluding too many people and
keeping down the burden on
firms.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000247">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I make no apology for a significant increase in the
tax-free threshold—that is the basis on which I stood for
election. The hon. Lady is right; it will have a significant impact,
but we should bear in mind that we are talking about nominal, not real
earnings. The lower earnings limit, or the primary threshold which I
think she wanted to use, would be linked to nominal average earnings
over three or four years, and who knows by how much they will
increase—it could easily be by 4% or 5% a year for three or four
years. <em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> Well, if inflation is about
4% at the moment, and real earnings growth returns and headline
inflation comes down, I would have thought that nominal average
earnings growth in that territory is not implausible. We can argue 3.5%
or 4% or whatever, but my point is that it is wrong to compare
£10,000 with current figures. The nominal increase is of about
20% over another three years or so. Yes, it will go up the income
scale—that is the point of the income tax policy, to take people
out of income
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000249">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are not proposing to stick rigidly to that in clause 8 but
we are instead giving ourselves the power to do an annual review. To
answer the hon. Lady’s question, therefore, each year we will
look at the relevant premises of the system and at what would be a
threshold that strikes the right balance between burdens on business
and excluding people who we might want to keep enrolled. If for tax,
national insurance or pensions policy reasons, the thresholds do
something, we would not be bound, as we were previously, only to index
the number we first thought of—that is the flexibility we have
in the clause and which I think the House wants. However, an impact
assessment will be done to inform the affirmative resolution debate, so
there is plenty of scope for scrutiny and assessment, which is only
right and proper, because the decision is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000250">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hope that the clause is not the most contentious
in the Bill. It is about rounding—the legal provisions for
rounding the figures for the earnings trigger and the qualifying
earnings band. Although the figures that we have been quoting are
annual figures and sound nice and round, when they are divided by
12 or by 52 they stop being round, and the clause contains
interesting but relatively uncontentious powers about whether such
figures should be rounded up or down, or to the nearest 10p.
Essentially, section 13 of the Pensions Act 2008 established the
principle that pro rata weekly or monthly figures may be applied
instead of the annual rate, and clause 5 introduces the same principle
for the auto-enrolment earnings trigger. As I am sure is apparent to
the Committee, clause 9 will insert a new section into the 2008 Act to
allow those pro rata figures to be rounded up or down. That means that
when new rates are set to match PAYE or national insurance
contributions thresholds, we can match them exactly if we so wish. The
clause is uncontentious and I commend it to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000258">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
is certification all about? The idea is that firms have to auto-enrol a
set of workers, but what do they auto-enrol them into? They have to
auto-enrol them into a scheme that is good enough. It does not have to
be perfect; it has to be good enough. The 2008 Act envisaged certain
quality thresholds for schemes that satisfy auto-enrolment quality
standards. The problem with the 2008 Act is that it is quite rigid,
which is a recurrent theme. A firm might have a pretty decent scheme,
but if it did not exactly fit with what the Government thought it
should look like, the firm would fail the pretty decent scheme
test—as it is known in the trade. The employer would then have
to amend the scheme to fit the Government’s framework or think,
“Blow this for a game of soldiers—I will shut my scheme
and do the bare minimum.” We want to avoid the situation of
firms that are running schemes that are good enough feeling moved to
close them or to level
down.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
idea of certification and the reforms in the clause is that we will
allow different sorts of schemes to pass the good enough test. We are
proposing a range of thresholds to allow schemes to be certified as
good enough, and there are three variants. First, if a firm provides 9%
of basic pay, its scheme is good enough. Auto-enrolment is based on one
definition of pay—on earnings in the band above the
£5,000-odd threshold—but many pensions are based on
another definition of pay, such as basic pay, which can create problems
in that basic pay might be very different from total pay, because of
overtime and bonuses. We do not want an employer who is running a
basically decent scheme to have to shut it or amend it because of those
differences in definition. Therefore, in response to a lot of
consultation, tier 1 of the certification test, which we will be
introduced in regulations, states that if at least 9% of basic pay is
put in, including at least 4% from the employer, the firm will have a
tick as being good
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
if the firm contributes at least 8% of basic pay, including a 3%
employer contribution, that will also be good enough. Thirdly, if the
firm contributes at least 7% of total earnings—basic pay plus
bonuses, overtime and so on—including 3% from the employer, that
will again be good enough. That is different from the 8% of band
earnings, which is the bit above the uprated £5,000 or whatever
the threshold finally is. As I said, the certification test is to give
firms that run schemes that are good enough but do not exactly fit our
blueprint a tick in the box, so that they can get on with running those
pension schemes and making widgets.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clearly, some
people in some firms will get less money put into their pension because
we have made that easement. For some individuals, 8% of band earnings
will be more than what is allowed under the certification rules, and
the question is whether we are disadvantaging too many people. We did
not design the thresholds and come up with numbers off the back of a
fag packet; they were based on studying basic pay, total pay and what
firms were putting in, and making a careful analysis of that. We always
intended for the vast majority of workers to do better—or as
well—in these tests as they would have done in the original
tests.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000268">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
was a debate on this issue at some length in another place, which we
welcomed and found helpful. It was suggested that reassurance was
needed that the new certification tests will not water down the
protection received by workers. We therefore tabled amendment 9 and the
linked new clause, which will ensure that over 90% of employees, based
on survey data, will do better or as well in each of these tests as
they would have done in the original tests. We have looked at the
annual survey of hours and earnings for private sector firms, and
applied the two tests—the original 8% of band earnings test and
the different tiered tests. With the tier 1 test, we found
that 95% of employee jobs will get as much money or more; with the tier
2 test, that was true for 91% of employee jobs. It must also be true
for the tier 3 test because that involves 7% of total earnings. Any
individual to whom that tier applies will save at least as much as they
would have done had contributions been calculated using qualifying
earnings.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000269">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I applaud the work done by the Minister and the
evidence that he has cited. He gives the percentages of those who are
likely to be better off, and I am pleased with those numbers. Does the
evidence suggest that those who will not be better off belong to a
particular group? Will it be those right at the top, for example, or
those right at the bottom? I have worked for firms where people on
lower incomes have a lower proportion of their income paid into a
pension by both employer and employee. Is there a risk of that
happening?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000270">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It is good
that schemes that pay in from pound one are not invalid under this
scheme because they do not fit specifically into the banded earnings.
From his conversations with employers, can the Minister tell us what
proportion of businesses will pay in from pound one? Will most wish to
do that, or will they prefer to use banded
earnings?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000271">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The answer will be different for each of the tiers.
Some involve payment from pound one, and some take differential account
of overtime. To clarify, tier 1 involves 9% of basic pay and tier 2
involves 8% of basic pay. There is, however, a second condition that I
forgot to read out a minute ago and the record will look a bit bizarre.
As I was reading it, I thought, “How can that provision be as
good as the other one?”, but the second requirement for tier 2
is that basic pay must be at least 85% of total pay. We do not want
manipulation or a situation in which somebody reduces basic pay to
nothing and pays everybody in bonuses—or does the
opposite—and thereby gets round the rules. That is why we have
the different tiers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One problem
with private sector occupational DC schemes at the moment is that many
would fail the tests under discussion. These tests are not watered
down. For tier 1, we think that around 50% of private sector DC schemes
would pass and 50% would fail. It is not a weak test and requires a
certain amount. We think that about 25% of private sector schemes would
pass either tier 2 or tier 3 tests.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In terms of
the people who do not get as much, we do not have strong evidence
either way, but it will be different for each scheme according to
whether account is taken of total pay, basic pay or whatever. In terms
of how many schemes use contributions from pound one, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 244<a class="bkMark" name="Column244">&#160;</a>
                  </div>my anecdotal impression is that it is quite common
for schemes to be based on that. We think that people might use
certification to have a scheme, which could be NEST, from the first
pound so that some of the matters that we discussed earlier about when
people fluctuate above and below thresholds will not be an issue for
the firm, because it will just pay 7% or whatever it is every month. It
will not have to worry about whether someone is above or below the
threshold, or about re-enrolling, waiting periods and so on. It will
just say, “Blow this, we’ll just put 7% in every
month.” That will be possible because of certification, but if
it had to be 8% of band earnings, it might not have that
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000274">&#160;</a>

response. I would expect the majority of employers who currently
contribute to a pension scheme to pay from pound one. That is certainly
my experience from talking to employers, and it would be good to think
that they might do so under automatic enrolment. I realise that there
might not be any quantitative analysis as we do not yet have automatic
enrolment, but having talked to NEST, I wonder whether the
Minister’s understanding is that many employers who do not
currently have schemes might consider automatically enrolling from
pound
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000275">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The short answer is that we have not had a
significant amount of feedback to that effect, but as we discussed a
moment ago, it might be attractive. Although it might be slightly more
expensive to pay 7% from pound one or whatever, it might make life a
lot simpler for firms, and that is partly the point of the
exercise.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
might stop there. Although I could speak about the clause, I want to
focus on the amendments, which are in response to discussion in the
other place, and seek to provide the reassurance that we will regulate
to provide easements, but that we will check annually against the data
for the survey of hours and earnings to ensure that we are meeting the
90% threshold all the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000277">&#160;</a>

on the success of automatic enrolment, it would useful to see what the
proportion of paying in is from pound one, the lower earnings limit, or
some other limit. That will say a lot about how much employers have
engaged with it, and, as the Minister said, the burden on business
could be reduced if fewer people are moving in and out of NEST,
especially if there are high set-up costs for moving someone into NEST
and then perhaps taking them
out.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000278">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is certainly the case that if an employer is
using certification easements to get clearance from the regulator that
they are compliant, we will have statistical data on that, and I am

appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000279">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On
reflection, I have ranged fairly freely over the clause, but in summary
the key thing that it will do when it is amended, as we hope it will be
shortly by amendment 9 and new clause 2, is to give us the power to
introduce a certification test for employers for money purchase
schemes, personal pension schemes, and the money purchase equivalent
element of hybrid schemes, and it requires the Secretary of State
periodically to review operation of the test. I have described the test
and the easements, and our proposed amendment. Let me make it clear
what the test is.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000280">&#160;</a>

Secretary of State will be satisfied before publishing regulations that
no more than 10% of individuals will receive contributions less than
the statutory minimum. The key point of clause 10 is that it allows
employers to continue to calculate their pension contributions on their
scheme definition instead of switching to band earnings, and the
alternative tests broadly replicate the minimum quality requirements
for money purchase and personal pension schemes, and the money purchase
element of hybrids. We are trying to protect individuals but give
flexibility to employers. I hope that the Committee accepts that the
clause takes us in the right direction, and that amendment 9 will
provide the reassurance that has been sought by hon. Members, and in
another

allow employers to make improvements, where the powers in the trust
deed and rules are limited, to their money purchase schemes and certain
hybrids, by increasing contributions, the basis on which they are

make it easier for employers with certain trust schemes to comply with

certain trust-based schemes administered by a manager might find it
difficult to modify their scheme if the trust deed and the rules were

Bill runs to, but we do not have 256 clauses
—prohibits a trustee or manager of an occupational or personal
pension scheme from taking money from the scheme to pay for a fine as a
result of a conviction or penalty, and rightly so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000301">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Clause
14 also prevents trustees or managers from being reimbursed from the
scheme for payment, and this includes indemnity insurance. Sections 40
and 41 of the Pensions Act 2008 introduced fixed and escalating
penalties in preparation for auto-enrolment. Section 256
prohibition should have been extended to cover the 2008 Act penalties,
but was not. Clause 14 closes that loophole and extends section 256 of
the Pensions Act 2004 so that it covers fixed and escalating
penalties introduced by sections 40 and 41 of the Pensions Act 2008.
The effect of the new clause is to prohibit pension scheme trustees or
managers from paying penalties that they are personally liable for out
of scheme funds, and as a result reducing members’
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000302">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will talk about why such prohibition is needed. For automatic enrolment
to work, the Pensions Regulator must be able to take effective
enforcement action against trustees and managers where necessary. As a
last resort, penalty notices could be issued, and the deterrent effect
of penalty notices is nullified if recipients simply take the money out
of the scheme. The thinking behind that prohibition is fairly clear. I
can reassure the Committee that there have not been any prosecutions
under section 256, and that is how we want to keep it.
However, we want to ensure that we have a deterrent effect and
therefore clause 14 corrects that omission in the auto-enrolment world.
I commend clause 14 to the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000303">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Sections 21
and 23 of the Pensions Act 2008 set out the quality requirements for
defined-benefits schemes used by employers to discharge their enrolment
duties. Quality requirements are based on a test of overall scheme
quality, which requires employers to compare the pensions from their
scheme against a benchmark or model scheme. For some schemes this will
be against a test scheme. Certain defined-benefits schemes, in which a
member accrues an entitlement to a sum of money to be used to secure a
pension within the scheme or purchase an annuity, have been
inappropriately classified as hybrid schemes when compared to the
benchmark test scheme. This erroneous categorisation means that those
schemes are being regulated in a way that is inconsistent with the
definition of hybrid scheme in the legislation. As a result, the
existing regulations could be outside the scope of the Secretary of
State’s powers, and we do not want that. That is ultra vires, as
it says in my
notes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000309">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 1 is essentially minor and technical. It amends sections 22 and
23 of the Pensions Act 2008 by including a reference to such schemes
and introducing a regulation-making power that will enable the
Secretary of State to provide for the detailed requirements for a test
scheme for such schemes. The introduction of a new equivalent test
scheme will allow the test scheme to operate as a straightforward
benchmark for employers to use for their previously mis-classified
defined-benefits
schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000310">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall clarify the effect of the new clause. The quality requirements
have been set at a level that balances promoting individual
responsibility for saving towards retirement with ensuring that
workplace pensions remain affordable for employers. The new clause will
correct an error by ensuring that a certain type of defined-benefits
scheme, incorrectly classified as hybrid, can be treated as a
defined-benefits scheme and meet the test scheme standard for
defined-benefits schemes. It does that by inserting a regulation-making
power under section 23, which enables the Secretary of State to
prescribe further features of the test scheme under regulations. I
stress that the reclassification does not alter the quality
requirements for those schemes, except that the quality requirement is
now provided for under the legislation relating to defined-benefits
schemes rather than the legislation relating to hybrid schemes. I

relating to some of the international aspects of pensions. If Committee
members consider that we been discussing technical minutiae, I have to
tell them that once we start to debate people who work in one country,
contribute in another, earn in another and are employed in another,
matters become very difficult. We want to ensure that, in a world of

is the issue? There is a potential for tension between the regulations

                  </div>directive—into domestic law and the
subsequent duties under the 2008 Act on employers to automatically
enrol UK workers into a workplace pension scheme. So there is a
potential conflict between IORP—which we talk about a lot in the
pensions world, sadly—and the 2008 Act, which
provides a duty on UK firms to employ UK
workers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000318">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
2004 Act and the cross-border regulations require the trustees and
occupational pension scheme to go through an approvals procedure before
they can offer pension services to an employer of a worker who is
subject to the social and labour laws of another European economic area
state. Once approved, the scheme must comply with those laws. It can be
complex and costly for trustees to comply with the cross-border
provisions, and schemes may refuse to admit workers who trigger the
application of those provisions. A scheme may say, “No, we are
not going to let you into ours because we would have to provide
benefits that are to do with the labour laws and
the minimum standards of another state, and that is too much hassle.
We’re not going to do
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000319">&#160;</a>

purpose of new clause 4 is to provide a regulation-making power. It
would enable the Secretary of State to provide that the automatic
enrolment duties under the 2008 Act do not apply in the case of a
person’s employment of workers who trigger the application of
the cross-border provisions. Those regulations, if we chose to make
them—at this stage we want to give ourselves the power to make
them, so that we can do more work and examine the scale of the
problem—could be made at any time, if necessary, before the
onset of the employer duties in October 2012. New clause 4 would
provide the Secretary of State with that regulation-making power.
Without such a power, some employers may find it impossible to comply
with the employer
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000320">&#160;</a>

are still assessing the character and scale of the problem. It affects
a small number of cases—potentially, however, 30,000 to 35,000
people. If we put an employer in an impossible position, that has got
to be a bad thing, even if it “only” affects 30,000 to
35,000 people. Those people may trigger cross-border activity. It may
include people who are seconded to work in another country, but who do
not acquire rights as a qualifying person, or individuals who may
already be in a pension scheme. It will affect less than 0.5% of people
who will be automatically enrolled.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000321">&#160;</a>

that the process can be complex and costly for trustees to comply with
cross-border requirements, and as I said, schemes may refuse to admit
workers who trigger the application of those provisions. Approval to
operate across borders can take a number of months. Statutory
requirements are for the regulator to submit an application to the host
state within three months of obtaining the necessary documentation.

of all those cross-border duties. We could require an employer to put
someone into a pension, but the employer could be unable to find a
pension to put them into. We do not want to put employers in that
position. We could be talking about some 30,000 to 35,000 people, but
as I have indicated, some of those people could already be in a pension
scheme, so the real number involved is likely to be lower.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000327">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I tabled new clauses 6 and 10 because they deal
with fees and charges and protection of pensions and pension schemes.
My aim is to ensure that any scheme to which an employee is
automatically enrolled is fit for purpose and of a high quality.
Employers can choose from a range of schemes, including NEST. As we
have heard today, those of us who have visited NEST are quite
impressed—it is easy to run, easy to access and value for
money—but there is nothing to stop an employer choosing an
inappropriate pension scheme, unsuitable for their
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 6 is designed to provoke a debate on the charging structure for
workplace pension schemes. Consumer groups such as Which? are
particularly concerned about the increase in charges levied by some
insurance companies for people who change jobs. Which? research has
found that some companies are charging 0.5% to 0.7% in annual
management charges to active members but, once the person leaves, the
charges can then double to 1.2% to 1.5%. Many people move jobs from
time to time, and around 60% of people who start contributing to group
personal pensions have stopped contributions after four years. A
substantial proportion of people will end up paying higher charges, far
exceeding the charges that they would be paying were they involved in
NEST. Such high charges could have a big impact on the pension received
by the consumer, and would be counterproductive to what we are trying
to achieve, which is renewed confidence in pension schemes. Insurance
companies that operate the practice call it an active member discount,
but a more appropriate name would be a deferred member penalty. Whether
the change needed is regulatory or legislative, the Government need to
address the fact that no one seems to be looking after the interests of
past employees, or deferred members. Varying annual management charges
through the introduction of extra charges for deferred members is a
transfer penalty, penalising people who switch from job to
job.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000339">&#160;</a>

temporary jobs, which we have been discussing today, once automatic
enrolment is rolled out, is her expectation that even more deferred
members, if not in NEST, will potentially incur such
surcharges?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000340">&#160;</a>

workplace personal pension provides good value for

               <p class="hs_brev">“if
the research shows that charging levels are creeping up, we
have the power under the Pensions Act 2008 to regulate to

               <p class="tabbed">Research
by Which? on deferred member penalties demonstrated that charges are
already high in comparison with NEST, and I would like to know
precisely at what point the Government might step in. Will the Minister
clarify the governance and regulation around these issues, so that we
can work together to find a solution that is best for employees and
supports
employers?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000344">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
new clause 10, it is important that automatic enrolment increases
access to good value pension schemes for all employees. As we have
heard during our discussions, too many employees have no pension cover
at all. There must be no reduction in consumer protection, and the
experience of stakeholder pensions shows that the best way of ensuring
that is through product regulation. Consumer groups such as Which? have
pointed out that most consumers find pension charges difficult to
understand and would find it difficult to know whether their pension
scheme offers a good deal. The new clause would require all qualifying
schemes to meet existing stakeholder standards. That would help ensure
that all pensions sold to employers as qualifying schemes would meet
certain basic standards, including a charge cap of 1.5% a year for the
first 10 years and 1% thereafter. There would also be restrictions on
transfer penalties to avoid pension companies using hidden or complex
charging structures to lock employees into poor value
pensions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000345">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
introduction of stakeholder pensions was successful in preventing the
mis-selling of poor value pensions and charges were brought down. One
impressive thing about NEST is its ability to talk in plain English.
Its leaflets and the information that will go out to employees mentions
high risk rather than high return. People might think that high return
sounds like a good thing, but they may actually be looking at a high
risk. NEST will not use the words “low risk” when
describing pension funds because, as it says, no investment
is  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 254<a class="bkMark" name="Column254">&#160;</a>
                  </div>completely low risk or has no risk. Instead of low risk, NEST will talk
about low return, and the use of language that is clear and
readily understood is a welcome initiative.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">No members of
the Committee, and especially the Minister, would want a situation in
which pensions are mis-sold. Often, however, mis-selling takes many
years to come to light. Bearing in mind the resistance that business
has to further regulation, will the Minister assure the Committee that
there will be sufficient regulation to ensure that inappropriate
pensions are not sold in the first place, rather than regulations being
introduced after the
event?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000347">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The new clauses are important and raise the issue
of the charging structure for workplace personal pensions. I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead for tabling them. The
new clauses seek to ensure that the scheme into which an employee is
automatically enrolled is fit for purpose and high quality. Employers
can choose from a range of schemes including NEST, but there is nothing
to stop a disengaged employer from choosing an inappropriate pension
scheme that is unsuitable for their employees. The new clauses seek to
address that risk.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some groups
are concerned that without some form of regulation, the programme of
automatic enrolment could be undermined. The Royal Society of Arts
recently stated that<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the view that
less regulation is required, is deeply dangerous for the success of
pension auto-enrolment. Further, the view that action can be taken if
it seems pensions are mis-sold, forgets that if these pensions are
found to have been mis-sold, this will result in individuals
withdrawing from pension provision. But much of the mis-selling may not
come to light, because, as with endowments, it can take many years, if
ever, for such mis-selling to become apparent. If we know what
constitutes an inappropriate pension, this should be regulated against
before it is sold, not after the mischief has taken
place.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000378">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore,
new clauses 6 and 10 seek to introduce some form of regulation to make
automatic enrolment work for both employees and employers, who have to

0.3%, although with a 1.8% contribution levy at the start to cover
costs, levelling out to 0.48% overall, which will decrease in 20 years
once the loan has been paid off. The 0.48% level is comparable to the
0.4% to 0.6% annual management charges that can be expected,
excluding commission. However, there are some serious worries about how
other schemes will be regulated and the fees that they will be allowed

               <p class="tabbed">More
generally, fees and charges are central to trust and predictability,
which are important in long-term financial planning, and therefore
particularly for pensions. The fact that someone who has saved
throughout their employment stands to lose a potentially substantial
proportion of their income as a result of hidden fees and charges
erodes trust in savings. It also damages the predictability of
retirement income, and therefore erodes the likelihood of getting
people into the habit of saving and to trust that those savings will
result in a decent pension income in retirement. Predictability and
trust must play a part in ensuring that people have adequate pensions
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000358">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the world of the stakeholder pension, there are some safeguards for the
employee about the level of fees and charges that can be expected.
Those safeguards do not, however, carry across to the automatic
enrolment schemes outside of NEST. New clause 10 explores the
possibility of encouraging the employer to take safeguards into account
when choosing a scheme. It is important to consider the proposal,
because automatic enrolment changes the nature of employers who are
providing a pension. Neither the employers nor the employees are
necessarily sophisticated consumers. Many of them will have little
experience of pensions, yet they are being asked to make big decisions
that might result in accusations of mis-selling later down the
line.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000359">&#160;</a>

employer schemes have been involved in mis-selling scandals that have
eroded trust and confidence in savings. Many employers will make a
positive contribution and will search for the best options for their
employees because they recognise the value of giving them proper and
decent workplace pensions. However, small businesses are worried about
the regulatory burden. Limited capacity might frustrate the best
intentions and some employers might not act in their employees’
best interests. The biggest concern, however, is the information
available to employers and the regulation of the schemes that they have
the opportunity of choosing.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000360">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Many
of the reforms are designed to allow for the practicalities of a small
business, which is welcome, and they are supported by employer groups.
When the measure was mooted and then presented in the Bill,
it became clear that employers were not necessarily in the best
position from which to protect their employees from hidden fees and
charges. We must ensure that protection applies in relation to the
level of fees and charges that an employee can expect.
Again, drawing on the evidence of the RSA, studies have revealed an
average cost of 1.53% in smaller funds, which equates to up to 40% of
the possible pension value over its lifetime
being consumed in fees and charges. Clearly, when neither
employer nor employee understands pension charges, dangers to the
consumer are increased. If people find that their savings are whittled
away by excessive charges because of the options selected by
their employer, the very aims of automatic enrolment might
be threatened.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000361">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead for tabling new clause
6, which addresses particular concern about the increase in charges
levied by some companies when people change jobs. The new clause calls
for employers to be required to take into account the level of such
fees and charges when deciding their contributions level. My hon.
Friend referred to Which?<em> </em>research, which has found that some
companies charge an annual management fee of between 0.5% and 0.7% for
active members. When a member leaves, however, the charges might double
to between 1.2% and 1.5%. According to Which?<em>,</em> given that 60% of
people who start contributing to group personal pensions stop doing so
after four years, mainly due to job changes, a substantial proportion
of people might end up paying those higher charges, which would far
exceed the charges that they would have been paid in to NEST, which
applies no higher charges for non-active members.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000362">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such high
charges might have a big impact on the pension received by consumers,
which might have reduced at their retirement by approximately 25%. The
insurance companies that operate the practice call it an active member
discount, but Which?, my hon. Friend and I agree that the more
appropriate title would be a deferred member penalty. Does the Minister
accept that whether the change is regulatory or legislative change, the
Financial Services Authority and the Government must address the
genuine concern that no one is looking after the interests of past
employees or deferred members? Does he accept that such extra charges
are currently penalising people who regularly switch
employer?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000363">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is also
serious concern about the FSA’s proposals to allow employers to
negotiate consultancy charges with their advisers, which would be
deducted from their employees’ pension pots. There is a clear
risk that excessive deductions might be negotiated with the employer to
the detriment of the employee—the future retiree. The FSA has
confirmed that it has no problem with deductions being made of up to
35% of the first year’s group personal pension contributions.
Does the Minister agree that either there must be more highly specified
quality requirements, or employers must receive better advice, with
advisers being required to benchmark charges against those in NEST,
which are much lower, to ensure that the workplace personal pension
provides good value for money?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000364">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">During the
debate in the other place, the Minister with responsibility for welfare
reform said that<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000365">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“if the research
shows that charging levels are creeping up, we have the power under the
Pensions Act 2008 to regulate to set a…cap for qualifying
schemes and auto-enrolment schemes.”—[<em>Official Report,
House of Lords, </em>3 March 2011; Vol. 725, c.
GC249.]<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000385">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In the
light of those comments, will the Minister explain what steps he is
taking to research the level of charges and fees in qualifying schemes
and auto-enrolment schemes? Will they be actively monitored and, if
necessary, acted on in advance of the review in 2017? Will the Minister
explain at what point he would deem it necessary and appropriate for
the Government to regulate under the 2008 Act if excessive charges are
applied by automatic enrolment schemes outside
NEST?<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
new clauses would be important to ensuring the success of
auto-enrolment, and I welcome our discussion on Thursday. I hope that
the Minister agrees that if we want automatic enrolment to succeed, we
must also ensure that the scheme into which an employee is
automatically enrolled is fit for purpose, of high quality and
transparent. We must also ensure that it is not exposed to excessive
fees or charges that might erode the value of the pension and undermine
trust in pensions. That will be important if automatic enrolment is to
work and to carry the confidence of both the people who are most likely
to benefit from it and the employers, who have to make important
decisions for their employees without always having the necessary
expertise and experience that larger firms
have.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000367">&#160;</a>

I want to apologise to the Committee that during the scramble of the
last seven or eight clauses, I moved Government amendment 9 to clause
10, but because I spoke about clause 10, I did not correctly describe
new clause 2, which we were also discussing. I had already written to
the Committee to explain what it does, but I want to read into the
record that the purpose of new clause 2 is to give employers offering
pension schemes, such as money purchase ones, where the scheme has its
main administration in a member state of the European economic area,
the option of self-certifying that their scheme meets the relevant
quality requirement. To clarify, the purpose of the new clause, about
which I had already written to the Committee, is to give the small
number of schemes in the EEA the power to self-certify. I apologise for
any confusion that I may have created. I am sure that other members of
the Committee had spotted my mistake, and I wanted to correct the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="1107139000369">&#160;</a>
