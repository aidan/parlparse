<P>
Amendments made: No. 129, in page 24, line 41, leave out `industrial' and insert `employment' .
<P>
No. 256, in page 25, line 10, leave out `34'.--[Mr. Ian McCartney.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 25, line 11, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
The amendment deals with a complex area of law, and we must probe the Government's intentions. I cannot believe that the matter needs to be referred to the Low Pay Commission; it concerns jurisdictions and sectors to be covered or otherwise, and how the clause will operate.
<P>
Labour Members have a certain sensitivity when the word ``offshore'' is mentioned. Before the position of the Paymaster General became a matter of public debate, I led on Treasury matters in a Statutory Instruments Committee debate on offshore activities in Labuan--learned members of the Committee will know it as former British North Borneo--with which we concluded a revised double-tax agreement. In that case, and this, offshore had nothing to do with tax havens, but with harvesting oil or gas from the continental shelf. That viable, buoyant and well-paid industry is a British success story.
<P>
Does the Minister of State anticipate a significant impact if the national minimum wage is extended offshore? Given the exchanges we had under Mr. Atkinson's chairmanship this morning, it would be helpful if the Minister addressed potential anomalies over inclusion and exclusion. For example, the armed forces will be excluded. Will oil workers be included? If not, why not? Will other offshore workers be included?
<P>
It would also be helpful, not least because of my responsibility for keeping an eye on the energy industries, if the Minister said whether adverse representations have been made. Most workers will be paid substantially more than the minimum wage. I have only one reservation about that, which follows this morning's exchanges about extended hours, particularly the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley). It is not clear how many hours persons on rigs are said to be on duty. By definition, they are away from home. The definition of offshore employment in the clause is intended to secure the participation of such workers in the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> As my hon. Friend is asking pertinent questions, will he also ask what pay reference periods the Minister anticipates will be used? There are periods of intense work on offshore rigs and periods of nominal contracted hours spent in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a pertinent comment. The debate is not designed to overturn the Minister's broad concept in the way that he so comprehensively did himself this morning in relation to the armed forces. We are not saying, ``Thou shalt not extend the Bill offshore''. There are probably strong arguments in equity for doing so, but it would be useful to know the Minister's intentions and for him to clarify the points about extended hours and pay reference periods.
<P>
My other concern, which is enshrined in the amendment, is the question of jurisdiction. I am not clear how that should operate. I know that Orders in Council are difficult beings. Without dilating, I recall our concerns in the previous Administration about the status of Rockall, which engaged several Government Departments for a long time as to whether we should renounce our claim to that territory. I do not think that that is privileged information. [Interruption.] I missed that.
<P>
An Order in Council is a complex procedure. I want to be clear about the jurisdiction--I am sure the Minister will take me through the matter. The measure extends to British nationals and I believe that it is intended to extend to foreign nationals working on British rigs. I notice that a degree of dissent may be being communicated to the Minister on that point. Difficulties may arise with the splendid concept of the ``cross-boundary petroleum field''. My understanding is that unless there is a specific exclusion within the provision of the Orders in Council, we are asserting an extra-territorial jurisdiction, which covers the UK sector of the continental shelf and beyond.
<P>
There may be perfectly sensible reasons for that. I imagine that the Minister would not want to encourage courts to participate in evidential disputes about whether Patrice from Calais had been working at one end of the rig or the other according to whether that was in the British sector during the relevant pay reference period. I am sorry to nit pick, but it is important to get that matter right.
<P>
There is also the question of overlapping jurisdictions. Patrice, to use my example, may, if he is a French national, be subject to the salaire minimum interprofessional garanti. There may be untidiness about whether the French minimum wage rules apply, overlapping the British rules, and, if so, who would enforce which rules and whether the individual rig operator might be in jeopardy under both sets of rules.
<P>
The amendment would remove subsection (4), which refers to jurisdiction, presumably in terms of enforcement. It is not clear what that means. I presume that it would enable a British employment tribunal to hear a case that was defined as being within the British sphere of influence, but would not prevent other tribunal proceedings that were not connected to that sphere or possibly overlapped with it.
<P>
We do not intend to entrap the Minister in a legal minefield or put him adrift on the Sargasso sea. We are trying to probe what he would like to do about the North sea in lay terms. Whom does he want to bring in and whom might he exclude? We would appreciate it if he prefaced his remarks with a health warning and did not commit himself indelibly to a particular course of action.
<P>
We would also be grateful if the Minister said a little more about the cat's cradle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities. Clearly, we do not want an individual to shop for legal forums to find the best deal. That might disrupt industrial relations in regard to the national minimum wage or other aspects of employment law.
<P>
This is a probing amendment and is important to have some assurance that the Department has thought about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I will detain the Committee for only a moment because, once again, I have to display my ignorance. I do not understand the purpose of certain provisions in clause 39. On this occasion, the explanation in the notes on clauses offers little more than that in the Bill and will not help us or those who study the Bill later.
<P>
I have three questions, First, subsection (3)(e)--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Ah. The hon. Gentleman is being very precise and has therefore ruled himself out of order. The amendment is very precise and deals with subsection (4). The hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to raise questions in the clause stand part debate, but he cannot refer to other parts of the clause on this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> You are, as ever, most helpful, Mrs. Dunwoody. Only one of the three questions that I was going to ask relates to subsection (4), so I will leave the other two on one side. I am not clear under what circumstances other tribunals or courts would be prejudiced in the absence of subsection (4) by the exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal or court under the Bill? What interaction between the two is the exercise of subsection (4) intended to avoid?
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Doran </B>(Aberdeen, Central): I have a strong interest in the oil industry and I am anxious to speak on the clause. My constituency is at the centre of the oil capital of Europe.
<P>
To preface the points that I want to make on the amendment and the clause, it may be useful if I remind members of the Committee of how important the industry is in the United Kingdom. There are about 30,000 workers who work offshore in the UK sector of the North sea. Throughout the UK, there are 330,000 workers in total. I was recently involved in an exercise to pinpoint the importance of the oil industry throughout the United Kingdom. We discovered that there were more than 200 constituencies in which more than 500 people were directly or indirectly employed in the oil industry. That is a significant figure in any terms. In Aberdeen and the surrounding area, there are 56,000 oil-related jobs and many spin-offs. It is an extremely important industry for this country.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) made clear, wage rates in the oil industry are perceived as being very high. It is reasonable to ask why minimum wage legislation should apply offshore. In the main, wage rates are high in the industry. For example, there is a major shortage of technicians. An ordinary technician can at present earn more than &#163;36,000 a year in the North sea. Even in unskilled forms of work such as catering and stewarding, the standard rate is between &#163;18,000 and &#163;19,000.
<P>
In answer to a question asked by the hon. Member for Daventry, I inform the Committee that offshore workers normally work on a two-week working cycle, which means two weeks on, two weeks off. Some companies use a three-week cycle. Most workers who are on such a cycle will work a 12-hour day, seven days a week. That is quite a lengthy period of work. For the record, I should say that United Kingdom offshore workers work longer than any other offshore workers in Europe. They work about 2,400 annualised hours. That contrasts, for example, with Norwegian workers, who work about 1,600 hours.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I acknowledge his expertise. How does he think that the clause would be damaged by the absence of subsection (4)?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Doran:</B> If the hon. Gentleman would let me get on with my speech, I might answer his question.
<P>
In catering, which is the main unskilled aspect of the industry, union agreements cover offshore earnings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to disrupt the hon. Gentleman's line of thought. He will be aware that the subsection that the amendment seeks to remove refers to the jurisdiction of courts and tribunals. That is what the Committee is debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Doran:</B> I am aware of that, Mrs. Dunwoody. I wish to develop a point that was made by the hon. Member for Daventry. The removal of the subsection would weaken the protection of workers. It is therefore appropriate to speak about the employment background.
<P>
Most of the industry's unskilled workers, who are employed in catering and stewarding, fall into two categories. On oil production platforms, such workers are usually covered by a negotiated agreement between the Transport and General Workers Union and the RMT. They earn between &#163;18,000 and &#163;19,000 a year, including pensions and other benefits. That agreement mainly covers the northern sector.
<P>
Other such employees work on mobile platforms, such as flotels or drilling rigs. Some of them are covered by such union protection and some are not. In the southern sector, offshore workers on such platforms, which are in that sector serviced mainly from Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth, have very little union protection.
<P>
My local unions brought to my attention a case in which workers had been imported into the southern sector from Lithuania and Portugal and who were then employed by two companies--Frazer Catering and Universal Catering--on rigs operated by a company called Nedrill. The workers were earning as little as &#163;10 a day. The Lithuanian workers were mainly professionals, and their number included teachers, doctors, and other professionals. They were earning as little as &#163;10 for a minimum 12-hour day. The situation in their own country was so desperate that they were prepared to accept such conditions.
<P>
That employment was stopped, not because of wage rates, but because of the safety implications for workers who could not understand safety rules because they spoke a different language. In an industry that lives under the shadow of the Piper Alpha tragedy, that is a serious matter.
<P>
The fact remains that, despite the perceptions of the offshore oil industry and the high rates of pay of which I have given examples, workers in the industry can be exploited and paid at a low rate. The clause is necessary in all those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): The hon. Gentleman's knowledge of offshore working, of workers on rigs and of other such matters is probably unequalled by that of any other Member of Parliament. I have listened to--and was most impressed by--his explanation of how those mobile platforms are dragged out into the high seas and down towards the south Atlantic. What I want to know, with particular emphasis on subsection (4), which concerns jurisdiction, is what happens when one of those great structures, carrying specially skilled men, passes outside territorial workers and into the high seas. What happens to the workers' terms of employment then?
<P>
<B>Mr. Doran:</B> I am always subject to a little flattery--I thank the hon. Gentleman. The case is clear, and we covered it earlier when we dealt with maritime workers. If a ship is registered in the UK, the Bill will cover its workers. In exactly the same way, it will cover any other merchant seamen. Floating vessels are regarded as ships in our law, and the law that applies to operating platforms is similar to maritime law. This clause will apply to vessels that operate within our national waters but which are not registered in the UK.
<P>
As I said, subsection (4) is important because it deals with a complex subject. The jurisdiction of the courts and tribunals in this country is constantly being tested. For example, we believed for many years that TUPE regulations extended offshore, but a recent industrial tribunal decision suggested that they did not. The clause will ensure that the minimum wage regulations will apply offshore and there will be no dubiety about that.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry would delete subsection (4), which is an important part of the clause, but I suspect that he has tabled it as a probing amendment. I did not detect in either the tone or content of what he said a desire deliberately to undermine the clause's effectiveness as it relates to people's entitlements.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) said, there are 30,000 workers in the offshore industry but only a few hundred work in cross-boundary situations. The cross-boundary areas are mainly between the United Kingdom on the one hand and Norway, the Netherlands and Ireland on the other. The clause enables us to extend the Bill to offshore workers by an Order in Council. That follows the standard pattern for the application of employment law such as the Employment Rights Act 1996 to employers and employees in the offshore industry.
<P>
It is not a unique process. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, extended protection to offshore workers under the employment protection (offshore employment) order 1976. We are seeking to use processes that have been tried and tested by previous Administrations and found to operate effectively in what can be, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, complex areas of activity.
<P>
The clause applies to employment in UK territorial waters but it also applies to employment connected with the exploration of the seabed or exploitation of natural resources in the UK sector of the continental shelf, as designated by the Continental Shelf Act 1964, and to employment connected with the exploration or exploitation of, for example, an oil or gas field in a foreign sector of the continental shelf, where that field extends across the boundary between UK and foreign sectors.
<P>
My interpretation of that in layman's terms--the interpretation of the hon. Member for Daventry might be different--is that there is a line across the floor of the continental shelf which an operation occasionally straddles. We want to ensure that if that happens, it is not to the detriment of people's employment rights.
<P>
Subsection (4) is therefore a good and uncontroversial safety provision which follows standard legal practice. It ensures that any new jurisdiction conferred by subsection (3)(c) concerning enforcement through the courts or employment tribunals for offshore workers does not prejudice exisiting rights. It is about the avoidance of doubt and ensuring cover in the court or in a tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is being helpful in clarifying the matter. However, will he confirm that the clause does not deal only with offences but with all the intervening stages, including the recovery of earnings, enforcement and penalty notices?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: that is precisely what the clause does. The provision is necessary to protect the rights of a worker in any situation, where the court may already have jurisdiction to hear the claim, or a similar claim, wherever that claim might be. The wording is the same as that in the Employment Rights Act 1996 and previous legislation. It is a commonsense proposal that will prevent doubt arising.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will not insist on his amendment deleting subsection (4), and that what I have said will encourage him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> All Conservatives Members know of and respect the Minister's passionate commitment to the Bill, but is it not true that people with the special skills and courage needed to work on offshore platforms are unlikely to be paid below the projected minimum wage? Is it not well known, anecdotally at least, that they are really rather well paid?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Aderdeen, Central showed that some people in the industry are paid very poor rates. In general, the industry is well paid, and exhibits very high standards in such matters as training and co-operation. Since the Piper Alpha disaster, a great deal of effort has been devoted to transforming the industry and to raising the industry's standards both onshore and offshore. Even if only a handful of instances arise in which its use is necessary, the clause will ensure that everyone will be able to claim the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether I had received any representations about the clause, adverse or otherwise. The answer is no. The various industry bodies representing the owners have a regular dialogue with the Department, but they have not raised the matter with us, either negatively or positively. Like us, they consider the clause to be uncontroversial and an extension of existing practice.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will take my comments in good faith and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am indeed grateful for that explanation, which is the one that I sought. I confirm that, given the Government's commitment to a national minimum wage, we have no objection in principle to its extension to the relevant sections of the North sea. The Minister of State has been helpful in clarifying the circumstances in which we might seek to claim or exercise a jurisdiction that, strictly speaking, is outside our territory.
<P>
In addition, the Committee as a whole is grateful for the elucidation of the matter by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central. I suspect that he is right and that a few people are low paid. He conceded that they could be paid even less in their countries of origin, if they could get jobs at all, and that gave Conservative Members pause for thought and provoked some doubt.
<P>
However, the Minister's explanation was given in good faith, and this was a probing amendment, as he intuited. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for calling me first in this debate. I probably qualify for that honour only on grounds of age: my younger colleagues will present the more vigorous arguments.
<P>
I have a lawyer's doubt about matters of jurisdiction. I remember from my student days a subject mysteriously called private international law, which had to do with determining in any dispute not only what was the proper law to apply to that dispute but also what was the proper jurisdiction, and from time to time some surprising results could occur. For example, one might find a case brought within the English jurisdiction but under another system of law. It is possible to contract for the system of law that applies to an employment contract, just as it is possible to contract for the jurisdiction that will govern a dispute on a contract.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That brings me to an interesting point on clause stand part that I want to put to the Minister. He can then reflect on it and take guidance from those who know these things, because I confess that I do not. Is it possible that the Bill, soon to be a statute, probably in amended form, is something that can be contracted out of? For example, if I, as a much younger man, went to work on an oil rig, what would happen if my employers, perhaps based in the constituency of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran), said to me, ``This is your contract of employment. You must sign it. We would like you to take note of clauses 20 and 21, which say that the jurisdiction for any dispute on this contract is to be Norwegian and that the law that will apply is the law of Scotland.'', which is different from the law of England? It would be possible for me to enter into a contract where I agreed that any dispute was to be determined in the Norwegian court, applying Scottish law. In case any hon. Member thinks that that is bizarre, a short reading of maritime disputes cases will show that such a thing can occur.
<P>
	Before I put my signature on that contract, or even after I put my signature on that contract, I should like to know--the Committee is entitled to know this, and a wider audience beyond might also want to know--whether it is possible to contract out of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is my hon. Friend suggesting that if, as a young man, he had undertaken offshore employment on the basis of the contractual terms that he has described, the legal authorities in this country would not have thought it practicable or desirable to try to interfere with those terms?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The drift of my hon. Friend's question is correct. In the culture and history of English law the uppermost consideration is that the parties to a contract, being of mature years and understanding and having the capacity to enter into a contract--unless the purposes of the contract are illegal--make their own terms. Therefore, recasting myself into the young man offering himself for an oil rig job, I could end up in the situation that I have described, and the general culture of English law or, for that matter, I think Scottish law would not seek to disturb that arrangement.
<P>
English law has never sought to inquire into the bargain merely to establish that the bargain was properly arrived at. By the same token, if I sell my motor car to my hon. Friend the member for Buckingham for what looks like a knock-down price, it is between me and him. If he gets a bargain at my expense, I cannot subsequently dispute the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is not likely from a Whip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> No, but I must get back to the clause.
<P>
Having considered the question of the parties creating their own jurisdiction and creating the proper law for the contract--two separate considerations--can the Bill which is to become a statute, be contracted out of or would such an effort to impose the proper law and jurisdiction be futile and fail for something in the Bill that I have not noticed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is educating us, as ever, in the workings of the lawyer's mind, and we are grateful for that. He will have seen clause 46, which contains a general set of provisions on contracting out from these arrangements. Presumably at least part of the point that he is seeking to probe is whether, although it is generally provided that there should not be contracting out, it might be possible to do so in the case of continental shelf workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be tempted to discuss another clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> No, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was about to say that following my experience under your tutelage, I would not read clause 46 at this stage. I am not even sure that there is a clause 46, but if there is, my intention would be to delete it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure that it is acceptable to mock the Chair, but I acquit the hon. Gentleman of the charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> That was not my intention. If I gave that impression, I apologise before the Committee. My intention was perhaps to mock my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, who was trying to draw me to clause 46; I knew that you would not want him to do so, Mrs. Dunwoody. I thought that my hon. Friend should be rebuked by me also.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend, who is elaborating his point. The application of jurisdiction and the ability to enforce the legislation, notwithstanding the regulations to prevent contracting out, is covered by the subsection that deals with activities occurring in a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``foreign sector of the continental shelf'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an area outside the territorial waters of any state''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may be the relevant subsection for these purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> It may well be, and with his customary prescience my hon. Friend has anticipated the matter to which I want to move.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, will he share with the Committee his experience, which I am sure is even greater than mine, of the legal concept of forum non conveniens, whereby certain parties might have the opportunity of proceeding in one of two jurisdictions and choose the one that is less helpful to the person concerned?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Taylor--in one direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> In one direction, indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. I look to you and I address my comments to you.
<P>
My hon. Friend may be straying slightly wide of the clause, and although it is a complex matter I think it is within the ambit of the clause to say that when two jurisdictions are available, it is open to the parties to agree to which jurisdiction to submit. That is often a benign and helpful way of enabling matters to proceed. If they do not agree, the general principles of private international law are applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): Will my hon. Friend, with his great legal experience and knowledge, enlighten the Committee? If contracting out is denied to the arrangement covered by the clause, would that be unprecedented, or at least extremely unusual in English law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> It would be rather against the grain of the wood. I would certainly go that far in reply to my hon. Friend.
<P>
I shall return to my mainstream point. The courts are associated with an alternative arm of our constitution and the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary is important. Is Parliament here asserting on behalf of our courts a sovereignty in territorial areas where another sovereign nation might claim that its writ ran or that its courts' jurisdiction applied? If so, I fear that when the Bill is enacted we may have left some unfinished business. This may be a reach too far on behalf of United Kingdom jurisdictions.
<P>
The Minister exhaustively listed those countries with which we have territorial relationships, including Ireland and Norway. Whether there will be any future complication in the relationship England and Wales have with Scotland, I do not know. Had the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) been selected as a member of the Committee, I am sure that he would have had something to say on that subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is bringing his formidable legal powers to bear on our discussion. Does he agree that clause 39 appears to apply to activities undertaken outside the United Kingdom and to persons who are not British subjects?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The situation is worrying. In the vicinity of the Antarctic, for example, there are notorious disputed claims by various nations that have at various times, for the oil rights or for reasons of national pride, planted a flag and said, ``That's our bit.'' I worry about jurisdiction. The Bill may assert UK jurisdiction, authority and competence over areas claimed by some other nation or agency. I am concerned that anomalies may exist.
<P>
You have been most patient, Mrs. Dunwoody, with my attempts to deal with what are generally acknowledged to be difficult considerations. We are metaphorically looking beyond the horizon into areas of difficulty and I hope that the Government will bear those difficulties in mind in endeavouring to produce the best Bill possible. We are doing our best to assist the Government to prepare the Bill in the best possible way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I wish to put one or two questions to the Minister. They are largely factual and are based partly on what was said by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central in his enlightening tour d'horizon of the oil industry. He did not mention one or two points that remain unclear and might affect our judgment on whether the application of a minimum wage to offshore oil workers would be damaging, or even irrelevant?
<P>
First, how many people in the oil industry might be affected? The Minister said not many of the 30,000 workers on the British offshore shelf would be affected, but can he let us know the order of magnitude of the number? Is it a few dozen, a few hundred or thousands?

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important to establish not just the number of people affected, but the extent to which they are seriously underpaid in comparison with any reasonable national minimum wage? The hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central appeared to suggest that there was a serious underpayment problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. That gives rise to the question of whether workers in the offshore oil industry whose wages may be increased by the minimum wage tend to be British? The oil industry is international and it would be interesting to know whether, broadly speaking, the lower-paid jobs on oil rigs are done by people from other countries where, as has been said already, standards of living and pay are so low that those people prefer to work on British rigs.
<P>
My second point bears on the impact of extending the minimum wage to the offshore oil industry. What percentage of the investment and revenue costs of running an oil rig goes on wages? One assumes that most of the capital goes into hugely difficult technology and large physical structures. One assumes that wages represent a relatively small proportion of the cost of running a rig. That is my intuition.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central mentioned ships. Oil exploration is increasingly an international activity. It occurs not just across the borders of the North sea shelf or of the Irish sea but around the world, reflecting a growing number of finds in fields. Large-scale investment decisions may be affected if wages account for a significant proportion of the costs of a British offshore rig.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As for extraterritoriality and the ease of placing a rig, those who own and operate a rig will, to some extent, have a choice of jurisdictions. What affect will the clause have on a decision to place a rig in an international area? What factors will affect a decision whether to register in Norway, Ireland, Britain or the Netherlands? Significant wage costs will be a relevant consideration in assessing the value of the clause. Either the clause will be irrelevant, in which case the Committee will take one view on it, or, at the margin, it might be harmful, in which case we might take another view. Although we have received many helpful facts, three or four more are needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> As you might have guessed, Mrs. Dunwoody, from my previous abortive remarks, I want to raise two matters. The first relates to subsection (3)(e). Why is the Secretary of State's consent required in other legislation for prosecutions in territorial waters? What other legislation is relevant? Why is it appropriate to disapply that long-standing provision? What are the precedents for disapplying the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878 for the purposes of other Acts, extending provisions to offshore employment or offshore territorial waters activity?
<P>
The second matter, which was mentioned by my hon. Friends, relates to the foreign sector of the continental shelf. Since our proceedings began, I have wondered why it has been felt appropriate to engage in what seems to be extraterritoriality. The definition in subsection (5) makes it clear that we are dealing with areas outside our territorial waters but in which mineral or other rights to natural resources are enjoyed by a state other than the United Kingdom. Our extraterritoriality seems to have stretched far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> May I develop this argument a little further, because I might cover my hon. Friend's point?
<P>
The inference to draw from reading the notes on clauses is that we are dealing with workers who do not ordinarily work in the UK. The clause is designed to achieve that effect. The reference to the connection with the exploration or exploitation of resources on the foreign sector of the continental shelf suggests that we could be dealing with people working inside our territorial waters but in a cross-boundary petroleum field that extends to the foreign sector of the continental shelf. The legislation might not have that effect. It may cover people who do not necessarily work for British corporate bodies and who do not ordinarily work in the United Kingdom but who work outside our territorial waters in areas that have natural resources, the rights to which are owned by a state other than the United Kingdom. It seems to be stretching things slightly too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's argument with much interest. The Minister should tease out one of the underlying confusions, which is in my mind as well as in those of other hon. Members. That confusion arises out of the distinction between territorial waters, which is a comparatively narrow concept, the United Kingdom sector of the continental shelf, which is a wider concept, and a third category, beyond the UK sector, of foreign sectors that are linked through cross-boundary activities with the UK continental shelf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend helpfully illustrates the point further. When I first read the clause, it seemed relatively straightforward. I assumed that the United Kingdom sector of the continental shelf would be included; there is no reason why it should not be. The question is, what are the limitations on the application of the Bill's provisions for the foreign sector? Does it necessarily cover people who work within the United Kingdom sector of the continental shelf, but on a cross-boundary petroleum field that extends into the foreign sector?
<P>
In order to understand the legislation, I have from time to time taken it step by step; I wonder whether the Minister would take us through it step by step. Is it right to conclude, as I have, that someone who does not work for a United Kingdom body and who is not ordinarily resident or employed in the United Kingdom could be covered by the Bill's provisions when he works outside our territorial waters and outside the United Kingdom sector of the continental shelf, because he works on a cross-boundary petroleum field that extends into the United Kingdom sector?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The clause does not seem to be any more obnoxious than the Bill's other clauses. We have not greeted it with automatic hostility.
<P>
We have several legitimate anxieties about the clause. I recognise that the Minister, as he said earlier, is relatively tired, but I hope that he will not appear too befuddled or irritable. Opposition Members want to ask questions about genuine anxieties, to which we are entitled to expect answers.
<P>
First, the application of the clause--[Interruption.] The Minister may chunter from a sedentary position if he so wishes; it will merely take me longer to make the speech. We are being asked to approve a clause in the absence of information about the number of people to whom it will apply.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central favoured us with his wisdom earlier. He was asked to how many people the clause would apply. In the absence of an answer from him, I hope that the Minister can oblige. If substantial numbers of people suffer low wages, despite the overall image of the offshore oil industry as being highly remunerative, why can we not be told to how many people the clause will apply? Is it hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands? I do not know; none of my hon. Friends knows. We are entitled to ask and to be told.
<P>
Secondly, what is the extent of the underpayment? Are we dealing with people who are paid wages marginally below what the Government expect to be the level of the national minimum wage? Or are we dealing with people who are paid wages that are well below the expected level of the national minimum wage? I invite an intelligible answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Doran:</B> I have listened to the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues try to nit-pick and squeeze out numbers. He knows as well as I do that the principle behind the Bill is that it applies to everyone. It applies to hon. Members and to the 30,000 offshore workers. The fact that some people may earn wages above the mimimum wage and therefore may not need to trigger the legislation is irrelevant. The Bill has universal application, except for the exemptions specified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I blame myself. I had hoped for a better intervention than that, but I was to be disappointed. I must disagree with the hon. Gentleman. I believe that the numbers involved are important. We should not ratify the legislation, and put it on the statute book with the full approval of the clause standing part of it, without being aware of the number of people who are involved. In several other contexts, it is clear that there are many relatively low-paid people whose remuneration the Bill will substantially raise. My hon. Friends and I suggest that only a few people may earn less than the minimum wage that is to be set, and we simply want to know what will be the practical consequences of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond: </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does my hon. Friend agree that because of the nature of offshore employment in the oil sector, much will depend on the pay reference period and on how hours spent on the rig but not enagaged in work are to be counted? Does he agree that the imposition of the working time directive on the offshore oil industry would further add to the burdens that the Bill may impose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point and he is right about the application of the working time directive. We are discussing irregular patterns of employment, to which the clause is relevant. The Minister made a bogus point and failed to admit that he did not know how many people the clause would affect. If he had been prescient, he would have realised that I would come on to a second and related question, which directly justifies our queries about the number of people to whom the clause will apply. What is the expected cost of the requirement to keep records in respect of a relatively small number of people? I do not know, but I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is important that we should not have too much repetition. We certainly should not go back and discuss records, which were dealt with in another part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I certainly do not seek to refer back to earlier discussions. I simply seek to establish the cost-benefit involved in the approval of the clause. I am sure, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you will accept as a relevant consideration the costs that will be incurred as a result of the clause. I hope that you will readily acknowledge that it is not my intention to divert from the clause.
<P>
My next, and the Minister will be relieved to hear, final point relates to subsection (3)(b), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An Order in Council under this section . . . may provide that all or any of the provisions of this Act, as applied by such an Order in Council, apply . . . to individuals whether or not they are British subjects''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that mean that the Bill could apply to non-British subjects on British rigs or American rigs operating outside the United Kingdom? If so, I have a legitimate query: is there not a potential conflict between the entitlement to the national minimum wage as established by this legislation and the possible and, indeed, competing entitlement to a different national minimum wage that might apply as a result of the legislation of another sovereign state?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I confess my ignorance in this matter, but it seems to me that it is likely that the application of law to offshore rigs on the continental shelf may be the subject of treaty obligations between us and countries that also abut onto the continental shelf. Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to ask the Minister if that is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a legitimate and sensible point. I feel sure that before proceeding with the Committee stage of the Bill, the Minister undertook appropriate consultations with international authorities. He would certainly have asked his officials to discover whether the clause would have implications for international treaty obligations to other states. I do not doubt that he will be able to tell us precisely whom he consulted about competing treaty obligations and what was the nature and outcome of those consultations. Those are legitimate concerns.
<P>
The clause does not seem offensive. It is, however, potentially complicated and there is scope for difficulty in its implementation, unless or until the Minister alleviates the concerns of Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The discussion on clause stand part did not reflect the remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry on my explanation of the proposal and its background. We have had a diet of verbal abuse and drivel--indeed, another lesson in buffoonery--from the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow). We are dealing with serious, complex issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister does not know the answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman chunters away. For once, he should listen to others. If he stopped listening to himself all the time, he would gain a clearer understanding of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A question was asked about the effect of the proposal on the North sea. We have a stable political climate and a stable tax regime. We also have a highly skilled work force available on the mainland and to work on deepwater platforms. From the inception of the oil and gas fields, all Governments have put tremendous efforts into creating sophisticated supply chains. For those good reasons, Britain's gas and oil fields are some of the world's most attractive investments. The fields are well established and new technology has allowed marginal fields to become productive.
<P>
Pay and conditions do not determine whether investment is made; they concern the ethos of a company and how it deals with its work force. Most important is a company's capacity to get a return on its capital investments. Since the Piper Alpha disaster, there has been a great deal of investment across the industry in new technology, platform construction and safety operations as well as improvement in the skills and knowledge of those who are responsible for safety.
<P>
The industry does not base investments in United Kingdom gas and oilfields or those across the continental shelf on the short-term consideration of the wage rates of low-paid workers. The hon. Member for Buckingham made the silly point that the potential entitlement of very few people to the minimum wage would fundamentally damage continued investment in United Kingdom gas and oilfields.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The point was nonsense.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) asked how many people would be covered by the measure. Because there is a fluid population in the industry, I do not know. But the question is irrelevant. Whether one person, 100 or 200--a small or a significant number--are covered, our job is to ensure that they get the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Even if wage costs go up?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes his nonsense point. When I explained my view of what happened in the industry, Opposition Members' body language suggested that I was not making sound economic points.
<P>
On costs and platforms, there was the issue of a handful of people who were potentially entitled to the minimum wage affecting the running costs of platforms in the North sea. There are more than 100 such platforms in United Kingdom gas and oil fields. Costs vary from platform to platform for a range of reasons. The fact that they continue to be there and yield a high return on their capital shows that companies that work in those fields feel that they have made sound investments. To suggest that those investments would be put at risk or that running costs would be affected by the introduction of a minimum wage for several catering workers, for example, is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, Central said, time-wasting nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept much of what the Minister says, but he refers specifically to established platforms in which the capital investment has been made. He said a few moments ago that changing technology allowed ever more marginal fields to be exploited using flexible production systems. Does he not accept that labour costs will be a much more significant factor at the margin, where companies are dealing with new and marginal fields?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> As I understand it--and I stand to be corrected--&#163;1 billion of investment is needed to establish a new platform in some fields. Surely, the issue is not how the level of investment relates to some of the labour costs, but whether the geological conditions are right and striking down a platform will secure oil or gas for companies. That is why they put the investment down. They are concerned about geological conditions and about whether they have made the right investment decision based on them. For the life of me, I cannot envisage a decision being made around the table at an oil company--in the UK or at a corporate headquarters outside it--about a new billion pound platform facility and the president saying, ``That fellow from Aberdeen, Central is a bit of a troublemaker. He has identified 10 people on a platform who are on &#163;2 per hour. Withdraw the investment now. Sort him out.'' The point is absolute nonsense and was made to waste the Committee's time.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is not here--
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am sorry. Like me the hon. Gentleman has trouble being seen on occasions. He asked whether one could contract out. As hon. Gentlemen suggested, the answer, under clause 46(1), is that one cannot. The purpose of the Order in Council will, therefore, be to apply clause 46(1) and to ensure that people cannot create contractual arrangements that facilitate someone signing away his minimum wage rights. It is fair and reasonable for us to ensure that the Act will not be rendered ineffective by the capacity to create waiver clauses on a range of contractual arrangements, disbarring people and putting them at a disadvantage so that they give up their right to a minimum wage.
<P>
I said on the amendments that developing provisions to ensure the extension of the minimum wage was not an easy issue. It is, however, easy in the sense that all Governments of practical persuasions--at least I thought that this was the case until I heard the contribution of the hon. Member for Buckingham in particular--have gone out of their way to ensure that employment legislation covered people working offshore. Their stance has been almost non-party and non-partisan, and the legislation has been devised on that basis. The reasonable and sensible coalition of view that basic minimum standards and employment rights should cover people working offshore in the gas and oil industries, or extend across fields on the continental shelf, did not come under threat until the contribution from the hon. Member for Buckingham this afternoon.
<P>
I was surprised that Conservative Members made such an effort to undermine and speak out against that concept. That must have been an embarrassment for the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Rubbish. We simply asked questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman laughs, but the hon. Member for Daventry signalled in the debate that he had no problems with the concept of ensuring that employment rights should be extended to people working offshore. He agreed that the amendments were probing in nature, tabled with the aim of ensuring that the clause met the all-party consensus on the matter.
<P>
At the end of the debate, the hon. Member for Daventry withdrew the amendments, but then the dogs of war behind him were unleashed and many spurious points were raised in an attempt to undermine the proposal. Once again, Conservative Members have shown themselves in their true colours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No. When they get the chance, Conservative Members will always have a kick at employment rights and show their displeasure by trying to undermine them.
<P>
If the matter is pressed to a Division, I ask my hon. Friends to ensure that the clause stands part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I must say that I am a little disappointed by the Minister of State, who is sometimes Dr. Jekyll and other times Mr. Hyde. Some Conservative Members, like my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, try to be Dr. Jekyll at all times. His gentle inquiries to establish the truth about the principle of the clause are sometimes interpreted as frontal attacks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that, if the Bill becomes law and poorly paid offshore workers are as a result able to enjoy a minimum wage with no loss of employment, I shall dance around the mulberry bush in celebration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall not go into the geographic point, but I have a feeling that, in the future, an offshore oilfield will be named the Bercow field in acknowledgement of my hon. Friend's contribution to our proceedings.--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a great buzz in the Room at the thought of that exciting event, but I suggest that the Commitee returns to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is very crisply put, Mrs. Dunwoody. You are right to remind the Committee of our duty.
<P>
The Minister tried to answer. His tone was a little regrettable, and he left several questions of detail unanswered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the points that I raised in the debate were technical and intended to secure elucidation from the Minister? They were not frontal assaults or wrecking points, but from the Minister reply came there none.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I did rather detect that. It would be a good idea for the Minister to reflect, with his officials, on the points that were raised and determine whether he has done the Committee justice. My feeling is that he has not. Conservative Members do no oppose the principle of the clause, nor do we wish to subvert its intention. However, because there is unfinished business in the debate, we decline to approve the clause without further clarification.

Clause 43
<P>
Relationship of this Act and agricultural wages legislation
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 26, line 33, leave out subsection (3). We come to clauses--to be followed in due course by a corresponding schedule--relating to the position of agricultural workers. They have an exceptional position in the current arrangements because their wages board, which was analogous to the wages councils that operated in other industries, continues to apply and operates under the agricultural wages order.
<P>
Before I continue, I think it fair to remind the Committee of my declaration of interest in the Register of Members' Interests, to which I averted in the Committee's first sitting. However, I do not think that that constitutes a material problem for me, or I would not be here discussing the issue.
<P>
The amendment is narrowly cast. Lest there be any doubt, I point out that it is a probing and not a wrecking amendment. I am very unlikely--unless the Minister particularly incenses me--to press it to a Division. I might make one or two points on this clause and its successor in the clause stand part debate, if we handle the matter tactfully and if you are happy, Mrs. Dunwoody, for me to do so.
<P>
The two clauses are procedural and concern the jurisdiction--the possible double jeopardy--into which farmers might fall as a result of the way in which two sets of regulations, the agricultural wages orders and the new national minimum wage provisions, mesh. The amendment does not relate to the substance of the clause. We may, if you select our amendments, Mrs. Dunwoody, be able to have a debate under schedule 2 about some of the more hard-edged economic issues, but I was not proposing to entertain them tonight.
<P>
The amendment would delete subsection (3). I tabled it because I do not understand subsection (3), although I have read it several times. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nothing in the agricultural wages legislation, or in any order under that legislation, affects the operation of this Act in its application otherwise than for the purposes of that legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I simply do not see why the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise than for the purposes of that legislation''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are necessary. I am sure that there is some arcane legal reason for them, but it ought to be, to use the Minister's favourite term, a matter of common sense. The Bill will no doubt shortly become an Act and we have an Agricultural Wages Act--I use a shorthand, because there are three territorial arrangements. Those two pieces of legislation will operate separately and come together only when necessary. Neither the Minister nor I would want agricultural wages legislation prescribing, for example, the right of notification to an agricultural housing advisory committee about a tenancy to get mixed up with the National Minimum Wage Bill. I do not understand what subsection (3) means. The amendment is intended to probe the Minister, and to gain his assurance about how the two provisions will stand separately and come together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards (Monmouth):</B> I pay tribute to the Minister's robust defence of the national minimum wage, which he gave when answering questions in the Chamber earlier.
<P>
I am interested in the contribution made by the hon. Member for Daventry. I acknowledge his remarks about the amendment being a probing amendment. I had wondered what its purpose was, and I must admit that I had wondered about the purpose of subsection (3). In the spirit of his remarks, I shall try not to be too forceful with Opposition Members. I shall speak merely about the point of the clause, and about why the Government do not wish to agree to the amendment.
<P>
I represent a significant rural constituency, which contains some 2,000 farms. Agriculture is by far the biggest industry in the constituency. I am conscious that farming faces a very serious situation. I do not wish to make political points about that. I am sure that the state of agriculture is a cross-party concern, which is for another debate, if a debate is necessary.
<P>
The agricultural wages boards are an interesting phenomenon. They were established in 1948 in England and Wales, in 1949 in Scotland, and then in Northern Ireland. Their purpose was to provide a set minimum rate for people in the sector. The clause is intended to ensure that agricultural wages boards will continue to exist under the national minimum wage. The clause aims to ensure that, as the hon. Member for Daventry said, no worker or employer should suffer double jeopardy. For example, if an employee was earning less than the national minimum wage and made a claim in that respect, he or she would not be able to make that claim under the agricultural wages board orders; therefore, a claim could not be made simultaneously. Neither would there be double recompense for having been paid at a rate below the Agricultural Wages Board level, or the minimum wage.
<P>
It is interesting that in 1993 the Government abolished all wages councils with the exception of the agricultural wages council. Why might the then Government have wanted to keep that council?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a degree of confusion in the Committee. When an amendment is narrowly drawn, members of the Committee must address exactly what is written on the amendment paper, which in this case is the proposed deletion of a subsection. The hon. Gentleman is making points that would be perfectly in order in a clause stand part debate, and would perhaps be useful. The very tightly drawn amendment does not allow the general remarks that a clause stand part debate would. However, it is perfectly in order for him to refute the arguments that have been advanced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. Should there be a clause stand part debate, I should be happy to make those comments then. As the hon. Member for Daventry said that he would not press the amendment to a vote, I shall not say any more. I wish only to highlight the fact that the clause will ensure that there will not be double jeopardy, given the continuation of the Agricultural Wages Board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> In the same spirit as that in which the hon. Member for Daventry made his remarks, I shall comment on what I believe would be the negative impact of the hon. Gentleman's proposals. However, I shall first concentrate on putting into context the purpose of the clause. I shall give the Committee a slight flavour of why it is included and then deal with the specific details.
<P>
In applying the national minimum wage to the agricultural sector, we have followed two key principles. First, that the national minimum should apply in this sector as elsewhere. Secondly, that we should not seek to make wholesale changes to the existing agricultural wages regimes in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Instead, we should do only what is necessary to ensure the effective application and enforcement of minimum wage rates, including the national minimum, in this sector.
<P>
Clause 43 ensures that the relationship between the Bill and existing agricultural wages legislation--the Agricultural Wages Act 1948, for England and Wales; the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act 1949 and the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977--does not result in unfairness or an undesirable outcome.
<P>
The clause ensures, in particular, that a person cannot be prosecuted for the same offence under the agricultural wages legislation and under the Bill, and that a person cannot claim double recovery of the same amount of a minimum wage both under the Bill and under agricultural wages legislation.
<P>
The clause also ensures, in subsection (3), which is the subject of the amendment, that agricultural wages legislation does not affect the national minimum wage regime. In practice, the subsection makes it absolutely clear that the minimum wage provisions apply without modification in the agricultural sector and it maintains the principle of the minimum floor.
<P>
There is a logic to that approach, which puts in place the national minimum as a floor. What happens above that, whether as a result of non-statutory, industry-wide agreements or, as in the case of agriculture, a statutory system of pay-fixing, is outside the scope of the Bill.
<P>
I hope that that explanation satisfies the hon. Member for Daventry. This process will ensure that, in the meshing together of systems, there is no propensity or opportunity for the provisions to work in a way that is detrimental or confusing or to create situations that put people in jeopardy.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``otherwise than for the purposes of that legislation''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which I presume means the agricultural wages Acts--are the cause of the problem. I am unsure whether they are necessary; possibly, an alternative would be preferable. I cannot suggest a precise wording, but something like, after the word ``application'' insert ``only as specified in this Act'' may be an improvement and might make it clearer. However, I accept the Minister's assurance that he is trying to deal with the problem, and in that context, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> I shall not repeat the comments I made a moment ago, other than to say that the clause's purpose is to ensure that there is no opportunity for double jeopardy, given that the Agricultural Wages Board still exists. It is significant that that wages council was not abolished by the previous Government, and it is interesting to speculate why. I gather that there was little demand for the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board. Abolition was opposed by the National Farmers Union and by the trade unions because it was recognised that it helped industrial relations in farming.
<P>
Unfortunately, the number of workers covered by the Agricultural Wages Board has declined with the decline in the number of employees. It is significant that many of the arguments for keeping the Agricultural Wages Board could equally have applied to keeping every other wages council. The national minimum wage will bring some of the advantages that have been apparent in the Agricultural Wages Board.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Daventry, who I understand is a farmer and I am sure is a gentleman, was never involved in a campaign to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, even though he was a member of the Government, and it would be interesting to know why there was no such campaign when so many other wages councils were abolished.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to ensure that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is waxing lyrical about the beneficial effect of the Agricultural Wages Board on industrial relations in the agricultural sector. Casual workers are paid &#163;3.06 an hour. If the minimum wage is set higher than that, will it not damage precisely the industrial relations about which the hon. Gentleman is so pleased?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edwards:</B> With respect, I find that contention quite speculative. We know that there was very little demand to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, and there was inconsistency in the previous Government's arguments on this point. I accept that the rates that were paid were not that high, but they were higher than those that applied in the wages councils generally, which were not over-generous. It will be interesting to see what level the Low Pay Commission will recommend for the national minimum wage.
<P>
The clause will ensure that agricultural wages will not fall lower than the national minimum wage. It will provide the floor below which wages will not fall. People who find that they have not been paid the national minimum wage will not be able to claim twice: there will be no double jeopardy against their employer. Should they seek recovery of under payment, they will not be able to have it twice.
<P>
That is the purpose of the clause. I am sure that it will be supported by Opposition Members and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We need not go on at great length about the clause, not least because I said that I wanted to have a wider economic debate about agriculture as related to the agricultural wages order and to the changes to be made to the Bill later in our deliberations, possibly under a schedule. The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) is right to say that the board was the one surviving wages council, or equivalent. I concede that, after consultation, there was some support in the industry and I see no point in wasting time on the matter. That is why, pragmatically, we decided to keep it, although I was not then involved as a Minister.
<P>
It is right to record--these figures were confirmed in a recent written answer--that a substantial number of workers are still covered. I have not brought that written answer with me, but I recall that the figure was 170,000 or thereabouts, which, as a matter of interest, is in the same ballpark as the figures mentioned earlier today for the armed forces. Therefore, we are talking about a significant number of workers, who are widely scattered. Some of them, as the hon. Member for Monmouth would say to me if I did not say it to him, were perhaps less well organised in terms of unions, less able to claim their rights and were facing less attractive alternative employment elsewhere.
<P>
I suggested that we should store the debate on the economic effect. From my perusal of the NFU's evidence to the Low Pay Commission, it is clear, as it is from the orders, that unless the national minimum wage is much higher than expected, it is unlikely to pose a problem in relation to full-time agricultural employees, because their minimum is &#163;4.12--I have also seen a figure of &#163;4.17, and the position is similar for part-timers. The concern will be very much about the casual sector, but I leave that point.
<P>
The clause is about enforcement. It is appropriate to ask the Minister one or two questions in that regard. First, as I read the notes on clauses, it seems clear that whatever happens to the rates, the enforcement mechanism for agriculture will fall largely into the same framework as for other industries. I do not complain about that; and I am familiar with the analogy with health and safety legislation. The latter is not run under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, just as enforcement of the minimum wage will not be run by the DTI.
<P>
The Minister said earlier that the system of delivering enforcement should be cost-effective, unintrusive and effective. It would seem a matter of common sense to make use of the existing structures for enforcing agricultural wages orders. I secured some details in a written answer--I have them with me. Those figures were at the back of my mind, because I once had ministerial responsibility for the matter.
<P>
An answer from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food dated 4 February states that the equivalent of about five staff years work had been committed to all aspects of the agricultural wages order, including enforcement in 1996-97. I did not ask a comparable question of the Scottish or Northern Ireland Offices; the figures may be slightly higher if those were added.
<P>
In fact, the Ministry now carries out fewer inspections. It is not that the inspection activity is less rigorous, but simply that just before my time at the Ministry the practice of the so-called test inspections--a term of art for random inspections--ceased. The Ministry is now usually called in only as a result of complaints, which makes its activities more focused. The number of formal inspections that took place in 1996 was 38, the number of consequent prosecutions was three and the arrears of pay recovered, at &#163;6,811, was quite small in proportion to the total cost of the enforcement arrangements.
<P>
I immediately concede that the money that is clawed back is not important; what is important is the deterrent effect of the enforcement structure. We cannot argue with that, as long as it is appropriate. In the previous year, when the Ministry was playing out the old test inspection system, there were 348 inspections, and only two prosecutions, which yielded arrears of pay of just over &#163;9,000. However, one case went to appeal, which reduced the arrears recovered to just over &#163;3,000; &#163;6,000 was at stake, which was not collected as a result.
<P>
The figures are relatively small. Will the Minister clarify whether what I call, in my shorthand, the MAFF inspectorate will continue as it has done, and whether he would like to include it in the overall inspectorate? In many ways, that may be better, not least because there are no individual inspectors; they would become part of the MAFF field staff if the Minister considered keeping the system, which would not be inconsistent with what he said earlier. If so, they will need to operate the enforcement provisions of the national minimum wage.
<P>
Clause 43(1) deals with prosecutions and with ensuring that there is no double jeopardy. That issue will not divide the Committee. Clause 43(2) deals with amounts that are recoverable on behalf of the worker--amounts that have been underpaid. Again, we have no objection in principle. However, two elements in the enforcement procedure are not specified in clause 43. One is the enforcement notice and the other is the penalty notice. From what is said in the notes on clauses, I take it that they will be applied. That will be a departure from existing agricultural wages enforcement powers, with which I have to admit I am not deeply familiar. It will provide a new and different structure. It would be useful to have it confirmed that that is how enforcement will work in future.
<P>
In addition, can the Minister confirm that he intends to avoid any double enforcement procedure? I am not talking about prosecution of criminal offences under clause 28 but the intervening stages between reference of a claim to a tribunal and the issuing of parallel enforcement orders or penalty notices by an officer. The Minister could usefully confirm that he envisages no double-headed enforcement procedure, which would be likely to aggravate farmers and be unacceptable to the public.
<P>
I have one further small point to raise, which I spotted only this morning. The Minister knows that I have, possibly to the point of obsession, canvassed the question of double employment, where two employments exist at the same time. Subsection (2) refers to recoverability of amounts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of the same work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Ought the Minister to consider adding ``and the same employment'' or ``by the same employer'' to that subsection? It is conceivable that work can be simultaneously done for two employers. I cannot synthesise such a case, but it is possible that a person may be under the direction of two employers--both agricultural perhaps, or one agricultural and one not. The test should be whether an individual contract of employment, or quasi-contract, is fulfilled, rather than whether the individual fulfilling the contract is caught up in someone else's failure to comply with the law.
<P>
My most substantial point is that the Minister should tell us a little more about how enforcement will work. Will he tell us more about the intervening stages of the enforcement and penalty notice procedures? Will he also reassure me on the matter of double employment?
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> A delicate operation is required to bring three agricultural wages regimes for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland alongside the enforcement processes of the national minimum wage. I should not pretend otherwise. That is what clauses 43 and 44 and schedule 2 seek to do. The hon. Gentleman has asked for a more detailed discussion later of schedule 2, and I look forward to that.
<P>
Clause 43 is designed to ensure that nothing untoward will result from the co-existence of two regimes. It ensures that there is no unfairness. A farmer will not be prosecuted twice for offences under the National Minimum Wage Bill and the agricultural regime.
<P>
Our aims in seeking to fit the two systems together are modest. The agricultural regime is due for review within the next year or two. No doubt that review will consider how the regime fits in with the national minimum wage. For the moment, we want to ensure that the two systems co-exist without too much difficulty.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the agricultural wages inspectorate will be used. That has not yet been decided. We have the power to appoint enforcement officers under clause 13 and we intend to introduce effective enforcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not want to be difficult. I infer from what the Minister has said that it would, if he so decided, be possible to use the existing inspectorate by appointing them as enforcement officers under clause 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. That is an accurate assessment--indeed, he explained the position rather better than I did, for which I thank him.
<P>
We are trying to move to a completely new regime. On the one hand, we are introducing the minimum wage, while on the other, we have to consider the review of the agricultural wages regime in 1999. In the interim, we are trying to ensure that the arrangements are clear and transparent and do not lead to double-jeopardy in relation to prosecutions under the process of enforcement. I hope that our debates on clauses 43 and 44 will clarify the position.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I want to return to one point. Perhaps I made a small meal of it, but it would help if the Minister would confirm the position. I understand that whoever the enforcement officers are--they may be from the agricultural wages inspectorate--they will be able to impose enforcement and penalty notices, just as any other inspectors in any other industry do, and that that matter is outside the agricultural wages order. Will the Minister also confirm that in addition to that enforcement, the inspectorate will be responsible for breaches of the order, short of criminal prosecution?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We want to ensure across-the-board enforcement, which is important.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 43 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 44</center></H4>
<H4><center>Amendments relating to remuneration etc of agricultural workers</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I promise that I shall not spin this out because the issues are technical ones rather than substantive ones.
<P>
The clause proposes regulations that amend primary legislation--the Agricultural Wages Acts, which always excite another place and should not be considered lightly, unadvisedly or without due consideration. The Minister will tell me, as the notes on clauses do, that the regulations will be confined solely to situations where it is necessary to act under the Bill. That is probably a sufficient safeguard, but it will help if the Minister confirms it.
<P>
The second point that causes me slightly more anxiety is the reference to section 67 of the Agriculture Act 1967. I had just become a very junior researcher when that legislation was under consideration. I confess that I have not refreshed my memory of it in the time available, but it refers to sick pay and the introduction of a sick pay scheme for agricultural workers, which in my view as an employer, is a welcome concept. During the long debates that we had on clause 2 on regulation and remuneration, sick pay was not mentioned at all. It is interesting that the Bill has powers to amend agriculture legislation in respect of sick pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry to be a bit slow joining the debate, but may I take my hon. Friend back to his first point? If the regulations to be made under this clause are only those that are strictly consequential on the Bill, they must be definable. They will have to be defined for the regulations to be promulgated, so is there any reason why they should not be listed in a schedule and defined precisely?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is for the Minister to answer--it is a fair question. We are not questioning his bona fides or suggesting that he is trying to create a huge new private construct in law, but it is important that he should try, wherever possible, not to amend primary legislation other than by primary legislation. He should explain exactly what he is about.
<P>
My final point concerns the benefit structure. The Minister has already said that the agricultural wages order will be subject to review in 1999. I understand from the notes on clauses that the benefit structure will continue and that the benefits that are taken into account for computing the total remuneration under the national minimum wage will only be those that are specified in regulations. They will not include matters that are not so specified.
<P>
However, if the benefits are still part of the minimum wage for agriculture because they are part of the order--which may vary from place to place--they would come under that head and be dealt with by an agricultural inspector. They have been modified a little in recent years and have specific applications, just as the ability to obtain a permit on the grounds of incapacity has a specific application. I noted from a recent written answer that there have been 101 such cases out of a total of 170,000. The provisions are minor and more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is it my hon. Friend's understanding from the notes on clauses that benefits in kind that will not count towards the national minimum wage would not be allowed to count towards the agricultural minimum wage, but that they could be counted as part of a higher rate agricultural minimum wage? Is that not rather curious?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is curious but, if the benefits are already built into the structure of no detriment, it could be sensible to retain their higher rate. We are talking about, for example, agricultural craftspeople or full-time agricultural employees who are already paid &#163;4.12 an hour and who may have certain allowable deductions, such as houses. In effect, they are part of that higher remuneration package on the assumption--that we still cannot safely make--that the national minimum wage will be below that level.
<P>
I am not sure that it is wrong to allow that system to roll on in the future. If the Minister deduces from what I am saying that those deductions do not play an important part in the macro scheme of things for the agricultural wages order, although they are important to individuals, and that I am giving him a signal that it would be sensible to harmonise the remuneration package in due course, I hope that he will take my message as a friendly, not hostile, suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Further to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, is it not the case that allowing the Agricultural Wages Board to continue within the regime of the minimum wage is doing precisely what the Minister said earlier he would not tolerate and not contemplate? That would allow a sectoral, differential effective minimum wage for different groups of agricultural workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a point. I am not at this stage seeking, unless perhaps in code, to persuade the Minister to think forward to the future operation of the agricultural wages order and the Agricultural Wages Board. It is a little too early to do that, because we should not create a situation of detriment or disbenefit. I am slightly twisting the analogy but we should not, in the interests of tidying up a board which, as the hon. Member for Monmouth said, has a great deal of support in the industry, rush to take the higher common factor that is now available under agricultural wages legislation and translate it into a lower national minimum wage figure.
<P>
I am simply putting down a market for the Minister's consideration. As he has conceded, the existence of a national minimum wage must have implications for the future operation of the Agricultural Wages Board, which will need to be considered when the legislation is reviewed. The orders were considerably tidied up and simplified under the previous Administration. I have known Professor John Marsh in different contexts for many years, and he has given the board strong leadership.
<P>
I give notice that we will want to refer again to pay reference periods. There is potential for non-coincidence between the reference period for wages orders and that under the national minimum wage. I know that that problem is touched on in schedule 2, but it would clearly be unfortunate if it were to continue indefinitely. I do not advise my hon. Friends to fight tooth and nail the merging of the sections, subject to the Minister giving a satisfactory reply to the points that I have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I have just two brief questions for the Minister. First, does he foresee any difficulties with the definition of agricultural workers? As I understand the notes on clauses and his speech on clause 43, there will be a national minimum wage, but the agricultural wages boards will continue to set minimum wages for different classes of agricultural workers. Those minimum wages cannot be lower than the national minimum wage, but they can be higher, and in some cases they are likely to be higher.
<P>
The Minister's favourite subject is unscrupulous employers. Does he agree that one obvious way in which employers might be unscrupulous is by trying to redefine agricultural workers as non-agricultural workers, so that they would be entitled to a lower minimum wage than they are at present under the boards?
<P>
Although the public conception is that it is obvious who is an agricultural worker, because of the way in which farming and countryside industries generally are developing, that line is more blurred than may be believed by people who know nothing about the countryside and the industries that operate in it--not just farming. As I am sure the Minister knows, many farms have diversified considerably, and farmers are actively encouraged to seek alternative ways of generating income--through using old barns, and so on, for different types of activity. People who would traditionally have been regarded as farm workers working on farms may not do much agricultural work for much of the time, so that definition may be difficult to nail into place.
<P>
Secondly, will the Minister enlighten the Committee about the position in Scotland? The notes on clauses suggest that the meshing of the agricultural wages boards will begin in 1999, when they are due to be reviewed anyway. The position in Scotland may then be affected by the Scottish Parliament. Although the clause says specifically that ``the appropriate authority'' is the Secretary of State for Scotland, does the Minister envisage a role for the Scottish Parliament in decisions on the relevant board in Scotland? Given that we know that the overall minimum wage will be a UK-wide rate, does the Minister foresee complications, or will the Scottish Parliament have no role to play in such deliberations?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> You will have to excuse me, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I think that I have the flu coming on.
<P>
All the questions asked have been reasonable. On the question of rural employment and whether people are covered by the agricultural wages board, the regime specifies which workers it covers.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill's purpose is to define people as workers. As a consequence, all workers, irrespective of the nature of employment or the task being done, will be covered by the national minimum wage. In practice, that means that the national minimum wage will include everyone in agriculture and, therefore, that it will become the floor below which people cannot be paid. That is all it means. That will be of great benefit to many occupations in agriculture.
<P>
For example, it will ensure that gang workers earn a minimum wage, which is a matter of great concern. Indeed, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is about to complete an investigation into the misuse of gang workers by gangmasters and others, which leads to poor employment practices, pay and conditions.
<P>
Packhouse workers undertake a mixture of agricultural and non-agricultural work and are paid piece rates. Again, the minimum wage will work in unison with the Agricultural Wages Board regime to stop the exploitation of packhouse workers by gangmasters and others. They will be special categories of workers under the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister accept that it might be difficult to define whether a packhouse worker is an agricultural worker, given the difficulties to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford referred?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The point is that there will be no such difficulty because those workers will be covered by the national minimum wage, which will be the basic floor. There will be no such problems of definition. The purpose of meshing the regimes is to provide an absolute floor--the national minimum wage.
<P>
That is also true for those agricultural contract workers who undertake a mixture of agricultural and non-agricultural work, for whom determining whether they are entitled to regional levels of pay is a constant problem. With the bringing together of the two regimes, the national minimum wage will provide those workers with a basic floor. Such examples show that the intention is to mesh the two systems to ensure that individuals of whatever designation in the agricultural sector are paid at least the national minimum wage. That is a fair way to proceed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked whether the operation Agricultural Wages Board will lead to sectoral rates. The answer is no. The minimum wage will apply to all employees, including agricultural workers. Therefore, it will provide no more and no less a floor in agriculture.
<P>
I hope that I have answered all the questions asked by the hon. Member for Daventry. If not, I shall write to him. He asked why powers are being sought to amend pay in agriculture. Those powers are needed on a contingency basis. We are bringing together two blocks of legislation--that on agricultural wages and the minimum wage--and the honest truth is that there might be certain frictions. It will not become clear whether agricultural wages legislation needs to be changed until the national minimum wage has been set.
<P>
Again, in an intervening on the hon. Member for Daventry, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked an interesting question about the consequential amendments. I understand that amendments might be consequential on the regulations setting up the national minimum wage as well as the agricultural wage. We do not know, as of now, what they will be, so they cannot be included in the Bill. However, under clause 44(2) and subsection (3), we have powers to deal with consequential amendments. Such matters will come before the House for consideration.
<P>
Again, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked whether the national minimum wage will include benefits in kind in agriculture. I can give him another straightforward answer: no. Final decisions have been taken and we shall review the situation in the light of the Low Pay Commission's advice before dealing with the regulations. That is why we took the power in clause 44(2) and (3) to deal with benefits in agricultural wages legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford asked the kind of nightmare question--although it was a good one--that one does not expect. It is my lucky day--I have a note on the subject and I can give the hon. Gentleman an answer--he might say that that is the first time today. The national minimum wage will apply throughout the United Kingdom. Industrial relations such as pay and conditions will be reserved matters. We therefore intend that in exercising its power to legislate on wages and conditions of services of agricultural workers in Scotland, the Scottish Parliament will not be able to act in a way that undermines or conflicts with the national minimum wage. That information must have been in the file in case Braveheart came to ask the question; I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford also asked about whether it would be difficult to define agricultural workers in the future. Agricultural workers are defined in the Agricultural Wages Act 1948 and the legislation will not change that definition, although it will grant added protection to workers employed in the sector. The Bill will therefore not undermine agricultural workers or the non-agricultural workers who work in conjunction with that sector. 
<P>
I have tried to answer all the questions--they were fair and detailed--that have been asked. On that basis, I hope that the clause will be accepted.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
