T.C. Davies</b> (Monmouth) (Con):
						I was
getting into my stride just before we adjourned this morning, but lunch
and a few hours of work at the computer have taken the wind out of my
sails, unfortunately. Suffice it to say that I was speaking about the
work that I saw taking place at Cardiff airport, and the importance of
joint working in a border security force. There is little that I can
add that has not already been said by me or by my hon. Friend the
Member for Ashford, so I will leave it at that. I hope that Government
Members will consider supporting new clause
4.</div>

							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): There is a slight
difference between the two Opposition parties on the responsibilities
of a UK border police, and, more substantially, on whether there should
be a UK border
police.</div>
					<a name="07031613000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier,
evidence from Migrationwatch was referred to in respect of an
organisational matter. I would like to quote from a report by Sir John
Wheeler in 2002 about airport security. Obviously, there are several
issues at ports. Security is one, in the sense of terrorist attacks on
ports, but there are also responsibilities in respect of immigration.
My party&#146;s argument is that there is merit in having an
organisational structure whereby a group of people under one management
structure are responsible for such
issues.</div>
					<a name="07031613000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 3.32
of the Wheeler report
states:</div>
					<a name="07031613000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
national co-ordination between the border agencies has improved, there
is clearly room for better co-ordination between the agencies on the
ground.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031613000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 4.18
states:</div>
					<a name="07031613000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
widely held within the airport security community that greater clarity
is needed around the role of the uniformed police, at both designated
and non-designated
airports&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07031613000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">and paragraph
4.19
states:</div>
					<a name="07031613000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Statements
of Service Provision have not guaranteed the co-operative working which
ought to characterise policing at the UK&#146;s major
airports&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07031613000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on. The
rest is not particularly
important.</div>
					<a name="07031613000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report
deals with security at airports. I am told that four police forces are
involved in policing at Heathrow airport&#151;I have not worked out
exactly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>which four they are&#151;as well as the railway transport police,
because Heathrow has railway and tube stations. Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs and the immigration people are also
there.</div>
					<a name="07031613000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
refer hon. Members to a study that examined a similar issue in
Liverpool, where several different agencies were dealing with an area.
A decision was made to place everybody in the same building, although
their management structures were different. That is a sort of halfway
house&#151;it is a move in the right direction&#151;but, frankly,
if one is to get proper co-operation on all the security issues at a
border, the management structure must be much simpler. Obviously,
airports are not physically the edge of the country, but, from the
point of view of people coming in, they are, in essence, the border.
The Government are making a mistake in not trying to simplify the
management
structure.</div>
					<a name="07031613000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
situation at Heathrow, where there are five different police forces as
well as all the other agencies that have been referred to, is a
mistake. There is not necessarily any great merit in dwelling at length
on how one handles the process once someone gets into the country. My
party argues that they are the responsibility of the ordinary police,
but the Conservative position is that they should be the responsibility
of the border police. Regardless, from a management perspective,
managing a single border force would allow a far better job to be
done.</div>
					<a name="07031613000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
discussed previously what would happen if somebody were to get past the
immigration officer. Does everyone else say, &#147;No, that is not my
job, it is the designated immigration officer&#146;s job to chase
that person&#148;? Do they allow that person, huffing and puffing, to
go past four different police forces, the railway police, HMRC and the
security services because it is the immigration person&#146;s job and
under the law only they can do it? That is a mistake. On that basis, we
support new clause 4, but obviously with amendment
(a).</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): We have received a
copy of &#147;Enforcing the rules&#148; by the Home Office with a
foreword by the Minister. I know irony is not dead in the Home Office
because one of the chapter titles is &#147;Making it happen&#148;,
which is something we have not seen from the Home Office for the past
10 years.</div>
					<a name="07031613000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I would be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s reasoned, coherent objection
to a border agency. I have examined the literature and the comments of
a previous Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn
(Mr. Straw), in his response to the 2001 Select Committee on
Home Affairs report. There seems to be no real issue of principle.
Indeed, no practical reasons have been given for the Government to
resist the recommendations of a number of people who are experts in
their field to have a border agency. He said at the time that there
would be a lot of links with inland operations, a reduction in skills
and objectives to the lowest common denominator&#151;the meaning of
which I confess to not fully understanding&#151;and disruption caused
by reorganisation. Given that many other European countries have been
able to put into place and continue to have successful border agencies
or equivalent organisations&#151;Austria, France, Greece, Poland and
Portugal, for example&#151;I am astounded that we are not in a
position to learn anything from the European experience.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>
					<a name="07031613000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like the Minister to
answer a point concerning the capital and revenue costs of the likely
border agency. In that document, which was published on 7
March&#151;it is an exquisite example of new Labour gobbledegook, but
I beg your indulgence, Mr. Amess&#151;the Government
pledge
to</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;redesign
our existing intelligence units so that they manage the flow of
information into, through and out of the organisation in a more
structured and systematic
way&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031613000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is,
obviously, the obligatory commitment to a step change. This is the
important part:</div>
					<a name="07031613000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;create a
function in each region to collect, analyse and disseminate
information, and link this into HMRC, DWP, SOCA, police, SCDA and local
authorities, allowing them to focus on local compliance and enforcement
priorities&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031613000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My challenge
to the Minister is: is he seriously suggesting that the commensurate
costs, both capital and revenue, associated with that level of
co-ordination across all those agencies, would always come out lower
than creating a border agency as proposed by my hon. Friends and
indeed, in a different way, by the Liberal
Democrats?</div>

						<a name="07031613000495"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Iain Wright</b> (Hartlepool) (Lab): I was particularly
interested during the morning sitting by the contributions of the hon.
Member for Monmouth, particularly his comparisons with regard to
Cardiff international airport and Newcastle international airport. It
seemed that the crux of his argument was that smaller airports such as
Newcastle would benefit from a single UK border force. As a north-east
MP who is very proud of what has been going on with regard to the
expansion of Newcastle and Durham Tees Valley airports, may I point out
that Cardiff had2 million users in 2006 and Newcastle
international airport had 5.45 million last year?</div>
					<a name="07031613000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that that undermines
the Conservatives&#146; argument on the matter. It shows the weakness
of the intellectual argument, but also profound ignorance of the
north-east region.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000496"></a>David
T.C. Davies:
						</b>
						I am delighted that the
hon. Gentleman has given way but I must point out to him&#151;perhaps
he was concentrating on other matters when I spoke&#151;that I did
not mention the north-east at all. The point that I was making was that
the larger the airport becomes, the harder it is for personal
relationships to develop between the different people responsible for
policing and, therefore, the less effective that policing is likely to
be&#151;hence the need for a border security force. It certainly was
not a comment on the abilities of anybody involved in policing in any
particular
airport.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000497"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b>
						I am extremely grateful for that
intervention, but I now find the argument even more
preposterous&#151;Newcastle international airport is apparently not
even in the north-east. That is absolutely unbelievable. The hon.
Member for Monmouth cited the argument advanced on Second Reading by
the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) that Newcastle
international airport often does not have immigration officers. He
advanced that as an argument for new clause 4 and I am saying that that
argument is intellectually
weak.</div>

							<a name="07031613000500"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I will respond to the points raised as quickly as I
can. I suppose that I should acknowledge the movement in Opposition
policy. It would be churlish of me not to welcome the progress over the
past 15 months. Only 15 months ago, we were hearing about policies for
the renegotiation of the Geneva convention, the provision of offshore
processing centres for refugees, a ring of steel&#151;an idea that
lasted about 15 seconds when the right hon. Member for West Dorset
(Mr. Letwin) tried to defend it to John Humphrys&#151;and
the James review and slide 105, proposing to cut 50 per cent. of the
immigration and nationality directorate&#146;s
budget.</div>
					<a name="07031613000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That the
Opposition have moved from the ring of steel to concrete plans
regarding disorder at the border is some progress, but not perhaps as
much as the hon. Member for Ashford would like to present. There are,
however, some quite serious issues that we need to tease out. I have
always been clear in the debates on the subject that I retain an open
mind about the creation of a single border force in the future, but I
have said consistently that I am yet to be persuaded by the proposals
or that now is the right time.</div>
					<a name="07031613000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Ashford
this morning prayed in aid some of the evidence that was presented by
the Home Affairs Committee in 2000. No doubt, like me, he has read the
evidence from the Association of Chief Police Officers, which said
that, although a single border agency made broad strategic
sense&#151;I think that that was the phrase that it used&#151;it
was uncertain of the cost and benefits. There are potential benefits in
this realm, and the question is whether there is a different way of
achieving them.</div>
					<a name="07031613000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about the need to attack organised crime harder.
We heard oral evidence suggesting that that was extremely important.
Tackling that kind of crime is precisely why we set up the Serious
Organised Crime Agency and pulled agencies together. As we heard in
oral evidence, 25 per cent. of its budget is devoted to tackling
illegal
immigration.</div>
					<a name="07031613000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen
(Mr. Denham) asked whether there should be a greater
alignment of powers. There is no legal barrier to aligning those
powers. Section 8(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979
allows Treasury Ministers to designate Customs powers to immigration
officers and, indeed, to anybody they class as a proper officer.
Paragraph 1(1) of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 allows the
Home Secretary to confer immigration powers on other people. Schedule 7
to the Terrorism Act 2000 allows immigration officers, police and
Customs officers to act as an officer under the relevant schedules.
With that power, we are trying to align police powers with those of
officers on the border.</div>
					<a name="07031613000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Therefore,
there is no legal barrier to the alignment of powers. That leaves us
with the question of whether there should be greater operational
alignment of activities. I think that the answer to that is yes, which
is precisely why there is a programme in place to help to deliver
that.</div>
					<a name="07031613000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Peterborough raised an important question, which he put
intelligently: how do we co-ordinate the intelligence that needs to be
shared 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>between the different agencies? If he has not yet been, I invite him to
visit the joint border operations centre at Heathrow, which brings
together four or five different agencies to screen intelligence from
airlines. It has already provided us with 8,000 alerts and something
like 800 arrests and is an excellent example of, asSir Andrew
Green called it, the capability of British agencies to work together
very well. There are already parts of the country where one can see
what is, in effect, a single agency providing the primary line, with
referral to specialist, secondary-line capabilities where needed. At
Poole or Coquelles, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs lead the
search, bringing in immigration officers where appropriate. At
Blackpool, the police are in the lead, bringing in HMRC where
appropriate. At Gatwick, immigration officers operate as Customs
officers, referring back to HMRC as the secondary line where
appropriate.</div>

						Many
of these changes are already seen in practice. The benefits, therefore,
could potentially be achieved by a different course. We have to weigh
some of the risks against the changes. I have consistently said that,
at a time when the terrorist threat to this country is severe, we risk
a distraction if we reorganise; when we want focus, we will be asking
people to reapply for their jobs. That is why I thought my hon. Friend
the Member for Burnley was right to quote Sir Andrew

							<a name="07031613000502"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I will make one more point, with which, perhaps,
the hon. Member for Ashford will help me. I understand that nobody, on
any Bench in the House, is proposing the merger of the Army, Navy and
Air Force. We recognise that different forces have different cultures,
specialisms and traditions; those different capabilities and history
are an important part of what makes them effective. Do we insist on
integrated command and intelligence? Yes, we do. Does that require a
full-scale merger? No, often not&#151;different things can achieve
the same effect.</div>
					<a name="07031613000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final example that I would give here is the United States, which was
prayed in aid. The United States has had an interesting challenge with
illegal immigration. Some papers, such as <i class="I">The New York Times</i>,
have estimated that the population of illegal immigrants in the United
States has gone from7 million to 12 million in the space of a
few years. Interestingly, during the same period the United States has
been trying to introduce a single border force. Going around Dulles
airport, one will indeed see a common primary line, but step into the
second line and one will see the component agencies still organised in
their traditional ways of working&#151;that is five years
on.</div>
					<a name="07031613000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
interested in the reference by the hon. Member for Peterborough to
European border forces. They are so effective that while this country
has the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>lowest number of asylum seekers not since 1997 but since 1993, asylum
claimants in Europe in the last quarter of last year went up&#151;not

					<a name="07031613000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the

					<a name="07031613000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are no
theoretical reasons why a single agency might be better at the
effective co-ordination of components. To consider the kind of change
proposed we would need to see a significant step up in performance.
There is a second problem with the amendments, which come from ideas
that have been drafted for prospectuses and manifestos, including by
the Liberal Democrats, who came up with the idea first&#151;the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley will correct me if I am wrong&#151;or
certainly some time ago. A number of observers might be concerned that
the clauses as drafted are, frankly, slightly Blue
Peteresque.</div>
					<a name="07031613000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sweeping
Crown powers are placed in the hands of the Secretary of State without
any provision for oversight of governance, which was and is of deep
concern to ACPO. Only this morning we heard from the hon. Member for
Ashford about the importance of parliamentary accountability, but there
is no provision for that, despite placing Crown powers in the hands of
the Secretary of State. Sweeping powers are put into regulations, a
principle that the hon. Member for Ashford has spent two weeks arguing
against, while large parts of business have fallen off altogether.
There is, it appears, a separation of the regulatory functions of
controlling admission, including the arrival of tourist and business
travellers. It is true that the clause provides for the Secretary of
State to determine other functions by order, but again I am surprised,
given the arguments of the hon. Member for Ashford over the past couple
of weeks, that such sweeping powers are put in
regulations.</div>
					<a name="07031613000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then, of
course, there is the risk of a new fragmentation because of the
disconnection between, for example, visa-issuing posts abroad and
in-country policing. That betrays a very 20th<span class="Sup"> </span>century
concept of the frontier. The frontier is not an isolated place any
more; it is intimately connected both abroad and in-country. To
separate that and snap those links would be dangerous, but not as
dangerous as what concerns me most&#151;the proposal that the system
would be underpinned by the cancellation of the identity cards
project.</div>

					<a name="07031613000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Half the
Minister&#146;s speech was quite serious. The other half was just
garbage and not worthy of the proverbial wet Tuesday night in midlands
towns that one of my hon. Friends got in trouble for talking about. I
shall deal with the serious parts of the Minister&#146;s speech.
First, would the split in the Home Office that its Ministers,
particularly the Home Secretary himself, have been touting around the
media&#151;and, I understand, Cabinet Committees&#151;be relevant
to a unified border force and the safety of our borders? Of course it
would. The Minister&#146;s whole argument, inasmuch as there was one
in the serious parts of his speech, was that this is not the right time
for such a force, yet the biggest change in the Home Office&#146;s
history is being touted at the same time. I gently suggest to him that
that is not a solid piece of ground on which he can stand.</div>
					<a name="07031613000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know how much the Minister
enjoys praying in aid Sir Andrew Green&#151;he did it about five
times in a 10-minute speech, struggling to find anyone else to support
his point of view. Good for him; he hasSir Andrew Green
on-side on this particular narrow issue. Nevertheless, Sir
Andrew&#146;s point is undermined by what is happening in the Home
Office at the moment. Even if we do not get the Home Secretary&#146;s
gleaming vision of an organisation split in two, so that the police
service and the Prison Service end up in different empires, which seems
to be a recipe for even bigger disasters with non-communication than
the onesthat we have seen in the past few months, we will
still have the Minister&#146;s radical reorganisation of the
immigration and nationality directorate, with which he is happily
proceeding at the same time as he is prepared to stand in this
Committee and say, &#147;We must not contemplate reorganisation
because it will get in the way of doing the job.&#148; On any level,
his argument is incoherent.</div>
					<a name="07031613000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, I was
delighted to hear the Minister say that he will keep an open mind on
our proposal. That is significant progress because I can sniff a U-turn
months or years before it happens. If the Government wish to take on
board more Conservative ideas, we are always happy to provide them and
to continue to make the political weather during this Parliament, as we
are doing. Genuine progress has been made because we think that the
issue before us is important and that our proposal would make a big
difference.</div>
					<a name="07031613000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
grateful that during the course of the Minister&#146;s speech, he
made it clear that there was no legal barrier to combining the various
powers, which lies at the heart of our proposal. He said also that
there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>was no operational barrier. Indeed, he gave helpful examples of where
such a process can happen now. Any practical arguments, therefore,
against our proposal have been blown away by him this
afternoon.</div>
					<a name="07031613000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned the importance of SOCA. I agree that it was a good
idea to set up that agency&#151;we supported it&#151;to fight
serious and organised crime. He will be aware that among the senior
police officers who supported a border force, there were murmurs of
surprise because SOCA did not include one. He said that, in effect, in
many parts of the country we already have a single agency on the front
line. That is good, but we should follow through that logic and make it
more coherent.</div>
					<a name="07031613000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister made some semi-serious points about possible deficiencies in
the drafting of new clause 4. We would be happy to take amendments. So
far, the Government have tabled a lot of amendments to the Bill, so if
they want to table some to our new clause, they may&#151;we are not
proud. We want legislation to be as good as it can be. If he wants to
do that, therefore, I am sure that we can come back to it at a later
stage.</div>
					<a name="07031613000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider
the weight of evidence from those who know about such matters. Almost
all are in favour of the proposal. In what I thought was a slightly
half-hearted attempt to oppose it, the Minister was forced to rely on
some fairly cheap soundbites and, indeed, at the start, on a speech no
doubt prepared for Labour candidates during the 2005 election. I sensed
that even he was embarrassed about having to deliver it in 2007 in this
rather different political landscape.</div>
					<a name="07031613000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am now satisfied that there
is no substantive Government argument against our proposal and,
therefore, commend the amendment to the

Green:
						</b> I beg the Committee to pay attention, as amendment
No. 92 gives effect to amendment No. 93, which was considered with
clause 18. I am sure the Minister will know that, as he will have
remembered every detail of our debates on that clause. However, I will
briefly repeat the points that we made about the amendments to clause
18.</div>
					<a name="07031613000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention of
the amendment is to save taxpayers&#146; money, as it would remove
the unnecessary duplication of immigration officers rightly having to
go through the various difficult and bureaucratic procedures involved
in handling cash that has been seized. All members of the Committee
will agree that it is a particularly sensitive area in which the
reputation of the police is high, and we should do nothing that might
affect it. The amendments would let the police do the work that they do
at present, without replicating the systems for the immigration
service.</div>
					<a name="07031613000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
94 is similarly consequential on the previous amendments, and it would
remove the powers of forfeiture from immigration officers. If the other
amendments were accepted, the cash would be handed over within 48
hours, so the powers in subsection (2)(g) would not be
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07031613000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In a previous
debate, the Minister made an interesting point about whether it would
be operationally difficult to hand over the cash within 48 hours. It
would be unfortunate if that were the case, given what we have heard
about the tremendous integration of all the different services. On
reflection, the Minister&#146;s argument was not particularly
compelling. The amendment would be a practical way forward that could
remove a small risk that would be added to the system if the clause
remained as drafted.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000530"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I think the amendments have been slightly distorted
by their grouping and the fact that the related amendment has been
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="07031613000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
remaining amendments would remove the provisions relating to the
detention and forfeiture of cash, which would weaken the ability of
immigration officers conducting search operations to seize cash because
they would not be able to apply for the power of detention or
forfeiture of cash seized. That would be problematical because it would
remove one of the key powers with which we want to equip the
immigration service. We want to increase, not decrease, the number of
illegal-working operations and to be able to confiscate illegal wages
and assets belonging to employers who break the rules or turn a blind
eye or something worse. That is important.</div>
					<a name="07031613000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">A question was raised about
training. As the hon. Member for Ashford rightly said, reassurances are
needed because that is a sensitive area. I agree with the sentiment
that he expresses.</div>
					<a name="07031613000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The legal
machinery that we seek to put in place effectively puts a gloss on the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; it adjusts the existing
legislation so that it works for immigration officers. Five important
protections remain in place: prior judicial approvals, or the approval
of senior officers before a search that is made explicitly for cash; a
code of practice applies to the use of search powers that we propose to
extend to encompass immigration officers; seizure can be for only 48
hours, then magistrates must approve it and the money must be paid into
a high interest account; any request to retain or detain the cash 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>means that magistrates have to be satisfied and anybody with an interest
can apply to the court at any time; and, of course, if forfeiture is
required, we have to convince magistrates that that is the right thing
to do. There are also appeal lines to a Crown court. So, a number of
protections are already set out in POCA and we are going to adjust them
so that they apply here.</div>
					<a name="07031613000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cash seizure training is very
important. We are asking HMRC and the Assets Recovery Agency to develop
it with us, and we hope to have it up and running by the end of the
month. I think that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the group of
amendments is now slightly distorted and that its effect would be to
weaken the power of immigration officers to police illegal-working
operations. I hope that he is persuaded that there are sufficient
protections in place, and that he will see fit to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07031613000536"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> The effect of the first two amendments, amendment
No. 121 being consequential on amendment No. 120, would be to extend
from six to 12 months the period during which a magistrates court may
make an order to return property to its owner. It is worth the
Committee, and Ministers in particular, considering what constitutes a
reasonable length of time during which somebody can claim back their
property from the Government. I am sure that it is accepted on both
sides of the Committee that the Government cannot be expected to hold
on to a person&#146;s property for an inordinate length of time or
for an indefinite period. Clearly there has to be a cut-off point, but
what is a reasonable cut-off point? We do not believe that extending
that period from six to 12 months puts an extreme or disproportionate
burden on the administration of justice.</div>
					<a name="07031613000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are positive arguments in
favour of such an extension. It is quite likely that some people who
have their property seized in connection with immigration offences, and
might be entitled to it back, are some of the poorest, most vulnerable
people in society. Previously, we have had some interesting exchanges
about whether the force of the law is aimed at falling more on
employers of illegal workers rather than the illegal workers
themselves. There has been a fair degree of consensus that it is both
more useful and more just to tackle the employers. It is also more
efficient, as that would be the way to stop most illegal working. It is
nevertheless unarguable that illegal workers will get caught up in the
process. We have agreed that many of them are working illegally not
only because they are in the country illegally, but because in their
vulnerable position they can be exploited and paid below the minimum
wage. They are therefore overwhelmingly likely to be poor.</div>
					<a name="07031613000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first and obvious point to
make about that group of people is that any property seized from them
will not amount to much. More importantly, it might be all their
worldly goods. It is not a question of someone paying a fine; it might
be everything that they have. In those circumstances, it is important
to consider the length of time during which the property can be
reclaimed. Ministers might consider whether there is not a moral
obligation to keep the case open for as long as is practical, so that
the small amount of property that such people have may be returned to
them after a reasonable amount of time. Many of them will not be
familiar with any kind of legal mechanism for retrieving their own
property. Many of them will have little command of the language and
absolutely no experience of the legal system in this country, and might
well come from countries where for the state eventually to give back
property that it has seized is a wholly alien idea. They are therefore
unlikely to be sufficiently up to the mark to get their property
back.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>
					<a name="07031613000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I would guess
that many people who have lived their entire life in this country would
be surprised to discover that they can get their property back from the
state after it has been seized, but I think that that would be even
more applicable to those who might be affected by this aspect of the
Bill. Among that group, possible suspicion of the attitude of the state
will be increased by some of the terms of the Bill, which they might
find onerous. We have had discussions about how much control the
Government should take, and are taking, over where people live and how
often and to whom they should report. If someone has been arrested, had
their property seized and been through a legal process, then come out
the other end without having been convicted, they will be unlikely to
want to come forward and make themselves known to the state. It may be
worth considering giving them some encouragement to do
so.</div>
					
					
					<a name="07031613000459"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07031613000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
122 would require the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps to
identify the owner of seized property, taking account of the fact that
the person may, in the circumstances, need help to retrieve their
property. For example, it would be difficult to identify the owner of
the property if it had been seized from one of the houses in multiple
occupation, which we heard about in an evidence session, where many
people live. I have heard in other forums of houses in which beds are
rented out for eight-hour periods and occupied for 24 hours a day.
Three and four-bedroomed family homes may have 30 or 40 people living
in them.</div>
					<a name="07031613000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
beyond the bounds of possibility that in such circumstances,
identifying the owner of seized property will not be straightforward
and it would not be enough for the authorities to sit back and assume
that it would be clear. A few simple, routine steps could be taken that
would establish what belongs to whom, and amendment No. 122 and the
consequential amendment No. 123 would lay that obligation on the
Secretary of State, so that in this relatively small corner of the
powers and actions that the Bill promotes there would be some obvious
fairness.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000537"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b>
						During the exercise of their
statutory functions, immigration officers can lawfully seize and retain
property, which may include forged passports, forgery equipment and
other evidence of immigration-related offences. In addition, the Bill
gives the courts new, extra powers to cause property used by convicted
offenders to commit immigration-related crime to be forfeited to the
Secretary of State. At present, the immigration and nationality
directorate lacks the necessary legal powers to dispose of property
that comes into its possession.</div>
					<a name="07031613000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The immigration service is
increasing its capacityto investigate immigration-related
crime and as a consequence the Home Office will incur rising costs in
storing and increasing amounts of seized and forfeited property. In
some cases, the retention of the property could become unlawful, so it
is necessary to provide for the disposal of the property that is held
by the IND in similar circumstances to those in which the police and
SOCA can dispose of property. The powers have two separate aspects:
first, the court has the power to order the disposal of the property,
and secondly, the Secretary of State may make regulations for its
disposal. I will come to that in a moment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>
					<a name="07031613000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s points were about ensuring that adequate and
appropriate safeguards are in place in respect of the power of
disposal. I will attempt to reassure him about the safeguards. In
respect of amendment No. 120, he will know that clause 22 is intended
to make provisions that are equivalent to the existing powers of
disposal of the police; it is nothing further than that.</div>
					<a name="07031613000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasing the time in which a
person claiming forfeited property can apply to the court for a
disposal order would be inconsistent with the existing legislation and
I believe that it would be unjustified.</div>
					<a name="07031613000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where we are talking about
forfeited property, there will already have been court proceedings,
during which the court decided to make the forfeiture order. As part of
those proceedings, a claimed owner would be able to make
representations. For example, under section 25C of the Immigration Act
1971 the court must give an interested person the chance to make
representation before forfeiting a vehicle used to commit a
people-smuggling offence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once property has been
forfeited, a person claiming the property will have a further six
months to apply to the court for the return of the property, provided
that they can show that they had nothing to do with the original
offence that led to the property being forfeited. That is in line with
the police and SOCA legislation, and it gives ample opportunity for the
court to take account of the legitimate rights of an innocent property
owner. The property owner can state their claim at the forfeiture
hearing and they also have another six months in which to lay a claim
before disposal.</div>
					<a name="07031613000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
property is seized from a vulnerable person, the owner will be
ascertained and in that situation the court can only order that the
property is returned to the owner. So, the property has been forfeited
because it has been used to commit a crime; the property will only be
returned to that person, as I said, if they show that they had nothing
to do with the crime. Therefore, there is protection for a vulnerable
person.</div>
					<a name="07031613000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to amendments Nos. 121 and 123, the clause allows regulations to be
made for the disposal of property where the owner cannot be
ascertained, or where the court has already ordered
forfeiture.</div>
					<a name="07031613000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
safeguards in the clause to protect the rights of the innocent property
owner. Where a court makes a disposal order, that does not affect in
any way the right of any person to bring legal proceedings for recovery
of the property within six months of the date of that order. Under the
police and SOCA regulations, property may be disposed of only after it
has been in the possession of the Secretary of State for a
year.</div>
					<a name="07031613000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
where the owner cannot be ascertained, the clause absolutely meets the
aims of the amendment that the hon. Gentleman has suggested, namely
that the period of time before property can be disposed of is increased
from six months to 12 months. It is in relation to forfeited property
that the period of six months applies. As I said, the safeguard in that
situation is that there has already been an order of the court and the
person who wants to lay claim to the property can do so. So, if the
property has been ordered to be forfeited, it is a period of six months
before disposal; if the owner cannot be ascertained, the period before
disposal is 12 months.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>
					<a name="07031613000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those measures are appropriate
safeguards. They apply at the moment, both to the police and to SOCA in
disposing of property, and they are working well.</div>
					<a name="07031613000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 122 is, in fact,
unnecessary because in cases where regulations enable disposal of
property because the owner cannot be ascertained, the Secretary of
State must act reasonably under usual principles of administrative law.
That point is already covered; the Secretary of State must take
reasonable steps to ensure that the owner cannot be ascertained before
disposal and they would be expected to demonstrate that that was the
case.</div>
					<a name="07031613000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having given
those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is able to withdraw
his amendment. I would reiterate that the safeguards apply; we meet
some of his requirements, and where we do not extend the period of time
to 12 months, that is because there has already been an opportunity at
a forfeiture order hearing for the individual to lay their
claim.</div>

is an attempt to help the Government by putting into practice some of
the rhetoric that we hear from Ministers. On Second Reading, the
Minister rightly made great play of the Bill&#146;s importance in
attempting to crack down on illegal employment and, specifically, on
those who employ illegal labour. As I mentioned in my remarks on the
previous group of amendments, that was the subject of some of the most
arresting evidence from witnesses. Indeed, over recent weeks the
Government have embarked on a range of activities, some of which will
be useful, but others worse than useless, in order to crack down on
illegal working&#151;a worthwhile ideal. One can see what they are
trying to
do.</div>
					<a name="07031613000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 97 would help the Government by increasing the maximum penalty for
those who knowingly employ illegal immigrants from two to four years in
prison. That is dear to the hearts of the Minister and the Home
Secretary, which is why I am hopeful that the amendment will get a
sympathetic hearing from Labour Members. It refers to the common
difficulty that we have debated in this Committee and with the
witnesses: is the real problem with illegal immigrants tricking
employers into believing that they are here legitimately or with
employers deliberately employing them precisely because they are
illegal
immigrants?</div>
					<a name="07031613000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the Minister has been so assiduous in quoting Sir Andrew Green, it is
only fair that I quote Jack Dromey, who made a very interesting point.
He said that he had heard about Portuguese workers in this country
deliberately obtaining false Brazilian passports so that they can
pretend to be illegal workers and take jobs below the minimum wage. If
their employers had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>known that they were legal workers, they would not have taken them. That
shows the Alice in Wonderland state of some of our employment
practices.</div>
					<a name="07031613000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
tells us two things: first, some people are desperate to find work in
this country but do not think that they can find any, even at the
minimum wage, and secondly&#151;this is significant for the
amendment&#151;some employers are ruthless and clued up enough to
want to employ only illegal workers and would not contemplate employing
legal ones. There is no difference of opinion on that in the Committee.
We need to crack down on those
people.</div>
					<a name="07031613000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
parenthesis, clearly such activity might well promote illegal
immigration on which, I am afraid, the Minister&#146;s biometric
passports and so on will have very little effect. We need a very strong
deterrent for anyone wanting to indulge in such practices. The
amendment would strengthen the Bill by sending out a clear message to
the small number of irresponsible employers who damage the name of
British business. Understandably, they are unpopular with trade
unionists and employers organisations, who I know have been urging the
Government to make sure that they crack down effectively on this type
of illegitimate employment practice. This amendment enables the
Government&#151;indeed, enables the House&#151;to send out a very
clear signal of what we think about that type of exploitative
employment practice. We think it should be unacceptable and we think
that its consequences should be extremely serious. That is why we
propose doubling the potential maximum penalty. I hope this finds

Hemming:

						The amendment goes to the nub
of an issue that was raised previously by the trade unions but is also
a concern of the CBI. The question is how we enforce immigration
regulations. There is an element of consensus in both the trade unions
and the employer organisations that we should crack down on those
people who intentionally go out to employ undocumented
workers&#151;the example cited was supposed to be from
Leicestershire.</div>
					<a name="07031613000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The challenge
is to distinguish between those people and the ones who get trapped in
a situation where what is known in one part of the organisation is not
necessarily known to the management. The challenge is to identify mens
rea&#151;the strategy of going for undocumented workers because they
have no employment rights and therefore they can make more money out of
them, or potentially not pay taxes and so on.</div>
					<a name="07031613000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am inclined
to support this provision on the explanation given, but the challenge
actually does not necessarily rest in the Bill. The view of the CBI is
that these issues will be addressed in future circumstances. But it is
very important indeed that we get the balance on this right; because
otherwise one ends up with the situation that Jack Dromey referred to,
which causes a lot of problems when you have legitimate employers but
the balance between the work force and the employer changes. The
subtleties here have a substantial
impact.</div>

						The clause is a minor technical
amendment to ensure that there continues to be a power of arrest for
the new offence of knowingly employing an illegal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>worker when the existing similar offence under section 8 of the Asylum
and Immigration Act 1996 is repealed. This amendment will add the power
of arrest with warrant.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Knowingly employing an illegal
worker is a significant offence. The offence was introduced in the
Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, and we have already
toughened up the offence. A person convicted of employing an illegal
worker under the 1996 Act can only be fined, whereas under the new
offence in section 21 of the 2006 Act, those convicted face a maximum
of two years imprisonment and an unlimited fine or both.</div>
					<a name="07031613000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is indeed
the case that many people we have taken evidence from have made a clear
and significant point, as we do ourselves, about the role of illegal
employment and the need to bear down on illegal employers. But I would
say to the hon. Member for Ashford that our view is that the two-year
maximum is an adequate and proportionate way of dealing with these
offenders. It is comparable to other maximum sentences for non-violent
crimes. His colleagues and, I presume, he himself supported the 2006
Act. This is a new offence. They made no objection at the time to the
two years. He will also know that we have not yet implemented this
measure, so it has not yet been tested as it is recent legislation.
There is no current evidence that four years would be a better
deterrent than two, so our view is as it was when that Act was
introduced in 2006&#151;that two years is the appropriate response
and already represents a significant toughening of the
measures.</div>

						<a name="07031613000542"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con):
						The
response to that is that one of the benefits of a Public Bill Committee
is that we have been able to hear evidence, which the other Committee
was not. The evidence has convinced us that four years would be more
appropriate. If someone were sentenced to two years, how long could
they actually expect to spend in
prison?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000543"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> That would depend on a number of factors, not least
that person&#146;s behaviour in prison. It is not something on which
I can give the hon. Gentleman an answer in years or months, as he is
probably aware. I accept that he listened to the evidence. We have not
only listened to the evidence but we had a significant amount of
discussion on the matter while constructing the Bill. Like all those
who gave evidence, we recognise the crucial significance of dealing
with illegal employers, and particularly the notion of
&#147;knowingly.&#148; That brings me to the points made by the
hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley.</div>
					<a name="07031613000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are civil penalties for those who are careless and employ an illegal
worker but do not do so knowingly. Employing illegal workers is a
serious matter&#151;a criminal offence with a criminal conviction. A
prison sentence of two years is significant and we should not lose
sight of the fact that an unlimited fine can also be applied. On that
basis, and because we do not have evidence that four years would be a
greater deterrent than two, we are not able to support the amendment. I
urge hon. Members to support the clause as it
stands.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000544"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I am disappointed that the Under-Secretary thinks
that, particularly as I was not treading on the tentative ground of the
fact that the tough clause in last year&#146;s Act is still not in
force, which she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>then brought up. I thought that I would forgo the opportunity to point
out that that is yet another example of the classic problem with the
current Home Office&#151;the fact that it introduces legislation as a
substitute or displacement activity for effective action. Last
year&#146;s provisions are not yet in place, but we are considering
this year&#146;s Act. We are promised an Act next year as well.
Legislation is ever flowing, but activity on the ground is rather less
visible. That is unsurprising, because the Home Office cannot get round
to implementing all the legislation that it
passes.</div>
					<a name="07031613000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that
the two-year sentence is not yet in operation, meaning that we cannot
hear any evidence as to whether it is effective, is not a particularly
strong argument against the amendment. There is no evidence about two
years, four years or any period that one cares to name, so the
Under-Secretary cannot pray that in aid. As she rightly said, we
supported that part of the 2006 Act because we believe not only that
the offence is serious but that, considering the figures, it is
increasingly common. The knock-on effects of it being known around the
world that Britain is the place to come and work illegally are very
serious. At the extreme end of horror are episodes such as the cockle
pickers and the dead Chinese people in the lorry in Folkestone.
However, even without such terrible tragedies it is bad in all sorts of
ways for this country. It is bad for employment and for social cohesion
that Britain has become one of the parts of the world in which illegal
working is endemic. I am not reassured by the Minister&#146;s
arguments, so I seek to press the amendment.</div>

Green:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in
clause 25, page 13, line 29, after
second &#145;the&#146;, insert
&#145;attempted&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07031613000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment continues our attempt to inject some more toughness into
areas of the Bill that we think need it. Its effect would be to amend
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>Immigration Act 1971&#151;an Act from an era when Governments used to
pass one immigration Act per Parliament&#151;to create an offence of
attempting illegal entry into the United Kingdom. It would
significantly toughen the measures on facilitation in this
clause.</div>
					<a name="07031613000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a
matter of dispute across the Floor of the House that we wish to toughen
up the laws against those who deal in the human misery of trafficking
and the exploitation that it causes. I know that we shall consider
those under later clauses. The amendment seeks to extend the reach of
the law to those who try to help others to enter the UK illegally but
are unsuccessful. It is clearly a common feature of parts of the
criminal code that attempting a crime, as well as actually committing
it, constitutes a crime in itself. Given that we all agree on the
seriousness of the offences concerning people trafficking, we think
that it is worth while to make this addition to the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07031613000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that we all know from
constituency cases&#151;if not, we have all read about it&#151;that
it is common for people who do not get into Britain the first time to
try again in later years. Around the world, Britain&#146;s borders
have a reputation for being porous and it is thought to be relatively
easy to get into this country. That acts as encouragement. Any steps
that we can take in the Bill to create countervailing factors that will
discourage people from making multiple attempts to get into this
country are worth doing, not least because we all know that many of the
illegal people here&#151;probably about three quarters, which is the
number we all work on, although the Minister can correct me&#151;have
been trafficked. Therefore, there is a large criminal business behind
this sphere of activity. Anything that we can do&#151;not only to
send signals but to take practical effects&#151;to minimise that
would benefit not just us but many of the victims of people
trafficking.</div>
					<a name="07031613000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment the traffickers will get away if the attempt is unsuccessful.
Clearly that is wrong and we should try to stop them. Indeed, in other
parts of the Bill the Government are taking welcome measures to reduce
the attractiveness of people trafficking, which is the fastest growing
global crime; it is up there with gun-running and drug-running, and is
growing faster than either of them. I support Government measures to
crack down, and here is one more thing that would be useful, another
tool in the armoury. Therefore, I hope that the Government will look
with some sympathy on the
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000560"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support over
facilitation and trafficking. I am conscious of the support that the
whole House affords on the proposed measures and of its concern about
such horrendous crimes. This clause and clauses 26 and 27, which we
will go on to debate, deal with facilitation of illegal migrants and
asylum seekers. The hon. Member for Ashford is right that three
quarters of illegal immigration is estimated to be facilitated by
organised crime gangs or by individuals seeking to profit from this
misery. This clause and clause 26 deal specifically with people
smuggling, which is the facilitation of illegal immigration for profit,
normally of individuals, who have sought the help of or have paid
facilitators to assist them to migrate. That is different from human
trafficking, which involves the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>facilitation of illegal migrants, including those who have been coerced
or duped with the purpose of exploiting them, often as prostitutes or
cheap labour; we will have the opportunity to discuss that subject when
we debate clause 27. What both activities have in common is that
victims of this trade are seen merely as commodities. I need not remind
the Committee of such tragic and high-profile incidents as those of the
Morecambe bay cockle pickers or the group found in the refrigerated
lorry at Dover, because they have already been
mentioned.</div>
					<a name="07031613000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
aims to protect vulnerable people by strengthening existing
facilitation offences. Section 25A of the Immigration Act 1971 makes
knowingly and for gain assisting the arrival in the United Kingdom of
an asylum seeker an offence. Clause 25 will extend that offence to
ensure that all acts facilitating either the arrival in or entry to the
United Kingdom are covered by the offence. A person is said to have
arrived in the United Kingdom upon disembarkation. That is distinct
from his or her entry into the United Kingdom, which takes place at
border control. At some ports there can be a considerable distance
between. I am thinking that, after stepping off the plane at Heathrow,
it can be some time and distance before one gets to the point where one
meets the immigration officer and has one&#146;s passport checked.
That physical and legal gap is exploited by facilitators, who use the
opportunity to carry out acts such as the destruction or disposal of
false passports. Even though such acts are often captured on CCTV or
witnessed by surveillance officers, they cannot currently be taken into
account as evidence of facilitation because they have occurred after a
person has disembarked or
arrived.</div>
					<a name="07031613000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Front-line
staff at ports are very frustrated by the difficulty in securing
convictions against facilitators. Last year, 42 convictions were
secured by immigration officers, but they estimate that 30 per cent. of
those suspected of facilitating go unpunished because of that gap. I am
sure we all agree that it is right that we should empower immigration
officers to tackle this problem.</div>
					<a name="07031613000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can reassure the Committee
that, as a matter of policy, only immigration officers who are trained
in arrest and criminal investigation matters are able to take forward
prosecutions. They are also bound by the provisions of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant codes of
practice.</div>
					<a name="07031613000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the intention behind the amendment and we want to enhance
our ability to tackle people smuggling and reduce the harm that it
causes to victims and the wider public. We agree that we need to ensure
that acts of attempted facilitation are also punishable, as well as
those that are successful. However, that mischief is already addressed
by legislation and case law. Section 31(3) of the 1971 Act defines an
entrant as someone entering or seeking to enter the UK. That definition
has the effect of establishing that attempted entry is equivalent to
actual entry, for the purposes of dealing with the relevant
offence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
interpretation has been adopted by the courts and is demonstrated in
case law in this area. Furthermore, section 1(1) of the Criminal
Attempts Act 1981 provides that, in the majority of cases where an
offence is triable either way, it is an offence to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>attempt to commit an offence. The facilitation offences fall into that
category. Therefore, as long as an individual undertakes actions that
would lead to the commission of an offence of facilitation, he or she
will be guilty of an offence of attempted facilitation.</div>
					<a name="07031613000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">An individual convicted of
attempting to facilitate another&#146;s arrival or entry into the UK
would face the same maximum penalty as if the facilitated arrival or
entry had been successful, that penalty being a fine and/or
imprisonment of a maximum of six months on summary conviction, or a
fine and/or imprisonment of 14 years on conviction on
indictment.</div>
					<a name="07031613000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is for
those reasons that the proposed amendment is unnecessary, but I very
much welcome the support of the hon. Member for Ashford for the
clause.</div>

which is one of the more important extra powers that the Government are
rightly taking in an attempt to stamp out people trafficking. I just
wonder whether the Under-Secretary could give some explanation of the
practicalities of applying these powers extraterritorially. Presumably,
she is seeking to hunt down and prosecute people who may never set foot
in this country. Although that is a laudable aim, I simply raise the
question of how practical it will be and how much effect it will have
on people who, as we have just been discussing, are some of the
world&#146;s most serious and hardened criminals.</div>
					<a name="07031613000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be grateful if, during
the debate on the clause, the Under-Secretary would give us some

							<a name="07031613000563"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> I have already set out for the Committee the
challenge that we face from those who seek to profit from the misery of
those seeking to migrate illegally. As we have heard, people smugglers
do not respect international boundaries or immigration laws and they
will seek to exploit any gaps and vulnerabilities. The clause seeks to
amend the existing facilitation offences to ensure that those who carry
out acts of facilitation, whether those acts are committed within or
outsidethe UK, can be prosecuted, irrespective of their
nationality.</div>
					<a name="07031613000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Currently,
these offences cover only acts of facilitation committed within the
United Kingdom. Unless a perpetrator overseas is a British national or
a body incorporated in the UK, they are not encompassed within the
scope of the offences. We know that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>carry out acts of facilitation outside the UK, for example by planning a
route, making transportation arrangements, purchasing tickets and false
documents or assisting people in deceiving carriers at check-in. Many
are responsible for multiple attempts on the border, and it is simply
unacceptable that those who engage in such activity abroad can be held
accountable for their actions only if they are British nationals. That
is why we have acted to remedy that
unfairness.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the clause,
then, is to extend the scope of the offences by removing the existing
limitations on their extraterritorial applications so that they cover
acts of facilitation directed at the United Kingdom wherever in the
world they are committed and regardless of the nationality of the
perpetrator. That will ensure that immigration officers are fully able
to tackle individuals who exploit vulnerable people. Because of this
clause and clause 25, immigration officers estimate that successful
prosecutions against facilitators will increase by up to 50 per cent.
In addition, the extended territorial scope of the offence will act as
a significant deterrent to those who involve themselves in such
criminal
activity.</div>

Gentleman says, this is one of the fastest growing areas of global
organised crime, if not the fastest growing. We hope that the powers
that we are taking and the ability to so extend our reach will make a
big difference&#151;a 50 per cent. increase in convictions. The
figure of 42 is for last year, and we want the level of convictions to
be much higher in
future.</div>
					<a name="07031613000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
an example of how the new powers might help by giving the hon.
Gentleman a scenario. A Singaporean national seeks leave to enter the
United Kingdom as a business visitor. The immigration officer is not
satisfied with the stated reasons for the visit and thus decides to
interview the passenger further. At the same time, a female passenger
presents a Singaporean passport to another immigration officer and is
found to be an imposter. Evidence is obtained showing that the female
imposter and the male Singaporean national have arrived on the same
flight and hold consecutive tickets. Checks confirm that the passengers
have a joint booking and that the tickets were paid for using a credit
card in the name of the male Singaporean national. Airline staff in
Singapore confirm that the passengers checked in together and claimed
to be newly-weds. They were allocated adjoining seats and checked in
their luggage under the same name.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>
					<a name="07031613000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Singaporean male did an act
to facilitate the arrival of the female imposter, but he could not
currently be charged with facilitation as all the above acts took place
abroad and he is not within our jurisdiction as a non-British national.
Under the new legislation, we would for the first time be able to take
account of those acts of facilitation in making a case against that
person. In the past we have only been able to do that in respect of
British nationals.</div>
					<a name="07031613000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the use of
extradition in relation to these measures. With that, I ask the
Committee to support the
clause.</div>

Green:
						</b> The purpose of these amendments is to amend the
Sexual Offences Act 2003 to increase the penalties for some offences
relating to trafficking specifically for the purposes of sexual
exploitation. In our most recent debates we have discussed the extent
and the seriousness of all people trafficking. One of the particularly
unpleasant subsets of people trafficking is trafficking for the
purposes of sexual exploitation. What we seek to achieve with these
amendments is to send an even clearer signal than we are sending
atthe moment of how much we deplore this particular
trade.</div>
					<a name="07031613000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are pleased
on these Benches that the Government now agree with us. They have
signalled their intention to sign the European convention against
trafficking and I can only reiterate what I said in previous
debates&#151;that signing the convention and increasing penalties for
this crime are an important step forward. They enable the House to send
a very clear signal that this type of crime needs to be hit hard now,
at the point when it is growing so much. Without this type of measure
and without both effective policing and stern sentencing it is likely
to grow.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>
					<a name="07031613000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It is one of
the inexorable side effects of increasing globalisation and of
people&#146;s increasing ability to move about the globe, and in
particular to move from relatively poor countries to relatively rich
countries, that opportunities open up for criminals as well. One
opportunity that we know they are exploiting hugely is the ability to
traffic young women and girls for sexual purposes. One of the most
terrifying and vivid statistics I have seen is that five years ago 15
per cent. of prostitutes working in Britain were foreign-born; the
figure now is 85 per cent., so only 15 per cent. are British-born.
There has been a complete reversal in a very small number of years in
that particular unfortunate group. That shows the extent of the
increased criminality and why it is so important to act against
it.</div>
					<a name="07031613000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
99 would subject all those found guilty of trafficking people for
sexual exploitation to the risk of automatic deportation. Amendment No.
100 is consequential and in effect puts the words of amendment No. 99
into clause 28. We are therefore seeking to increase the penalties for
people trafficking for this particular purpose.</div>
					<a name="07031613000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Committee
has already debated the appropriate length of sentence before a person
is eligible for automatic deportation. That is a very important debate
to be had about this Bill. What we are seeking to do with these
amendments is to add this peculiarly unpleasant offence to those
provisions. It seems to us that one of the most effective signals we
can send&#151;because it is practical, not just sending a
signal&#151;is that if a person has committed a serious immigration
offence, which this kind of trafficking certainly is, then it is
reasonable for this country to withdraw its hospitality from that
person and add them to the group of people who can be automatically
deported.</div>
					<a name="07031613000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of these amendments is simply to encourage the Government to move in a
direction that I know they want to move in anyway. It seeks to toughen
the Bill. It seeks to make these important provisions even more
rigorous and robust. I therefore commend them to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07031613000571"></a>Joan
Ryan:
						</b> We made it clear in the IND report, &#147;Fair,
effective, transparent and trusted: Rebuilding confidence in our
immigration system&#148; that we are committed to working with
overseas partners to tackle the challenges of global migration, which
includes implementing measures to tackle cross-border crime. In that
regard, we have ratified two important United Nations protocols: the
protocol against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air, and
the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons,
both of which came into force on 11 March 2006. In addition, our
intention to sign the Council of Europe convention on action against
trafficking in human beings, to which the hon. Member for Ashford
referred, was signalled by the Prime Minister on 22 January. It will
build on our strategy to combat human trafficking by providing minimum
standards of protection and victim support.</div>
					<a name="07031613000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We have
always said that we are wholly sympathetic to the objectives behind the
Council of Europe convention, which will provide greater support for
all victims of trafficking and support the fight against organised
immigration crime. We did not want to sign the convention 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>until we had fully assessed the risk associated with the provisions and
how we might implement them safely while maintaining effective
immigration control. Signing the convention now means that its
implementation can be monitored under the UK action plan on human
trafficking, which we will publish in the next few months.</div>
					<a name="07031613000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already done good work
to develop an effective enforcement response to this horrendous crime.
Last year, we established the UK Human Trafficking Centre, which will
become a central point for the development of police expertise and
operational co-operation. We continue to support adult
victimsof human trafficking through an investment
of&#163;2.4 million in the Poppy project. The scheme
provides safe shelter and support to assist in the recovery of adult
female victims who have been trafficked into the UK for sexual
exploitation.</div>
					<a name="07031613000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As we have
already discussed, trafficking is almost always a form of organised
crime and should be dealt with using criminal powers to investigate and
prosecute offenders for trafficking and any other criminal activities
in which they engage. The 2003 Act introduced wide-ranging offences for
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, covering trafficking into, within
or out of the UK for sexual exploitation. A further, UK-wide, offence
of trafficking for exploitation, which includes trafficking for forced
labour and the removal of organs, was introduced by the Asylum and
Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. Those offences
carry a heavy maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment on conviction on
indictment.</div>
					<a name="07031613000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In broad
terms, the existing trafficking provisions make it an offence to
facilitate arrival in, travel within and departure from the UK of a
person whom the facilitator intends to exploit or whom they believe to
be likely to be exploited. The offences currently cover acts of
facilitation that are committed within the UK and, where the
perpetrator is a British national, such acts that are committed outside
the UK. The clause will enhance the existing trafficking offences to
ensure that they cover acts committed after a person has disembarked
but before they have arrived in, or been granted entry to, the UK. That
will catch those traffickers who operate within the secure area of our
ports, as we discussed during our consideration of the facilitation
clauses. The clause will also extend the extraterritorial scope of
trafficking offences to cover acts of facilitation that are carried out
overseas, irrespective of the nationality of the perpetrator. The
clause applies the same extension of scope to trafficking as we have
agreed to apply to facilitation.</div>
					<a name="07031613000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to bring to the
attention of the Committee an amendment that we have tabled in respect
of the application of the provisions to Scotland. To the extent that
they relate to devolved matters, it is for the Scottish Executive and
the Scottish Parliament to decide what approach to take.</div>
					<a name="07031613000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the introduction of
the Bill it was noticed that subsections (1) and (2), which amend the
Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.)Act 2004,
relate to devolved matters in so far as they apply to Scotland.
Subsections (3) and (4), which make similar amendments to trafficking
offences in the2003 Act, do not apply to Scotland as the
provisions of that Act do not extend to Scotland. The application of
subsections (1) and (2) to Scotland in the introduction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>was an oversight and we will remedy it by tabling an amendment to limit
the extent of the provisions to England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.</div>

are united in their condemnation of those individuals who seek to

worked together closely on the development of the UK action plan to
tackle human trafficking.</div>
					<a name="07031613000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Scottish Executive is

					<a name="07031613000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments relate to a very serious topic on which there is some
consensus, but we need to discuss the detail of the proposal. Amendment
No. 98 would increase the sentence available to the magistrates court
from six months to 12 months. The offences in sections 57 and 59 of the
2003 Act are triable either way and like all such offences will be
amended when custody plus commences to allow magistrates to impose
sentences of imprisonment up to 12 months.</div>
					<a name="07031613000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be wholly
inappropriate for the Bill to purport to allow magistrates courts a
higher level of sentencing for these offences than is within their
jurisdiction, but I take note of the substance and the content of the
amendment. If magistrates courts hear cases that they think are too
serious to be punished adequately, they should commit them to the Crown

<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>court, where the full maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment will be
available. That would be a way
forward.</div>

						On
amendments Nos. 99 and 100, which refer to the automatic deportation of
prisoners convicted of trafficking offences, there will be three ways
in which a person can be deported on conviction of one of those
offences.If he is sentenced to a period of imprisonment
of12 months or more, the automatic deportation provisions will
apply. If the automatic provisions do not apply, he can still be
considered under existing deportation arrangements, either on conducive
grounds or as a result of a court recommendation for deportation.
Moreover, sections 57 and 58 of the 2003 Act are included in the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Specification of
Particularly Serious Crimes) Order 2004, known as section 72. If a
foreign criminal is imprisoned for those offences, the automatic
deportation provisions will apply.</div>

enjoy the benefits of signing up to the convention more speedily than
might otherwise be the case, as it could be used as a vehicle through
which we can do so. Many other European countries have already signed
up. I hope that the Under-Secretary will regard the amendment as a
gentle and friendly push in a direction in which she wants to move

entirely the wrong message if we could not reach agreement on issues
such as this, and I am heartened that we are able to do so. I can tell
him that we seek to sign very shortly, but I cannot give him an exact
date. Of course, upon signing, we will be able to implement the
convention. He is right that his amendment provides for some key
measures from the convention, but we could probably implement those
sooner by signing the convention than by waiting for the Bill to be
enacted, although, of course, we can implement some of those measures
without legislation or the
convention.</div>
					<a name="07031613000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">To assist
the Committee, I shall provide some information about measures that we
have taken already and comment on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments. On proposed new subsection (6) to section 4 of the Asylum
and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, we have
provided staff with guidance for identifying victims of trafficking at
the earliest possible stage. The Home Office has developed an online
tool kit aimed at practitioners to increase awareness of trafficking
and to provide training on identifying and handling potential victims.
That is being provided for all regional enforcement
officers.</div>
					<a name="07031613000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On
reaching a decision to pursue repatriation of an individual,
consideration is given to our obligations under immigration laws and
the Human RightsAct 1998, including any risk that those
individuals face on return and humanitarian or other reasons for
allowing them to remain in the United Kingdom. On proposed subsection
(7) to section 4 of the 2004 Act, when the IND encounters children and
identifies child protection concerns, they are referred to local
authority children&#146;s services, in line with the IND&#146;s
existing procedures.</div>
					<a name="07031613000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any child aged 17 or less, in
the UK, who cannot be cared for by a parent or established care giver
must be accommodated by a local authority children&#146;s services
department. Those departments are charged with the responsibility for
the care and well-being of children in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>the UK, as set out in the 2004 Act, and reinforced by statutory guidance
subject to independent inspection. The support is mandatory, regardless
of immigration status, and is automatically given to any children
granted refugee or subsidiary status. To support the identification of
children in need, the immigration service has also provided specialist
training to about 600 operational members of staff in the United
Kingdom. The message that children arriving in the UK might be here as
a result of coercion or criminal activity, including trafficking, is
central.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have always said, we are
wholly sympathetic to the objectives of the Council of Europe
convention, which will provide greater support for all victims of
trafficking and support the fight against organised immigration crime.
The convention will build on our strategy to combat human trafficking
by providing minimum standards of protection and victim support. As I
have outlined already, we have done some very good work to develop an
effective enforcement response and last year we established the UK
Human Trafficking
Centre.</div>
					<a name="07031613000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
convention provides the framework for victim provision to be enhanced
for victims of sexual exploitation and to be created for victims of
forced labour. That will also improve the effectiveness of our
enforcement strategy. The measures in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment are extremely important. As he said, two of them are taken
from the convention, which we will sign and implement as soon as
possible. As I have said, however, we have already taken some

							<a name="07031613000588"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I shall be speaking to the amendments standing
in my name and shall also say a few words about the amendments in the
name of my hon. Friend the Member for
Monmouth.</div>
					<a name="07031613000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
now come to the subject of automatic deportation, as it is termed by
the Government. Briefly, to assist the Committee, as the Bill stands,
what is described as automatic deportation will generally be triggered
when a foreign offender receives a sentence of at least12
months imprisonment. There are other circumstances in which it may be
triggered under the clause, when an offence is specified under
condition 2, but generallythe trigger mechanism is a sentence
of 12 months imprisonment. My amendments are refinements on that, as
are the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend. That is the starting point
for the
debate.</div>
					<a name="07031613000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
should say, so as to give the Committee a complete picture, that in the
case of sentences of less than 12 months imprisonment or of
non-custodial sentences the existing law on deportation remains in
place. As I understand it&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am
wrong&#151;someone who does not set off or come within the ambit of
the trigger mechanism of 12 months imprisonment may still be
recommended for deportation by a court; or the Home Secretary may
decide to deport the person concerned on the grounds that his or her
presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good,
even if the court has made no recommendation. That is the existing law.
The Bill adds to that the category of automatic deportation. That is
the difference that the Bill
makes.</div>
					<a name="07031613000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
58 seeks an additional trigger mechanism in the case of a person who
receives a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed at a time
of not having valid leave to be in the United 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>Kingdom; that means, basically, somebody who is an illegal entrant or an
overstayer in the United Kingdom and who does not have permission to be
in the country. The Committee may remember that I specifically raised
that question with
Migrationwatch.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some sympathy with the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Monmouth. He would trigger automatic deportation when a
foreign offender receives any sentence of imprisonment, as opposed to
what is on the face of the Bill, which is a sentence of 12 months
imprisonment or one of the offences specially listed by the Home
Secretary. I do not know what the Minister will reply, but whatever
else he says, I do not think he will be able to say that my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendments are entirely unreasonable, because the
Government had the same idea originally. The Committee will remember
that there is quite a history as far as the provisions are concerned,
from the early part of last year&#151;the Minister winces at that
recollection. I do not propose to go over the whole of that history; I
will save the Committee that, but I think it highly relevant to the
amendment to remember what the then Home Secretary originally said to
the House when dealing with the aftermath of the problems&#151;if I
may put it that way&#151;over foreign
deportations:</div>
					<a name="07031613000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will consult on whether that presumption should be made statutory
through primary
legislation&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07031613000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
was referring to the presumption that deportation would follow, unless
there were &#147;special circumstances&#148; where it could
not.</div>
					<a name="07031613000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Such a
presumption would include all criminals sentenced to imprisonment, all
those convicted for an offence listed in an order under section 72 of
the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, all those on the sex
offenders register, repeat offenders and, of course, all those
recommended for deportation by the sentencing judge. We believe that
there is a strong case for extending those proposals to any individual
who is convictedof an imprisonable offence, whether or not a
sentence of imprisonment was actually given, and we will consult on
that too.&#148;&#151;[Official Report, 3 May 2006; Vol. 445, c.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000589"></a>David
T.C. Davies:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving
way and for enlightening us in that manner. Is it not the case,
therefore, that the original proposals put forward by the Government
were far less moderate than the proposals that I am putting forward
today?</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000590"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> My hon. Friend is correct. However, that was
not the final version of the Government&#146;s thinking. To be fair,
they moved on from the position of all imprisonable offences committed
by a foreign offender resulting in a presumption of deportation, which
was going to be put into statute and presumably was what they were
thinking of at the
time.</div>
					<a name="07031613000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">We then moved to
the present Home Secretary, whose own proposals in this regard, which
he described to the House in a written statement, seem to be on all
fours with those in my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. I shall quote
what he said in that
statement:</div>
					<a name="07031613000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
believe it is essential to be clear about our long-term policy. My
objectives are straightforward: all non-EEA nationals who are given a
custodial sentence should face deportation; and deportation should
happen as early as possible in that
sentence.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 May 2006; Vol.
446, c.
79W.]</div>
					<a name="07031613000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There is
not much room for doubt there as to what the present Home Secretary
wanted. He wanted what I think appears in the form of my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>So it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what has prompted
the shift in the Government&#146;s thinking: away from the Home
Secretary&#146;s predecessor, who wanted imprisonable offences to
result in automatic deportation; to the present Home Secretary, who
wanted all sentences of imprisonment to result in automatic
deportation, and finally to this measure, which sets the trigger for
automatic deportation at 12 months&#146; imprisonment.</div>
					<a name="07031613000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite natural to ask why
the Government have engaged on this retreat. The public will want to
know and I think that it is a fair question to put: why should foreign
nationals who have abused their position in the UK by committing
serious offences for which only a custodial sentence is appropriate be
allowed to stay in this country? It might be the case that the Home
Secretary and his predecessor were thinking similar thoughts when they
made their proposals.</div>
					<a name="07031613000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like to point out
that, if the Bill is amended to make the trigger mechanism a sentence
of imprisonment rather than 12 months imprisonment, it appears to be
the case that all the protections afforded to an offender in the Bill
would remain. There are quite a lot of them. I have noted that there
are a large number of exceptions, some of them in the form of
protections for an offender, particularly in respect of offenders who
are claiming asylum. There is also the full range of protections for a
foreign offender under the European convention on human rights,
including article 8, the right to family life. All those protections
are in the Bill and they would apply as much to somebody who is
sentenced to imprisonment following an offence as they would to
somebody receiving12 months imprisonment. All those
protections are in place, so I would like to hear from the Minister why
he wants to give additional protections to someone who receives a
sentence of imprisonment of less than12
months.</div>
					<a name="07031613000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to my
amendments. Amendments Nos. 58 and 59 cover a slightly different case:
the case of a person without leave to remain in this country who
commits an offence. If I may, I pray in aid the support of
Migrationwatch, because I asked it specifically about that issue. We
heard a lot about Migrationwatch this morning; I think that the
Minister was quoting Migrationwatch left, right and centre, if I can
put it that way, and it was an unshakeable authority for the
propositions that the Minister wanted to advance. What Migrationwatch
had to say about the point that I put to it in support of amendment No.
58 was absolutely clear. It clearly thought that it was right that
somebody in the country without permission to be here who offended and
received a sentence of imprisonment should be asked to leave the
country, and deported.</div>
					<a name="07031613000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The case of
somebody who commits an offence without having permission to be in the
country is different from that of somebody who does have that
permission, not least because, as the Minister will confirm, that
person is liable for removal whether or not they have committed an
offence. They will be subject to administrative removal rather than
deportation, but it has the same effect&#151;they are removed from
the country. I know that the Government are interested in removing such
people, because they produced a paper about it two weeks ago with great

<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>fanfare. It explained how they would crack down on people who were
illegally in the country by way of overstaying or whatever.</div>
					<a name="07031613000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an important
difference there, and in the light of that I hope that the Government
will welcome the amendment. Somebody who is illegally in the UK,
commits an offence and is arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to
imprisonment should automatically be deported, subject to the
exceptions and protections in the Bill. My amendment would ensure that
all offenders who commit an offence resulting in imprisonment and do
not have leave to be in the country are deported.</div>
					<a name="07031613000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, such people are
liable for deportation in any case. Are we to say that somebody who
goes through the process of being arrested, charged, tried, convicted
and sentenced to imprisonment should be released from prison to
continue their illegal presence in the country and perhaps, who knows,
to be texted a fortnight later to be told they should not be in the
country? Perhaps great efforts would have to be made on the part of the
IND to locate exactly where they were once they had left prison so that
they could be removed from the country. Members of the public would
want to know why such a person was not removed from the country as a
result of their sentence of imprisonment as night follows day, subject
to the exceptions in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07031613000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendment No. 55 and I shall also make a few remarks about amendments
Nos. 14 to 18, which stand in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for
Monmouth. The amendments are on a separate issue. I have said that the
trigger for automatic deportation will be 12 months imprisonment, but
there is an issue of exactly what that means for that purpose. Under
the interpretation in clause 34(1), it seems to me that a considerable
number of offenders who receive a sentence of more than 12 months will
not be subject to automatic deportation because of the meaning that the
Bill gives to such a sentence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I shall
explain why 12 months will not mean12 months in a number of
cases. The Bill prevents consecutive sentences totalling more than that
from being counted as a 12-month sentence. So for example&#151;the
Minister can correct me if I am wrong&#151;someone who offends on
separate occasions and receives a series of two or more consecutive
sentences in a single court appearance totalling more than 12 months
will not be subject to automatic deportation, because he has not
received a single sentence of 12 months. Under the Bill, however long
the consecutive sentences are and whatever their total, as long as each
individual sentence is less than 12 months such an offender will not
automatically be
deported.</div>
					<a name="07031613000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall give one or two examples. A foreign national who commits two or
three offences of burglary and receives nine months to be served
consecutively for each offence&#151;that is how the courts are told
to sentence people who commit offences on different
occasions&#151;could be sentenced to a total of 18 or 27
months&#146; imprisonment and not be subject to automatic
deportation. There is a problem with repeat offences, and the
interpretation in clause 34 can be described only as a concession to
serial offenders. My question to the Minister is why the Government are
making that concession. Why are they showing generosity to people who
repeatedly commit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>offences? It is not just a single offence. They are committing repeated
offences and violating this country&#146;s hospitality. Why cannot
they be subject to automatic deportation if their sentences total more
than 12 months?</div>
					<a name="07031613000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 55 covers a
similar point. As the Bill stands, it could give rise to another case
in which 12 months imprisonment will not necessarily result in
automatic deportation. I am talking about offenders not being deported
despite being sentenced to a total of more than 12 months imprisonment
for separate offences in a single court appearance.
AmendmentNo. 55 covers a slightly different point, too,
although it is on the same lines, because under the Bill as
drafted&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;a
suspended sentence is not taken into account even where the foreign
national commits a further offence and the sentence is activated to run
alongside a sentence for a new offence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A foreign
offender who commits an offence and receives a suspended sentence of 12
months imprisonment will not automatically be deported, and if during
the period of his suspended sentence of imprisonment he commits a
further offence and receives a further sentence of imprisonment, he
will not be subject to automatic deportation unless the second sentence
is itself more than 12 months imprisonment. He will not be
automatically deported even if the suspended sentence is implemented
consecutively so as to make a total sentence of12 months. Thus
an offender who receives a sentence of 12 months imprisonment suspended
for two years is not automatically
deported.</div>
					<a name="07031613000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
suppose that that offender commits a further offence within that
two-year period for which he receives a sentence of nine months
imprisonment in a separate court appearance. If he is sentenced
to21 months imprisonment in which the 12-month suspended
sentence is activated consecutively to the nine-month sentence of
imprisonment, which is how courts regularly sentence people who are
subject to these provisions&#151;they are probably told to do
so&#151;he will not be subject to automatic deportation, even though
he is a repeat offender. In his case, not only is he a repeated
offender, but he has repeatedly appeared in front of the courts and
taken no notice when they have told him, in no uncertain terms, that he
will be sent to prison if he commits a further offence during the
period of his suspended sentence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The proposal
is another concession for serial offenders which is capable of
producing perverse results, and the public, if they heard about it,
might well regard it as a loophole. I can easily envisage a scenario in
which a foreign citizen receives sentences of more than 12 months in
one of the ways that I described and in accordance with court
sentencing practice he is not automatically deported and goes on to
commit further, serious offences. The question would be asked why the
person concerned, having received a sentence of more than 12 months
imprisonment, was not deported in the first place, and the answer would
be that Parliament left a loophole.</div>
					<a name="07031613000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment provides us with
a chance to ensure that we do not leave a loophole, that we bring some
coherence to the Government&#146;s provisions and that we send a
clear message to people that they should behave themselves in this
country, especially if they are here
illegally.</div>

Clappison:
						</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention. I said that the public might regard it as a loophole. As
I am sure that he will recollect that, at the beginning of my speech in
support of the amendments, I mentioned that the Bill is in addition to
the provisions in existing legislation. The court recommended the
deportation of offenders or a separate power for the Home Secretary to
deport someone whose presence in the country is not conducive to the
public good. Those provisions were in place in the spring of last year
when we experienced all those problems.</div>
					<a name="07031613000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions are subject to a
legal mechanism and a series of appeals. The proposals before us are
the outcome of the Government&#146;s attempts to improve the
situation in the light of last spring. It is the case that the sort of
person who I described might be deported, but as we found out last
spring, that is not always the case. Let us imagine that the public
found out that such a person, having not come under the provisions of
the Bill, had committed more serious offences, having already received
more than 12 months in prison, but not been automatically deported. I
can picture in my mind&#146;s eye the television reporters on the
steps of the court saying that because of a loophole, X, Y or Z was
able to remain in the country, even though theyhad been
sentenced to more than 12 months&#146; imprisonment. The Committee
has the chance to say, &#147;We have seen the loophole so let us
close
it&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000593"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> This is a complex area, with which the Bill tries
to deal with too few words, unless discretion is given to the courts. A
lot of different circumstances could arise. Reference has been made to
EEA citizens, but the Bill refers only to British citizens. The legal
position of EEA citizens with a legal right to be here is unclear.
Furthermore, it is entirely unclear whether suspended sentences count
as periods of
imprisonment.</div>
					<a name="07031613000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
face an odd situation. The clause provides for a simple process of
automatic deportation when certain conditions are satisfied. Where else
should that apply? What approach should we take? In a couple of words,
we could specify whether any sentence of imprisonment, or one of a year
or more, would be necessary. Alternatively, would it be best to leave
that decision to the discretion of the judge who can consider all the
issues on the hearing at first instance? In effect, the judge could
apply a number of sanctions: fines, imprisonment&#151;suspended or
otherwise&#151;or he could press the button for deportation,
although, obviously, the Secretary of State would actually order the
deportation. Under the previous system, the Secretary of State could
consider deportation. The newer one says that it will ensue, unless the
Secretary of State pulls
back.</div>
					<a name="07031613000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us consider
the example of a repeat burglar, which was a good one. Clearly, we do
not want such a person in this country: they have come in on a
visitor&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>visa and carried out burglaries. There is no reason for that person to
remain in this country and, frankly, there is no reason to lock them up
for three years and then deport them when we could lock them up for six
months, save ourselves a lot of money and then deport
them.</div>

						</b> A lot of people would say that that is not
correct. The message needs to go out to fellow burglars from the
country that that person came from that they cannot simply come here,
commit burglaries, wait until they have been caught and then be given a
free flight home with nothing lost. People who commit burglaries should
be punished, which means that they should, indeed, spend several years
in prison before
deportation.</div>

Hemming:
						</b> I am not saying, &#147;Come here, steal things
and we will give you a free ticket back&#148;. I gave the example of
six months vis- -vis two years. We must consider the extent to
which we need to go beyond that. It is an issue to be considered, but
not necessarily now by this Committee. Our amendment gives the judge
the discretion to say in certain circumstances that are not covered by
the automatic provisions or the list in the statutory instrument,
&#147;Let us put this person on the conveyor belt towards
deportation. When he has completed his sentence, he will be
deported.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031613000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that different people find themselves in very different
circumstances, and that needs to be considered at the court of first
instance. One of my constituents, who does happen to be a British
citizen, was imprisoned for five years for dropping a cigarette. It is
a complex case that has gone badly wrong, and we are hoping to take it
to the Court of Appeal.
However&#151;</div>

T.C. Davies:
						</b> I do not know whether it is entirely in
order, but that is such an incredible example that I think that the
hon. Gentleman should spell out in more detail how anybody can have
been locked up for five years for dropping a
cigarette.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000597"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> It happens that my constituent has mental health
problems and he dropped the cigarette in his home, where his parents
live. A fire ensued and it was deemed to be reckless arson. Let us look
at the mens rea issue&#151;the question of intent. Consider the
offence of careless and reckless driving by somebody who has lived in
the country for a number of years. They lean down inside their car to
pick something up, and it happens to run into other people. They get a
short period of imprisonment, not necessarily a year. Are we saying
that, having lived here for 30 years, they should automatically be put
on the conveyor belt for deportation? That is a very different sort of
offence from that committed by somebody who goes around burgling lots
of people, where there is identifiable intent to cause misery to
others.</div>
					<a name="07031613000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consider also
circumstances where somebody on a student visa goes out with other
students, they get a bit drunk and do something rather stupid. That is
not the same mens rea as the situation in which somebody commits repeat
burglaries. That person would effectively have ended their studies
because they went 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>out and did whatever the other students happened to do at the time. We
cannot try to deal with those circumstances using the form of words
that we are considering here. There is, therefore, logic to giving the
judge the discretion to decide in circumstances that do not already
fall within condition 2 whether a particular sentence or conviction
warrants deportation. Whether that is taken into account to any extent
in terms of the period of sentencing&#151;obviously, taxpayers have a
concern about what is done in given circumstances&#151;is a matter
for Home Office guidance and further work.</div>
					<a name="07031613000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are proposing an alternative
approach. In certain circumstances, it will be a lot firmer because it
will involve a shorter sentence than a year&#151;so the example of
the repeat burglar would be trapped by that. However, in other
circumstances, it will allow consideration of the circumstances of the
individual. As I mentioned, people come here on student visas, and odd
things can happen. It is a complex situation and I do not think that
trying to deal with it simplistically deals with it properly in the
long term. A good example is that of the lad in the Orkneys. Hon.
Members might remember that there was a major campaign to prevent his
deportation. It had a lot of public support. He was not deported. That
related to an arson offence committed on a previous
occasion.</div>
					<a name="07031613000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
role for condition 2 and a statutory instrument determining a list of
types of offence. However, wherever the number of months or years is
set, there is going to be a problem. That problem is best resolved by
giving discretion to the judge. I wish to press amendment No. 134 to a
vote later.</div>

T.C. Davies:
						</b> This country has a proud history of offering
hospitality to people who have chosen to come here for different
reasons, and it is right that that should continue. Unfortunately,
while there have been many good examples of people coming here in large
numbers and living constructive lives, there has been a tendency
recently for some people from certain countries&#151;I might give an
example later&#151;to come with the deliberate intention of breaking
the law, in order to profit from doing so. My view, which may be shared
by Labour Members and even Liberal Democrat Members, is that we should
not have to tolerate that. There is a widespread view among all
communities that if people come here and abuse our hospitality, any
obligations that we have to them become null and void.</div>
					<a name="07031613000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of my two
amendments is to ensure that anyone who received a prison sentence
would face automatic deportation as a result. Given what my hon. Friend
the Member for Hertsmere has just said about the Government&#146;s
original proposals, they are very moderate amendments indeed. I
probably ought to become the hero of the <i class="I">Guardian-</i>reading

liberal than what the Government proposed some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>time ago. They originally talked about automatic deportation for anyone
who broke any rules whatsoever, but I am suggesting automatic
deportation for anyone who is sentenced to any form of imprisonment. As
we know, it is quite hard to get thrown into prison these days. One has
to do something very serious indeed to earn any sort of prison
sentence. I have heard a few examples. I have to say to the hon. Member
for Birmingham, Yardley that the example of the cigarette end was a
little bit misleading, if it resulted in arson in a house in which
somebody was living.</div>

not go down this road; I can feel an imaginary shovel in my hands as I
continue.</div>
					<a name="07031613000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
reasonable. People who are young&#151;by that I mean under the age of
20, and even a little bit older&#151;do silly things. I should think
that most of the people in the Room have done silly things and I
certainly include myself in that. One does not go to prison for doing
one-off silly things, or for doing things as a drunken
student.</div>

T.C. Davies:
						</b> It is clear from the amendment. We are
talking not about people who get fined, but about people who get
sentenced to any form of imprisonment. I purposely tabled the
amendments so that they would not include people who get involved in a
drunken prank while they are a student, or somebody else who shoplifts
something. They would not face any form of imprisonment and therefore
would not be automatically deported either. We have to draw the line
somewhere. I have clearly referred to anyone who gets a sentence of
imprisonment. It is quite difficult to get such a sentence. One has to
do something quite serious to get
it</div>

intent. Do people intend to achieve the results that are achieved? I do
not want to go through a list of offences or examples of people who
have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>imprisoned. I cited that example from my constituency because it
involved somebody who happened to be mentally ill at the time. He
dropped a cigarette and did not do anything about it. He pleaded
guilty, which perhaps was also a mistake, but that is life. He has now
got a problem. There are situations in which someone might get a short
prison sentence. We have to look at the wider issue of where we set the
limits on the
rules.</div>

T.C. Davies:
						</b> To be truthful, the problem with setting any
limits on any rules is that there will always be cases that make the
rules look a bit silly. The truth of the matter is that if the
amendments are passed, there will occasionally be somebody deported who
one might reasonably think should not be deported. That will happen,
but rarely. The problem at present is that there are many thousands of
people in this country who should be deported&#151;I believe that
Government Members would agree with that&#151;but who are
not.</div>
					<a name="07031613000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give one
example. I was looking on the force computer a couple of weeks ago and
learned that a gang of pickpockets from Chile is operating in tube
stations. There are about a dozen in the gang. They are constantly
being arrested, but every time one is arrested, everyone else clubs
together to get them a solicitor and get them out of jail, whereupon
they go straight back to the tube and carry on picking pockets. It is
done in an organised fashion and the people who are involved are doing
nicely out of it. They are never, or very rarely, sent to prison, which
surprises me, but if they were sent to prison, they would not be sent
for12 months, because one is not sent to prison for12
months for picking
pockets.</div>
					<a name="07031613000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that everyone in this room would agree that those people should
automatically be deported. There is no reason why they should not be
sent back to Chile or why we should enable them to stay here to pick
pockets on the tube, yet they are not
deported.</div>

						I did not mention the last

deportation?</div>

months, in
prison.</div>

take away the existing power of the judge to recommend deportation if
he thinks that it is appropriate&#151;that is the discretion to which
the hon. Gentleman refers&#151;or for the Home Secretary, quite
independently of what happens in the courts, to make an order that
somebody&#146;s presence is not conducive to the public good? The
problem is that the procedures 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>are so labyrinthine and subject to uncertainty and bureaucracy that we
end up with the problems that we had last spring, but the powers remain
in

T.C. Davies:
						</b> Before we start to go around in circles, I
want to come back with one point about mens rea, which, as the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley knows, is all about intent. I shall not
name the country this time, because I know that it will get me into
trouble, but there is a problem in my force area with a certain
community that is constantly breaking driving regulations. That has led
to accidents, and people are driving around without tax, insurance,
MOTs or anything else
whatsoever.</div>
					<a name="07031613000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
that concerns me is not simply that the driving rules are being
flouted, but that people driving without licences are causing a danger
to others. Should they be involved in an accident, imprisonment of more
than 12 months is unlikely because there will not have been an intent
to cause serious harm to somebody, although that might be what actually
happens. I put it to the Committee that people who deliberately flout
rules in a systematic fashion should not be made welcome in this
country, and we should have no obligation to them, regardless of
whether they do or do not intend to cause somebody a serious
injury.</div>

						</b> If the hon. Gentleman considers what I have
suggested, he will find that it is very simple. Automatic deportation
will be presumed if somebody is sentenced to any period of
imprisonment. I do not see anything wrong in that, given the fact that
people are not sent to prison unless they have done something fairly
serious or are doing less serious things on a repeat basis. It is a
perfectly reasonable amendment and far more reasonable than the ones
put forward earlier by the Government. I offer it up as a third way. It
is a moderate compromise that we can all get behind and support, and I
put it to members of the Committee that they should do
so.</div>

position.</div>
					<a name="07031613000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall return to the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere
carried out an extremely good forensic examination of the way in which
the Government&#146;s position on deportation has oscillated, not
just from Home Secretary to Home Secretary, but between the existing
one and the legislation before us. However, I seek always to be kind to
the Home Secretary. The phrase that makes an extraordinary appearance
in clause 28&#151;&#147;automatic deportation&#148;&#151;should
not be laid at his door. I think that that phrase was used originally
by the Prime Minister in an unguarded moment at Prime Minister&#146;s
questions. Many of the difficulties and knots in which the Government
have entangled themselves ever since have resulted from an attempt to
justify the use of that phrase by the Prime Minister. Nothing in the
Bill suggests that anything will be automatic.</div>
					<a name="07031613000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that regard, the remarks of
the Immigration Law Practitioners Association are very relevant. On the
provisions to which the amendments refer, it
said:</div>
					<a name="07031613000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
provisions do not address the problem, which came to light last
year&#151;that IND had not been making decisions in respect of
foreign criminals, who were then released from prison into the
community without any consideration of whether a deportation order
should be made. The Bill refers to automatic deportation, which is a
misnomer. Deportation will not follow automatically. Officials will
still have to apply the provisions, and if officials do not do so no
deportation will
follow.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031613000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is clear,
and to a large extent unarguable. ILPA
continued:</div>
					<a name="07031613000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
provisions constitute an abrogation of responsibility on the part of
the Secretary of State. He is empowered to make a deportation order,
but currently has discretion not to do so if deportation is not
justified on the particular facts of the individual case. As drafted,
the Bill would remove the Secretary of State's
discretion&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031613000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I am
sure that that point appeals to the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley. I hope that the Minister will address it when he responds to
the amendments.</div>
					<a name="07031613000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">ILPA
went on to make a point that I feel very strongly
about:</div>
					<a name="07031613000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
provisions effectively allow for indefinite
detention&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031613000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To
a large extent, that is what we are now witnessing. Not unreasonably,
the Government have reacted to a crisis&#151;foreign criminals simply
being let out&#151;that led 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>to the sacking of a Home Secretary. Now we are just trying to lock them
up anywhere. Indeed, only yesterday, we saw that the Government are
putting such people in immigration detention centres. At places such as
Harmondsworth and Campsfield, violence and serious disorder has ensued.
That is not only bad in itself, but bad for the future operation of
detention
estates.</div>

Green:
						</b>
						Absolutely. I am more than happy
to do so, because I know how serious it was. It clearly could have been
even more serious, as the Harmondsworth incident became. I know that
the emergency services and those who were sent in to sort out the
situation behaved admirably, bravely and quickly to minimise its
effect. However, the incident illustrates starkly the fact that if we
carry on doing what we are doing, the position will remain
unsatisfactory.</div>
					<a name="07031613000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is not one of the parts of the Bill that will affect what might
happen in future or in a theoretically constructed situation. It
affects things that are happening now and going very wrong. That is why
there are so many amendments for us to discuss and why I, my hon.
Friends and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley are seeking to
improve the provisions. At the moment there is a toxic interaction of a
prison estate that is too full and a deportation system that is not
working. The only safety valve is the immigration detention estate,
which is not designed to take people who have been sentenced to prison
for serious offences. I am sure that that particularly unpleasant
combination of failures is one thing that keeps the Minister awake at
night.</div>
					<a name="07031613000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall speak
briefly to the amendments in my name. As the Bill is drafted, people
will be liable to automatic deportation only if they have been
sentenced to prison for at least 12 months. We have all sought
different ways to improve that and relax that constraint. I seek to
remove that criterion so that automatic deportation applies to any
person who has served a prison
sentence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
length of the debate, I suspect that nobody has said much with which
the Minister does not agree. We all agree that the deportation of
foreign prisoners is desirable in most cases&#151;the debate is about
prisoners only, which is an important distinction. We know that at the
moment only people who have committed serious offences are sentenced to
prison. That is all the more true given the current overcrowding in the
prison estate. It therefore seems to us extremely easy to argue that if
a foreign criminal has been given a prison sentence, by extension they
should lose their right to stay in this country. They have abused the
hospitality that it has afforded them and should therefore lose their
right to be here.</div>
					<a name="07031613000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have referred several times to prison overcrowding. I am sure that it
would help if the ability to deport foreign criminals who have been
given a prison sentence were extended so that it was not restricted to
those who had been sentenced to more than 12
months.</div>
					<a name="07031613000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
127 is another of our amendments requiring the Secretary of State to
report back. We had a lengthy, good debate this morning on the amount
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>parliamentary accountability that ought to come with such a Bill. It is
clear that the clause is one of the most important parts of the Bill,
so that applies particularly here. I have no wish to repeat what we
said this morning, but I wish to make one point: this is an area in
which ministerial rhetoric has been extremely strong. It was
instructive that on Second Reading the Minister said that his best
guess was that of the 10,000 or so foreign prisoners in British
prisons, about 4,500 would be subject to the deportation provisions
expressed in the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000622"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> Obviously, we need to distinguish the stock and the
flow. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for helping me to clarify
that point. The stock of foreign national prisoners is about 10,000,
but what I said on Second Reading was that there would be about 4,500
considerations each year. Obviously, some people will be locked up for
much longer and that figure will not always be
appropriate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000623"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I appreciate that. Clearly, the prison population
changes on a constant and daily basis. Nevertheless, the underlying
point is that the process will not be automatic for a large
number&#151;many thousands&#151;of foreign prisoners. Frankly,
there is a gap between the rhetoric and the reality of what the
Government are
promising.</div>
					<a name="07031613000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 142 is consequential to the previous amendment and, again, it would
expand the range of the clause. This debate has been enormously
important and if the Bill is designed to secure our borders, a much
better deportation system than the present one is necessary. I am sure
that the Minister recognises that and it is presumably why these
clauses are in the Bill. The various amendments tabled by me and by my
hon. Friends simply try to make that system genuinely effective and,
once and for all, to make it clear that Britain&#146;s borders are
open. People are welcome to come to this country, but they are not
welcome to come here and prey with criminal intent on its people. We
need to clearly send out that message.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000624"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I am grateful to hon. Members for an excellent
debate. In some of the exchanges betweenthe hon. Members for
Hertsmere, Monmouth and Birmingham, Yardley&#151;who is my
neighbour&#151;we have seen the different dynamics and ends of the
debate. I will take the Committee through the journey that I have
travelled because I have an enormous amount of sympathy with the
argument that has been eloquently put by the hon. Member for
Hertsmere.</div>
					<a name="07031613000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						What the
Government have tried to do in the clauses that we have structured is
provide for a degree of balance. The starting point for the debate is
that those who come to this country, commit a crime and receive a
criminal sentence face the prospect of deportation. As the hon. Member
for Hertsmere said, existing powers on the statute books provide for
that. The question left is how to ensure a stronger link between
criminality and deportation. What we have tried to do, as the
Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association has recommended, is
to remove some of the Home Secretary&#146;s discretion when making
those decisions. The Home Secretary was clear 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>that those who commit offences should face the prospect of deportation.
What we are debating in these clauses is the manner of execution for
that decision.</div>
					<a name="07031613000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
clauses will accelerate the removal of foreign national prisoners from
the country while increasing the certainly of removal. One of the
current problems is that when foreign national prisoners are considered
for deportation and handed a deportation order, nearly three quarters
appeal against the order despite the fact that about 55 per cent. of
appeals are dismissed and25 per cent. are withdrawn. That
process of appeal takes up to six months and that is too long. When
serious offences have been committed, we need to deport the individuals
effectively and if they wish to undertake an appeal, they can do so
from their country of origin, thanks very
much.</div>
					<a name="07031613000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
that we have debated this afternoon fall into four categories.
AmendmentsNos. 7, 8, 15 and 16, and 142, which is in the name
of the hon. Member for Ashford, challenge the threshold. The hon.
Member for Hertsmere raised a related point about offences committed by
individuals without leave and raised points, on which there a number of
related amendments, about suspended and consecutive sentences. The hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley put a point from the other end of the
spectrum about eliminating some of our proposals. I shall canter
through those points as quickly as I can.</div>
					<a name="07031613000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall reflect again on the
debate that we have had this afternoon, because it has been important.
I need to consult with colleagues in both the Home Office and the
Department for Constitutional Affairs in order to explore whether there
are areas in which we need to go further than we have provided for in
the Bill. I understand that hon. Members may wish to put some of the
issues to a vote, and that is fine. However, this is a signal that I
shall reflect carefully on what has been said.</div>
					<a name="07031613000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The starting point for the
question of balance is important. We have deliberately drawn the debate
widely; we have drawn the applicable population as broadly as we can. I
said earlier that the debate covers some 3.4 million foreign nationals.
The hon. Member for Monmouth asked where that figure came from. It came
from the operational modelling, data analysis and reporting services
published by IND in February 2007. If he wants more details, I shall be
happy to try to provide them.</div>
					<a name="07031613000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about the foreign
national population in this country is that it includes individuals who
might have arrived in this country moments after they were born.
Indeed, there may well be foreign nationals in this country who were
born in Britain after 1981 to parents who were not British, and are
therefore not British citizens. They are foreign nationals with
indefinite leave to remain; none the less, for the purposes of the
Bill, they are classed as foreign nationals and are therefore subject
to the foreign nationals clauses. Those individuals might have spent
all their lives in this country, so we need to inject a degree of
balance into cases in which we take into account people&#146;s
personal circumstances. That is why I think that it is not necessarily
appropriate to remove all discretion for all offences that carry a
sentence.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>
					<a name="07031613000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some individuals, such as those
born here to foreign national parents after 1981, have grown up in
Britain and are to all intents and purposes British, but are not
British citizens. If one of them committed an offence that was subject
to a sentence of imprisonment, he would automatically be deported.
Having reflected long and hard on that, I think that that would be
disproportionate.</div>
					<a name="07031613000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have therefore sought to structure in a supporting mechanism, and that
is recourse tosection 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and
Asylum Act 2002. I do not know whether Committee members have had a
chance to look at that, but it is important to do so. It is about 40
pages long and lists some 324 offences. Almost all of the examples that
have been given by hon. Members this afternoon, whether of burglary,
picking pockets or other types of theft, concern offences that appear
on the section 72 list and therefore carry the sanction of automatic
deportation. We wanted to avoid the situation in which somebody who was
born in this country after 1981 is convicted of the non-payment of a
fine and sentenced to a period of imprisonment and is then
automatically deported. That is not the same as saying that he should
not face deportation; provisions that are already in place mean that he
would do so. However, the outcome would beat the discretion of
the court or of the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07031613000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important point was very
well made by thehon. Member for Hertsmere about the automatic
deportation of those who commit offences when they are here without
leave. I confess to him that I started in precisely the same place as
he did. However, what leads me to suggest that his amendments Nos. 58
and59 should be withdrawn is the fact that there could be
situations in which injustice results from the changes that he
proposes.</div>
					<a name="07031613000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scenario that has been put to me&#151;it is, I am afraid to say,
perfectly plausible in my experience as a constituency MP&#151;is
that of a woman who came over as a spouse, possibly through an arranged
marriage, and her husband did not allow her to apply for indefinite
leave to remain. Through no fault of her own, she therefore found
herself without leave to remain in this country and then became a
victim of domestic violence. Maybe one day she fought back, committed
an offence and was therefore liable for imprisonment&#151;that is how
the hon. Member for Hertsmere has drafted the amendment&#151;and she
ends up being given a community sentence. However, under the precise
drafting of the amendment, she would therefore be automatically
deported. The protections that we have put in place might simply not
bite in that case.</div>
					<a name="07031613000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not to say that that
individual&#151;the woman in question&#151;would not face automatic
deportation; indeed, she would face automatic deportation. My argument
is that, in cases as complicated as that, we may need the consideration
process rather than an automatic process to unfold and it may be
appropriate to provide for an in-country right of appeal, rather than,
say, an appeal from Pakistan.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000625"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I appreciate the way in which the Minister is
contributing to the debate and promising to take matters away and think
about them. However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>may I come back to him on the example that he has just given to the
Committee? I think that it was the amendments by my hon. Friend the
Member for Monmouth that would change the wording to a sentence of
imprisonment rather than 12 months&#146; imprisonment. The way that
the Minister put it was that that individual would be liable to a
sentence of imprisonment, but instead would receive a community
sentence. That situation would not be covered by my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment; there would have to be a sentence of
imprisonment.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case that the Minister
has outlined to us, if the lady in question committed an offence that
resulted in a sentence of more than 12 months&#146; imprisonment,
under his own trigger mechanism she would face automatic deportation in
any case. In both cases, whether it is any sentence of imprisonment or
more than 12 months&#146; imprisonment, that person would have the
full protections afforded by exception 1, which would bring into play
the question of her rights under the European convention on human
rights, including the right to family life under article 8. I suspect
that those rights would cover the sort of case that the Minister
referred
to.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000626"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I think that the amendment that was tabled in the
name of the hon. Member for Hertsmere is No. 59, which
says:</div>
					<a name="07031613000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition
3 is that the person is convicted of an offence liable to imprisonment,
the commission of which took place when the person did not have valid
leave to remain in the United
Kingdom.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07031613000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand,
however, that there are a lot of amendments in this group.</div>
					<a name="07031613000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I am less
convinced than the hon. Gentleman that article 8 would kick in as a
protection and I agree that, under my own provisions, if the sentence
were for longer than 12 months there would indeed be automatic
deportation. However, I do not think that there would be a court that,
on review of the facts of that case, would necessarily hand down such a
sentence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I was also
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point about administrative
removal, which is, of course, important. That is because against
administrative removal, the right to appeal is out-of-country; to come
back in, one would obviously require entry clearance.</div>
					<a name="07031613000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The point
about suspended and consecutive sentences was one of the most important
parts of the debate this afternoon. The examples of offences that were
given were all offences that would have been captured by section 72 of
the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and therefore would
have resulted in automatic deportation. The argument about suspended
sentences comes back to some of the points made by my neighbour, the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley. We want to try to retain the link
between serious offences and automatic deportation.</div>
					<a name="07031613000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, the
issue with consecutive sentences is different. The hon. Member for
Hertsmere was quite right to question me quite closely about this
matter when I gave oral evidence to the Committee at the beginning of
our deliberations. The issue with consecutive sentences is this: if
somebody commits a series of offences that accumulate, should there be
automatic deportation or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>should there be a more flexible process of consideration by the
Secretary of State, with an in-country right of appeal? There is no
question whether someone is facing deportation; they do face
deportation. The path is simply different. The reason we propose the
latter course is that it is difficult to define in the Bill the period
over which the offences might be committed. For example, someone may
have committed an offence when he or she was 15 or 16; for the sake of
argument, let us say that the person was 18. The individual may have
been born in this country after 1981, grown up here, and then have
committed an offence 20 or 30 years later.Under these
provisions, that would result in automatic
deportation.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000468"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5 pm</div>
					<a name="07031613000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not dispute the fact that
that individual should face the prospect of automatic deportation, but
I think the force of the automatic deportation provisions may be the
wrong approach and risk an injustice, which would be unwise. The
protection of an in-country right of appeal may also be important in
order to provide that the Secretary of State does not get it wrong. The
point is simply that the period is difficult to stipulate and the
number of offences committed within that period is difficult to set in
stone. Again, I am not in a very different place from the hon. Member
for Hertsmere, because his real concern is about serial offenders or
recidivists.</div>
					<a name="07031613000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
different way to tackle that problem is by amending section 72 of the
2002 Act. That Act contains an order-making power, so it would not be
difficult for the Government to amend the section 72 list and introduce
changes. I was interested that the hon. Gentleman included burglary in
the crimes he mentioned, because that is already on the list. It is a
faster, more appropriate way to tackle the problem that he highlighted.
The problem of defining the time window in which the offences are
committed is so difficult that it may warrant a different process for
considering automatic deportation.</div>
					<a name="07031613000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I have picked up most
of the points that were made except the one that was raised by ILPA,
cited by the hon. Member for Ashford, which was concerned that we might
be locking people up indefinitely. There are, of course, the usual
protections under the European convention on human rights. We cannot
lock people up indefinitely; the IAT&#151;the immigration appeal
tribunal&#151;takes a pretty stiff view of that and looks for the
immediate prospect of deportation and
removal.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000627"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the manner in
which he has replied to the debate. My hope throughout has been that he
would at least indicate a preparedness to think constructively about
the amendments, which highlight problems that must be tackled and would
improve the Bill if they were implemented.</div>
					<a name="07031613000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I want to get
one little disagreement out of the way and then I shall move on to more
constructive matters. The Minister deftly fudged the distinction
between facing deportation and automatic deportation. When the Home
Secretary was speaking about facing deportation he was clearly talking
about these provisions for automatic deportation. There would have been
no point in his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>making those statements if he was going to leave the existing system as
it was in the spring of last year.</div>
					<a name="07031613000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all know about the existing
provisions for deportation; one could say that somebody was facing
deportation in those circumstances. But when the Home Secretary talked
about facing deportation he meant automatic deportation, as is clear
from the context and the words that he used. However, we will not get
far by going over that ground again. I am trying to improve what is
presented as automatic deportation.
</div>
					<a name="07031613000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the person who is
here illegally, the Minister is quite right; I was talking about the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth. The
amendments that address people who are illegally present in the country
relate to the commission of an offence. However, I would ask the
Minister to reflect on that. I listened to the example of the lady who
comes to this country in the sad circumstances of a marriage that does
not turn out to be happy and has problems of domestic violence; if she
does not have leave to remain, such a person would be liable none the
less for administrative removal.</div>
					<a name="07031613000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a person would have rights
to have that case considered, but I believe that those rights would be
on all fours with what is contained as a protection in the existing
Bill&#151;namely, the right to have the case considered against the
background of the European convention. Such a case would be covered by
the exception of the person&#146;s rights under that convention. As I
have already pointed out, if the sentence that the person received
happened to be more than 12 months, quite likely in those
circumstances, that person would face automatic deportation in any
case. I would invite the Minister to think about
that.</div>
					<a name="07031613000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the
Minister also think carefully about the position of repeat offenders?
He has been trying to find examples which might give a little wriggle
room on these questions. His point was about repeat offences which were
a long time apart, of somebody who commits an offence as a young man
and then later commits another offence.</div>
					<a name="07031613000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would respectfully remind the
Minister that this amendment is about somebody who is being sentenced
on the same occasion for a number of offences. It is not a question of
repeat court appearances; it is about someone who is sentenced on the
same occasion and the court chooses to impose consecutive sentences for
each
offence.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000628"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is being generous, but as I
understand it&#151;and I am not a lawyer&#151;it is possible that
an individual might be sentenced on the same day in the court to
consecutive sentences for offences that were committed a very long time
apart. It could just be that the offences are brought together on that
day.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031613000629"></a>Mr.
Clappison:
						</b> The Minister is right. That was the case that I
had in mind. However, at a single court appearance that person might
receive a sentence of imprisonment for one offence, which, although it
is unlikely, may have been committed some time beforehand, and then
receive a prison sentence for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>another offence, which was presumably committed more recently. Therefore
that person would receive a total of two sentences. It is still repeat
offending.</div>
					
					<a name="07031613000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot find it in myself to
feel that such a person should receive additional protections. If a
person repeatedly offends, even if the offences are a little way apart,
and on each occasion it is considered that the offence is so serious
that only a custodial sentence can be imposed, the totality of that
person&#146;s offending should bring that person within these
provisions for automatic deportation.</div>
					<a name="07031613000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s example
goes to the furthest reaches. Nine times out of 10, if not 99 times out
of 100, the offences will be much closer together in time than that.
Such a person would have the protection of the exception for their
convention rights, the right to family life and all the other
protections that arein place. I ask the Minister to think
carefully about
that.</div>
					<a name="07031613000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like the Minister to consider the problem of suspended sentences.
There, even his example could not apply because when someone receives a
suspended sentence, that person is told that it will last for a certain
length of time. It is usually two years, although the time could be
shorter&#151;I think it is a maximum of two years; it might be three.
It is certainly for a limited period. We are talking about somebody who
receives such a suspended sentence and then commits another offence
during the currency of that suspended sentence so as to produce a total
sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment; a person who repeats
offences close together, has two court appearances and refuses to heed
thewarning that has been given through the first court
appearance.</div>
					<a name="07031613000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful to the Minister for confirming that my understanding is
correct&#151;at least he has not said that it is wrong. However, it
is just that the Minister can think of some examples that might result
in hard case stories. That is my interpretation of the provisions. I
cannot see any conceivable circumstances in which a person in that
position should be treated more leniently than a person who appears in
court and for a single offence receives a prison sentence of 12 months
and faces automatic deportation. It is not just or in the public
interest to have someone in this country who commits repeated offences
and takes no notice of what the courts have said.</div>
					<a name="07031613000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the
Under-Secretary of State for the spirit with which she has replied to
the debate. I am not prepared at this point to retreat from the
substance of what I have said, but I will reflect carefully on what the
Minister has said. He has promised to think carefully about what I have
said in the debate. If he is prepared to do that he may produce
amendments that are better technically and have the same effect of
dealing with the problem of repeat offences, or perhaps deals with them
in a different way.</div>
					<a name="07031613000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a problem here of
dealing with repeat offenders. In other evidence that it has given,
Migrationwatch highlighted that problem. I think that it may have been
mentioned on Tuesday, but it has been highlighted on previous
occasions. I believe that in existing provisions, which the Home Office
has had as guidelines for dealing with deportation, recognition has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>been made of the case of repeat offenders. Therefore, we have to deal
with repeat offenders here. On the basis that the Minister is prepared
to think about and reflect on what I have said and possibly come back
with some further measures at a later stage in the Bill&#146;s
consideration, I seek leave to withdraw my
amendments.</div>
